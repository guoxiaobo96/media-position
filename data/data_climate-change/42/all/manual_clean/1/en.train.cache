Progressives fought for the exceptions of the budgeting rules to open the door for their high-priced legislation, like Medicare-for-All and the Green New Deal. Omar also praised the new rule that curbs the ability for the minority party, in this case the GOP, to bring a Motion to Recommit to the House floor with language changes to legislation that is about to be passed by the majority.
Galveston: Remains found on a tiny South Pacific island where a bloody World War II battle happened have been identified as those of a missing Marine from Galveston, a federal agency said Wednesday. In a statement, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency announced that the remains of 1st Lt. Justin G. Mills of Galveston, Texas, had been identified. The remains were found in 2015 on the island of Betio in the Tarawa Atoll of the Gilbert Islands. The remains were turned over to the DPAA laboratory for genetic identification. Mills had been missing since the November 1943 Battle for Tarawa, which left about 1,000 U.S. Marines and sailors dead and more than 2,000 more wounded from fighting that stretched over four days. The DPAA said Mills died on the battle's first day. Mills is to be buried April 29 at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.

To many, Van Drew was adopting the same logic as a first-term congressman, fearing that a vote for impeachment was unpopular in his district. He argued that the issue was doomed to die in the Republican Senate and diverted attention away from priorities voters cared about.
This is going to entail coordination at all levels, as well as resources, said Dr. Nadine Gracia, executive vice president of the nonpartisan Trust for America's Health. There is a commitment the (incoming) administration has articulated to address the needs of communities.
California's authority to set its own emissions standards tougher than the federal government's goes back to a waiver issued by Congress during passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970. The state has long pushed automakers to adopt more fuel-efficient passenger vehicles that emit less pollution. A dozen states and the District of Columbia also follow California's fuel economy standards.

Given the groundwork we already laid and the growing investment risks surrounding sustainability, we will be increasingly disposed to vote against management when companies have not made sufficient progress, the spokesperson said.
At the beginning they were afraid to come to Paris, Noyer says. Because of perceptions about a rigid labor market and an uncertain tax system. Or they were saying, 'We'll increase a little bit, but we don't want to take the risk to make the hub (in Paris).' Now that's changing.
In a story published by Time on Wednesday, the 25-year-old model claims that Marciano verbally harassed and inappropriately touched her starting when she was 18 years old.
The Elfstedentocht is the longest, most punishing outdoor speed skating race in the world. And it's been an essential part of Dutch life since 1909. Held in the northern province of Friesland, the 125-mile race links 11 cities over frozen canals and waterways. But climate change has changed all that, and now the race is under threat. Bill Whitaker reports on an alternative race in the Austrian Alps that's drawing thousands of Dutch skaters on the next edition of 60 Minutes Sunday, March 8, at 7 p.m. ET/PT on CBS.
I'd argue that our expectations for climate change were overly simplistic, Cohen said. It was kind of expected that if you warm the Arctic, the only thing that's going to lead to is just milder temperatures everywhere -- and that's not a complete picture.
It gives me no pleasure to tell you what most of you already know, and that is that President Trump lies all of the time, Sanders said, his voice rising. In his remarks tonight and in recent weeks regarding immigration and the wall, he continues to lie.
The scale of the ongoing disaster in Australia is difficult to fathom even for those on the ground. At least 12 million acres have gone up in smoke so far in Victoria and New South Wales alone, which dwarfs the amount of land that burned in California's worst fire season in 2018. It is equivalent to the burning of the entire state of West Virginia.
Climate change, Donna Laframboise reminds us, came in at 17, second from bottom of a long list including terrorism, a financially sound social security system, Medicare, and dealing with the poor and needy. It will be the same when Pew releases its annual poll this year. Every time, climate change comes either bottom or second from bottom.
So I'm not focusing on Doug Ford. I'm not focusing exclusively on just the fight. What I'm focusing on is … having Ontarians think about where they want to be over the next 10, 15, 20, 30, 50 years. And reimagining Ontario by asking big, bold questions.
The president's executive action to legalize illegals by nullifying existing law, constitutes a stunning abuse of office: usurping the power of Congress, while abdicating his duty to uphold and enforce the laws. Here are three ways this is happening:
In a statement, Amazon Watch pointed to widespread local media reports that just last week, farmers had organized a coordinated fire day to burn land for agriculture, inspired by Bolsonaro's rhetoric.

Past estimates have pegged the headcount at 1 million or 2 million people. But a British crowd-science professor posited that the actual crowd size is probably more like that of a typical New York Giants game – somewhere short of 100,000 people.
Phoenix: The National Weather Service said there were seven confirmed tornadoes in Maricopa and Pinal counties last year, the most in nearly five decades. Meteorologists said last year's total is second only to the 10 confirmed tornadoes that hit the Phoenix metro area in 1972. They said all of the 2019 tornadoes were considered weak, ranking as either F0 or F1 in intensity. But in June 1972, an F2 tornado damaged about 200 homes in Paradise Valley and caused extensive damage to canals and power lines in Scottsdale and east Phoenix. The National Weather Service in Phoenix has data on tornadoes going back to 1950. Meteorologists said there were five confirmed tornadoes in the metro Phoenix area in both 1992 and 1993 with four tornadoes in 1971. Tornadoes are considered a rare event because the Phoenix area generally doesn't get the wind shear and unstable air mass needed to whip up the twisters.

Amid the recent dust-up between Sanders and Warren about whether a woman can win, 54% of Iowa Democrats say it would be harder to beat Mr. Trump in November if the nominee is a woman. It is Biden supporters who are the most likely of the top-tier candidates' backers to say it would be harder. And Democratic women are more likely than men to think it would be harder for a woman to defeat Trump.

There was no collusion with Russia. There was not a shred of evidence. There was nothing he did wrong to be impeached — zip, zero, nada — and yet look at what they made of it. The news became what they wanted to be true, and because they wanted it to be true, they reported it as true. They're doing the same thing with the coronavirus. Just be patient. Just, you know, be in control. If it evolves and becomes something very bad, I am confident the United States will be prepared for it because we have competent people in these agencies now.
Much of the concern about taking action to limit global warming has been framed around how much it will cost to transition from fossil fuels, Diffenbaugh added. Indeed, It will cost too much is a familiar refrain among those who oppose action to combat climate change, to which the climate-concerned always counter: We can't afford not to. That's because as the planet gets warmer, the impacts of climate change increase exponentially.

Part of the problem is there is no easy mechanism for nations to enforce their rights, she said. The issue is that Nations are not able to litigate the full scope of Indigenous rights violations as part of a judicial review of a project. They are told that to do a full-on civil action for infringement, and those cost millions of dollars.
The headlines that sprung from the group's pushback to Richmond's selection took Prakash by surprise, she said. And looking back, the 27-year-old added, maybe I wouldn't have approved using exactly that word. But the message came across. And it penetrated. A few days later, Richmond as a guest on The Breakfast Club was asked by co-host Charlamagne tha God about his ties to the oil and gas industry. He answered in part by noting his role in drafting Virginia Rep. Donald McEachin, co-founder of the House United for Climate and Environmental Justice Task Force, into Biden-Sanders climate task force, then shrugged off the suggestion that his acceptance of fossil fuel industry money influenced his legislative work.

Thousands of people have had to evacuate their homes and are camping in these relief centers. They don't know if their homes are standing or not standing.
Moreover, many teachers are unequipped to deal with it. A survey from the National Center for Science Education and Penn State's Survey Research Center during the 2014-15 school year found that fewer than half of the teachers responding had taken a formal course on climate change. The same survey found that only two-thirds of teachers said they emphasize that human activity is the primary driver of climate change, despite the scientific consensus that humans are the cause. (Jeanne Kaidy, a high school science teacher in Rochester, N.Y., told me she gets a distressing amount of pushback from students and teachers disputing the science.)

Without the glossary, Domestic QT is hard to read. But clearly legible are the duo's aesthetic hyperactivity, neo-baroque sensibility and simultaneous attraction to and dissatisfaction with digital image-making. If free-associating collages are the equivalent of random Web-surfing, the tidiness of the compositions is offset by surrounding them with found objects, blocks of lumber and strands of beads. Transforming digital pictures into free-standing sculpture, Wickerham and Lomax reveal a yearning to escape virtual reality and live in the real world.

It would also threaten the $100 billion a year pledged to help developing countries achieve emissions cuts, as Bloomberg has reported.
Norway moves to the top of the ranking despite weaker oil prices, the report noted. It is sometimes said that Norway achieves and maintains its high happiness not because of its oil wealth, but in spite of it. By choosing to produce its oil slowly, and investing the proceeds for the future rather than spending them in the present, Norway has insulated itself from the boom and bust cycle of many other resource-rich economies.
It didn't help that the Sussexes announced their plans with little advance notice of his grandmother and his father, Prince Charles, judging from the careful statement issued in response by Buckingham Palace.

We ask that you honor your pledge to support climate liability lawsuits by selecting a Solicitor General who has demonstrated their commitment to fighting for people, not polluters, read the letter, a copy of which HuffPost obtained. That means removing David Frederick, a corporate attorney who has represented Royal Dutch Shell against climate liability lawsuits, from your consideration.
And secondly, you know they've got this false choice that they're throwing out there, either we do nothing and continue to appease the terrorists, or we have World War III with D-Day style invasions of Tehran. There is a lot of room in between. There is a lot of options. That is not on the table and nor does the President need authorization to defend our embassies, to defend our troops to strike back and to stop this escalation. He's absolutely right. We're preventing further war. We're not escalating into war. We're stopping Iran's escalation. And I think it was absolutely the right move.
We are absolutely committed to making the Academies safe, Robert Wilkie, under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness, said in a press release. It is imperative that these future officers understand how eliminating sexual harassment and assault advances our ability to protect the nation.
The new tally shattered the previous 2005 record of $215 billion, driven mostly by Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma and Rita. Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall over Houston in late August, is second only to Katrina in for record billion-dollar disasters.
Of course, simply replacing our electronic gadgets with solar-powered versions won't stave off the climate crisis. Even with the record drop in greenhouse gas emissions last year, 2020 tied for the hottest year on record. The year began with record-setting wildfires in Australia and ended with rolling blackouts in California just to keep the state's power grid from being overloaded.

But not everyone is so confident. At least one prominent economist believes that this latest civil unrest will play a role in convincing investors to put their money elsewhere. If you could invest anywhere in the world, why would you want to invest in the U.S. when there are safer environments? asked Carl Weinberg, chief economist and founder of the research group High Frequency Economics.
The legislation calls for researching at least six different types of batteries to store excess wind or solar power for times when the wind doesn't blow and the sun isn't shining. That would, in theory, offer the increased energy reliability needed to replace a network of gas-fired peaker plants on the New York waterfront. Those plants provide backup power when demand is high or there's a malfunction at power stations upstate.
It follows that divided government isn't good enough. In order for anything to be accomplished in Washington, and I mean anything, McConnell cannot remain in control.

We embrace federalism and the role of the states, but federalism does not mean that one state can dictate standards for the nation, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler told the National Automobile Dealers Association Tuesday, adding that higher fuel economy standards would hurt consumers by increasing the average sticker price of new cars and requiring automakers to produce more electric vehicles.
Why? Because gossip is always a juicy topic and royal gossip even more so. Because many people in Britain believe, rightly or wrong, that Harry and Meghan have delivered a blow to his grandmother, the 93-year-old Queen Elizabeth II, who is beloved but above all revered.

Another possible candidate with experience as governor of an economically prosperous state is former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe. His Post op-ed stresses his practicality. Democrats must maintain our credibility with a pledge of results that are honest and achievable, he writes. We can expand the Affordable Care Act and take on pharmaceutical companies' cartel pricing, pass comprehensive climate change legislation and substantially raise incomes through minimum-wage increases and tax fairness. And he deliberately contrasts his own results with a more strident progressive vision that includes guaranteed jobs and free college tuition. When the stakes are another four years of Trump degrading our country, do we really want to use the 2020 campaign as a first-time experiment on idealistic but unrealistic policies?
Donors have broadened their philanthropic scope beyond the universities, medical centers and other organizations that typically comprise the year's list of top beneficiaries, according to the Chronicle.

Together, these analyses revealed that climate change has contributed substantially to the growing cost of flooding in the U.S. Overall, the study found 36% of the cost of flooding over that time period can be attributed directly to increasing extreme precipitation events, or almost $75 billion of the estimated $199 billion total.

The qualifier is an easy out for Biden. If Sanders' single-payer, Medicare for All system passed Congress, that would mean the political winds had shifted dramatically — that at least some Republicans and moderate Democrats who opposed that plan came on board, because their constituents were also on board. That's an unlikely reality in 2021 if Biden were the new president.

Before we rush to nominate Senator Sanders in our one shot to take on this president, let us take a sober look at what is at stake for our party, for our values and for those with the most to lose, said Buttigieg, who ran third in Nevada following a win in Iowa and a second-place finish in New Hampshire.
For more than 20 years, researcher Mary Lu Arpaia has been on a mission to find an avocado tree that can withstand the Central Valley's frosty winters and hot summers. At a test field east of the Central Valley city of Visalia, Arpaia thinks she's found three varieties that can do just that.

It has no merits from the standpoint of science or transparency, and it will make it vastly harder for the agency to do its job of protecting public health and the environment, Andrew Rosenberg of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a national science advocacy group, wrote in an email after the final rule was announced. The damage will fall hardest on Black, Latinx and Indigenous communities who already bear disproportionate harms from environmental hazards in the air, water and soil.

Still, to some, a lawmaker from a top oil-producing state like Texas nodding to a Green New Deal signals a major shift in the national debate, said Robert Kopp, a climate scientist at Rutgers University who is tracking how the policy is being discussed.
He's been my friend and I really feel for the woman, she added later in the conversation. I identify with all the women in these situations. Even if it's my friend, I don't go, 'Oh, but he's a good guy.' I think, 'What would it feel like to have been her?'

The average Brazilian doesn't consider climate change to be a very important issue, especially not in relation to truly terrible problems such as poverty—or the crime rate, which is even more terrible.

Trump's remarks underscored the chasm between his denialist view of climate change and the overwhelming scientific consensus driving the rest of the developed world to action. Speaking shortly after the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg accused world leaders of not taking action, Trump rejected calls for urgent action and encouraged the world to instead embrace optimism.

As a consumer of political content, I'm sure you've already been inundated by articles and TV segments analyzing the importance of the Georgia Senate run-off elections on Tuesday. Control of the Senate means, in no uncertain terms, that President-elect Joe Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris will be able to bring their agenda to life… or not.

A new generation of left-wing Democrats, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), ran as champions of a Green New Deal, a sweeping federal policy to end fossil fuel use and guarantee high-wage clean-energy sector jobs to every American. It's a popular idea. One poll released last month pegged the number of registered voters who support a Green New Deal at 81 percent, including 57 percent of conservative Republicans.

Newsom's penchant for taking risks may have its roots in his childhood. He was not a particularly good student and was eventually diagnosed with dyslexia. Figuring out how to compensate for that learning disability was a gift, he says.
Saikiran Gaddam, an engineering student in Hyderabad, was one of 11 Akvo volunteers who spent 10 days last year in the field — in the rural Nalgonda district about 60 miles from the city — testing 240 wells, streams, ponds and water filtration plants. Armed with gloves and a small kit the size of four decks of cards, they did basic tests for five hours a day out in the hot sun. The Akvo app on their mobile phones let them log, map, and upload data on contamination and chemical run off.

Tensions between the nationalist-patriotic U.S. president and the globalist-progressive French premier came to a head when in early November Macron called for a real European army to protect the continent from threats from China, Russia, and the United States itself — a NATO ally.
The Repauno plant site includes a diverse and significant amount of hazardous waste that DuPont dumped into unlined landfills, sand tar pits, pipes and ditch basins, according to a suit against the former owner brought by state environmental officials. The land is contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, among other wastes.
The papers questioned everything from the relative role of natural mechanisms in changes to the climate system vis-à-vis increased CO2 concentrations, the allegedly unprecedented nature of modern climate phenomena such as warming, sea levels, glacier and sea ice retreat, and the efficacy and reliability of computer climate models for projecting future climate states.
It didn't take long for profound changes to start taking hold.
I don't want to see my own district under water and I know that Leader Pelosi doesn't either and I know that what we need to show her is we're here to back her up in pushing for 100% renewable energy, Ocasio-Cortez told CNN during the November sit-in at Pelosi's office. This is to show that we are here to back up bold action and that, you know she will be supported in that.
What do you say to Senator Manchin and others who are saying that?
ANTHONY SALVANTO: Good morning, Margaret. Big keys for him. First of all, overwhelming support from black voters. That was key and they make up most of the electorate in South Carolina. That was really helped by an endorsement from Representative Jim Clyburn, the most influential African-American politician in the state, more saying that was important than not. And then, finally, big support among those looking for electability that somebody they feel can go on to beat Donald Trump in November. The question now, Margaret, is can Joe Biden parlay that argument into Super Tuesday?

Democrats acknowledged the intraparty fight to come. Maine independent Sen. Angus King, who caucuses with the Democrats, told CNN that he is very reluctant to eliminate the filibuster but looks forward to changing the rules to disincentivize its abuse.
It looks like we will emerge from yesterday's election with Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate, and of course I'm pleased that we will be able to work with Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi and a Majority Leader [Chuck] Schumer, he said. But I'm also just as determined today as I was yesterday to try to work with people in both parties ― at the federal, state, and local levels ― to get big things done for our nation.

Biden has built his team by assembling trusted hands. On the climate-oriented positions is actually where we've seen the most divergence from that, I would argue -- it's the most progressive team overall in the administration, Weber said. You've got a really visionary, bold team, who's really serious and ambitious about the task at hand and are really all advocates and public servants.

This [fluoride] test on a mobile phone is of equivalent quality as an ion selector device used in the lab; the difference is this cheaper and portable, Bjelkeman-Pettersson says. The data is calibrated, interpreted and sent to the cloud with time stamps and GPS markers. The test can be extended to check chlorine, bacteria levels in the water, and, soon, arsenic — another big problem in the Indian subcontinent.

Although the Biden campaign attempted to dismiss Bondi's argument, the broader point about a culture of corruption permeating the former vice president's family seems to have taken hold with the mainstream media. Just this past week, Politico published an in-depth exposé on the financial ties between James Biden, the former vice president's brother, and a high-powered Washington, DC, lobbyist.

Bipartisan legislation tends to stand the test of time, said Tester.
Getting on board with Biden, though, was a more complicated proposition -- and sell to volunteers and supporters who overwhelmingly supported Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders during the primary. Sunrise political director Evan Weber said the Biden team made the first contact, a courtesy call in June 2019, after the campaign put out the first iteration of its climate plan. But the group was all-in for Sanders and there were no further conversations, he said, until after Super Tuesday in March.

He repeated that wording during a rally Monday night in the state, continuing to call the general election rigged. Trump also put pressure on Vice President Mike Pence during the rally.
Biden's rhetoric mostly stayed the same. He spent parts of the final few weeks of the campaign insisting that he had never supported, or even hinted, that he wanted to ban fracking. But on the ground, the campaign targeted young voters with information about its climate plan.
Because of a technicality within the family, if we are earning money separately from within the family structure, then we obviously have been asked not to use our titles in order to make money, which we would never do. But the press managed to jump on that to make it look like we had been stripped.

While perhaps failing to observe the irony of its own reporting, the Times juxtaposed the thoroughly discredited population explosion theories of the 1970s with the (equally alarmist) global warming predictions of our day.
GUY BENSON, TOWNHALL.COM: No, it could be a gut check moment coming up for the Democratic Party, right? Here is a New York billionaire with potential vulnerabilities on race and sexism, right, which sounds familiar if you're a Democrat, and Mike Bloomberg is the human embodiment of money in politics. All right, this is a party that at least pretends to abhor the influence of money in politics and here's someone who is doing the closest thing you can do to buying a nomination. That combination, is that going to sit well with the Democratic electric? Are they willing to swallow hard and go for it because they think that he's got the money and maybe the moderation relatively to beat President Trump? That's a decision they're going to have to make, but there are no shortage of ironies here.

It's really simple: This isn't a political issue. The changes we are seeing firsthand are affecting our communities, our economies, affecting ways of life that have existed for millennia, said Michael LeVine of the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy, which has worked on climate change issues in Alaska. We simply don't have a choice. It is incumbent on us as Alaskans to work together. We are past the point of fighting about who did what, who caused what, or what the political consequences might be. Our way of life depends on adapting to the changes that are happening.

His battle with Joe Biden on Social Security
The seeds of a new order are already apparent: In October, the Tony Awards belatedly announced the nominees for Broadway's truncated 2019-20 season, which ended in early March. The searing seriocomedy Slave Play, by a young Black dramatist making his Broadway debut, Jeremy O. Harris, garnered an astonishing 12 nominations — the most ever for a nonmusical.
One of Hollywood's most literate actors, Hawke is no dilettante when it comes to writing fiction. This novel , his first in almost 20 years, is about a self-destructive young actor making his Broadway debut in Henry IV as his marriage is falling apart. No doubt any similarities between the book and Hawke's own life -- he debuted on Broadway at 21 and endured a messy divorce from actress Uma Thurman -- are coincidental.
I understand that we're still fighting over climate change — although that seems somewhat absurd to me — but to fight by objectifying and having a picture that demonstrated a level of violence against this young [17]-year-old girl, who has every right to stand up and say, 'You know world, you're not doing what needs to be done,' that's misogynistic, Clinton said.
While it might seem easy to pass off the 80-strong rally as a fringe event, Rebekah's journey to the protest frontlines is a microcosm of how online misinformation has allowed fantastical conspiracies to find a bigger audience.
This has resulted in considerable loss of purchasing power for many countries and billions of consumers, and thus a reorientation of demand at the expense of durable goods, which have become inaccessible to many. Added to this are national trade imbalances - the surpluses of some countries and the deficits of others - that have also acted as a brake on trade.

Wednesday marks the 33rd day of the partial government shutdown, the longest in American history. Mr. Trump offered a deal to Democrats over the weekend extending temporary protections for the Deferred Action Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program. While the Senate will vote on the deal this week, Democrats have already expressed opposition due to the temporary nature of the extended protections, and the $5.7 billion border wall funding request.

Mecher said he got quite a few stares from fellow motorists. When he stopped, he got questions about the legality of transporting a snowmobile on top of a car. When he arrived in Bessemer, it took just nine minutes to remove the snowmobile from its lofty perch with a front end loader and a strap.
Trump's latest blather actually provides insight into his real thinking. His policy is not America First — as in America leads the world and creates conditions to our benefit. Rather it is, Russia First as long as we can pull up the drawbridge, extinguishing robust trade and legal immigration. If Ronald Reagan's response when asked how the Cold War would end was, We win, they lose, Trump's is: Putin wins. Let's bury our heads in the sand.
However, progressive leaders in the House cheered the new rules. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said the changes will allow Democrats to push for a bolder agenda.
The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created, the former president said.
A team of researchers analyzed rates of coral bleaching around the tropics over the past four decades, events that most often occur when seawater becomes too warm for coral to remain healthy. Scientists discovered that in the 1980s, severe coral bleaching events occurred only about once every 25 to 30 years. But, in the six years after 2010, the rate between bleachings plummeted, and mass events now occur about once every six years.
Sen. Joe Manchin, a conservative West Virginia Democrat, who is due to hold immense veto power as a critical swing vote in a 50-50 Senate, told The Washington Post on Friday that he disagrees with Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's insistence that the Senate prioritize $2,000 payments to low- and middle-income households. Instead, Manchin said, Getting people vaccinated should be the first order of business.
John Dickerson: So how many days a year was it planned that Moses would be used?

Unlike the firm's founder, James Simons, Mercer isn't named on the lists of the wealthiest Americans compiled by Forbes magazine and Bloomberg, and it's not clear how much money he actually has.

This is a woman who relied upon her employment, relied upon Michael Bloomberg for employment, and one would imagine her maternity benefits as she found out the good news. The comments he's made about women -- I mean, The Washington Post had to bleep out some of the actual words.
To be a socialist, said Sanders, in the sense of what the Pope is talking about, what I'm talking about, is to say that we have got to do our best and live our lives in a way that alleviates human suffering, that does not accelerate the disparities of income and wealth.
When you live in drastic weather conditions, you learn to adapt. And even though we enjoy a variety of outdoor winter activities such as skiing, snowboarding, ice fishing, and snowmobiling, many Minnesotans will limit their time outside in the winter.
DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think the decision the administration made to block the travel, which was controversial at the time, clearly, bought us time. It-- it slowed the introduction of the virus into the country. Virus was probably here at that time, but it slowed additional cases. The question is what do we do with that time? I think there's some things we did that were very smart. We got the country prepared. One of the mistakes, one of the challenges was getting the diagnostic testing in place. I think what-- what we should have done and I don't want to, you know, armchair quarterback this, we relied on the CDC. We always rely on a CDC in a public health emergency. But simultaneous to that, we should have also been reaching out and trying to get the laboratory-developed tests into the game and the manufacturers, who have diagnostic capability. We've done that. You know, a couple of weeks went by and they did that. And that is now in place. And those labs are going to be coming online. So we course corrected. I think what it teaches us, if you're looking back, what is the teachable moment? It's don't take a linear approach to these crises, take an all of the above approach. And we need to do that now in a therapeutic. We-- we can't put all our eggs in the vaccine basket. We need to be looking at antibody-based prophylaxis, treatments, vaccines, and all of the above approach.
We don't think it's just fires or just those bad storms in March … but it's a really small population that has already had a bad year last year and then it got hammered by more stressors, Pelton said. We're seeing the population really collapse in a single year. Now we're worried: Are they going to bounce back? We're not sure.
The previous Administration refused to recognize that private innovation and American natural gas have achieved more than government mandates and misguided international agreements — and that naiveté led President Obama to sign a climate deal that will impose great costs with little gain. President Trump made the right call in leaving a deal that would have put an unnecessary burden on the United States.
With her advocacy, the Army re-opened the case in 2018 to investigate an allegation that someone was ordered to destroy medical records related to the case. It was closed again in 2020, on the grounds that no credible information was found to substantiate the allegations.

ELIZABETH WARREN BARNSTORMS IOWA AMID 2020 PUSH, SAYS SHE WANTS TO 'RETURN POLITICS TO THE PEOPLE'
Unfortunately, however, it misses what would be most effective — namely, removing the corrupt power of oil companies and other wealthy interests over government. This power is exerted through the legal bribery of public officials with lobbying and other money by the rich heads of private industries. And that problem could be fixed by rewriting campaign finance law.
MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: He is not sending thousands of troops into ground combat, but he has taken on a mass murderer, a person who has not only killed over 700 Americans, but a person who has killed tens of thousands, we don't even know how many, of his own people in Iran.
The 29-year-old deflected further, saying the government would pay for social programs the same way the government would fund the Space Force — all while refusing to break down how much taxpayer money would go towards each of her policy proposals.
Trump Regulator's Rule Would Force Banks To Lend To Gun-Makers And Oil Drillers
There's this huge wave of energy and enthusiasm and excitement that somehow we are turning a corner towards a different sort of capitalism than we've had in the past.
As the new Mayor of Atlanta, the capital city that anchors the ninth-largest metro in the United States, I take air pollution, the threat of climate change, and the effort to address both very seriously.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You served in the Trump administration. What do you think the administration is doing now that is right, wrong in its handling of the virus?
Authorities have issued a ban on traffic in the area and access is restricted to residents and local workers only. There will also be a high-security presence.
JAKE SWAMP AND THE PINE: Dick Monks is a retired union carpenter who backed Sanders four years ago then voted for Hillary Clinton in the general election. Now he's with Sanders again. He looks around at a packed house on a night with lousy weather.
(CNN) — From the sinking city of Venice to the mass bleaching of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, climate change is drastically impacting some of the world's most treasured heritage sites.
The White House by Annie Linskey
Smithsonian: Tis the season … to kick millions of Christmas trees to the curb. … [I]n many places the trees are simply tossed in the landfill, where their pine needles break down, emitting greenhouse gases. Now, researchers at the University of Sheffield are offering a sustainable alternative to this sad fate. … Cynthia Kartey, a chemical engineer, found another use for pine needles. As it turns out, they are a great feedstock for creating other chemicals. … Using heat and solvents like cheap, environmentally friendly glycerol, the needles can be broken down into bio-oil and bio-char. Bio-oil can be further refined into glucose, which is used as a food sweetener, acetic acid used in making paint and adhesives, and phenol, which is used in mouthwash. The solid-bio char also has industrial uses. 'In the future, the tree that decorated your house over the festive period could be turned into paint to decorate your house once again,' Kartey says.
Additionally, says Umrbek Allakulov, Research and Development Officer at Water Integrity Network, government agencies and research centers in developing countries may not have the ability to monitor and test water quality. Under such circumstances, citizen-led water quality monitoring can offer a supporting hand to help ensure that water is safe for human consumption.
But it says something that the FBI would react to the firing of Comey this way and that somebody -- somebody who was then near the top of the FBI, leaked this to The New York Times. Shame on them.
Some poncy green pillock from Whitehall dictating how they can heat their home on the basis of some bollocks they've heard from some Remoaner gimp on the detested BBC?
The minister administering this scheme, instead of being your usual Commie deadbeat apparatchik, was so able and forceful you'd almost imagine him to be a Conservative — if it weren't for his extremely dodgy eco-socialist Weltanschauung
Sanders: You've obviously seen the latest polls, right?
A region's climate refers to the average weather conditions that prevail there, and can be studied by climatologists looking at long-term historical trends.
WALLACE: OK, and I'm not going to spend anymore of this interview on that.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: This was such a bruising fight, Mara. Over the last month, as we talked about the possibility of declaring a national emergency, you said it was kind of like a life vest. He could use it to show his base he did everything that he could, and that would satisfy them. Do you think, after all this, it still holds?
The party's failure to find that balance proved fateful in 2016, when blue-collar voters in the counties that surround Pittsburgh abandoned Democrats in droves, and Donald Trump carried the state by about 44,000 votes.
CHRIS WALLACE, HOST: I'm Chris Wallace.
SAGAL: Yeah, I have no idea - the question is - and there are photographs of this. But I don't know how the guests - what they had to do to the David to get it to dispense vodka.
Florin also claimed that there were threats of arrest from Fort Hood leaders during their initial search for their son, pertaining to being in waters belonging to the base.
WALLACE: So why was stop-and-frisk tremendous then, and it's racist now?
In an era constrained by sustainability and affordability, a big house with a backyard should be a rarity. Much of California is straining under its own success: We have too many people and too few places for them to live, offered at too-high prices, in too many areas touched-by-climate-change-related menaces, like wildfires, all too far from where people work. And the solution is so painfully obvious it feels almost reductive to point it out: Make it legal to build more housing that houses more people.
Watch: Kenney wants Ottawa to fast track Teck Frontier mine
At a time when political polarization divides Americans on so many issues, these points of agreement may seem surprising. But agreement is not enough. For an energy transition to happen, policy and incentives are needed.
Misczak said local governments often find success when they tie climate-resiliency efforts to impacts on local businesses. And he said that while the federal government can provide leadership, it's usually a series of seemingly small decisions made at the local level that can truly make a difference: Can homes be built in floodplains? How tough is the building code? Are local emergency services designed to operate in an actual emergency? Are emergency generators sitting in basements that could get flooded, or installed atop parking garages, where they'll be better protected?
A study published last week in the BMJ (formerly the British Medical Journal) looked at the 20 countries with the most confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus. Not all 20 countries differentiated by gender, but of the ones that did, the majority — including Canada — reported more confirmed cases of the virus in men than women.
In the short run, the green goal is moot because Republicans control the White House and the Senate; there are, to be sure, differing opinions on climate in Republican ranks, but there's no appetite for anything like what the greens have in mind.
Bercow, Tom Harris drily notes at Cap-X, is about as even-handed and impartial on the matter of Brexit as Jacob Rees-Mogg.
Democratic voters could agree on the main goal through a messy primary race and a quarantined general election: They would put aside differences to defeat President Trump.

INGRAHAM: Mollie, real quick, do you think Nancy Pelosi sends the articles of impeachment to the Senate, yes or no?
Number two, they don't like the precedent that's set that a future Democratic president could declare a national emergency around gun safety or climate change or health care. They also don't like the constitutional clash that the president is setting up, where he's challenging the separation of powers and Congress's power to appropriate money. And also, Congress, who has allowed its power to wither, is further emasculating itself in the mind of many lawmakers. Republican Senator Lee of Utah said recently because we don't want to make the judgment calls that made people angry, we leave it to the executive. It's almost as if Congress doesn't want to go through the difficult task of lawmaking.
You saw something similar in Kingsman: The Secret Service a few years back. Amongst the most reactionary films of our age, Kingsman featured as its villain a tech guru named Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson). This billionaire was so disgusted by humanity's excesses and so riled by the excretions of the masses that he engineered a plot to kill all of us in the most horribly violent manner possible. He invented a device that would cause man to turn against man, mother against child, sister against brother — with bare hands, we would tear each other apart. In so doing, the planet would be cleansed of humanity's foul stench. Once free of the riffraff, wealthy swells and fabulous celebrities would reclaim the planet for themselves and rebuild the world in their image. Clean. Pristine. Free of the gauche hordes who have rendered our air travel unbearable and our beaches crowded messes.

Jones, an attorney who grew up in poverty, ran and won as an unabashed progressive with the usual list of ambitious priorities, including enacting Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, and far-reaching police reforms. He nonetheless stopped short of some of the left's more controversial stances and slogans, eschewing calls to both defund the police and support the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel.
That narrow margin could also incentivize bipartisanship, though. Already, a small bipartisan group of senators, working with a similar group in the House called the Problem Solvers Caucus, played a major role in developing the second big coronavirus aid package. It also called for senators to refrain from challenging the Electoral College results when the votes were presented to Congress.
MARGARET BRENNAN: South Carolina is the first southern state. Does that indicate anything to you about your prospects in places like Virginia and-- and North Carolina? Will Joe Biden really challenge you there?

I'm really energized by Steyer, she said. He's for everyone. I really believe that race, along with climate, have to be the top priority, and he seems to be the candidate that is putting it first and foremost.

But there are a lot of people around him and certainly in the city of Washington who have been preparing for this, agitating for it, Bolton is one of many for an awfully long time and you wonder if it's possible that he might be outmaneuvered by them and that we might find ourselves moving toward war despite what the President wants.
But the private planes present unique issues for Warren and Sanders. As the leading progressive voices in a crowded Democratic primary, they often criticize rivals they deem insufficiently loyal to those values. The sudden use of private travel is an example of how ideological rigidity can sometimes collide with White House aspirations.
REP. RO KHANNA, D-CALIF.: He would be, again, violating the Constitution by disregarding Congress. And it's illegal. It's, frankly, another impeachable offense for him to continue an escalation without Congress's authorization.
In 2020, temperatures globally were an average of 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.25 degrees Celsius) higher than in pre-industrial times, Copernicus said. The last six years were the world's hottest on record.
In New Mexico, the minimum wage will increase to $10.50, up $1.50 from the current $9 wage. And in California, the rate for employers with 26 workers or more will rise from $13 to $14 an hour, the highest statewide baseline in the country. In Minnesota, the gain is just 8 cents, to a $10.08 hourly rate for large employers.

Warren's announcement can be fairly seen as the start of the 2020 Democratic primary. The question for Democratic voters is whom to nominate; the question for the press is whether we've learned anything from a 2016 campaign that made fools out of many experts. Plenty of first-look commentary on Warren is repeating the mistake that led many to suggest that Donald Trump could not win the 2016 Republican nomination, or that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) would be, at best, a token challenger for Hillary Clinton.
Trump has also alienated America's most important ally on Iraq — Britain. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is unhappy that the United States did not coordinate with him before targeting Soleimani.
China's authoritarian leadership is all too aware of the need to pivot given its aging population and has set about trying to reorient the Chinese economy to cater more to a domestic market after years of export-driven boom. In a decade's time, we may also know whether India's youth glut — more than half of its population is under 25 — has turned into either a demographic boon or a curse. The world's largest democracy is already struggling to support its vast population of young people with adequate education, health care and jobs.

Republicans made extensive use of the CRA in the early days of the Trump administration, after learning of a convenient loophole that let them review regulations and guidance that had been on the books for decades — as long as they hadn't technically been submitted to Congress yet. They nixed 16 regulations, including one that had been finalized in 2013.

Further, the Fed should stop paying financial institutions interest to keep money out of the economy and parked at the Fed. Incredibly, the excess reserves of financial institutions that are sitting in the Federal Reserve has grown from less than $2 billion in 2008 to $2.4 trillion today. That is absurd.
CHARLES LANE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, obviously, he's in a lot of trouble. And let's be candid here, a lot of people foresaw this kind of downward spiral if Biden was unable to up his game on the campaign trail and present as a more dynamic candidate. And he, so far, has not delivered.

The final miracle of Paul Ryan's unlikely speakership was the passage of a final, Hail Mary pass to push the shutdown back on the Senate. As soon as your conference becomes too divided to pass legislation you become sitting ducks.
Emphasizing the policy stakes of Sanders' bid, Brezler added, We need 'Medicare for all,' we need tuition-free college and we need to abolish [Immigration and Customs Enforcement], end mass incarceration, [enact national marijuana] legalization and all of the other reasons why we come to this movement.
Schumer added afterward: There is an obvious solution: separate the shutdown from the arguments over border security. There is bipartisan legislation – supported by Democrats and Republicans – to re-open government while allowing debate over border security to continue.
Wins by both Ossoff and Warnock would result in a 50-50 split in the Senate, effectively giving Democrats control of the chamber since Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast tiebreaking votes.

Montgomery: A recycling center that employs adults with intellectual disabilities should have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to its workers, federal labor officials said. The U.S. Department of Labor recently announced that employees were rightfully owed $540,000. Montgomery Arc and two of its partners – Hanan Center and McInnis Recycling Center – will now pay $541,597 in back wages to 80 employees, federal officials said. The deal is part of a settlement between the organizations and the federal agency, The Columbus Ledger-Enquirer reports. The organizations were supposed to provide services to the employees in exchange for paying them less than minimum wage, the newspaper reports. But the agency found that it failed to provide services required by federal guidelines.
MONIZ: Exactly. And of course we are already about 1 degree on the path to that 2 degrees. So there's no doubt we have to pick up the pace. And there are some elements of optimism here. First is that the states which have been the leaders in driving low carbon continue to do so - and in fact cities as well. Secondly, starting right after President Trump's announcement on the Paris Agreement, the reality is an enormous part of the business community came forward and said, we're staying the course. And we've seen, if anything, a pickup in that commitment in the last years. We are seeing the oil companies, the big utilities all going in this direction.
Arctic scientists like to say that what happens in the Arctic doesn't stay in the Arctic, but the interconnectivity between Earth's dynamic atmospheric systems is no laughing matter, Cohen said. The complexity of these systems is reflected in emerging disruptions that are likely the products of climate change, though there is still much to be learned about how climate change could shape weather patterns around the world, the study authors reported.

Killingly: The Killingly Board of Education voted to bring back a controversial Native American-themed athletic mascot. The board decided to reinstate the Redmen mascot at a meeting Wednesday, the Norwich Bulletin reported. In October, the same board approved the new Red Hawks mascot after it was overwhelmingly approved by students at Killingly High School. Several students, faculty members and local tribal representatives have criticized the original mascot as inappropriate, racist and stereotypical. It featured the profile of a Native American man wearing a headdress. Newly elected Republican members of the education board made a campaign promise to reverse the change. The board, with a Republican majority, held a public meeting on Dec. 11 where it voted to remove the Red Hawks mascot but tied on whether to return to the original mascot. More than a dozen people, including students and Native American representatives, spoke out against the decision to keep original mascot at the meeting. They also sought some other compromise, the Bulletin reported. At the Wednesday meeting, the board also voted to appoint a subcommittee that would update the high school logo so it doesn't portray Native Americans in a negative stereotype.

As the highest-ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, Smith has called out Democrats' removal of a budgetary restraint on government spending, known as the pay-as-you-go provision, or PAYGO. This would enable Democrats to spend further on climate change proposals such as the Green New Deal.
If President Obama can refuse to enforce a valid federal law affecting millions of people, are there any limits to his powers? After all, he has frequently threatened, Where Congress won't act, I will. What is to stop him from rewriting other laws with which he disagrees? Or to act where Congress has declined or refused to act? Can he abolish certain tax laws because Congress chooses to keep them? Can he banish all sources of energy except renewables to advance his agenda on climate change? If so, why even have a legislative branch of government? What's the point of a Constitution which enumerates and circumscribes powers and duties?
It is, of course, important that some equitable plan for resource development be put in place. That is, a plan that rewards risk-taking and entrepreneurship but also assures workers and citizens a piece of the action. We might note that one of the signal successes of the previous left-wing regime was its program of family allowances, aimed at the poor and working poor. Such conscious spreading of the wealth is, of course, good politics, and yet it's also good policy because every citizen deserves a fair shake and because it's important to preserve social peace.

The group calculated that 24.6 million pounds of antibiotics were fed to chickens, pigs and other farmed animals, counting only nontherapeutic uses. And that was in 2001. In other words, for every dose of antibiotics taken by a sick human, eight doses are given to a healthy animal.

In the study, researchers drilled 13 permafrost soil cores from various sites in Alaska between 2004 and 2012. Then, they measured the total amounts of mercury and carbon in each sample, which proved consistent with thousands of other soil cores taken from other sites around the world, the paper said. Using the mercury contents of their 13 cores as a springboard, the researchers estimated the total amount of mercury sealed away below North American permafrost to be roughly 793 gigagrams — or more than 15 million gallons.

Every day, he takes another swipe at the pillars of our democracy, but we cannot allow him to irrevocably change this country, the Meet the Fockers star adds. The 'beacon of hope' that is America could be extinguished if he's given another four years.
While the idea gained some currency in Europe and also in the Green Party, it wasn't until after the 2016 election that it really gained broad popularity on the left in the U.S. (Vox's Dave Roberts has a more thorough history here).
Rising Democratic star Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said in a new interview that she could fund her proposed Green New Deal in part by slapping a tax as high as 70 percent on top earners.
As a result, much of Brazil's land became off-limits to development. Today, indigenous tribes account for .4 percent of Brazil's population, and yet they inhabit 13 percent of the land. To put that another way, natives are about 32 times more land rich than the average Brazilian. Admittedly, there are often violations of these pro-native restrictions, as illegal poachers and loggers seek quick profits in no-go zones. And yet because these violations are illegal, they are episodic, not offering the potential economic benefits of permanent settlements and systematic development—that is, of the kind that could offer good jobs at good wages to all Brazilians.
Gates has been lobbying publicly for years about the need for drastic action on climate change, and now he's collected his ideas into a book . The billionaire philanthropist gathers advice from experts while laying out his vision for technological innovations that could reduce greenhouse gases and stop the warming of the planet. If even some of his plans work, this might be the most important book of the year.
It's not just those candidates tethered to Washington by the impeachment trial who often opt to fly private. Former Vice President Joe Biden spent at least $1.2 million on charter jets through September, while Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, had spent at least $750,000.
East Machias: Atlantic salmon laid a record number of eggs in the East Machias River last year, according to a conservation group that tracks the species' status in the wild. The fish are considered endangered in the U.S. by the federal government, and they only appear in a handful of Maine rivers. The Downeast Salmon Federation said the high number of eggs shows that efforts to bring them back in Maine's river systems are working. Biologists counted 61 of the nests the fish build for spawning in the East Machias River. The Downeast Salmon Federation's executive director, Dwayne Shaw, said that's six times the number counted in the river since the federation started tracking the fish's egg nesting patterns two decades ago. The federation counted only 10 of the nests in 2018, the Bangor Daily News reports. That was about an average number. The nests carry about 4,000 eggs each.
The figures stand in marked contrast to the final years of Barack Obama's presidency, when a median of 64% expressed confidence in Trump's predecessor to direct America's role in the world in a positive manner.

Durand Jones & the Indications, we're starting our next album, this weekend and we definitely have a couple of moments on there that were born from what we all shared and went through together this year. I think that this year will affect things to come for a while, as so many past past moments of political chaos and other kinds of chaos have been reflected in folklife, whatever form you define it. I think a lot about Gil Scott-Heron's H2Ogate Blues and how much it maps onto today.
Led by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the National Audubon Society, along with Bird Studies Canada and other international partners, bird count participants are asked to go outside for at least 15 minutes and identify as many birds as they can.
There has been a clear top tier of Democratic hopefuls in Iowa since the early fall: former Vice President Joe Biden, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. Two of those candidates, Sanders and Warren, have been stuck in Washington for the impeachment trial the past two weeks, while Biden and Buttigieg have been able to camp out in the state. Senator Amy Klobuchar, who has also been in Washington for impeachment, has been working to break into that top tier for several months.
This study envisions spending about $1 trillion per year on direct air capture alone. That amounts to roughly 5% of the United States' annual gross domestic product, a percentage the researchers gleaned from the average budget the country has spent fighting every major conflict since the Civil War. Then Hanna and his team looked at the maximum rate at which various technologies have been developed and deployed in times of crisis, including U.S. warships in the 1940s and French nuclear power plants in the aftermath of World War II, and arrived at 20% as a usable average.

The 19th Amendment did not grant all women equal access to the voting booths immediately, said Zamora, the site's publisher, citing the 40 years it took for the civil rights movement to grant women of color the same voting rights as white women. The 19th provides a great opportunity to talk about all of those tensions and all the work that is still to be done in terms of equity whether it is at the ballot box or beyond.
GROSS: Right. Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill fled the Nazis, so they - they really know - they know the story. They know the climate in which Cabaret is set. So I want to play a song that you wrote for her character that she does such a wonderful job with in the original cast recording and that Linda Emond did such a great job with in the revival. And the song is, What Would You Do? And this character that she plays is a tough but lonely older women who runs a boarding house. There's a Jewish man who wants to marry her. But when it's clear the Nazi's are coming to power, she rejects him to save herself. And she sings this song, What Would You Do? as if to ask, if you were in her position, would you stand up for your principles or save yourself? Let's hear a little bit of the song.
Combined, the hurricane data from historical accounts, as well as tree ring data from actual Caribbean shipwrecks, revealed the same trend: a 75 percent drop in the number of hurricanes between 1707 and 1825. This was a period when few sunspots occurred, known as the Maunder Minimum. Without these sunspots, Earth received fewer rays of sunlight, leading to a cooler Northern Hemisphere, the researchers reported March 7 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Like any White House budget, Trump's blueprint is more of a political document than an accurate predictor of government spending. Congress controls the purse strings and lawmakers may have very different priorities. As a statement of presidential intention, though, the blueprint is crystal clear.
GONYEA: After the rally, the cleanup crew stacks the folding chairs. Music still pipes through the sound system.

They know that there's something big that has to happen, but nothing has been able to be agreed to.

Now in the 2009 [flu] pandemic the only occasions we documented outbreaks in the summertime were in places where there was close contact, such as military ships and dorms. So contact is obviously a very important issue, but there may be this overlying effect of the environment, like the climate of a place, that acts as an upper boundary as to how much virus activity there can be.

Cohen explains that any given time the wave pattern is naturally elongated over Eurasia as compared to the rest of the globe. In a typical pattern this would have no impact on the stratosphere.

Trump's rally will cap a frantic and financially costly final weekend of campaigning for both parties. President-elect Joe Biden is set to campaign in Atlanta hours before Trump, while Vice President-elect Kamala Harris traveled to Georgia on Sunday afternoon. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz campaigned for Republicans in Atlanta's suburbs, and the cast of HBO's The Wire did the same for Democrats. Republicans continue to hold an advantage in a television and digital advertising war that has topped $100 million, while Democrats have continued to fund far larger field operations than the party ran during the general election.
It's a remarkably successful example of what political scientists call a political epistemic community — an interconnected network of experts with policy-relevant knowledge who share certain beliefs and work to actively transmit and translate those beliefs into policy, as Amanda Hollis-Brusky argued in her 2015 book, Ideas With Consequences: The Federalist Society and the Conservative Counterrevolution. Hollis-Brusky documented the impact of such a community: Focusing on key recent Supreme Court decisions on hot-button issues such as campaign finance, gun control and state sovereignty, she found that as many as two dozen people with Federalist Society connections played some role in crafting the arguments, arguing the cases, clerking for the judges or issuing the rulings.

What don't we know? Well, for the first time since 2004, Democrats have a wide-open primary field with no establishment favorite, and not much of an establishment to decide on one. The 2008 and 2016 primaries eventually settled into battles between Clinton, representing the old party leadership, and a candidate who could define himself as a change agent. Some Democrats see Joe Biden potentially filling that establishment role, but none see him consolidating party support the way Clinton did.
Both she and Weber are in consistent contact with Biden transition officials. They have met with the EPA agency review team, among others.

GROWING NUMBER OF 2020 DEMOCRATS SUPPORTING 'GREEN NEW DEAL'
Under the Green New Deal, Congress must develop a plan for the transition of the United States economy to become carbon neutral by 2030. And to accomplish that, the U.S. will need to make big investments today to jump-start and develop new projects and sectors to power the new economy, which are estimated to be in the tens of trillions of dollars. Some of these activists are hoping to get that money by diverting the trillions of dollars needed to build and upgrade our current energy and transportation infrastructures to entirely rebuild the U.S. economy to suit their Utopian and unrealistic world view. With hundreds of state and local officials and likely 2020 presidential candidates signing on to support the Green New Deal, this campaign isn't going anywhere. And neither is its supporters' strong aversion to the oil and natural gas that has made the US a leader in affordable energy, environmental progress, and economic advancements.
Atlanta: Leaders of the African Methodist Episcopal Church forgave $4 million in debt owed by a college it founded in Atlanta. The financial boost for Morris Brown College was announced Tuesday night, news outlets reported. In exchange, the college agreed to establish a $1.5 million scholarship for AME church members. Morris Brown College lost its accreditation in 2002. Interim president Kevin James launched an effort last year to become accredited again. An official told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the debt forgiveness will help. The Georgia Conference of the African Methodist Episcopal Church founded Morris Brown College in 1881, the newspaper reported. The college has about 40 students enrolled, according to news outlets.

In this essence, he did. And what we've got also to think about now is Iraq is being run by Iran. This is what we have to understand.

One reason is that Congress is limited to one budget reconciliation bill per fiscal year, restricting how much legislation it can pass with a simple majority and heightening competition for what takes precedence. Because Congress has not yet used a budget reconciliation bill in Fiscal Year 2021, which began in October, it can pass one such bill for FY2021 and another such bill for FY2022.

'Climate change is not the only man-made reason'
ANTHONY SALVANTO (CBS News Elections and Surveys Director/@SalvantoCBS): Well, that remains a key difference between these candidates which is that Bernie Sanders' supporters are the most enthusiastic of all the top candidates. That's why his numbers remain so stable. Those folks turn out for him. But Joe Biden still has a challenge in that regard. His supporters are less enthusiastic about him. Can he motivate them to turn out? I think it remains a key question. And, look, to that point, when you look at California, Texas, at these big delegate hauls, the Democrats give out delegates just to top finishers. And so they could very conceivably end up splitting the delegates along with some of these other candidates and then we move on into the spring.
SENATOR DICK DURBIN: Well, of course, there was agreement to continue the conversation. But what we've said is open the government and let's have a fulsome debate and deliberation. This gun in our head approach with closing down the government is the thing we most opposed, and-- and we wish incidentally that the Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, would step up and be part of this conversation. He's used to-- he's going to stand on the sidelines and wait for instructions from the President. He is part of a branch of government and a leader in the Senate, he should be a participant in this conversation from the start. As of last night, three Republican senators have said they don't like this approach of shutting down the government and they're talking about joining in a bipartisan effort to end it.

The rule goes into effect on Wednesday and applies to all future EPA regulations. It puts a premium on scientific studies that are based on underlying data that is available to other scientists or to the public. Studies that do not meet that standard, which could include major epidemiological studies, will be given less weight by regulators unless the head of the EPA personally intervenes. The rule also requires that the agency disclose which studies it uses to set future pollution limits.

Nor was there much promise that the partisan warfare that has seized the capital in recent years would soon subside with the new session. After they are sworn in, a growing cohort of Republican senators and House members plan to initiate a long-shot attempt on Wednesday to try to overturn Mr. Biden's victory and deliver a second term to Mr. Trump. The attempt will fail, but only after it cleaves the Republican Party in two and further erodes confidence in Mr. Biden's legitimacy among the president's most ardent supporters.

Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., has been one of the most aggressive, warning in a speech Saturday night that Sanders as the party standard-bearer could be disastrous for other Democrats on the November ballot.
The party quickly made a crucial decision. Rather than pursue swing voters, they would focus on turning out the Democratic base, especially Black voters. The choice wasn't obvious. There were roughly 100,000 voters, mostly in the Atlanta suburbs, who cast ballots for Biden and Purdue in November. But knowing Republicans had roughly 300,000 more high-propensity voters in the state than Democrats, the campaigns wagered their best bet was to fire up Black turnout.
No one is arguing against increasing productive capacity to go alongside increasing public investment. This is literally what we did to mobilize for World War 2, and @AOC has referenced that multiple times when talking about the economics of a Green New Deal.
INGRAHAM: I just still can't believe; he was in the airport.
Are you worried about Republican turnout because of the current ongoing
Ford's government did introduce a climate plan in 2018, but Ontario's auditor general says it'll likely fail to meet its targets. Environment Minister Jeff Yurek has since called the plan a draft.
He recognizes he has an uphill battle selling this to Congress. But he says, You can't solve big challenges without ambitious solutions. That's what this seeks to do.
Other reports suggest that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been pushing to hit Soleimani for months and took advantage of Trump's moment of risk-readiness to argue for the more extreme option.
The main trade group for payday lenders, INFiN, said in a statement that it supports steps by the OCC to protect legal businesses from discrimination under the proposed fair access rule.
ROVE: No. And we have a disconnect between I -- what I thought was an excellent speech by Pompeo. He opens up by saying, America is a force for good in the Middle East. Repudiates the Obama era doctrines. But there is a disconnect between that and pulling us out of Syria.
I think he's got a long way to go. But, then there's this next generation of leaders, And, I think if people take a moment and listen to Julian Castro, what he's done in the past, but more importantly what his vision is for the future, I think he will catch fire, said Archer.
PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, it's very important for us to do well, and we're on the ground working to earn those good results here in Nevada and we'll be campaigning hard for every vote in South Carolina as well.
Co-author and University of Illinois entomologist May Berenbaum, a National Medal of Science winner, said, Insect decline is kind of comparable to climate change 30 years ago because the methods to assess the extent, the rate (of loss) were difficult.
You should also make sure someone knows where you are heading in case you get lost or need any help.
The petrochemical plant has become a political crucible. President Trump visited the Shell site in August, speaking for more than an hour while surrounded by construction workers and touting the complex as one of the single biggest construction projects in the nation . . . made possible by clean, affordable, all-American natural gas.
That is not to say the sticker should ever have been distributed.
(Editor's note: Odds as of Jan. 23)
Together with officials from the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing border patrol agents and staff, Trump insisted that we need protection in our country.
In New York, people are far less aware of the risk and less prepared — and that's a problem, Grimm said. The day before he said that, New York had a tornado watch. Days later, the National Weather Service tweeted that in 2020 several cities, mostly along the East Coast, had more tornadoes than Wichita, Kansas.
A private jet will reportedly fly Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to and from campaign events in Iowa to avoid commercial airline delays.
As climate change continues unabated, parents, teachers and medical professionals across the country find themselves face-to-face with a quandary: How do you raise a generation to look toward the future with hope when all around them swirls a message of apparent hopelessness? How do you prepare today's children for a world defined by environmental trauma without inflicting more trauma yourself? And where do you find the line between responsible education and undue alarmism?
Historically, the Black American woman, the enslaved African woman, actually felt the need to give stern boundaries to their children, says Mullan. The fear was if I, as a parent, don't stop you from acting a certain way, master, officer, or whatever authority figure is going to kill you, hang you, or keep you in line.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) rushed to minimize the political damage — as well as the potential loss of funds — with a statement assuring the public that The President and his administration understand the severity of the devastation and have delivered for Californians.  He added: Republicans will offer an amendment to the Democrat's [sic] spending bills that will be voted on the floor this week to increase money for forest management that will help prevent and reduce the devastation from wildfires that we saw a couple months ago.
Rep. Jason Smith (R-MO), the House Budget Committee ranking member, offered a motion to commit on the Democrats' rules package for the 117th Congress. The motion to commit would strike the Democrats' provision that creates an exemption for climate-related legislation for the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) restriction on spending. PAYGO mandates that new spending is either offset by a payfor such as tax increases or spending cuts. Democrats blocked the motion.
The music of Aaron Frazer feels a bit like stepping into a time machine: It's got touches of Curtis Mayfield and Carole King, but it's also very much of this moment. The Baltimore native, who's best known for playing drums and singing in the band Durand Jones & the Indications, says he was in the middle of making dinner one day when he got a call from Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys, asking if they could make a record together. That solo album, Introducing..., was released Friday, and Frazer joined NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro to talk about it. Hear the radio version at the audio link, and read on for an edited transcript.
The situation is becoming more and more grim for the polar bear.
Clipping the wings of PAYGO doesn't just pave the way for big-ticket progressive agenda items, but will also be a boon to progressive legislators. Functionally speaking, PAYGO meant that any legislation that spent money needed a payfor — some additional piece of legislation that has been analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office and deemed to save X amount of money, equal to or greater than the new spending.
But I've been looking around, and -- and Karl is exactly right on who it exposes, but in addition to that, there could be a Turk massacre of the Kurds who fought side-by-side with us, not only in Syria but in Iraq and Israel is totally vulnerable because of this on its northern border.

Canada is deeply disappointed at the U.S. position, the country's environment minister, Catherine McKenna, told reporters Thursday. The Paris agreement is a good deal for Canada, and it's a good deal for the world. No one country can stop action on climate change.
INSKEEP: You can find the Green New Deal resolution on our website today. NPR is the first to publish this call to transform the economy. It's a resolution calling for massive increases in renewable energy production, like wind and solar. It would have the United States set a goal to become carbon neutral in 10 years, which is a very ambitious timeline. This resolution says what should be done but offers few specifics on how to do it. That would have to come in later legislation. Instead, the congresswoman aims to promote big goals.
Worldwide, women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence, less access to economic and educational opportunities, and exclusion from decision-making roles at the community and governmental levels.
The abrupt resignation, which is effective Feb. 1, could prompt a clash between the Trump administration and other governments over the future of the international body. The United States traditionally selects the president of the World Bank, which is made up of more than 100 countries, but Mr. Trump has taken a skeptical view about the importance of multilateral institutions. The World Bank's priorities — like combating climate change and engaging in foreign aid — also tend to be at odds with those of the Trump administration. Last month, the bank announced it would invest $200 billion toward fighting climate change over a five-year period.
And the only thing she's missing right now are oral arguments. She's participating by phone in the decision about what cases to take. And hopefully she will fully recover soon. Her doctors say she's on course and she's cancer free.
He said Soleimani has blood on his hands and was a bad actor in the region, but he questioned whether the Trump administration had a plan.
But Sunrise's young leaders say that, after two years of pitched battles across the country, they are prepared for the fights to come.
Eco-anxiety or climate depression is playing out in real terms among young people, sometimes in extreme ways: A 2008 study in an Australian medical journal chronicled the case of a 17-year-old boy who was hospitalized after refusing to drink water during a nationwide drought, in what the authors called the first case of climate change delusion. A psychiatrist I interviewed told me a patient had confessed that she secretly wished a pandemic would strike to ease stress on the planet.
And when you have infrastructure -- infrastructure that is rated about the worst in the nation, our highways and bridges, and it's hard to get to these places. The freeways are packed. We haven't built a major reservoir since New Melones Dam in 1983. So it's a kind of a perfect storm.
INGRAHAM: Literally. I was rah rah war in Iraq, because I love our troops. I support our troops. Those enlisted guys remember Trump met with the enlisted soldiers couple of weeks ago. They kept saying, Iran, the story is Iran. Don't drop Iran. That's the story. Remember, General Casey, he didn't really want to get into the Iran situation with me in an interview. I like him a lot, but he didn't want to touch that. I'm telling you; this Iran thing has been brewing for so long, it's been happening for deadly consequences.

The treaty is set to be signed in the German city of Aachan, which lies on the multi-nation border with Belgium and the Netherlands, on January 22nd, and the agreement will be ratified at both the French and German parliaments.
Pelosi wields tremendous power over Trump. As speaker, she has say over investigations and subpoenas and would ultimately be the one to bring impeachment charges to the floor if it came to that. She even said Thursday the president's not immune from indictment. Maybe Trump is playing nice because he knows that.
ALBANY, N.Y. – On Wednesday morning, Sen. Chuck Schumer declared Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock as the winners of the Georgia runoff after both candidates claimed victory in the Senate races. Media outlets also named Warnock the victor, while most outlets deemed Ossoff's race too close to call.
After November's general election, Georgia became the center of the U.S. political universe and the scene of a bitter battle within the GOP over the results of the 2020 presidential election, with President Trump falsely claiming that the state was stolen from him. The state's result is likely to be challenged Wednesday as Congress counts the Electoral College vote. That challenge is expected to fail.
We need to be asking ourselves hard questions as a state as to whether a settlement in bankruptcy might be better than something we get through this gas sale, warns Wara, the Stanford researcher.
Frustrated by what they see as the Trump administration's decision to de-emphasize the danger posed by climate change, local government officials, nonprofit leaders and university researchers are busily forging ahead with limited resources in a piecemeal approach they say is better than nothing. They're hardening buildings, digging bigger storm drains and changing zoning laws to keep homes from being built in low-lying areas prone to flooding.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: This was a real will he or won't he kind of thing on the part of the president. Do you think he was going to do this all along?

In New Hampshire, the so-called moderate candidates won more than 50 percent of the vote of voters in that state, but -- which was double what Bernie Sanders got, but he won in New Hampshire because he had that left lane, the more liberal lane, all to himself while the so-called more moderate lane was kind of clogged up by you and -- and Biden and Klobuchar, all of whom split up the votes.
Almost 40% of the House Democrats were female. The gutsy candidates largely supported each other, but further advancing them were party leadership, funders and a legion of like-minded groups. The surge in the Democratic victories of well-funded female candidates was a wake-up call for Republicans that they had to diversify or die. What Dems did in that election cycle became a playbook for the GOP. Existing Republican political action groups, like Value in Electing Women (VIEW) and Winning for Women gained traction as never before.
Inscrutable as ever, McConnell holds cards close - McClatchy: Mitch McConnell, uncharacteristically absent from deliberations as the shutdown approached the three-week mark, suddenly emerged as a player Thursday. But only for a few hours… McConnell had hosted a group of GOP senators in his office Thursday morning to discuss a compromise to break the impasse, but the White House quickly rejected the proposal. … McConnell … [spoke] on the phone with Trump, who agreed to legislation guaranteeing furloughed government employees would be compensated 'to ease their anxiety' as the shutdown continues. The partial shutdown is due to reach its 21st day Friday, tying the record set in 1996. What's not known is whether McConnell will gather members into his office again to discuss strategies or do as he's done the past three weeks, which is eviscerate Democrats on the Senate floor for refusing to give Trump $5.7 billion for his border wall and otherwise wait for Democrats and Trump to broker a deal.

As Breitbart News has noted, the Green New Deal is in fact an old idea, first championed by President Barack Obama's green jobs czar, Van Jones. It seeks to implement classic socialist policies of state-run enterprises, using the pretext of an environmental crisis.
James Shaw, New Zealand's climate change minister, said the only reason 2016's Winston -- the strongest cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere -- wasn't a Category 6 was because there is no such category. But we might need one in the future, Shaw said at the conference in New Zealand, The Guardian reported.
The progressive agenda seemed more likely to succeed Monday after the House approved rules that would purportedly exempt policies like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal from a fiscal responsibility measure aimed at offsetting deficit increases with additional revenue.
It's an idea that has been gaining popularity for more than two decades: Instead of giving poor people goods and services — say, a cow or job training — why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it?
I finished the first class asking students what they expect from a teacher. The answers were great: be passionate about the subject matter; be available to students after class; be clear about expectations; have a sense of humor. I reminded them that I was once a student, too, and I swore then that if I ever became a teacher, I'd never repeat the things I hated in my teachers. At least, I try not to. But then I reminded them that the onus is not all mine. That to learn you must engage with the subject matter, that learning is an active state, not a passive one. Finally, I reminded them that not even the best teacher in the world can teach someone who doesn't want to learn.
Take, for example, your cellphone. Most of us hold onto them for only two years, but as we noted in November, producing a common smartphone released the equivalent of 178 pounds of carbon dioxide, about as much running a modern refrigerator for a year. That is one of the biggest reasons that the global carbon footprint of smartphones is projected to increase by 730 percent this decade.
It is a breath of fresh air to see leaders in Congress discussing climate solutions that rise to the scale of the challenge, said Aliya Haq, federal policy director for the Climate & Clean Energy Program at the Natural Resources Defense Council in a statement.
For decades, policymakers have debated whether to build new reservoirs. One project, the Auburn Dam, was authorized by Congress in 1965 for flood control, but later abandoned over structural and environmental concerns. Numerous other proposals have been studied for decades, with little progress at the state or federal level — though local authorities have built their own projects, such as the Los Vaqueros Reservoir in the East San Francisco Bay, one of the few projects environmentalists have not opposed (though many have since opposed its expansion.)

Biden, who has publicly used the phrase Black lives matter, released a plan that includes an array of policies to address systemic racism, which includes investing in Black-owned small businesses, creating a new tax credit to help Black Americans buy homes, and investing in historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs).
It will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive, Pelosi told Politico. The green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they're for it right?
That said, it's interesting to see how students that have a background in the sciences — and those who don't — look at the course. This is something that speaks to our educational system at large.
His comment comes ahead of what is likely be a contentious joint session of Congress where lawmakers will vote to certify the results of the presidential election. In a final test of loyalty to President Trump, several Republicans have promised to vote against the Electoral College's certification of President-elect Joe Biden's win.
Julian Castro has made history by becoming one of the biggest lightweights to ever run for president, Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Ahrens said in a statement. He was a weak mayor who couldn't even handle being HUD secretary. This is obviously just another desperate attempt to become someone else's running mate.

And I show up to this house on the island. Susie's staying at a friend's place. The house is in disarray. Her daughter's there. Her friend's there. There's a lot of things going on, kind of a manic energy. And there's this smell of hay and animals. And I go in and have a look in the living room, and there are all these joeys, baby kangaroos.

He is buying three minutes of advertising on NBC and CBS to talk about the coronavirus. And trying to cast himself as somebody who is a competent manager, who could probably help solve this problem, and would have tackled it sooner than the President. He can spend as much as he wants. But if he doesn't hit fifteen percent in these states on Tuesday, it will have been for naught, essentially. Certainly, they believe that they can go on into Florida and Arizona and Illinois next and-- and try to compete in later March contests. But, perhaps, the biggest loser last night in South Carolina was Mike Bloomberg because Joe Biden did so well. They needed Biden to stumble or to only win narrowly to help make the argument that he is the better moderate alternative.

The polar vortex is a huge low-pressure gyre of cold winds spinning counter-clockwise, which rotate quickly around the Arctic Circle from west to east. But when an SSW occurs, if it is a strong enough event, winds will often reverse and become easterly, and the polar vortex will split into two or three separate vortices, which then drift southward towards the mid-latitudes carrying cold air along with them.

In addition to the Green New Deal, candidates must stress that their opponents' inaction on environmental issues hurts American workers and their communities. Florida's former Gov. Rick Scott won a Senate seat this fall even though his gutting of Florida's water management budget by hundreds of millions of dollars likely created the conditions for the unprecedented red tide event that cost Florida's tourism economy over $90 million in one summer. His opponent, then-Sen. Bill Nelson, hardly mentioned that Scott's recklessness and complete disregard for Florida's environment and waterways was a direct blow to small businesses, fisherman and millions of Floridians whose livelihoods depend on the health of the ocean. Meanwhile, evidence shows that 30-year Congressman Dana Rohrabacher's notorious denial of climate issues potentially cost him his seat in California's 48th Congressional District this fall after he routinely ignored the issues plaguing his constituents ― including rampant flooding in Orange County's Balboa Island that has resulted from sea-level rise.

Baltimore: A 24-year-old chimpanzee at the Maryland Zoo has given birth to a girl. The zoo welcomed the 2-pound new addition on Dec. 29, officials announced in a statement on Wednesday. The first-time mother, Raven, and the newborn chimp have spent their first week together bonding in a quiet off-exhibit area, according to the statement. The baby chimp will go on display for the public following the short period of bonding. Raven was the second chimpanzee to give birth at the zoo outside of Baltimore in 2019. Bunny, gave birth to Lola in July. There are now 14 chimps in its care, and officials said the births have been important as reproduction of the species at zoos nationwide has slowed in recent years. Officials haven't decided on a name, a spokeswoman for the Maryland Zoo told The Washington Post. Sometimes the animal's care team chooses a name and other times there's a contest that involves the public, she added.

In the biblical apocalypse there are false prophets claiming the voice of God. Similarly, today there are those who claim the same while simultaneously trying to put the lid back on what others have revealed to be the truth — that is, that Christ favored the poor and the marginalized over the mighty. Yet this message has been buried by some of our most prominent Christian leaders who seemingly have been seduced by the trappings of power, privilege, and prestige.
NOAA said the 16 billion-dollar disasters included eight severe storms, three tropical cyclones, two flooding events, one wildfire event, one drought and one freeze event. These events resulted in the deaths of 362 people and had significant economic effects on the areas they affected, the NOAA said.
Supported by both Northern Democrats and Northern Whigs, the Wilmot Proviso passed the Northern-dominated House but died in the Senate, where Southerners enjoyed equal representation. Despite its failure, the proposal nevertheless reopened the politics of slavery and was the first step in events that led the United States down the path toward Southern secession, the Civil War, the emancipation of enslaved people and the Reconstruction Amendments that ended slavery, and secured civil and political rights for freedmen. In the end, a better United States emerged, but not until Americans endured the bloodiest conflict in their history.

While most visitors just marvel at Ötzi's sunken figure, Peschel focuses on that ice layer. Despite carefully climate-controlled conditions, Ötzi has trouble keeping his cool. The glass plate is connected to a scale, which shows that Ötzi loses about 2 grams of water weight each day. Peschel says the right hand, which is the body part closest to the visitor window, sheds ice most rapidly. On a recent visit, he points out that the pinkie has no ice at all.

The madness of Trump, as bad as it was, it really needed to happen. We really needed a reflection of our world's greatest problem, which is not climate change, but sociopathy and narcissism. Especially in America, she said. It's going to kill the world. It's not capitalism, it's narcissism. I was surprised we didn't have a live-television psychopath crazy person as a president a long time ago because that's what we see on TV and that's what we see on Instagram.

Pelosi then interjected to remind Hoyer that the meeting was actually planned for 11:30 p.m. ET, and joked that Trump perhaps had told her the wrong time intentionally so that she would be absent.
The drawing shows a naked female and two hands pulling her braids back, with the word Greta written across her lower back. Below that is the logo of Edson-based company X-Site Energy Services Ltd. It has drawn staunch criticism, and serious concerns that the imagery constitutes child pornography.
It's a new year, it's a new moment, Warnock told a crowd of hundreds who gathered in a downpour to see him speak at New Life Ministries in this city near Georgia's border with Florida on Saturday night. The rest of the country did not see Georgia coming on Nov. 3. Welcome to the new Georgia. Welcome to the blue Georgia.

Automation for good. There has been a lot of discussion about the job-killing potential of tech, including how an unholy combination of automation, robotics and artificial intelligence will be the death of employment. Many jobs will, in fact, be replaced by tech, especially ones that are rote and also many that are high paying in medicine, law and more. But this is also an opportunity to rethink the entire way we imagine employment and education.
These air-temperature changes close to the surface led to similar changes higher up in the atmosphere. This, in turn, affected the jet stream -- a conveyor belt of wind that carries warm air and moisture around the globe -- by increasing its waviness, making jetstream waves dive farther south and stretch farther to the north. In turn, this extra amplification can alter the movement of cold air masses near the pole, otherwise known as the polar vortex, Cohen explained.
Last year, two companies in the S&P 500, fast food giant Yum Brands and snack maker Mondelez International, faced shareholder resolutions specifically on deforestation. BlackRock voted against both.

But in the first months of his candidacy — and, as it happened, the last months, as well — Smith made sure Buttigieg was booked on every television show possible. He sneaked calls to broadcast stations on almost every drive, took reporters with him from one event to another, and talked to local cameras whenever they would have him.
Embracing decarbonization as an opportunity, not a burden, has spurred many large companies to commit to achieving net-zero emissions as rapidly as they can -- for some, this is by 2040 or sooner , while other sectors are harder to abate and will need more time to do so. It's in everyone's interests to increase momentum until we can no longer count the companies involved.
By the time he began stabbing strangers in the synagogue, Thomas had already been arrested seven times, in some cases for violent offenses like assault, resisting arrest and killing a police animal.
As fracked natural gas and renewables like wind and solar undercut the price of coal, both Mitchell and the nearby Hatfield's Ferry power plants were deactivated on the same day in 2013.
And though confidants say that the incoming team's core priorities for that 100-day agenda will remain the same regardless of the outcome — the pandemic, the recession, climate change and racial inequality — they concede that the scale of their plans could change dramatically come Tuesday evening, Politico's Tyler Pager and Megan Cassella wrote on Tuesday.
The letter calls for a number of steps that the coalition argues that Biden could take unilaterally, including an executive order upgrading public buildings, transportation and energy in a transition to a clean energy economy; an executive order that requires federal agencies to secure informed tribal consent from Indigenous nations; declaring a national climate emergency; and banning new fossil fuel projects on federal and tribal lands and waters, as well as in environmental justice communities.
At times, Harris reveals a more vulnerable side that she rarely shows in public. She notes, for example, her shock and horror when she failed the California Bar on her first try, and how she almost didn't notice that her now-husband was proposing marriage because she was so caught up in what she calls the balancing act of the working woman.

Conservation takes a long time. It took hundreds of years for grizzly bears to be hunted, trapped and driven to the brink of extirpation from the lower 48 states. Scientists and conservationists say it's unreasonable to expect that they'd recover in a few decades.

These energy realities could be the makings of a happy story of energy abundance, leading to both economic and national security for every American. After all, with that much money, we could provide good education, protect retirees, build infrastructure, improve our defenses, cut taxes—and still have trillions left over.
Some Jewish women remained wary of the organization because of delays in removing former board members accused of anti-Semitism. But others said they felt compelled to give the group another chance.
Morrison is right about one thing — the only solution is global action, writes Ross Gittins, the economics editor of The Sydney Morning Herald, Australia's oldest newspaper. While Mr. Morrison certainly deserves blame, Mr. Gittins says, nothing Australia could have done by itself would have prevented the current devastation, since the country accounts for only 1.3 percent of global emissions.
Contacted Thursday, a spokesman for OSTP was not available to comment because of the government shutdown.
So one thing I was really interested in finding was someone who was coming face to face with this massive destruction of Australia's ecosystem.
Trump said back in 2016 he could shoot someone in Times Square and most of his supporters would still be with him. There's a lot of truth in that, but if this election is as close as people think, then even if he turns off a small sliver of Republicans, this might be a step too far and could be the difference, Charles Bullock, a University of Georgia political science professor, told USA TODAY.
Senate Republicans also showed their determination to deprive the unemployed of benefits as far back as July, when they waited until just four days before unemployment benefits expired, before even responding to the Democrats' proposal that would renew them.
People who have been locked out of power are speaking up about corporate influence over the issues that matter in their lives, said Abdul El-Sayed, a Sanders ally and liberal organizer who ran unsuccessfully for Michigan governor in 2018.

Forty-nine percent of suburban voters in the district supported a Green New Deal candidate, compared to just 31 percent of urban voters. By contrast, 14 percent of suburban voters said they'd support an anti-Green New Deal primary candidate, while 43 percent of urban voters said they'd do the same.
The socialist Democrats just can't help themselves. They are openly pushing for a socialist agenda that will raise taxes, destroy our economy and leave communities less safe, NRCC Spokesman Mike Berg said in a statement to Fox News.
Sites Reservoir … reduces the flood potential of the Sacramento River … and it allows the entire Central Valley system, all the other major dams in the north — Trinity, Shasta, Oroville, and Folsom — to rebalance … [A]s much as 3 million more acre-feet of water can be stored in Trinity, Shasta, Oroville and Folsom because they don't have to prevent flooding of Sacramento and other downriver communities, rebalancing the system. A similar proposal to raise the height of the Shasta Dam has a similar purpose, as would Temperance Flat on the San Joquin River near Fresno.
I certainly hear some animosity to the Endangered Species Act, because people that are living with endangered species feel that their rights are being infringed upon, he says. That recovery goals are going beyond what was originally agreed to.
A constant target of Mr. Trump, Bloomberg made his intentions clear from at every speech that his focus was beating Mr. Trump in the general election.

Needless to say, the thought of digging up Amazonia in pursuit of minerals is horrifying—horrifying, that is, to Western environmentalists. Yet for their part, Brazilians seem okay with it; after all, they just voted Bolsonaro into office. As this author has argued in the past, if a resource is sitting there, it only makes sense that hungry people will wish to see it utilized. Green elites may sentimentalize poverty as living in harmony with nature, but the poor would rather have refrigerators, automobiles, and good health care.
We win partisan battles yet lose the war
California faced its deadliest wildfire season this past year, with the Camp Fire and the Woolsey Fire destroying thousands of homes and burning through hundreds of thousands of acres. Mr. Trump visited California in November to tour the devastation with then-Gov. Jerry Brown and Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom, during which he promised that the federal government would continue to support the state in the face of these deadly wildfires.

Sanders: Sure, it might be a hard sell. The American people want a health care system that works for them, not for huge profits for the drug companies who are ripping us off every day and the insurance companies. At the end of the day, we will create more jobs. Will there be some job loss? Yes, there will. We're gonna create more jobs. We need more doctors. We need more nurses. We need more psychologists and psychiatrists to help us deal with the opioid epidemic. There'll be a net plus of jobs.

As you know from our work at the end of the last Congress, the job of COVID emergency relief is far from complete, Schumer told senators. Democrats wanted to do much more in the last bill and promised to do more, if given the opportunity, to increase direct payments to a total of $2,000 — we will get that done.
Adam Carolla and Dennis Prager, join us tonight. Gentlemen, thanks both for coming out. I haven't talked to you since the film came out. Just to start with you, Adam. What was the risk?

Most of the money went toward supporting the chapter programs and staging conferences — in other words, tending to the network and the idea factory. What makes Leonard Leo so consequential is not because he's so smart or whatever, it's that he's sitting at the center of an enormous network, says Steven Teles, author of The Rise of the Conservative Legal Movement: The Battle for Control of the Law and a professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University. He has lots of information, and that information isn't just his; it's that those things bubble up through those relationships … spreading through all these people who know each other, and they develop reputations and linkages, which then have lots of other consequences.
Major provisions include a requirement that House members reimburse taxpayers for any settlements that are the result of discrimination by that member based on race, religion, sex, national origin or disability, among others.

Much of the nation's land mass, occupied by 110,000 people, is endangered by rising seas that have inundated coastal villages. The rising oceans have turned fresh water sources brackish, imperiling communities and raising doubts the nation will exist at the next New Year.
The Democratic caucus has announced plans to make a package of political reforms, including the provisions to encourage small donors long championed by John Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, their top priority, bearing the symbolic bill number H.R. 1. In addition to highlighting corruption and the corrosive consequences of the post-Citizens United era, such reforms, if they were ever to pass, could give elected officials a way to stay in better touch with their districts, spending more time with voters and that way keeping the vital, diverse local dimension of politics alive even in a time of deep national polarization.
What concerns me, at least as publicly reported, is that the U.S. did not consult with our allies prior to this action. And if that is the case, it put Canada and others in a fairly difficult and complex situation on the ground.
Let me tell you something: the way Michael Bloomberg treated employees, female employees who were under his wing, who were relying on him for their -- for their livelihood, for their health benefits, for their 401(k)s, to have created that kind of culture, that unsafe workplace, to feel that you're being harassed because of your gender, that is problematic, and I think you're going to hear more of it.

Founded officially in April 2017, the Sunrise Movement traces its roots back to the start of the decade, when the Occupy Wall Street protests put a national spotlight on the widening income gap. By the mid-2010s, the student activists who would go on to found the Sunrise Movement were leading efforts to pressure their universities to divest from fossil fuels. Drawing on lessons from the 2016 presidential bid of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the group finally took form a few months after President Donald Trump began a full-on assault on environmental regulations in a push to bolster the oil and gas industry.
Of course he is, Warren said. He's part of a group that our federal government has designated as a terrorist. The question, though, is what's the right response? And the response that Donald Trump has picked is the most incendiary and has moved us to the edge of war.

WaPo: House Republican leaders on Thursday stepped forward to criticize Rep. Steve King for defending white nationalism... King, who won a ninth term in Congress in November, lamented in an interview with the New York Times that the term had become a pejorative one. 'White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?' King said in the interview, which was published Thursday. King later issued a statement in which he sought to walk back his remarks. He said he rejects 'those labels and the evil ideology that they define' and proclaimed himself 'simply a Nationalist.' … And Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R), who backed King during the last campaign and appeared with him on the campaign trail, has said she will not endorse him this time, telling an NBC affiliate in Des Moines that 'the last election was a wake-up call for it to be that close.'
WALLACE: The McCabe case is small potatoes?
At the foundation of all of Ocasio-Cortez's reforms is her commitment to socialism, an economic system that in its most utopian form aims to eliminate nearly all private property and puts the collective—which, in a democratic society, is simply the majority of voters—in charge of every aspect of life, including the education of your children, the extent of your rights to practice your religion, and your most important health care decisions.
The science journal Nature felt compelled to conclude (with unusual modesty) that better models are needed before exceptional events can be reliably linked to global warming.

President Trump used his first-ever prime time address from the Oval Office on Tuesday night to make his case for funding a southern border wall -- as well as to emphasize the human cost of what he called the growing humanitarian and security crisis of surging illegal immigration.
It's possible to prevent power lines from sparking fires or power outages by putting them underground. But that option was found to be so expensive that a utility watchdog group said it was really not feasible, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.
That's the rosy view. The demands of a rising middle class in the developing world may prove a challenge to decarbonization efforts, while climate skepticism may further drive a host of right-wing movements in the West as their opponents go green. Rather than a warning to the world, melting ice caps in the Arctic are already opening new trade lanes and avenues for exploration, stoking a new era of geopolitical competition. All the while, scientists predict an increasing number of extreme weather events wracking the world and destabilizing vulnerable communities.

She did not realize she would deliver that line in front of television cameras. The world watched as the president interrupted her after she uttered those words at the outset of a wild 15-minute exchange: Did you say 'Trump' ?
Even Federalists come down on both sides of some of these questions. In 2013, years after he spoke at the founding Federalist Society symposium, and after he won Bush v. Gore, Ted Olson returned to the Supreme Court to overturn a California proposition banning same-sex marriage. For their part, many liberal scholars and lawyers continue to reject originalism in favor of a vision of the Constitution flexible enough to embrace changing times and evolving notions of human rights. Still, even critics of originalism are forced to acknowledge the new reality: Despite recent work demonstrating the bankruptcy of these [originalist] approaches, liberal lawyers trying to get progressive results at the Supreme Court have already begun trying to pick off conservative justices through a calculated embrace of the theories, Richard Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California at Irvine, wrote recently in Slate.
We shouldn't hinder ourselves from the start, she added.

But when elites of both persuasions preside over too many calamities, you can get Jeffersonians and Jacksonians as important presidential contenders in their own right — think of George McGovern and George Wallace when the Vietnam War went bad.

American consumers are tired of hearing Ford blame Firestone. Consumers don't want to go out and buy four tires and ask the dealer to throw in a vehicle; they buy a vehicle and the tires are part of that vehicle. Today I'm going to ask Firestone and Ford to join with me in calling for and cooperating with an independent review of these tire failures worldwide to determine the cause of the failure and to propose solutions and report back to this committee and the public by the end of the year. In the meantime, I believe the recall should be widened to include all 15- and 16-inch Firestone tires, as has been done in Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. We here in the United States deserve to be treated no differently than people in other parts of the world. We deserve an answer to the many questions that will be raised here today. I'm afraid that Firestone, Ford and NHTSA can't find the answers. Let's join together to call for and support a fully independent review of this situation so that we can find the answers.

In 2010, she returned to office as a member of the Hawaii City Council. In 2012, she was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. She comes from a multicultural, multi-religious family and, as a practicing Hindu, was the first Hindu elected to Congress.
Singh brought up the Trump administration's record of detaining migrants seeking asylum, and their immigration policy of ripping babies out of their mom's arms.
Even the most political people, the most thoughtful and engaged, tend not to go there. And for good reason. Going there can be extremely uncomfortable. Food is not just what we put in our mouths to fill up; it is culture and identity. Reason plays some role in our decisions about food, but it's rarely driving the car.
We are therefore asking Christians of all denominations and sects to follow the call that we've all been given, and to fulfill the words of Isaiah to bring good news to the oppressed, to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and release to the prisoners. To do this means calling out racism, homophobia, transphobia, sexism and ableism, and then doing something to eradicate those sins in our lives, in our churches, in our communities and, sometimes, even within our own families.
And thus, if that's what we believe, then we should agree all of us on an immediate withdrawal of all troops from the region. Otherwise, the troops are just sitting ducks along with contractors, NGOs et cetera.

At least three states passed laws putting new criminal penalties on protests against fossil fuel infrastructure in just the past two weeks amid the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic. First came Kentucky. On March 16, Gov. Andy Beshear (D) signed legislation that ― while removing some of the original bill's most draconian measures on protest ― designated natural gas or petroleum pipelines as key infrastructure assets and made causing damage that totals more than $1,000 or tampering in a manner that renders the operations harmful or dangerous felony charges of criminal mischief in the first degree. Two days later, it was South Dakota. On March 18, Gov. Kristi Noem (R) signed a bill that expanded the definition of critical infrastructure to include virtually any oil, gas or utility equipment, and raised the charges for causing substantial interruption or impairment of such facilities to felonies. Five days later, on March 23, the governor approved a second measure defining a felony riot as intentional use of force or violence by three or more persons that causes any damage to property. On Wednesday, West Virginia followed suit. Gov. Jim Justice (R) greenlighted legislation assigning the same critical infrastructure status to a wide range of oil, gas and pipeline facilities, slapping fines as high as $20,000 on anyone found guilty of causing damage, destruction, vandalization, defacing or tampering that totals $2,500 or more.

A Little-Known Climate Fund Is Suddenly In The Spotlight
Atlanta's promise is tested in a year of political and racial tension. Thousands of protesters in downtown Atlanta demonstrating for racial justice. Credit... Joshua Rashaad McFadden for The New York Times For generations, the prevailing mythology of Atlanta has been that it is an undeniably Southern city that is also unlike the rest of the South, a place where the relentless pursuit of economic and social advancement meant casting aside much of the racial division and bitter history that have long dogged the region. But lately, that notion has been tested — by the pandemic; by violent encounters between African-Americans and the police; and by the fluctuating divide between metropolitan Atlanta and the much more conservative and traditional state surrounding it. The pandemic has laid bare gaps in access to opportunity and health care, as the virus has hit the African-American community especially hard. It has also galvanized ideological divides between the city and the state, as the mayor and governor sparred over adopting strict measures to curb the virus's spread. Protests forced many to examine the stubbornness of institutional racism. A meltdown during the summer primaries, with long lines and malfunctioning voting machines, stoked concerns over suppression. Those issues are certainly not Atlanta's alone. But again and again in recent months, the city emerged as an arena in which those tensions played out in vivid and revelatory ways. When Georgia votes on Tuesday, representatives of very different segments of Atlanta will play leading roles in this chapter of the city's history: the Rev.

One of her most important opinions as a circuit court judge was an against-the-grain dissent that said felons should not necessarily be forbidden from gun ownership. Such a deprivation of Second Amendment rights should depend on whether a person is dangerous, she wrote, not the classification of his crime. The Firearms Policy Coalition has filed a petition on behalf of a Pennsylvania man similarly barred from gun ownership, which could provide the chance for the court's new conservative majority to consider the issue anew.
A broader study in the New England Journal of Medicine showed an eightfold increase in antimicrobial resistance from 1992 to 1997 and linked this increase to the use of antimicrobials in farmed chickens. As far back as the late 1960s, scientists have warned against the nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in farmed-animal feed.

If Biden is successful on Monday night, his campaign will argue that voters believe he has the best chance of beating Mr. Trump. While many important issues come up in conversations with Iowans, polls suggest caucus-goers are more concerned about finding an electable candidate. The Biden campaign hopes those Iowans will turn out for the former vice president.
At the time of the challenge, Gore warned that the climate was warming at such a rate that, without immediate action, disasters would occur. His book Assault on Reason — published in April 2007 — stated that: Many scientists are now warning that we are moving closer to several 'tipping points' that could — within as little as ten years — make it impossible for us to avoid irretrievable damage of the planet's habitability for human civilization.

KERIK: You know what, Tucker? Nobody knows how to fix the city and how to reduce crime better than I did, and I do because I was there when the Renaissance occurred, but it looks like this Mayor and this Governor, they're trying to diminish and destroy all the programs that were put in place that reduced crime by 65 -- violent crime by 65 to 70 percent, homicide by 70 to 75 percent.

Of course, no one purveys these theories with as much verve as Trump. The president has suggested that the nation's first African American president was born abroad (he wasn't), that the father of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) had a part in JFK's assassination (he didn't), that Ukraine rather than Russia was responsible for election interference (it wasn't), that the Mueller investigation empaneled by his own administration was a Democratic plot against him, that the Clintons orchestrated the prison killing of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein (who committed suicide, according to an autopsy) and that the Obama administration spied on his campaign, a claim most recently debunked by the Justice Department's inspector general.

Democrats are always best when the race is one in which it's change versus status quo, and the Democrats are change, Doyle added. You go back historically to Roosevelt, to Kennedy, to Carter, to Clinton, to Obama. That's how Democrats win.

Stolyarov added that Thunberg's name opens doors to everyone. Everyone, from presidents to street cleaners, are ready to talk to Greta Thunberg, he told the AP in a Skype interview.
Castro also delved into the issue of race, casting prominent police killings of people of color as symptomatic of America's wider problems with racial discrimination.
DAN BALZ: Well, there-- there is certainly a lot of politics in this because we know that for-- for President Trump the wall has been central to his political message. And I know there are Democrats who believe that he will never make a deal because he wants the issue more than he wants the wall, if you will. And so that's part of the hump that you have to get over in these negotiations. But with the government shutdown, there's going to have to be solution at some point. I mean, this can't go on indefinitely. President talked about this could go on for months or even years. It's not going to go on for years, we're-- we're confident of that. But the question is, how long each side is prepared to hold out? And I think what we'll-- what we'll get to, at some point, I don't-- don't know when is, there will be enough, you know, if you will, pain and suffering and complaints and issues that pop up as a result of the hardships caused by government being shut down that will eventually force a solution.

Speaking shortly after Trump's prime-time Oval Office speech, Sanders listed the 30 million Americans without health insurance, the millions of senior citizens in desperate poverty and the 40 million young Americans trying to deal with outrageous debt as issues meriting a White House declaration of a national emergency.
Movement leaders do not agree on a price tag. Estimates run in the hundreds of billions of dollars, or more. But they argue a combination of tax hikes on the super wealthy – Ocasio-Cortez has floated a 70% rate on income over $10 million – and cuts to fossil fuel industry subsidies and military spending, in addition to the stimulative effects of the new public spending would offset any cost.
Even the solutions that we have considered big and bold are nowhere near the scale of the actual problem that climate change presents to us to our country, to the world. And so while carbon taxes are nice while things like cap and trade are nice, it's not what's going to save the planet. It could be part of a larger solution but no one has actually scoped out what that larger solution would entail. And so that's really what we're trying to accomplish.
Modi said failing to act on climate change would be a morally criminal act. Merkel had previously vowed to convince the doubters among world leaders that protecting the climate matters to all of us.

SEN. SANDERS: Well, two points. I'm a member of the Democratic leadership. I've been in the Democratic caucus from my, you know, virtually my first day back in Congress 30 years ago and from- in the state of Vermont, where I live, I am supported by Democrats and have won the Democratic primary. But we will win because we have an agenda that speaks to independents, to Democrats, and to more than a few Republicans. Look, we are living at a time when the American people are sick and tired of the kind of income and wealth inequality that exists in America. All over this country, MARGARET, and I have been all over this country, you got millions of people are working 11, 12 bucks an hour. They can't afford childcare. They can't afford healthcare. They're scared to death about their retirement. They want a government that represents them, not just billionaire campaign contributors. That's how you win. You put together that coalition, multi-generational, multi-racial. That is what we're doing. No campaign out there has a stronger grassroots movement than we do. That's how you beat Trump.

Over the last several years, I've met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration, Trump continued. I've held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief-stricken fathers. So sad. So terrible. I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices, or the sadness gripping their souls. How much more American blood must be shed before Congress does its job?

The political outlook for the legislation remained unclear. In a joint statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer praised Biden for including liberal priorities, saying they would move quickly to pass it. But Democrats have narrow margins in both chambers of Congress, and Republicans will push back on issues that range from increasing the minimum wage to providing more money for states, while demanding inclusion of their priorities, such as liability protection for businesses.

Jackson:A prison inmate said he was transferred and lost his job as a tutor after complaining that teachers were supplying answers to a high school equivalency test. U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith declined to dismiss the lawsuit, the Detroit Free Press reported Thursday, which means it will go to trial or be settled. Munin Kathawa, 57, who is serving a life sentence for murder, sued five people, including a deputy warden, claiming his rights were violated. He said he reported his concerns about cheating in 2018 to a state lawmaker and a Catholic priest. Corrections Department spokesman Chris Gautz declined to comment. Kathawa said he was falsely accused of being a safety threat and removed as a tutor. A teacher, Laura Bendele, testified in a deposition that she was pressured by officials to stick to that story but refused.
Whatever Mandelblit decides, it will tear the country apart, said Reuven Hazan, a political science professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

The former vice president, in particular, claimed that questions about his political influence intersecting with his son's work in Ukraine were part of an organized smear campaign. The claim, which is disputed by ethics watchdogs in both the U.S. and Ukraine, was further undercut by Biden's inability to recollect in which country his son was working.
I remember handing him ... an envelope with checks, which he took graciously, Kostopoulos said.
Adding yet more to Democrats' optimism is Trump's penchant for putting himself in untenable positions, like the one he is in over border wall funding. He can either infuriate his base by compromising or alienate pretty much everyone else by continuing a cruel, unpopular government shutdown.

At the time there was really no place or process to care for the oiled wildlife that was showing up on the beaches, says Nancy McToldridge, the zoo's director. So the zoo closed its doors and concentrated its time and energy into taking in these oiled birds, treating them and then rehabbing them back out into the wild.
But there are some signs of progress: This year, a new dengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years. And the world is more prepared to deal with Ebola than at any time in history: Two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use, all developed after the 2014 West Africa outbreak. The current Ebola outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world's ability to battle this virus. If there's an Ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020, it would likely be contained and crushed quickly. — Jason Beaubien

Additionally, consumers should be aware how much interest they're earning on their banks accounts. Stock-trading platform Robinhood made a huge splash in December when it announced banking accounts that were set to earn 3% interest. Though the company has since delayed the rollout of these accounts amid regulatory scrutiny, the public's enthusiastic reaction to the announcement — some 850,000 people joined a waitlist for the accounts — shows that Americans are hungry to earn interest on their cash.

Las Vegas:Lincoln County authorities have announced that a reward is being offered for information surrounding the starvation and death of a herd of cattle. The Lincoln County sheriff's office announced the $10,000 reward Monday after the herd of six were locked into a corral in rural south Nevada, officials said. Authorities believe at least one person intentionally isolated the herd in a coral where all but one cow starved to death. The herd was in the Tule Spring area about 30 miles north of Mesquite when weather made travel to the area difficult, Sheriff Kerry Lee said. The rancher who owns the cattle last saw them alive the first week of December before the weather cleared and he returned to his cattle, authorities said. The area is a popular location for hunters, authorities said. Anyone with information or trail camera footage of vehicles in the area is asked to contact the Lincoln County sheriff's office.

Despite Few Details And Much Doubt, The Green New Deal Generates Enthusiasm
It was in these factory farms that scientists saw, for the first time, viruses that combined genetic material from bird, pig and human viruses. Scientists at Columbia and Princeton Universities have actually been able to trace six of the eight genetic segments of the most feared virus in the world directly to U.S. factory farms.

When all we are doing is protecting rights, titles, freedoms, water, air, land, something that is so vital to all human beings, and to have armed personnel come at you, have our people and our supporters arrested … that is not supposed to happen in a democratic country.
Seventy-five percent of Asian voters in the sample said they'd support a pro-Green New Deal candidate, followed by 51 percent of whites, 39 percent of blacks and 33 percent of Hispanics.

SPALDING: I actually think the Iranian leadership is going to have to take a reassessment based on the strike. So, whatever language the President uses, it kind of reinforces this sense of unpredictability on - so they don't know where the line is. And if they don't know where the line is, they have to reassess. And I think you're going to see a level of stability as a result, not just in Iran. I think it sends a message to Beijing, to Moscow and Pyongyang that they need to pay attention to what the President is saying.
After House Republicans failed last year to enact an expansion of work requirements for food stamp recipients, the Trump administration announced in December plans to tighten rules on its own. Democrats' rule package directs the House to explore ways to respond to the administration's proposed changes.

The fact that such warm water was just now recorded by our team along a section of Thwaites grounding zone where we have known the glacier is melting suggests that it may be undergoing an unstoppable retreat that has huge implications for global sea-level rise, David Holland, director of New York University's Environmental Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and NYU Abu Dhabi's Center for Global Sea Level Change, which conducted the research, said in the news release.
WHO also warns of the dangers of influenza — a century after the 1918 flu pandemic killed millions of people around the globe.

Jim Kim had deftly struck a balance between keeping the Trump administration mollified and involving the World Bank in work on areas that the administration has been openly hostile to, said Eswar Prasad, the former head of the International Monetary Fund's China division. The new head of the institution will face a difficult challenge in maintaining the institution's legitimacy and relevance while hewing to the Trump administration's open hostility to multilateralism.
Heyman, a Democrat, has been a fierce critic of Trump, and has emerged as a vocal booster of Canada-U.S. relations during the Republican president's rocky term in office.

Lubbock: Police say a man who shot at a police officer early Sunday was then fatally shot when two officers returned gunfire. Police say in a news release that 30-year-old Drew Nichols Wallace-Flores was killed in the shooting in a southwest Lubbock neighborhood. Police say the officers were investigating a report from a resident of seeing a man on security video checking vehicle door handles in the neighborhood shortly after 5:30 a.m. Sunday when the man fled as one officer arrived. Police say the officer gave chase on foot, and as the second officer arrived, Wallace-Flores fired at the first officer, and both officers returned fire, killing Wallace-Flores at the scene. The names of the officers were not immediately released. Police say both are on paid leave pending an investigation into the shooting.

McCrory may challenge Tillis - [Raleigh] News&Observer: Former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory on Wednesday ruled out running in the 9th Congressional District — but not for governor in 2020 or the U.S. Senate in 2022. Speaking on his morning talk show on WBT radio, the Charlotte Republican said he'll make that decision later this year. 'I'm going to do a thorough assessment about running for governor (in 2020) or Senate in 2022, but I'm not ready to make either decision,' McCrory said. Charlotte's longest-serving mayor did say he's ruled out running if there's a special election in the 9th Congressional District. The election in November of Republican Mark Harris has been clouded by allegations of election fraud involving absentee ballots in Bladen and Robeson counties. The State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement has twice declined to certify the race.

Do you agree that we need to wait on the courts there? And is there any room for that kind of swap, that kind of deal?

That's a great question. We're definitely expecting impacts for two reasons. First is the warming ocean. As the waters warm, they can add more moisture to the air, allowing the storms to dump more precipitation. Latent heating could also play a role intensifying the storms as well. These storms feed off the temperature gradient between the mild Gulf Stream and cold air over the land. Climate change could also periodically cause cold air to spill farther south, and when the two meet, there's an increased risk for these extreme storms.

And the same thing with North Korea, these sanctions are sharvy North Korea and all of the cards, everybody is hysterical Laura, but the cards - if you just look at it dispassionately or on our side with Iran, with North Korea, with China, it will just calm down and let these things play out. We're the ones with the sanctions. We're the ones with a strong economy. We're the ones with the largest military. And as long as we don't overreach or try to as you say nation build or go into some large expedition, we're in great shape.
Taken together, Sanford's words as governor created a kind of second Emancipation Proclamation for North Carolina. His inauguration speech and other comments signaled to the state's Black residents that, as Sam Cooke would sing a few years later, change was on its way.

Weeks of federal indecision on the regulatory approval process and inaction in the face of illegal blockades have created more uncertainty for investors looking at Canada, said Kenney.
If Sanders is successful on Monday night it will show that caucus-goers back his message of changing the system and believe he will fight for issues that matter to working class Americans. The campaign also has an aggressive ground game in Iowa, one that includes hundreds of staffers and volunteers spread across the state looking to turn out his fervent supporters and first-time caucus-goers. Although it is a comparatively small demographic in the state, the campaign's outreach with Latino voters in the state could also prove to be essential come Caucus Night.
ALEX AZAR: And I-- I appreciate that people are concerned of that, and that-- that is why we're being radically transparent about what we know and also what the full range of potential scenarios could be. And that's why we say might be, but also might not be with aggressive containment and mitigation steps. Right now it's important for people to understand we're not advising any types of particular measures in the United States like travel restrictions or closures. State or local public health offices, which are the frontlines of response, might make their own decisions to do that. But, at this point, we do not have sufficient spread in the United States that would indicate those measures. But we're not taking any of them off the table. The full range of options will always remain on the table.
The scientists recommend salvaging oxygen-starved areas by tackling climate change and nutrient pollution, focusing on protecting particularly vulnerable sea life with no-catch or no-fishing zones, and increasing and improving surveillance of areas where oxygen is plummeting.
Wheeler said critics of the rule had distorted both its intent and its impact. He said that a pivotal study like the Harvard one, which has influenced key federal pollution standards that have saved thousands of lives and been economically beneficial, might still be able to inform future policies if the next administrator determines it is justified and publishes the reasoning behind that decision.

Which Republicans might run against Trump in 2020? Too soon to say - WashEx: Renegade Republicans intent on upending President Trump in 2020 are keeping their powder dry, waiting to see if legal and political controversies drive him from office first. …Republicans who oppose Trump's re-election are eyeing June as the approximate moment for deciding on a primary challenge or independent bid. It's a strategic delay. Some Republicans think the weight of multiple investigations could motivate the president to exit the White House after one term — especially if special counsel Robert Mueller issues a politically damaging report. … The Republicans most often listed as possible Trump challengers are outgoing Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who ran in 2016; Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who is up for re-election next year; Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah … Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan; and former Sens. Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona, who sources say are unlikely to run.

Green and his organization, through its Social Progress Index, have been tracking this every year since 2014. Higher education has traditionally been concentrated in wealthy countries, says Green, but many countries are making significant leaps, both in terms of enrollment and quality, and it's leading to a growing global middle class. Some of the biggest improvers, according to their data, include Morocco, Slovakia and Turkey.
INGRAHAM: Governor Huckabee, when you think about how Trump has been an advocate for a more restrained approach to deployment of our military, and you I have talked about this, he's never gotten any credit for that from the left, not at all. But now they are mad that he is actually doing something to protect American interests against this craven mass murderer.
No stranger to hyperbole and grandiloquence, Sanders told Sarah Silverman last September that America starves little children and bombs houses and buses of children.
So, down the road somewhere, if Green New Dealers still say they want to create 10 million new jobs, maybe the rest of us should say, That's great! Now, how're you going to pay for them?
For instance, in the U.S. the largest retailer of organic food is Walmart. As people started to consume organic food and demand organic food, companies competed to provide it, and Walmart is the biggest one out there. In many ways, it's empowering to recognize that ultimately the economy reflects our decisions and our choices, and that can be small choices like what milk you buy or major choices of where you choose to work and how we choose to save and invest. That's the power we have as consumers, investors and as voters.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who sponsored what some saw as an early version of the Green New Deal in 2012, backs the policy and is planning to introduce legislation on it this year. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) was among the first in the Senate to endorse Ocasio-Cortez's select committee push. Long shot Richard Ojeda, a populist Democrat from West Virginia's coal country who was the first to announce a bid for president, shortly after losing a House race in November, gave the Green New Deal his full-throated support.

Climate change has made weather events more destructive, with fiercer, more violent storms and prolonged droughts that transformed swaths of the west into tinderboxes, driving up the losses. But part of the problem is that more valuable properties are located on the coasts or near forests. NOAA officials said the analysis did not account for differences between those two factors.

I think the significant development here is that this is the first of these cases in this last year that's filed outside of California, said Michael Burger, who directs the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. If more and more localities sue, we might be able to see adequate pressure applied to these companies to inspire action on climate change, he said.

It is worth noting that the team did not find a significant trend in dry extremes or mean precipitation in either the observational or the model analysis. Instead, most of the increase in likelihood of extreme fire weather is driven by heating. That's because more heat causes more evaporation which dries out soil and vegetation.

Trenton: All 37,000 of the lead water pipes in the state capital will be replaced over the next five years at an estimated cost of $150 million, Trenton officials said Thursday. The announcement comes about five months after the state's largest city, Newark, said it would speed up the replacement of its 18,000 lead lines over the next 21/ 2 years – and as the state grapples with how to move forward with its old water infrastructure. Trenton's publicly owned water utility draws water from the Delaware River and serves some 200,000 customers in the city, in addition to surrounding communities of Ewing, Hamilton, Hopewell and Lawrence. Pipes will be replaced in phases as the city and Trenton Water Works, the public utility, continue to secure funds, which are coming from the state infrastructure bank, as well a federal program, according to David Smith, the water works chief engineer. Residents must register on the utility's website and pay $1,000 to have their lines replaced, Democratic Mayor Reed Gusciora said. That's a savings, he said, because replacement typically costs about $2,000-$5,000 per line. About 7,000 people have registered to have their pipes replaced, and officials said they hope to make the replacement mandatory and at no cost at some point.

Grants to Meals on Wheels would also likely be eliminated as part of the cuts to the Community Development Block Grant program, and Mulvaney defended those cuts Thursday afternoon, claiming the block granting program was not showing any results.
Trump's allies in the White House and on Capitol Hill are fond of pointing out — and potentially exploiting — the difficulties Pelosi will probably have managing her caucus's aggressive left flank. Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), for instance, tweeted criticism of Democratic leaders Monday over the makeup of a special climate-change committee and Wednesday announced she would vote against rules changes backed by Pelosi.

Progressives are already looking at how Democrats should use their newfound power, advocating for the Senate to go nuclear and eliminate the filibuster, which requires that most legislation obtain 60 votes to advance, in order to pass a more ambitious agenda. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York dodged a question on Wednesday on whether his caucus will lower the threshold to a simple majority vote, saying it is united in wanting big, bold change and would discuss the best ways to get that done.
DOUG JONES: No, actually, I started as a mime back at Ball State University in Indiana. And being 6-foot-3 and 140 pounds and having a mime background, it's like, oh, the creature-effects people were just all over me the minute I got to LA.
Crucially, the Sites Reservoir appears to have some startup funding. As much as half of the money will come from a special water bond passed by voters in Proposition 1 of 2014, which set aside $2.7 billion (of $7.5 billion) for water storage projects. The rest of the project would theoretically be funded by long-term contracts for water not reserved for public use.
Francis also said it is necessary to create a social debate in which of those involved in any way can explain their problems and have access to adequate and reliable information in order to make decisions for the common good, something rarely seen in contemporary discussions of climate change that tend to exclude climate change skeptics.

Or, as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) declares, extreme event attribution can't tell us whether global warming 'caused' a specific event.
Along with an 1.9 percent spike in power sector emissions, increases occurred in the transportation, industry and buildings sectors, according to Rhodium. Contributing to the overall increase were the growing U.S. economy, a cold start to the year that required additional energy for heating, and the limited progress made in developing decarbonization strategies, the analysis found.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --who accuse them--
That's my last option, Trump said, according to Graham.
HARMAN: OK. No. And I think that what you said, Chris, is right. This is a counterintelligence investigation, not a criminal investigation. And if they have had real evidence that the president was a Manchurian candidate, I think they would have intervene right then. I mean we can't have that go on -- an unprecedented whatever I -- collusion, cooperation, arrangement with one of our most important, strategic competitors, Russia.
There are also relatable moments when she describes her anguish at missing sports matches and family milestones as she tried to balance her home life with her job in Washington.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But more testing means more positive results. I mean you're saying, basically, expect the number of those who've been diagnosed with the virus to also increase?
WALLACE: OK, I want to switch subjects. The New York Times now reports that after President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, that the bureau opened up a counterintelligence investigation into whether or not the president of the United States was working on behalf of the Russians. One, did you know about that? Two, what do you think -- I have to say, it's an astonishing idea.
Worldwide, the frequency of severe coral bleaching events has increased nearly fivefold in the past four decades, from once every 25 to 30 years in the early 1980s to once every six years in 2016, the study suggests.
LIASSON: I think some of the dynamic on that has changed a bit because he took a big hit with his base this week. He went into a macho standoff and lost to Madam Speaker. And some of his base is angry with him because they think he had no strategy. They think he wimped out. And don't forget this was a kind of two-step capitulation. First, he played brinksmanship (ph) on the State of the Union address, then retreated on that. And Nancy Pelosi had a strategy. As she reportedly told a group of columnists this week, she says, you start with a feather. Then you get to the sledgehammer. So her Art Of The Deal was smarter and more strategic than the president's. His critics say his strategy was more whining than winning.

There's a lot of things we can do instead of that.

While the GOP was actively courting allies who propagated conspiracy theories, the Democratic Party took much the opposite tack — mostly rejecting the outlandish left-wing theories that surfaced from time to time. Although some research has found a recent uptick in Democratic support for conspiracy theories (a jump caused by a lack of political power), elected Democrats have typically fenced their party off from wild-eyed claims promulgated on the left. They never embraced the theory that the 9/11 attacks were an inside job carried out by the Bush administration, for example. During the 2004 presidential primary race, even the most lefty antiwar candidates — Dennis Kucinich, Howard Dean, Carol Moseley Braun — largely eschewed conspiracy theories that President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney had gone to war for oil or to enrich their friends in the construction business. The left has its share of anti-vaxxers who believe that vaccines cause autism, yet Democratic officials have battled that lie (which Trump himself has promoted).
In March and April, the Sunrise Movement will host events in Florida, California, Pennsylvania, New York, Kentucky, Michigan and elsewhere.

Each event will include in-person training sessions, and conclude with organizing meetings for new converts.

About the time of his inauguration, Sanford and his wife decided to send their two young children to a public elementary school near the governor's residence that had been integrated the previous fall by 7-year-old William Campbell.

First in a list of four main risk factors was increasing demand for animal protein, which is a way of saying that demand for meat, eggs, and dairy is a primary factor influencing emerging zoonotic diseases.

How Biden, Sanders approach the Iran question
Several dozen countries have signed but not fully approved — including Iran, Turkey and, most significantly, Russia, which is a major emitter of greenhouse gases. But three-quarters of the countries on Earth have fully committed to the accord.
LIASSON: I think that's right. His hardcore base will never desert him. As he said, he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose any votes. The big question is, how big is his hardcore base? We know from polling, including NPR's polling, that his approval rating was starting to slip with white, working-class voters who are the core of his base. And we know that in every shutdown - shutdowns end because one side reaches their pain threshold first. In this case, it was the Republicans and Donald Trump. Maybe it was the long lines at the airport, that angry video statement from the FBI director or all those Senate Republicans who were starting to jump ship. But he had a weak hand and played it poorly. And his base is angry at him.
But he's also laid out an ambitious agenda of things he would like to do,
In such conversations, it may be important to remember how your interlocutor's values differ from your own. In Vice, Maggie Puniewska points to the moral foundations theory, according to which liberals and conservatives prioritize different ethics: the former compassion, fairness and liberty, the latter purity, loyalty and obedience to authority. Ms. Puniewska writes:
The collapse of the 74,000-square-mile Thwaites — which some scientists see as the most vulnerable and significant glacier in the world when it comes to sea-level-rise — could release a mass of water roughly the size of Florida or Great Britain. Its melting would raise global sea levels by more than three feet, enough to potentially overwhelm vulnerable populations, the researchers said.
Amid the impasse, Pelosi and her fellow Democrats have also signaled in recent weeks that they intend to move aggressively to use their newfound powers to investigate Trump and his administration from multiple angles. She even suggested in a television interview that he was not immune to indictment.

Even as much of the economy bounces back, evictions could easily spike as protections fade away; millions of unemployed workers are severely behind on rent. And many services on which the poor and middle class depend could take a significant hit: Public education and public transportation, in particular, could face drastic cuts as cities and towns search for ways to close budget gaps caused by reduced tax revenue and the high costs of fighting the coronavirus. The pain will linger for low-wage workers even as many economic headlines turn rosy again.
With Pennsylvania expected to be a crucial battleground in the 2020 presidential contest, the local fissure is highlighting a national dilemma for the Democratic Party as it tries to address the environmental demands of liberal urban activists while reaching out to voters who rely on the manufacturing industry for jobs.

In an odd decision when unemployment is extremely high among low-income Americans, the proposal shoehorns inthe long-term Democratic policy aim of hiking the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

Paul Ryan condemns party members' plot to reject Biden's election win. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan during his farewell speech at the Library of Congress in 2018. Credit... Erin Schaff for The New York Times WASHINGTON — Former House Speaker Paul D. Ryan on Sunday issued a rare statement condemning members of his own party for attempting to overturn President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory in the November election. As part of an attempt to defy the election results and indulge President Trump's attempts to remain in power, a dozen senators and more than 100 Republicans in the House have announced their intention to vote on Wednesday to reject electors chosen by the citizens. Efforts to reject the votes of the Electoral College and sow doubt about Joe Biden's victory strike at the foundation of our republic, Mr. Ryan wrote. It is difficult to conceive of a more anti-democratic and anti-conservative act than a federal intervention to overturn the results of state-certified elections and disenfranchise millions of Americans. The fact that this effort will fail does not mean it will not do significant damage to American democracy.
The proposal reflects the priorities of Democrats, spending more money on aiding state governments, schools, and colleges than stimulus payments to individuals. It also includes a minimum wage hike, a measure sought by Democrats long before the pandemic struck.

Ocasio-Cortez is a looker and I hazard a guess has had the privilege of turning men into gibbering idiots for most of her adult life. I have little doubt she has been trotting out utter nonsense and yet can make it look convincing and credible because she has hardly ever been challenged on it. This is what happens when beautiful women grow up in Leftist circles and are rarely called out for mixing up a billion with a trillion. This builds confidence and sense of entitlement and soon you end up with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Then suddenly when she enters Congress and her policies are examined by people on the Right, she thinks this is down to sexism. No. it's not your sex we have a problem with; it's the socialism.
One reason is that Democrats have been reluctant to use anti-government theories to tear down the things they would prefer to burnish, such as government and international institutions that they believe work for social justice and economic progress.

I mean, they're all about bringing people together and creating community and energy. How do you canvas? How do you knock on doors? I mean, the answer is you don't. We have seen both Biden and Sanders give speeches trying to show how they would handle a crisis. So that kind of thing is going on.

Trump plans to award nation's highest civilian honors to his most devoted defenders. Representative Devin Nunes during a television interview at the Russell Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill. Credit... Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times President Trump plans to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom in the coming days to two of his most outspoken Republican defenders in the House, Representatives Devin Nunes of California and Jim Jordan of Ohio, two officials familiar with his plans said. The award is the nation's highest civilian honor, meant to recognize exceptional contributions to national security, world peace or cultural and other significant endeavors. While presidents have bestowed the honor on members of Congress in the past, it has typically been granted at the end of a lawmaker's time in public service or in recognition for an unrelated achievement. In the case of Mr. Nunes and Mr. Jordan, however, Mr. Trump wants to honor the lawmakers for their leading roles in personally defending him against the F.B.I. 's investigation of Russian election interference and the House's impeachment inquiry, according to the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss plans not yet made public. Both investigations uncovered wrongdoing by the president and his advisers, but Mr. Trump viewed them as partisan witch hunts, demanding his party rally around him to fend them off.

He added that back in D.C. they are gathered together for the White House correspondents' dinner — without the president. Trump then told the crowd he was thrilled to be with them instead, many miles away from Washington.

Brown and Mercer eventually were named to head Renaissance.
And Raymond Arroyo is here. Now, this is special. It's a Monday appearance for Raymond. But of course, when the Golden Globes host Ricky Gervais gave celebs some really great advice at the award show. Too bad they didn't listen. He's going to explain later in the show why something I wrote 17 years ago was a little bit ahead of its time.
The U.S. Virgin Islands were devastated by hurricanes Maria and Irma, leaving homes collapsed and trees toppled on land. But there was also a great deal of damage under the water. In St. John, the storms churned up parts of the lush coral reef, depositing chunks on the beaches. Joining us now to talk about it is marine biologist Peter Edmunds of California State University, Northridge. He's been studying those reefs in St. John for more than three decades. Welcome to the program, sir.
Schumer said the security failures were unacceptable and pledged that the events would be fully investigated and every necessary security measure taken for Mr. Biden's inauguration inauguration in just over a week.

Now a county commissioner, Zimmerman is part of a local group hoping to lure natural gas investors from Texas to drill in Pennsylvania and he scoffs at the Trump administration's efforts to deregulate coal-fired power plants. It will help this much, he says, holding his fingers an inch apart. But it won't bring back coal as king .

BIANCULLI: Today, we celebrate the birthday of Broadway composer John Kander, who turns 90 years old tomorrow, with excerpts of two interviews he recorded with Terry. Along with his longtime lyricist, the late Fred Ebb, John Kander wrote the songs for such Broadway shows as Cabaret, Chicago and Kiss Of The Spider Woman, and as well as the songs for Martin Scorsese's 1977 film New York, New York. The title song was a big hit for Frank Sinatra.
The Associated Press has reported that Obama and his Republican predecessor George W. Bush decided against ordering a targeted killing of Soleimani because it could spark severe repercussions.
The next primary is on Saturday in South Carolina, where the latest polls show Biden leading and Sanders running close behind. The Super Tuesday contests on March 3 may be decisive, with voters in California, Texas and 12 other states determining approximately one-third of the nearly 4,000 pledged delegates to be awarded by primaries and caucuses.
I don't doubt that some people are very frustrated, but the consequence of not delisting grizzly bears is the continuation of good and effective programs, says Tom France, a long-time conservationist with the National Wildlife Federation's Northern Rockies, Prairies and Pacific Regional Center.
But he does it because the base loves it. I'm not even sure he really wants these threats and orders carried out, but the base loves it and that is why he will keep doing it.
The consequences of the partial government shutdown are mounting ― for national parks, airports, food inspections, emergency preparations and a host of other services. Some 800,000 federal workers missed their first paycheck on Friday, prompting fears among many of taking on debt to pay for food, medication, rent and loans.
And they feared future presidents like Mr. Obama.

Out with the old, in with the new. That was the mantra U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres espoused as he promised the world will never be the same again in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He has a fractured skull. He has been sliced, like through his neck. He has a shattered arm. The doctors do not have high hopes for him. He may never be -- I mean, if he wakes up, he may never be able to walk, talk or even process speech again.

And what they did in this -- with these new laws where they're letting people back out on the street, it's going to diminish quality of life and it's going to enhance violence.
Trump warns Iran:But says US 'ready to embrace peace with all who seek it'
It may seem out of place, to emphasize unity and belonging at a time like this. But my sense of hope is based not in my age but in my experience.
Panel, stand by if you would. We'll see a little bit later in the show.
If you want an either-or situation, I'm not your guy, he said. I want to do both. I want to have an energy efficient future, I want to have a strong environment and I want to have a good economy in Pennsylvania, and I think we can do all of those things.
O'Donnell: Can you unite the Democratic Party? We've just talked about criticism from Senator Warren, criticism from Senator Clinton, criticism from the Obama camp.
Early last year, the Transportation Department moved to allow railroads to transport LNG for the first time, over the objections of environmentalists, the National Transportation Safety Board, Native American tribes and other groups.
The European Parliament passed a motion in December calling for access to the camps in Xinjiang, sanctions, and saying that no investment treaty should be struck which didn't include China ratifying human rights conventions, especially the convention on forced labour, and then the European Commission rams through this deal within days despite the European Parliament's wishes.
It also means that my style, my approach, may be different as it concerns certain issues. Again, the SALT deduction is important to New Yorkers. It may not be as important in Missouri, for example, where property taxes are lower.
SPALDING: Creating chaos, everywhere he went. Quite frankly, I'd given up hope that we were going to do the right thing with regard to his actions all the way back to my time in Iraq back in 2007.
On Tuesday, Francis will celebrate Mass to mark the start of a new year and officially leave behind 2018, which saw a new eruption of the clergy sex abuse scandal.
This was a resounding success, from their point of view. In the November 2010 elections, Republicans picked up 63 seats in the House, flipping control of the chamber, and gained six seats in the Senate.

Running in winter takes a little more preparation than simply lacing up your sneakers and heading outside. You'll need to think carefully about the preparation and execution. Follow these tips from fitness experts to become a successful winter runner:
KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: Good morning.
BAIER: But I guess -- and I know you're focused on January 5th, but
The deal — which was not done in consultation with the United States — is seen as a big diplomatic loss for the incoming Biden administration, which had promised to develop closer ties with the EU to counteract the rise of China as opposed to President Trump's tougher unilateral approach.
Under my administration, Wall Street CEOs will no longer receive a get-out-of jail free card. Big banks will not be too big to fail. Big bankers will not be too big to jail.
Gray: I would challenge those people to really see past what's onstage. We're not just there for that one night and that's it, that's the finished thing. Behind every girl is a story, there's a journey. There's something that they're passionate about. And the women that I competed with, they are incredibly successful. Some are medical students, some are budding lawyers, some are business owners, artists, they're such accomplished women. And they all have something to not only pursue but also a reason why they do what they do.
SHAPIRO: You know, often when Congress holds hearings about renewables or clean energy, we hear Republicans question the premise that cutting carbon emissions is important or questioning the science of climate change. How much of that did you experience in your testimony on the Hill today?
REPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: I think we have to look at the bigger problem of immigration reforming our immigration system, not just a wall.
Infrastructure would be a harmonizing subject for your conference and would undercut the president on an unmet promise to voters. If you get very lucky, you could pass something that the president would actually pressure Senate Republicans to pass.
Asked about emissions tied to the state's growing petrochemical industry — including an ethane cracker plant under construction in Beaver County — he indicated his support for the industry.
So, the researchers developed a new technique: Studying the turtles' hormones.Proving that the increasing temperatures actually changed the turtle population proved challenging, though. Turtles don't wear signs of their sex as obviously as humans; researchers can't tell just by looking between their legs. And the easiest method — cutting them open — isn't really an ethical way to approach an endangered turtle population.
A Facebook company spokesperson told CNN that it takes aggressive steps to limit the spread of misinformation about Covid-19, that it has connected over two billion people with accurate information from public health authorities and it removes content that could lead to imminent physical harm, such as false posts about virus cures or vaccines.

In other words, the oceans were just hiding the heat and now new tools have enabled scientists to find it.
This all came after a tumultuous few months in South Korea's political climate. In December, then-president Park Gun-Hey was impeached amid a corruption scandal. Hundreds of thousands flooded the streets of Seoul, calling for her removal.
Fox News reached out to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Whip James Clyburn and the Democratic National Committee to ask if they thought socialism was a good thing for America. They did not respond.
Why is this the time to be talking about corporate accountability?
Potter says during this great migration, either before or after they crossed the land bridge, this group (which the researchers call the founding population for all Native Americans) split again, into two populations. Scientists had suspected this and surmised that one group stayed put in and around Beringia. They call them Ancient Beringians.
Although there's little question that climate change will harm younger generations, there's considerably more debate about a related concern — that the rhetoric surrounding the issue is equally injurious. When young people seize on the U.N. warning that governments need to take action in 12 years to conclude, incorrectly, that the planet has only a decade remaining (Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said last year that millennials fear the world is gonna end in 12 years if we don't address climate change), or when the website of the U.K.-based activist group Extinction Rebellion warns that societal collapse and mass death are seen as inevitable by scientists and other credible voices, it can be terrifying. Some voices are now sounding the alarm about alarmism, suggesting that we'd all be better off if we dialed down some of the hyperbole.
LOEFFLER: Well, look, Bret, Georgians are fired up. They are ready to get
Jay Timmons, president and chief executive of the National Association of Manufacturers, said his group had called for exactly the changes proposed by the White House because his members' efforts should be used for building the infrastructure Americans desperately need, not wasted on mountains of paperwork and endless delays.
The cost is stupendous, damaging, regressive, but secondary to the damage this is doing to our freedom. — Jeffrey Lee (@jafarcakes) February 4, 2020
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Speaker Pelosi has called the wall an immorality. She said, no way, no how, is the President going to get money for it. That's a pretty hard line position versus where the President is. Do you find any room for compromise in the middle?
Overall, half of all those surveyed said they would consider looking for a new job in the year ahead. Glassdoor polled more than 2,000 employed adults in December.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Julian Castro, the only thing Latino running ends his campaign today leaving the Democrats even less diverse. Following the earlier departure, of course of Senator Kamala Harris.
My district has not had an outspoken progressive represent it in the United States Congress. And so I'm looking forward to showing my district that I'm going to work with everyone if it means improving the lives of my constituents.
Rice won endorsements from a handful of GOP officials in her district in 2016. Since 2016, she's voted in favor of legislation Trump pushed just over 30 percent of the time, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis, which predicted, based on Trump's support in her district, that figure would be closer to 48 percent.
As early favorites such as Sens. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) built multistate organizations, Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten, along with Smith and another staffer, Max Harris, would pile into the car, drive west from South Bend, and try to find Iowans willing to listen to Buttigieg.
Health care Yang has called for moving toward a single-payer system to provide universal coverage but said he would not eliminate private insurance, expecting a public option to out-compete companies. He said he supports the spirit of Medicare-for-all but that swiftly reformatting 18 percent of our economy and eliminating private insurance for millions of Americans is not a realistic strategy. Under a government-run plan, Yang would allow undocumented immigrants who are on a path to citizenship to be covered. He also supports granting Medicare the same drug-price-bargaining powers that Medicaid has. See all candidates

All we've heard from this administration is shifting explanations, evasive answers, repeated assertions of an imminent threat without the necessary evidence to support that conclusion, he said in a nearly 20-minute speech.
Droughts are nature's fault. Water shortages are our fault.
The proposal also calls for a job-guarantee program offering a living wage job to every person who wants one, a plan to aid workers affected by climate change, universal health care and basic income programs, among other things.
In October last year, it seemed finally as if the poisonous dwarf were going to get his comeuppance, after a damning report by Dame Laura Cox into bullying and harassment in Parliament.

As the new Congress convenes, the partial government shutdown continues in its 13th day – with no end in sight in the showdown between Trump and lawmakers over funding for a border wall.
Last year's hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in the United States and Caribbean, wildfires in California and earthquakes in Mexico destroyed homes, infrastructure and numerous lives.

In addition to garnering the necessary number of voters, Democratic candidates need to reach 5 percent support in at least four DNC-approved polls, or at least 7 percent support in two single-state polls in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina.
Some wildlife groups and grizzly advocates question those numbers and the federal government's population counting methodology. Others believe the initial recovery goals were set too low.
In 1996, Congress passed a law which requires federal immigration agents to deport illegal immigrants, with few exceptions. The statutory language is mandatory. Thus, whatever prosecutorial discretion which may have existed previously, was specifically eliminated by that legislative act. Yet, the President is now, in effect, ordering those agents to break the law. He cannot, on his own, engage in a de facto repeal of this law by executive action. To do so would be, quite simply, lawlessness and a dereliction of his duty.
SENATOR DICK DURBIN: I don't see that. But I will tell you we've offered 1.3 billion with very specific limits which would not include a concrete wall. The President could have taken this long ago and we could have moved forward. But he said, No, I'm going to shut down my own government. That's what he's done.
But it's the intemperance with which the foreign policy establishment in Washington describes the threat that I think makes sensible people nervous, that Iran is the greatest threat we face. I mean, it's so prima facie absurd that it makes you wonder what their actual agenda is.
She had another, more tangible gift: Replacement headlights for her bike.
AOC referred to the 70% rate on people at the tippy-tops as the rich merely paying their fair share of the tax burden.
This is a temptation present in our world, understandable because it is part of our nature, he said.
But Frontier was not without its detractors.
We want to put the brakes on globalization a little bit and reassert control over our country, our borders, our economic policy, our tax policy, with the recognition that the distinction of citizenship means something and citizens are in it together fundamentally in a way that the world community is not, Anton says.

Rainfall was below average across southern Australia during the cooler months of May to September.
If I hadn't seen her on TV, I would've thought I could never be on TV – they don't let LGBTQ people on TV. And more than that, I would've gone on thinking that I was an alien and that I maybe didn't even have a right to be here. So, thank you, Ellen for giving me a shot, said McKinnon, seemingly holding back tears. A shot at a good life.
Buttigieg would spend most of the next few months repeating himself, in television interviews and magazine sit-downs, on CNN town halls and Sunday shows. From the earliest days of Buttigieg's bid, Mike Schmuhl, a longtime friend turned campaign manager, acknowledged it was a long shot.

In addition, by 2030, more than a billion people on the planet will be over the age of 65, according to a study funded by the National Institutes of Health. That's due to longer life expectancies and improving living standards around the world. But the maturing of the world population — not just in the West, but throughout Asia and Latin America, too — carries real policy conundrums.
For many Australians, it seems as if we've entered some sort of Back to the Future parallel universe and somehow Biff is in charge.
Leading Democrats on Capitol Hill slammed Trump's budget blueprint as wrongheaded. President Trump is not making anyone more secure with a budget that hollows out our economy and endangers working families, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, of California, said in a statement, adding, The budget is a statement of values, and President Trump has shown he does not value the future of children and working families. The Senate's top Democrat was more direct: Democrats in Congress will emphatically oppose these cuts & urge our Republican colleagues to reject them as well, Sen. Charles Schumer, of New York, said on Twitter.
As a result, Earth's temperature is changing at a rate 100 times faster than what happened in the last Ice Age.
Both campaigns and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee knew pulling off the upsets would demand the type of massive ground game Democrats had eschewed during the pandemic era. Christie Roberts, a senior adviser at the DSCC, had begun searching for an operative to run a unified field operation even before Election Day. It was one of the crucial shifts the party made before the two-month runoff campaign that proved essential to Warnock and Ossoff's victories in elections that saw record-breaking turnout.
The candidates were particularly focused on engaging young voters and they did it through music, through K-pop and popular media. It worked.
Curtis Smith, a Shell spokesman, told The Associated Press that the company believes climate change is a complex societal challenge that should be addressed through sound government policy and cultural change to drive low-carbon choices for businesses and consumers, not by the courts.
Jennifer Lentfer, a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades, says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development. There are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject. In the coming weeks, Lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question Western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative. And in January, graduate students at Duke University are organizing a conference called Decolonizing Global Health 2020.

SYMMES: I say they're wrong. And I have confidence that the truth and integrity and character will win.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you seen the more specific financial request that the White House says they were giving to Democrats?
Bloomberg's plan calls for his foundation to work with other groups, from governments to philanthropies, that want to support the U.N.'s climate change agency.
While a record number of coal-fired power plants were retired last year, their energy production was mostly replaced by natural gas instead of renewable energy like wind or solar, according to a report by independent research provider Rhodium Group. The report estimates that in 2018 the U.S. posted the largest increase in heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions since 2010, up 3.4 percent.
Two long-sleeved shirts, a sweater, a fleece jacket, two scarves and two pairs of socks.
The question of speed makes all the difference in the world for climate change, he said. If New York City is serious about its climate goals, that's exactly what it needs to do, is look at the question and say, 'How quickly can we get out of gas and into renewables?'
Unplugging from the world. We all need to unplug from the constant stream of information flowing to us from traditional mainstream and social media sources. Just like our mobile phones and other electronic devices, we too can crash unless we reboot our circuits on a regular basis. Winter hibernations can be great opportunities to detach from the world and reconnect with ourselves.
Globally, we throw out about a third of the food we buy, and if food waste were its own country it would be the third-largest greenhouse gas emitter behind China and the United States, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.
The new House rules also authorize funding for the House Administration Committee to investigate election disputes underway in Iowa's 2nd District, where Democrat Rita Hart is contesting a six-vote win by Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks.
No one can tell me that if it had been a group of Black Lives Matter protesting yesterday, they wouldn't have been treated very, very differently from the mob of thugs that stormed the Capitol, he said. We all know that's true, and it is unacceptable.

HOLMES: Well, it's -- I think this is important to know because at that point he had an obligation to do a deal with an administration that didn't see eye to eye with his conference. That is precisely the role that Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi find themselves in at this particular juncture. And instead of understanding how it is that they get from a to b and open up the government, Nancy Pelosi's telling the president she would only give him a dollar to open up -- open up the government and fund the wall. That's ridiculous.

But while it concluded that the US Military Academy and US Naval Academy were in compliance with Pentagon policies that govern sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention, victim assistance and advocacy, investigation, accountability, and assessment, the report determined that the mismanagement of victim response programs at the Air Force Academy did not meet that standard.

Students, read the entire essay, then tell us:
Jason Plautz is a writer in Denver.
CONWAY: It should be an issue here and now, today. You don't have to wait for an election to be offended by the fact that Michael Bloomberg, according to other Bloomberg employees, said to a woman who announced she was pregnant, she's been congratulated by her coworkers, says, aren't you going to kill it?
Sullivan had his own thoughts. What you need to say to coal miners is 'We're going to figure out a way to give you better, safer, healthier jobs.' These guys and the few gals are simply too good. They are too capable to simply say that we don't need you, he said.
Even when the excitement over Crazy Rich Asians fades, its redefinition of cultural appropriation will remain critical. Let's not forget this nuance during awards season.
But the incident ― on which Constantinides is scheduled to hold a Feb. 11 hearing ― raised new concerns about the risks of burning fossil fuels for electricity in a residential neighborhood and cast a new light on existing public health problems linked to power plant pollution.
Sparrow did not respond to HuffPost's repeated requests for comment, but he told City News Edmonton Thursday that neither X-Site, nor any X-Site employee, was involved in making the sticker.
TRUMP: I think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked. I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written.
Listen to what Barr said in that interview with ABC. Here he is.
States and cities started suing oil companies in 2015 after Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times published documents showing that oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp. understood fossil fuels caused global warming decades ago yet chose to ramp up drilling and fund a misinformation campaign smearing climate science. Three years later, the Dutch-language De Correspondent published a similar exposé on Shell.
Asked whether she would consider challenging Sen. Schumer, Ocasio-Cortez avoided a direct answer. I'm a no bullshit kind of person. I'm not playing coy or anything like that, she told John Bresnahan. She did, however, clarify that she was keeping her options on the table.
What does a storm have to do to be classified as a bomb?
Conservatives have been particularly critical of two studies that have spurred increased regulation: a 1993 Harvard University Six Cities project that linked air pollution to premature deaths and a Columbia University analysis of a widely used pesticide, chlorpyrifos, that suggested the chemical causes neurological damage in babies.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But the President says he could bypass Congress by declaring this national emergency. So what would you do if he-- he went that route?
Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has argued a Green New Deal needs to tackle the tax code – which he said is stacked against renewable energy – by eliminating breaks for oil companies. Instead, tax incentives should be made available for clean energy, clean transportation fuel and energy efficiency, he said.
The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in 2018 that policymakers have just 12 years to avert the worst consequences of global warming; news coverage is constantly filled with apocalyptic stories of storms and wildfires. Young people, absorbing the gravity of these warnings, have become the defining face of the climate movement — marching, protesting and berating their elders for bequeathing them an uncertain, unstable future. Underlying their anger, though, is another a-word: anxiety. And it's something they're increasingly voicing. Teachers hear their students talk about panic attacks when wildfires break out, and psychologists face young patients weeping about their fear of never having a family. Amber Bray recalls Colin solemnly telling her on his eighth birthday, My life would be better without climate change.
They argue that the dam is unnecessary — electricity could be generated through less environmentally destructive means, such as solar, wind or geothermal infrastructure — and violates their treaty rights, said Willson. Treaty 8 was signed in 1899 and contains promises that the state will protect their way of life. In the meantime, construction on the dam is allowed to continue, although it won't be completed until 2024.
WALLACE: But is it fair game for President Trump when he's made sexist comments too?
WALLACE: That doesn't mean -- that doesn't mean it's not an issue.
The President of the United States – having failed to get Mexico to pay for his ineffective, unnecessary border wall, and unable to convince the Congress or the American people to foot the bill – has shut down the government, Schumer said in a response delivered jointly with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. American democracy doesn't work that way. We don't govern by temper tantrum.
New Orleans: John White, who helped strengthen the role of charter schools, backed a taxpayer-funded tuition voucher program for private schools and oversaw overhauls of the state's school accountability efforts, said he is stepping down as Louisiana's education superintendent. He told state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education members in a letter that he will leave the job March 11. He did not state his reasons. The board said a search for his replacement would begin immediately and the process will be discussed at an upcoming meeting. White can point to numerous improvements made during his eight years as education chief, including improved graduation rates and better performance on college preparation tests. His tenure was also marked by a rocky relationship with teacher unions and Gov. John Bel Edwards. And the state continues to lag others in nationwide education rankings. Still, his departure comes as his job seemed secure, following the election last year of a slate of state education board members who were backed by the state's business lobby, which was supportive of White. Although he didn't discuss his future, The Advocate reported in April that he had quietly co-founded a national nonprofit group, Propel America, aimed at connecting low-income high school graduates with solid jobs. White has been education superintendent since 2012 but he had been working on a month-to-month basis since 2016. Although he had the support of a majority of the 11-member state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, he lacked the two-thirds majority needed to get a new contract.
Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and President Trump are still trading barbs. Here's a look at their feud. (Bastien Inzaurralde, Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)
And so there's this real divide here between those who see the bushfires in Australia as some kind of natural disaster, as a tragedy, and those who see it as a turning point in the conversation about climate change.
And I really experienced what most people in the West have never ever experienced -- life under a totalitarian regime.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --those people who work for homeland security who are carrying out the policies you're talking about who are not going to get paid?
I'm not surprised. I'm accustomed to coaching — and being coached by —thousands of women leaders in war zones who are making life and death decisions every day. They have their fingers on the pulse of their communities. They know which young men have weapons under their mattresses. Ironically, as second-class citizens, they aren't as threatening as their male counterparts. And they don't get stuck on dissent at the expense of solutions. For all that we wring our hands, not knowing how to decrease the scourge of war, the result is a show-stopper: if women play a significant role forging a peace agreement, research shows it's three times likelier to last.

SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, I had lunch with the President last week and I came away a bit encourage. There are three things that we want to accomplish as part of a withdrawal. We want to make sure that when we leave the Kurds do not get slaughtered. And I don't trust Turkey to take care of the Kurds. It'd be like Putin trying to police Assad. That didn't work well. We need a plan to protect the Kurds from Turkey and others. We need to make sure ISIS doesn't come back once they're defeated and Iran is not the biggest winner. If you can accomplish those three objectives by reducing our forces, which I think we can, then count me in. But those three things have to be--
So can we really expect to ramp up solar and wind, from three percent of our energy production, to 100 percent of what we need, and will need, as the population grows? In a little more than a decade? We all know the answer to that.

Authorities warned that land damaged by recent wildfires is especially prone to flash flooding and debris flows because burned soil is less absorbent, repelling water as well as pavement in some cases. Water that would normally be absorbed into the ground instead runs off, picking up ash, silt and debris along the way and threatening nearby areas.

After The Big Short, McKay's successful turn to serious movie-making, I had high hopes for Vice, that it would be something closer to Stone's underrated Nixon. Unfortunately, McKay uses the irreverent formula that made The Big Short so memorable to own Cheney, and the results are alternately ham-handed (fishing lures and heart removals as metaphors), hollow (it's a movie filled with impersonations, not characters), and laughably dishonest.
If the idea was to get as many people as possible to know him, Buttigieg had a good person to help: Smith.

As Biden builds out his White House senior staff and Cabinet, the climate movement has notched a series of high-profile victories, one of the few divisions of the Democratic left to successfully embed a number of its top allies -- and ideas -- into the new government's upper echelons. But the promise of today, before Biden has even taken office, will soon be met by the grinding realities of governing in divided Washington.
That's like just flat out acknowledging, 'We've been doing everything we do to keep Biden from being the nominee, and guess what: we tried it in Iraq, and it's not working.' … I mean, in Iran. Excuse me. 'We tried it in Ukraine,' the 77-year-old former vice president said:

SENATOR DICK DURBIN: No. As a matter of fact, the meeting yesterday between Vice President Pence and the staff, they agreed that today they would produce it, finally produce documentation backing up what the President's latest demand might be. But Vice President Pence said at one point a few weeks ago, two billion will do it, 2.1. And then within a matter of hours, the President reversed and said, No, it has to be 5.6. That's what we're up against. There doesn't seem to be a consistent message and-- and it doesn't seem to be a message consistent with border security. If we're talking about border security, the overwhelming number of undocumented people in the United States overstayed visas.

Rice did not join a handful of other Democrats in the New York delegation in supporting Ocasio-Cortez's resolution for a select committee on a Green New Deal. But in a statement to HuffPost, Rice said she supports robust federal investment in energy-efficient infrastructure projects and training for green energy jobs and said members of Congress committed to this fight should no longer accept campaign contributions from oil and gas companies.
Look at what Carbon Engineering says when they're criticized by environmental groups for working with oil companies, Hanna said.

There is much for this crowd to celebrate. The conservative and libertarian society for law and public policy studies has reached an unprecedented peak of power and influence. Brett Kavanaugh, whose membership in the society dates to his Yale Law School days, has just been elevated to the Supreme Court; he is the second of President Trump's appointees, following Neil Gorsuch, another justice closely associated with the society. They join Justice Clarence Thomas (who said last spring he's been a part of the Federalist Society now since meeting with them … in the 1980s), Chief Justice John Roberts (listed as a member in 1997-98) and Justice Samuel Alito (a periodic speaker at society events). The newly solidified conservative majority on the court will inevitably decide more cases in line with the society's ideals — which include checking federal power, protecting individual liberty and interpreting the Constitution according to its original meaning. In practice, this could mean fewer regulations of the environment and health care, more businesses allowed to refuse service to customers on religious grounds, and denial of protections claimed by newly vocal classes of minorities, such as transgender people.

It's only a matter of time before Hollywood makes a movie about this.
The 116th Congress was sworn into office this past week, even as the government remained in a partial shutdown. A record number of women have been elected to the House of Representatives. So far, one newcomer is getting most of the attention, from both the left and from the right. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is 29 years old. She'd never run for elective office before and was working as a waitress and bartender when she launched her campaign. She unseated one of the most powerful Democrats in the House in the primary.
Amidst criticism that Trump's rebuke showed insensitivity to the victims of ongoing fires, as well as first responders battling the blazes, the president subsequently made an extra effort to show his support for the state during the fires. Newsom joined then-Gov. Jerry Brown in welcoming the president on a tour of Paradise, California and other areas.

Experts say climate change has worsened the scope and impact of natural disasters like fires and floods -- weather conditions are growing more extreme, and, for years, and fires have been starting earlier in the season and spreading with greater intensity.
These statutes were certainly not written with the intent to give a man like Donald Trump the power that he's now claiming, said Lessig, but it's not an efficient process to check him and that's the uncertainty I think Congress now has to face.
So now we can see the makings of the next epic political fight: that is, the zeal of the greens vs. the determination of carbon-energy producers. In the U.S. today, about a dozen states are heavily dependent on carbon-energy production for their wellbeing; these states account for most of the 1.1 million employees in the energy sector.

The campaign is beginning to make some moves, announcing a shake-up of its senior ranks last week. Biden emphasized the importance of diversity in the Democratic Party during weekend campaign events. In an interview with ABC's This Week that aired Sunday, he took particular aim at Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, for failing to attract black voters.
Domesticity takes many guises in Daniel Wickerham and Malcolm Lomax's towering assemblages, which rely heavily on photographic images but also include 3-D objects. Among the homey motifs are pets, TV shows, cocktails and Baltimore places and pals. The assemblages's see-through portals include a doggy door and intricate cutouts, but some possible passageways are blocked by wooden 2-by-4s or slabs of blank plywood. These barriers suggest containment and isolation, and also provide a breather from the profusion of pictures and items.
I placed my bet on American manufacturing, Mr. Obama said in the Saturday video. In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We said the auto industry would have to truly change, not just pretend that it did. We got labor and management to settle their differences. We got the industry to retool and restructure.
Pelosi, 78, faced early opposition from some in her own party who called for a fresh generation of guidance. But one-by-one, Pelosi managed to win over several skeptics through promising lead positions on their legislative priorities or special panels. She also struck a deal with Democrats by vowing to serve no more than four years in the leadership position.

At the UN, when I insisted that there's room for women at negotiating tables if we just pull up more chairs, an official answered that elbow room isn't the problem. Warlords refuse to have females on their teams he said, matter-of-factly, because they're afraid women will compromise.
The chamber also has enormous power in shaping the nation's judiciary. Democrats have watched in dismay as the now-outgoing Senate majority leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has won confirmation of scores of conservative nominees to federal district and appellate courts ― as well as three justices to the nine-member Supreme Court — and blocked a host of legislation from ever getting voted on.
There was no way I could win, Harris writes in her new memoir, recalling the strategist's stinging words, because I was 'a woman running for attorney general, a woman who is a minority, a woman who is a minority who is anti-death penalty who is DA of wacky San Francisco.' Old stereotypes die hard.
Even if he fails to secure the nomination outright at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee this summer, Sanders is unlikely to go away quietly, aides and friends said. They suggested that Sanders's long run and defiant exit from the 2016 race — doggedly carrying on with his calls for a political revolution until the final primary, weeks after Hillary Clinton had effectively sewn up the nomination — was a revealing glimpse into his character and his desire to move the party to the left.

This moment is truly unlike any other. It's made plain the deep social imbalances ― like poverty, racism, sexism, classism to name a few ― that are a new revelation for some, but have been common knowledge for many. As a trained public health professional and former state health official, I can't help but think about the lessons that I hope health care and public health take and learn from the moment we're in.
We have been poisoning air, land and water – and filling oceans with plastics. Now, nature is striking back: temperatures are reaching record highs, biodiversity is collapsing, deserts are spreading, [and] fires, floods and hurricanes are more frequent and extreme… We are extremely fragile.

With smart policies and the right investments, we can chart a path that brings health to all, revives economies and builds resilience and rescues biodiversity.

In reviewing the Georgia election, critics will rightly award the liberal media a starring role. The press acted as apologists for both Rafael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, instead of reporters.
The state's incoming attorney general has spent decades in Washington working on federal policies, said Assemblyman Chad Mayes, R-Yucca Valley, in a statement quoted by the Sacramento Bee. It's not clear why legislative Democrats needed to hire a D.C. insider to litigate the exact same issues.
Also, in the run-up to the election, the release of a phone call in which Trump exhorted Georgia Secretary of State to find 11,780 votes to give him the state likely turned off a number of Republican voters fed up with our mercurial president. Exit polls indicate that 63% of self-described moderates voted for Warnock, whose agenda does not promise moderation.

By 2050, the study found, a direct air capture program expanded with that kind of money could remove 2 to 2.5 gigatons of CO₂ per year. Estimates from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the leading global climate forecasting body, vary on how much CO₂ needs to be removed from the atmosphere annually to keep warming in check, but most models suggest a figure close to 6 gigatons per year by midcentury. The rest would need to be made up with newly planted forests and styles of soil cultivation that trap carbon underground. (There is some debate among carbon removal researchers about whether that much will, in fact, be necessary.)

At the end of the 19th century, the Supreme Court declared that Congress had plenary power (meaning full and complete) to regulate immigration. Derived from Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, the doctrine is based on the concept that immigration is a question of national sovereignty, relating to a nation's right to define its own borders and restrict entrance therein. As the high court observed, Over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete.

A concerned Alberta resident posted a picture of the sticker on Facebook in late February. It showed a drawing of the back of a nude female with two hands pulling her braided hair from behind. The word Greta was written across her lower back, and the name of Alberta oilfield firm X-Site Energy Services was printed boldly at the bottom.
Ocasio-Cortez's commitment to enacting democratic socialism is evident in many of her policy proposals, especially her plan for a Green New Deal. According to a draft resolution produced by Ocasio-Cortez to create a House climate change committee, the Green New Deal would eliminate nearly all fossil fuels in the United States by 2030 and instead force consumers to buy 100 percent of their power from renewable energy sources like wind and solar, which cost as much as five times more than existing fossil-fuel-power generation, and to purchase electric cars.
Introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, the Green New Deal sparked a fierce political debate on how to best combat climate change. The plan drew significant attention from President Trump and Republican lawmakers, who have panned the plan as costly and unrealistic and used the policy to cast Democratic supporters of the framework as socialists. The Green New Deal was introduced as a nonbinding resolution, written with out some specifics, making it challenging to specify a price tag. Supporters say the plan will pay for itself through economic growth, and that the urgency of the climate crisis requires a bold and immediate response.
Travis Miller, senior utilities equity strategist at Morningstar, is skeptical that a potential gas sell-off would fly with regulators or Wall Street. He said he doesn't think another utility would step forward to buy the gas assets.
What I saw in that Oval Office circus was someone struggling really to try and respect the institution of the president while having total disdain for the man himself, said Jim Manley, who was a top aide to then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), who served alongside Pelosi. She's smart enough to know that she can't go into the gutter, but you know she's going to find ways to tweak the guy.
Many saw this coming. The rioters had been planning in plain sight. But perhaps Black Americans were the least surprised by the day's events. The precedent had been set, time and again. We don't have to look back that far for reminders: Whether in 1900, or 1925, or 1939, or 1965, or 2020, white terror has been deeply embedded in American culture, especially in the face of Black progress and the quest for freedom and equality.

Their averages are so close that small changes can re-order the rankings from year to year, the report said.

Committing to remove some of the centuries of carbon emissions that countries such as the U.S., United Kingdom and France have produced since the dawn of the industrial revolution could prove a powerful tool in global climate negotiations. Developing nations such as China, India and Vietnam, whose emissions make up the bulk of those that could push the world over its climate threshold, have complained it's unfair to demand they sacrifice fossil-fueled economic growth that lifts their populations out of poverty at the behest of countries that grew wealthy exploiting coal and colonizing their ancestors.

Workers have had the legs taken out from underneath them and this agreement makes improvements, Warren told a Boston CBS affiliate Friday. It's gonna help open up some markets for farmers, they need that stability. It's gonna help with enforceable labor standards and that's gonna be useful. We really need trade negotiations going forward that make sure anyone who wants access to our markets is actually helping us in the fight against climate change and helping build an economy that works for everybody in the U.S.
Vaccines will help, but normal is still elusive
It appears that the Republican leadership's recent willingness to finally negotiate a COVID relief package was driven by the risk that continued refusal could result in losing the Jan. 5 runoff election for the two senators from Georgia. This election will determine who controls the Senate.

Older voters, whites and Asians made up the strongest base of support for a pro-Green New Deal Democrat. Such a hypothetical candidate garnered 57 percent support from voters over 65 and 55 percent among voters aged 55 to 64.
Biden believes the key to speeding that up lies not only in delivering more vaccine but also in working closely with states and local communities to get shots into the arms of more people. The Trump administration provided the vaccine to states and set guidelines for who should get priority for shots, but they largely left it up to state and local officials to organize their vaccination campaigns.

Since October, Sanders has separated himself in polls from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the other top Democrat in the liberal lane, solidifying himself in second in recent national polls behind Biden. He overcome a heart attack that month and pundits who had written off his campaign. If the Democratic primary is as drawn out as it was in 2016, Sanders could set up his foreign policy differences with Biden as an issue for the months ahead as both men battle for votes.
But having allies on the highest court of the land is just the top layer of the Federalist Society's expanding sway. For one thing, there is the judicial nomination process itself. When Trump was campaigning in 2016, he made the shrewd and un­or­tho­dox move of publicizing a list of 11 conservative legal stars that he promised to draw from if he got a chance to pick a Supreme Court justice. Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society, played a key role in suggesting the names, along with Trump's future White House counsel, Don McGahn (also a society member), and the conservative Heritage Foundation. The list was expanded twice to include Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and others. Leo took a leave from his job at the Federalist Society to advise the White House on the confirmation process for Gorsuch and Kavanaugh — reprising a role he played for the George W. Bush White House in putting Roberts and Alito on the court.

The president certainly didn't invent racism.

Macungie: Mack Trucks plans to lay off 305 employees at its assembly plant north of Philadelphia, the company said Wednesday. Mack blamed the layoffs at its Lower Macungue Township plant on a downturn in the heavy-duty truck market. They will take effect at the end of February, The (Allentown) Morning Call reported. The cuts represent about 13% of the plant's payroll. We regret having to take this action, but we operate in a cyclical market, and after two years of extremely high volumes, we have to adapt to reduced market demand, said Mack spokesman Christopher Heffner. Employees, most of whom belong to the auto workers union, were informed of the news Wednesday. The cuts were expected after Mack said last month that it would need to slow production to cope with reduced demand. Mack expects the North American truck market to be down nearly 30% this year.

Barnett realized he had misread the Federalist Society. Despite his initial impression of a closed conservative sect, the society seemed open to testing a diversity of ideas — and speaking on that panel changed his professional life. He switched from contracts to constitutional law. He made himself an expert on the Ninth Amendment, which got him involved in a case seeking to protect people from federal prosecution for using medical marijuana in California, where the state had legalized it. The case ended up relying not on the Ninth Amendment, but on the commerce clause — a strict reading of which is a favorite Federalist tool for curbing federal power. Barnett argued the matter before the Supreme Court in 2004. He lost — but in the process he developed some subtle jujitsu moves with the commerce clause.
Biden says he will create a national standard for housing appraisals.

Editorial Board:Iran crisis demands Donald Trump spell out endgame after killing Gen. Qassem Soleimani
After President Donald Trump insisted at the last minute that a relief bill provide $2,000 checks, House Democrats immediately passed an amendment increasing the stimulus payment by $1,400 that then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) blocked in the Senate. The issue would end up becoming a critical political cudgel for Warnock and Ossoff, the victorious Georgia Senate Democrats, to wield against their Republican opponents.

Currently, most California avocados are grown in the southern part of the state and on a narrow strip along the coast. But if avocados could grow in the Central Valley, the state's agricultural powerhouse, farmers there could reap the benefits of our avocado addiction, as well as stand out among foreign imports.
HARMAN: It's not a national emergency. It is fulfilling a campaign pledge. The wall is a primal scream. In your conversation with -- your very good conversation just before with Lindsey Graham and Chris Coons, both of them made clear that there are ways that Congress can make a deal. That's the right answer. And I'm going to get in a fight with Josh because I think that Mitch McConnell, his old boss, who is a dealmaker and wrote an autobiography called Playing the Long Ball, is bunting here and he could, if he chose to, rouse a veto proof majority in the Senate to pass what the Senate passed in the last Senate, which is the collection of CRs and then just leave one, that would be the Department of Homeland Security bill, with a shorter time frame to negotiate, have Lindsay and, as far as I'm concerned, Chris negotiate this and they will come up with the list of things they just suggested on TV, which maybe Trump will sign on whatever day they actually come up with it.
An RCMP senior commander has been in contact with representatives from Coastal GasLink, Indigenous communities, including hereditary chiefs, and the province to ensure protests are lawful, peaceful and safe, Saunderson said.
Yes, there would be 'outrage,' Levine writes. Hollywood's Jacobins of propriety would express their horror. Screenshots of trollish old tweets (and there have been many) would make the rounds. Words like 'racist' and 'sexist' would fly a mile a minute.

The U.S showed less social support, less sense of personal freedom, lower donations, and more perceived corruption of government and business, it said. America's crisis is, in short, a social crisis, not an economic crisis… Almost all of the policy discourse in Washington, D.C. centers on naïve attempts to raise the economic growth rate, as if a higher growth rate would somehow heal the deepening divisions and angst in American society. This kind of growth-only agenda is doubly wrong-headed.

Trouet said she and her colleagues first got the idea while at a conference for tree-ring researchers. At that meeting, Trouet mentioned that the National Hurricane Center began tracking Caribbean hurricanes only in 1850, making it hard to understand how climatic change had affected hurricane season. But one of her colleagues, dendrochronologist Grant Harley of the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg, noted that in the Florida Keys, people kept tree-ring data going back to 1707. And because hurricanes can stunt trees, hurricane intensity can be gleaned from those tree rings.

Our body does so using two primary mechanisms, she explained: by changing our breathing rate ― making it faster to release more carbon dioxide, which is acidic when dissolved in the blood, or slower to maintain CO2 levels ― or by releasing bicarbonate from the kidneys if our pH dips or excreting it in the case of excessive alkalinity. Diets will also have no tangible impact on our pH levels for the same reasons.
Allegations late in the academic year prompted a commander directed investigation at the Air Force Academy which disclosed significant evidence of mismanagement and unprofessionalism that negatively impacted victim advocacy and assistance rendered to a number of cadets, the assessment stated.
As Christians, we have a choice: We can either emerge from our quarantined lives wanting to return to pre-pandemic normalcy, or we can use the knowledge revealed during the pandemic months — of health care system failures, systemic racism, and transgender violence to name a few — to lift these groups and others up to Christ and saddle up next to them in solidarity.

BUTTIGIEG: Well, I think that's what voters right now are in the process of settling. Look, there are a lot of different candidacies with a lot of different visions. But the vision of my candidacy is that we're going to have to bring change to Washington, that we can't confront the most disruptive president in modern times by falling back on the same playbook, just as we also can't do it by telling people that their only options are between a revolution or the status quo.

Significant academic damage to children has already been recorded, particularly in math, as students have struggled to connect and teachers have struggled to teach remotely. Students of color and those in low-income families are seeing the steepest losses — exacerbating existing inequities. In a December report, the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. predicted that White students could lose the equivalent of eight months of math if schools stayed closed through June, while students of color could lose as much as 12 months. McKinsey estimates that high-intensity tutoring to cover half of U.S. students would cost $66 billion (at $2,500 per student), and advocates hope the federal government and private foundations will pay the bill.
Perdue downplayed the controversy, telling Fox News he did not think the revelation of Trump's effort to pressure the secretary of state would impact his reelection bid. Rather than criticize the president, he slammed Raffensperger.

So many decisive events occurred in late 1845 and 1846 that writer and historian Bernard DeVoto called it The Year of Decision. Countless individuals made innumerable decisions that, when they were all put together, added up to a single national decision: The United States' conquest of the West, and the establishment of a continental empire that would soon dominate the hemisphere and eventually the world.

Albuquerque: The head of New Mexico's largest Catholic diocese has issued directives aimed at protecting parishioners during flu season. Santa Fe Archbishop John Wester cited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, saying New Mexico is one of the states experiencing widespread flu outbreaks. He's urging people not to shake hands or hug when they attend Mass. Parishioners also are being asked not to hold hands while reciting the Our Father and those who are ill should stay home to avoid spreading the virus. Priests and other church officials also are being asked to wash their hands before and after distributing communion. Wester said the directives will be revoked when the situation improves. He said the archdiocese was instituting the directives not to limit expression of faith, but rather as a preventive measure against a widespread and potentially deadly disease.
Even though he is very private, he has very deep pockets and he cuts a wide swath in conservative politics, Sheila Krumholz, the center's executive director, told NPR.

Let's then claim our faith unabashedly. Let's live out our calling, so that people will know we are Christians because of our love for others. Let's cry out for justice like John the Baptist and the prophets once cried out in the wilderness.

Additionally, 15 of the state's 20 most-destructive fires on record have occurred since 2003. Coming in at No. 1 is November's Camp fire, which engulfed more than 153,000 acres, destroyed nearly 19,000 structures and killed at least 86 people. The Camp fire topped the 2017 Tubbs fire, which torched some 5,600 structures and killed 22 people.

Democratic leadership rejected the plan, but the effort succeeded in shifting the climate debate in the direction scientists say matches the extent of the crisis. By mid-December, more than 300 local and state officials voiced support for a Green New Deal in an open letter.

However, the broad scale and intensity of overall warmth across the Northern Hemisphere cannot be explained without climate change. Each year more signs emerge that human-caused climate change is playing a bigger role. A peer-reviewed paper published March 10 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters shows the climate-warming signal is becoming more apparent, with many regions already experiencing a climate which would be 'unknown' by late 19th century standards.
Warren's approval is new as she previously disagreed with the initial version of the trade agreement, and demanded changes.

[Ed. note: I will not nitpick your condemnatory descriptions of Lincoln's extra-constitutional activities as president. I take your basic point that he did exceed the boundaries of presidential authority, even in the creation of my home state of West Virginia. But suggesting that somehow Lincoln did not work through Congress in prosecuting the Civil War or that he lacked congressional authorization goes too far. I would also point out that the Constitution explicitly grants the president special powers in a time of domestic insurrection. There are many who seek to diminish Lincoln's legacy by casting him as some sort of despot, but that tends to either be sour grapes among still-unreconstructed Southerners or hot take aficionados. Lincoln's love for the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence is evident. When he was visited by a delegation of powerful American leaders who had participated in a peace conference in Washington prior to his inauguration, Lincoln was urged to accommodate the demands of the secessionists. As described by one who was there, Lincoln calmly, clearly told the men lecturing him: I will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. … It is not the Constitution as I would like to have it, but as it is, that is to be defended. The Constitution will not be preserved and defended until it is enforced and obeyed in every part of every one of the United States.

If they show a big increase over the previous month, or the same month in the previous year, that's a story. If they represent a sequence of warming months or years, that's a story. When they show cooling of any sort—and there have been more cooling months than warming months since anthropogenic warming began—there's no story.

Boise: A federal agency has ordered a company to pay four employees tens of thousands of dollars in unpaid overtime and travel time after the company violated labor laws. An investigation by the U.S. Labor Department found that Intermountain Concrete Polishing paid employees straight-time rates for all the hours they worked, including workweeks that exceeded 40 hours, the Idaho Statesman reports. The company also failed to record or compensate employees for travel time when they worked several hours away from their homes, officials said. The Meridian-based floor polishing company must pay $47,676 to four employees for violating overtime and record-keeping requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act, federal officials said.

At times, the wild-eyed conspiracism came from the top.

One to 2 degrees Celsius sounds really small when you hear scientists talk about it, she says. But it's a big deal when it comes to the climate of the Earth. And it means really enormous changes for coastlines around the world.
At the same time, Democrats were continuing to hammer both Loeffler and Perdue for their stock-trading scandals, with Ossoff dubbing them the Bonnie and Clyde of political corruption. The message worked, particularly when paired with spotlighting the GOP's stance on coronavirus relief.
Biden made no direct reference to Trump's call with state election officials during Monday's rally, but he did criticize Perdue and Loeffler for failing to speak out more forcefully against the president's actions.
He trashed his opponent more than Trump, but it was all in the same vein, Pirone said. It was about how we needed to put up a fight against Trump and Trumpism and where the direction of the country was going.
One key solution, she says: Channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately, rather than big international NGOs. — Tim McDonnell
Where are the teachers? When a politician can not only say what to write — because of a special interest group — but also the importance of it? When they are out of power, who gets their turn to indoctrinate? Every member of the teachers union should be screaming at the top of their lungs.
Last year was the hottest and driest year on record in the country, and December turned out to be one of the top two hottest months ever recorded. December featured the country's hottest day on record as well. No significant rain is expected in the hardest-hit areas of New South Wales and Victoria for months.
Even some American papers featured critical headlines about Harry and Meghan: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are hypocrites — abdicate or stay!, shouted the New York Post.

The federal government declined to comment on this project as it falls under provincial jurisdiction.
2030 represents a major milestone for the international organizations and climate scientists that have been climate change's doleful town criers. Two years ago, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that without huge, unprecedented cuts to carbon emissions over the next decade, the world would place itself on the brink of climate disaster. Subsequent studies suggested that, even if the demands of climate activists were met, it would take decades to measure any discernible effects.
But Manjoo is a clever pundit who can parlay his self-defeating politics into pleasing rationalizations:
The 2019 count ends on February 18.
If a restaurant already has more than enough cooks, why hire another cook? If a car dealership is already overflowing with cars, why buy another car? If a construction site already has more than enough day laborers, why hire another day laborer? If a far-left news organization already has a massive pile of Never Trump voices, why hire John Kasich?
In a statement on Facebook, local government official said camels and other feral – which essentially means wild, undomesticated animals – are searching for water. But camels are the primary targets of the cull. Government leaders held a board meeting on Dec. 11 to discuss the animals, and the cull was approved for Wednesday. It will last five days.
Climate and environmental rules have been perhaps the biggest target of Trump's deregulatory agenda. Since taking office, the industry-friendly administration has scrapped, weakened or proposed rolling back nearly 100 environmental rules and regulations, according to a New York Times analysis.
pushes for $2,000 direct stimulus payments.
The changes would mean that communities would have less control over some projects built in their neighborhoods. Environmental groups, tribal activists and others have used the law to delay or block a slew of infrastructure, mining, logging and drilling projects since it was signed by President Richard Nixon in 1970.
Lana Del Rey told BBC1 Radio that the Trump administration needed to happen in order to reveal the true problems with the world.
And what do Golden Globes, that ridiculous awards ceremony, tell us about the next election, if anything? Stay tuned.
The report calculates two scenarios depicting significant warming this century. The first scenario falls in line with the Paris Climate Agreement's goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to keep the average global temperature from rising no more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. The second scenario assumes no change in emissions and projects warming that could severely affect ocean ecosystems and sea levels.
To help identify the birds, participants can use an app from the Cornell Lab called Merlin Bird ID, which takes information such as the bird's size, color, and location to pinpoint the exact species. Online, participants can submit their counts and see results from others in real-time.

This exemption was designed as a mechanism to ram through socialist policies like the Green New Deal and other ideas aimed at hurting American workers, families, and farmers, he added.
BAIER: Yeah, Juan, you know, you heard Senator Loeffler not really answer
Some likely trends give cause for optimism — signs of progress in solving the world's problems. Other trends are pessimistic — threats and challenges that are expected to worsen in the year ahead.
In television ads, Democrats doubled down on a corruption argument against GOP Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue that the party largely avoided making against President Donald Trump. And the return of coronavirus relief to the news helped the party develop a sharper, more specific economic message focused on winning larger relief checks for voters.
Just at a time when people are finally waking up to the dangers of the CCP, after a year in which the whole world has suffered a global pandemic caused, at least in part, by the CCP's mendacity and repression, and at a time when increasingly experts are accusing the CCP of committing genocide against the Uyghurs, now is not the time to be doing such deals, especially without any human rights safeguards in them, Rogers said.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And Nancy Pelosi, of course, is in Puerto Rico. So it's not like, you know, she's here right now talking to the president either. So I guess, you know, this leaves him taking his case to the American people. He tried to do that when he actually went and gave an address in the Oval Office. Did that move the needle?
Yet it seems a fair guess that most people remain hazy on what the Green Climate Fund actually is — not the least because the GCF is so green in the other sense of that word: It's only just getting off the ground.
But Schumer has long operated as a moderate Democrat while trying to stay ahead of the progressive political winds within his own party in New York and the nation.
This split, of course, is not new. In 1959, the British physicist and novelist C.P. Snow, in his Rede Lecture at Cambridge University, called our attention to the Two Cultures divide — the growing gap between the sciences and the humanities that, he believed, threatened the health of academia:

MARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like you're saying you would be open to more border funding if it were spent in a different way, could you get to that five-billion-dollar number?
I think the downside to us facing just how colossal of a challenge this is, is it can feel paralyzing, Buttigieg said. But we can rise to meet this and be proud of it. That's part of what my climate plan is about. It's not only about all of the things we've got to do technologically and with regulation and so on. It's about summoning the energies of this country to do something unbelievably hard.
In a separate development, the state's top law enforcement official, Attorney General Xavier Becerra, said in a court filing in late December that PG&E could face criminal charges up to murder if it's found liable in any of the recent deadly California wildfires.
Angie Thomas captivated young adult readers with The Hate U Give, her novel about a Black teen, Starr Carter, who must decide whether to speak out after witnessing her best friend getting shot and killed by police. Now Thomas is back with a prequel of sorts about Starr's father, Maverick Carter, a gang member who tries to go straight after he becomes a father for the first time. Like its predecessor, Concrete Rose poses moral questions as it forces its teenage protagonist to decide what kind of adult to become.
There are estimates that up to 30% of koalas (as many as 8,400 koalas) may have perished during fires on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, Blanch said. This is a devastating blow for a species already in decline due to ongoing excessive tree-clearing for agricultural and urban development, and pushes the species closer to becoming an endangered species.
CARLSON: It just shows you what political leaders can do the damage they can wreak. I mean, all of our attention is on the national stage. But here you have just a Mayor, just as Mayor of a city, causing remarkable damage to people.

Project Hail Mary, by Andy Weir (May)
You need to have a very healthy media ecosystem in order to support a functioning democracy, and I look at everything we do as how do we find the actual crux of some of the problems rather than putting Band-Aids on them after they develop, Murdoch said.
Still, there are conflicts up ahead.
Emanuel noted that the public remained a huge buyer of bonds and a steady seller of equities over the latter half of the last decade as money-market balances rose to levels seen only during the worst days of the 2007-09 financial crisis (see charts below).
It's incredibly rare, says Ben Potter, an archaeologist at the University of Alaska who is among the researchers on the project, at a site called Upward Sun River in central Alaska. We only have a handful of human remains that are this old in the entire Western Hemisphere. The findings were published Wednesday by the journal Nature.

REPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: It's absolutely premature. This is way too early to be talking about this. We need to let the investigation run its course. And I just think that it's-- it's also something that can be used as a partisan lightning rod that we need to try to avoid.
The commission declined further comment for this story. A spokesman said only that state regulators are looking at a range of options for the utility.
We only ask how we pay for it on issues of housing, health care, and education, Ocasio-Cortez said. How do we pay for it? With the same exact mechanisms that we pay for military increases for this Space Force, for all of these ambitious policies.
Natural climate drivers in Australia, such as El Niño ocean conditions, were neutral, and there were cooler-than-average waters to Australia's west and warmer-than-average waters to the east of Africa during the year.
But the anxiety can manifest in subtler ways as well. Sarah Niles, an 18-year-old from Alabama, told me that her fears about climate change have simply become a part of her life. I feel like in my peer group, you just go right from talking about polar bears dying to 'Did you see what Maya posted on Snapchat?' Nobody has a filter to adjust, Niles says. It's like, the ice caps are melting and my hypothetical children will never see them, but also I have a calculus test tomorrow.
Beyond the incoherence is the horrifying realization that Trump endorsed the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, an action regarded for decades as inimical to interests of the United States and the Free World. (You'll recall for 45 years we opposed the invasion of independent states by an expansionist Communist dictatorship.) Former ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul reacted with horror, as any informed public figure likely would:
We need to convince Bernie Sanders to run. He isn't in this race yet, Brezler said.

McConnell has made it clear he thinks government shutdowns are stupid. There's no education in the second kick of a mule, he told reporters. But he also has been loath to take on Trump.
With sustained winds of 185 miles per hour, gusts above 200, and a storm surge well over 20 feet in some spots,Dorian wreaked unimaginable havoc on the Bahamian islands known as the Abacos.
In the end, reiterated his call for new border technology and $5.7 billion for a physical border barrier, and sought compromise: To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife, whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken? Trump asked.
Climate change is real and it's impacting our city right now, said Walsh. We just can't back down from the threat regardless of what's happening in Washington, D.C. I would love to have a strong federal partner. We don't have that right now. But that doesn't mean we stop.
Amid the outcry over his selection as Oscars host, Hart, 39, apologized to the LGBTQ community and stepped down from the hosting gig. He is now evaluating retaking the job after Ellen DeGeneres told him she reached out to the Academy on his behalf and they said they wanted him to host.
New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand announced she is forming an exploratory committee to run for president, throwing her hat in the ring for the Democratic nomination in an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert that aired Tuesday night.
The shock troops of the Green New Deal are known as the Sunrise Movement, which sounds like a new thing but it's not. It's simply a repurposed version of an old, failed campaign of 350.org's – the college divestment network.
Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen, Mr. Trump wrote. Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money!

Not necessarily. A number of these titles cost $200 million or more to make. Studios can earn that back fast in theaters if a movie does well. On streaming only? Not so much. While studios often take upward of 60 percent of theatrical ticket sales in the United States, streaming dollars can be measured only in subscribers acquired or retained — and, given that one title rarely compels a subscription, sometimes not even that. Most studios would rather relax and recoup than rush and lose.
The Union of Concerned Scientists estimated that the industry underreported its antibiotic use by at least 40 percent.
Legal experts said Barrett's father, who now works as a Catholic deacon in Louisiana, could be called for deposition as part of the case.
But more recently another liberal position has emerged, and it shows what the Federalists have achieved. This position might be summed up as: If you can't beat them, join them — methodologically, at least. A number of liberal scholars have applied themselves to the task of showing how, in fact, originalist approaches can yield progressive results. As this train of thought has flowed out of the academy, liberal originalist logic is, more and more, showing up in legal briefs and even in Supreme Court dissents. Advocates of all stripes know they must be ready with textualist arguments because, thanks in large part to the work of the Federalists, it's more likely than ever that the judge deciding a case will want to hear that perspective.
Apparently responding to Pelosi's widely reported comment that a wall would be immoral, Trump remarked: Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences and gates around their homes? They don't build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside.

Climate change protests seemed to intensify in the fall with thousands skipping school during September's climate strike. Activist Greta Thunberg also appeared at a United Nations meeting where she vehemently denounced politicians for inaction on climate change.
Hancock County: A huge component of a new rocket system was wheeled slowly from a New Orleans spacecraft factory on Wednesday to a barge that will float it up the Mississippi River for testing. The recently completed core stage of NASA's Space Launch System, which dwarfed the hundreds of NASA and Boeing employees, was to be taken to the Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, about 50 miles northeast of New Orleans. Space Launch System rockets are expected to take astronauts to the moon as part of NASA's Artemis program. The core stage – which measures 212 feet from end to end and more than 27 feet in diameter – was transported like a giant Carnival float from the Michoud Assembly Center in eastern New Orleans to the barge as workers took pictures. It will undergo tests at Stennis ahead of the first Artemis launch, planned for 2021, said Tony Castilleja, a systems engineer with the Boeing Space Team. The SLS core stage, with four huge engines, is the largest rocket stage NASA has assembled since the Apollo stages that first powered crewed missions to the Moon. It will be used for Artemis I, a test-flight without a crew. Artemis II is to send up a crewed spacecraft. The third mission, Artemis III, would put a man and woman on the south pole of the moon, with an eye toward a continued presence that would lead to a trip to Mars.
In a letter to the commission, the Natural Resources Defense Council said that recent scientific evidence has shown that PCBs are far more toxic than scientists or environmental agencies realized even 15 years ago.
Locusts are similar to grasshoppers, but differ in that they have the ability to change their behavior and can migrate over large distances. The swarms over the Horn of Africa are made up of desert locusts, which are known for forming swarms that can be highly dense and mobile, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization desert locust information center.

I'm the youngest member of House leadership. And I have a responsibility to every member of the freshman class to represent their needs and their concerns. So my role is a little different in that way from the role of the progressives in the caucus who don't have those responsibilities.
In a 2012 episode of Fort Apache, Iglesias defended working for the theocratic regime in Tehran, saying: Who has been one of the fundamental allies of Hugo Chavez? Iran, which has contracted me on television, too – a state that murders communists, where women have to wear burqas, but politics is like this. Some people have to work for Coca-Cola or Walmart.
Both new and old members have lots of personal ambitions that will diverge from the good of your party and your hopes for full restoration in 2020. You have Democratic socialists on the left who, like the Tea Party in 2011, want to show maximum resistance. But you also have moderates in vulnerable seats who will want to take no chances.
Bush signed several major laws passed by Democrats, led by Pelosi and Reid, including energy, tax and foreign-aid bills, and in the final months of his presidency, the leaders worked closely together to address an epochal financial crisis.
Yes. They have an endless supply of money. But we have something they don't have. And that is that when millions of working families stand together, demanding fundamental changes in our financial system, we have the power to bring about that change.

Then, on the same day that marches had been held worldwide protesting his skeptical views on climate change and seeking great investments in protecting the climate, Trump informed that crowd that he would be making a big decision about the Paris Climate Agreement in the next two weeks.
Now, pallets of cash were delivered in the dark of night to the Iranian regime. Now, one of the most disgusting acts of American capitulation, I can recall in my lifetime. Remember also the Iran nuclear deal itself was full of holes, but Secretary of State John Kerry, he insisted it was the best we could do and thought Iran's signing on to that agreement would be a stabilizing process.
If we can recognize him in those faces, we will be the ones to thank him for having been able to meet, love and serve him in them, he said.
We are stuck in ideological debates of the '60s and '70s. We have no strategy for the future. Both sides seem satisfied with winning the next election while sacrificing the century.
Polarization has also made mainstream American culture hospitable to ideas once relegated to the margins. Voters have grown more tolerant of political leaders' failings as long as they adhere to the correct ideological positions, opening a space for someone like Trump to win the presidency and then govern with the support of a minority of the electorate. And grass-roots opinion has shifted in favor of conspiracy theories, a pattern that both follows the cues of political leaders and incentivizes those leaders' abasements. For instance, Twitter equips Trump to instantaneously air any theory, no matter how nutty, to raucous and affirming plaudits. Fox News also capitalizes on this shift to amplify Trumpian claims (Russia didn't hack our democracy, Fox host Tucker Carlson recently parroted). It's no wonder that, as Gallup found last February, 30 percent of Republicans see Russia in a favorable light. One recent Post survey of attitudes toward 2016 election conspiracy theories found that 26 percent of Americans believed that CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, invented a story of Russian election meddling in order to hide Ukraine's efforts to help Hillary Clinton.
And even in cities where violent crime hasn't surged, locals are dealing instead with property crimes and quality of life offenses, which are significant, in some places, severe.
This isn't the first time Sherman has introduced articles of impeachment against Trump. But when he did so in 2017, Republicans controlled the House.
SAGAL: Although the melting ice sculpture of the planet did hold its own in many fine points of debate. All right, last chance - if you get this, you win it. A local news reporter in California went viral when he knocked over the carving of the ice sculptor he was interviewing on live TV at the state fair. But there was another twist to the story. What was it - A, the reporter had faked the accident because he was bored of doing stupid human interest stories all the time; B, he was carried away by rage when he realized the ice sculpture was of his ex; or, C, the ice sculpture was his childhood enemy, and he had planned this vengeance for decades.

But other studies suggest governments should focus first on transitioning electricity production to zero-carbon sources that could make direct air capture cheaper and less likely to add carbon pollution.
But conservative leaders more typically embraced the passion and support of the Birchers at the grass roots. At its 1964 national convention, the GOP rejected a plank condemning the society, along with its conspiratorial beliefs. Birchers such as John Rousselot and John Schmitz served in Congress as Republicans in good standing, while conservative oilman and family patriarch Fred Koch was a founding member of the society. Birchers took active part in Republican election campaigns and ran right-wing bookstores packed with conspiratorial treatises such as John Stormer's None Dare Call It Treason (about Soviet infiltration of American government) and Fred Schwarz's You Can Trust the Communists (to Be Communists). They served as members of local school boards and state legislatures. Other Republicans rarely spoke up to debunk the Birch view that fluoride in drinking water was part of a communist plot to cause cancer or control Americans' minds.
I don't know. A lot of people don't fully recognize it. Is that why there has not been a majority of White people who have elected a Democrat since LBJ. And that's a troubling pattern. And if that doesn't change, I don't know. It's just going to be a real test of democracy in the next 25 years. But if we want to hold onto democracy. I think the way we do that is through coalition building, because without that, you get Trump [as president].
We're launching the Road to a Green New Deal Tour to activate the millions of Americans who are ready to fight for a Green New Deal but haven't heard of it yet, Varshini Prakash, co-founder of Sunrise Movement, said by email.

The state just emerged from a five-year drought emergency, which Gov. Jerry Brown declared officially over in April of 2017. The long drought period, which experts say is among the extreme weather patterns exacerbated by climate change, made the land especially fire-prone. Not surprisingly, 2017 saw the largest and deadliest wildfires in California's history.
But Biden and the myriad Obama-era veterans in his administration also have grander ambitions, beyond setting the clock back to 2016: He says he aims to counter the global tide of rising authoritarianism. His aides have floated new geopolitical groupings that would prioritize human rights and liberal values, an alliance of democracies that could serve as a counterweight to autocrats and elected illiberal strongmen. Biden also says he'll put the world's kleptocrats on notice and bring greater transparency to the global financial system. Targeting corruption and illicit tax havens, the thinking goes, would chip away at the inequities that fuel nationalist populism.
Pew, which describes itself as a nonpartisan fact tank that does not take positions on policy decisions, tested the international popularity of four other world leaders in its survey: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Because the cold front is still making its way through the area of most intense fire activity, the hottest part of the day came and went with little to no relief. This allowed temperatures to soar to what appears to be a record-high temperature for Sydney, with Penrith, located in the far western reaches of the metropolitan area, hitting 120 degrees (48.9 Celsius). In addition, Canberra, the nation's capital, hit a record high of 110 degrees (43.6 Celsius), breaking the previous record of 109 degrees set in 1939.

LIASSON: It seems that he's saying, I will do it if I can't get a deal. But the waffling around this is happening because some of his advisers say it's not a good idea. It's going to be tied up in the courts. The Republicans in Congress are split on this. Some Republicans say it would usurp Congress's power of the purse. Others say it's a terrible precedent because a future Democratic president could declare a state of emergency around gun safety or health care or climate change.

In a twist, a right-wing commentator seemingly alluded to Sanders' words on Tuesday. Erick Erickson, a vocal conservative critic of Trump, suggested on Twitter that, if GOP lawmakers cave to the president's border demands, it is only a matter of time before a progressive President declares climate change a national emergency and uses eminent domain to shutter coal plants, etc.

Indianapolis:Family members of Hoosier bank robber John Dillinger have dropped their lawsuit seeking rights to open his grave at Crown Hill Cemetery. The lawsuit, filed in August by Dillinger nephew Michael C. Thompson, was initially dismissed without prejudice by Marion County Superior Court Judge Timothy Oakes on Dec. 4, but Thompson was granted an extension of time to file an amended complaint. That deadline would have been Jan. 15. But on Tuesday, a motion to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit was submitted to the court on Thompson's behalf. It has been granted, effectively putting the issue to rest. Since the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice, the family could revisit the issue in court. It's unknown what Thompson's plans are moving forward or how this affects the status of the proposed documentary. Attempts to reach the Thompson family and their attorney, Andrea Simmons, were unsuccessful. Crown Hill Cemetery objected to plans to exhume Dillinger's body, citing a duty to ensure the safety and integrity of the grounds and those buried there. In a written statement sent to IndyStar, cemetery management said they were pleased the matter has been resolved. Dillinger, born in Indianapolis in 1903, gained notoriety after a string of bank robberies in 1933 and several high-profile escapes from police custody. His name became legend when FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover labeled him Public Enemy No. 1, but his life of crime came to an end when police and federal agents ambushed him outside Chicago's Biograph Theater on July 22, 1934.

[Ed. note: So why is it that you think that legislative bodies advocate their powers? Voters preference for authoritarianism. Liberal democracy of our kind is messy, complicated and asks a great deal of citizens. Dictators ask much less of the governed, at least until they start the long, inevitable march toward oppression. Congress has not devolved its powers irrationally. It's hard to get re-elected if you address difficult questions. It's hard to raise money from powerful interests if you are independent and honest. Ceding issues that are likely to upset primary voters and donors to the other two branches takes the pressure off. The rise of authoritarianism logically follows. I'd submit the two are closely correlated.]

Iran now presents Donald Trump with the first real-time crisis of his presidency, illustrated in stark terms Tuesday when Iran launched ballistic missiles at two Iraqi bases hosting U.S. and Iraqi troops. And not surprisingly, he is handling it in a way that embodies all the worst elements of his management of national security issues. Unfortunately, Trump also seems to have abandoned one of the more positive aspects of his approach to foreign policy: a reluctance to get into new and unwinnable conflicts in the Middle East.
MARK LANDLER: And that's a very interesting question, because a number of the obvious candidates for the defense secretary job are actually people who went on record fairly strongly against President Trump's troop pullout. Lindsey Graham being an obvious example. Tom Cotton expressed reservations about it as well. So some of those top tier candidates don't appear to be on the same page. There are some other names that are being bandied about, but I am beginning to sense that maybe filling the defense secretary job will be a little bit like filling the chief of staff job was, which, if you recall, a lot of people turned it down, and Mick Mulvaney only agreed to do it on an acting basis. I wouldn't be surprised if Pat Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, is someone we see in that job for quite a few more months.

While reefs that bleach ― so named because once-colorful corals turn white ― aren't immediately killed, many of the creatures die in the intervening days and weeks. A mass bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016 left up to two-thirds of parts of the reef dead, and a back-to-back event in 2017 left some scientists in shock.

While Kejriwal steered clear of the BJP's virulent anti-Muslim rhetoric, he was careful to ensure his Hindu credentials were not questioned. He declared himself a devotee of Hindu god Hanuman, prayed with his wife at the Hanuman Temple in Connaught Place, and recited the Hanuman Chalisa on a television channel, ahead of the election.

Checking out a number of panels, I was impressed that, true to its claim, the Federalist Society really had invited capable liberal advocates to try to rebut conservative perspectives. People always treat me politely in these circumstances, but they always look at me in bemusement about how wrong I am, W. Neil Eggleston, former White House counsel for Obama, quipped during the session on stare decisis. He cautioned the newly empowered majority on the Supreme Court against overturning landmark decisions such as Roe v. Wade just because it could with slim 5-to-4 majorities.
A challenge for Biden is that he and his campaign has spent months raising expectations for South Carolina, in part to offset losses they anticipated in states that vote earlier and are less diverse. Biden has argued that his campaign would essentially begin in South Carolina, where a win would propel him into the clutch of states that vote in March where black and Latino voters will be key.

On top of the classic new year's resolution to get healthier in January, nutrition has become increasingly top-of-mind as we fight against a pandemic ― wellness could very well be our best protection. Increase your general state of health and you increase your immunity, lower your susceptibility to disease and give your body the best chance possible to fight COVID-19.
In an interview with CBS Evening News anchor Norah O'Donnell, Senator Bernie Sanders talked about the cost of his health care plan, his relationship with former rival Hillary Clinton and the impact of the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.

Bradley thinks it's ridiculous that Sarmento has to check in with his federal counterparts, and believes that state biologists — free of federal oversight — would be better able to respond to problem bears.
The new rule would require the release of raw data from public-health studies whose findings the EPA uses in determining the danger of an air pollutant, toxic chemical or other threat. Big public-health studies that examined results from countless people, who were kept anonymous, have been instrumental in setting limits on toxic substances, including in some of the nation's most important clean-air protections.
Our first order of business will be to end the reckless Trump shutdown and reopen the government, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the incoming caucus chairman, said in an interview. Then, he said, we will turn our attention to bringing our democracy to life and returning our government to the people.
This, I believe, is the reason why so many scientists (with, of course, brave exceptions), many of them in the public media, condemn the humanities as useless — or seem not to understand why we should bother with them at all. As a consequence, many scientific ideas are presented as having conquered some of the deepest questions we have been asking for millennia, when they haven't. Point in case, the origin of the universe, something we can't truly address within the scientific framework as we know it, is often presented as solved and understood. God isn't needed. Case closed. Boom.
It is entirely possible that Justice Barrett's father could be a witness at a later point in this case, said Marco Simons, the general counsel at the environmental legal nonprofit EarthRights International. It sure creates a very problematic appearance that she is very close to the facts of this case, and in most cases that would lead a judge to recuse.

Congratulations Democrats on your first House majority since the Jersey Shore was in its first run. And now you, like Snooki, JWoww and The Situation, are back, older and perhaps a bit wiser for the experience.
I think one thing this pandemic has taught us is how much we were taking for granted before. The ability to hang out in my favorite coffee shop, take a vacation, hang out with my friends and family members. I never experienced a sense of awe and joy at doing these activities before COVID, but I hope when I return to them after the pandemic, it will be with a bit more gratitude and a bit more understanding of how cherished these joy-inducing activities really should be. I think all of us will become a bit more appreciative of the little things we didn't pay attention to before.
To Servheen, the danger seems more acute. He worries that the delay will erode public support for the Endangered Species Act and, more importantly, for the bears themselves.

In the early 21st century we, too, are headed toward some destination we cannot know, but we can at least get a handle on the direction we are moving. Will we know by the end of these conversations which way the arc of history is bending? Maybe not, but it's worth trying.
In this new study, the researchers used detailed energy and chemical production records to figure out what fraction of the VOCs from oil and natural gas are released by vehicle fuels versus other sources. They found that the decline in vehicle emissions means that – in a relative sense – nearly twice as much comes from chemical products as comes from vehicle fuel, at least in the US. Those chemicals include cleaning products, paints, fragrances and printer ink – all things found in modern homes.

Honolulu: Improvements in programs to address Hawaii's homeless population have allowed the state to fall from first to second in the national ranking of per capita homelessness, officials said. State homeless coordinator Scott Morishige informed lawmakers Tuesday that New York now holds the top position, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. Morishige presented the data to the Hawaii Homelessness Summit for both houses of the state Legislature. The summit is designed to help lawmakers evaluate the success of programs funded by the Legislature and consider other solutions to homelessness. Placements of homeless people into permanent housing in Hawaii increased in 2018 from nearly 4,000 to more than 7,000. The state appears to have exceeded 7,000 placements again in 2019, he said. After trending upward from 2013 to 2016, Hawaii's official Point in Time count of homeless people showed a decrease over the past four years. The decrease corresponds with similar increases in housing placements over the same period and is reflected in other surveys related to homelessness, Morishige said. There has also been a nearly 40% reduction in homeless families with minor children since 2016.
At one point, the train surges through Jaman Tunnel, engulfing you in nearly 2 miles of darkness.

What reality will look like is another question. We know that at least a few movies will be coming — Warner Bros. says it will make available all 17 of its scheduled films, including Dune and In the Heights, on HBO Max, no matter how many theaters it can put them in. But that still leaves four other major studios, including every big movie from Disney, in limbo.
The USMCA was supported by the AFL-CIO, one of the largest unions in the country, as well as leading business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable. Other union groups, such as the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, opposed it. The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union also criticized the agreement for not including country-of-origin labeling intended to ensure food safety and prevent foreign companies from skirting food production standards.

EDMUNDS: Well, storms bring massive waves that - 20, 25 feet in height to the surface. And those waves bring tremendous forces underwater that drag things across the bottom and break things off the bottom and cause a tremendous amount of scarring. And so in the Virgin Islands, we're accustomed to calm, sheltered waters, sunny days and spectacular underwater visibility. And then after a storm, everything has changed. And it's a remarkable game trying to imagine what it was like on that night of the storm.
So a number of weeks ago, these posters of the prime minister, this man named Scott Morrison, began to pop up around Australia and online as a kind of meme. They said, Missing. Your country is on fire.
There are many factors that create complex trauma in Black children, teens and adults: Race-based traumatic stress has been heightened in the aftermath of the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, Mullan says, particularly by Black youth, who have taken on so much of the effort to protest their killings. Add to that the fact that Black children are often not seen as youth, but are treated as adults, (like Tamir Rice, who was just 12 when he was killed by police for playing with a toy gun in a park), their stress and need for therapy is compounded.

In fact, as CNBC noted, the new discovery will inspire $1.3 billion in investment to actually get the oil out. And that's good news for all the workers who will get jobs and overtime out of this additional economic activity; according to Zip Recruiter, energy jobs in the Gulf pay an average of $80,201 a year.

The broadcast aimed to push back against a narrative developing in the media that Sanders would have difficulty retaining his 2016 staff, as well as to pre-emptively refute questions about the diversity of his staff and surrogates in a hypothetical 2020 run. In addition to Brezler, the speakers included Nina Turner, president of Our Revolution, and RoseAnn DeMoro, former executive director of National Nurses United. The discussion also featured contributions from Roy Tatem, the former deputy director of Sanders' 2016 African-American outreach; Cori Bush, an African-American nurse and former progressive congressional candidate; and Belén Sisa, an undocumented immigrant activist and former member of Sanders' Latino outreach team.
Conducting a breakout session during World Water Week in Stockholm last year, Akvo's Bjelkeman-Pettersson demonstrated the mobile-phone-enabled water-quality tests that their lab in Bengaluru uses. One kit contains a simple strip test, say for pH or phosphates. Another consists of a collection jar and a reactant chemical that can test for fluoride — a big problem in India and Bangladesh. There, too much fluoride in the drinking water has led to mass fluorosis, a condition that leads to calcification of ligaments.

writes that if the president wants to follow through on pro-union campaign promises, there are many pro-labor things Mr. Biden can do even without Congress. Chye-Ching Huang argues that one of the best ways for the president to pay for ambitious policies and help honest taxpayers is to restore the funding the I.R.S. needs to effectively battle tax cheats.
But observers have noted a change in the senator's tune of late. He has touted Trump's golf clubs after a round with the president, lambasted the very rebukes of Trump he once leveled himself and turned increasingly critical of the Russia investigation. Last week, Graham joined Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) in a formal request to the Justice Department asking for the criminal prosecution of Christopher Steele, a former British spy whose research led to the so-called Trump dossier, claiming that Steele had lied to the FBI — a development likely to please the president.

They're set to approve a rules package on Thursday that sets a new tone for governing. For example, it requires that legislation first be considered in committees before bills are brought to the floor for votes. It bans lawmakers from serving on corporate boards.

The challenge for these subcommittees is to dig beneath the headlines of the last month and the events of the past few years because if the answer is too easy, the question probably wasn't good enough. I extend a welcome to our witnesses, and I particularly note the presence of Ford President Jacques Nasser, and the CEO of Bridgestone/Firestone, Mr. Ono. You can't write the history of the automotive industry without the names of Ford and Firestone and the advances from the Model T to the cars of the new millennium that they have been part of. The first thing that I'm looking for is assurances that every driver is being protected. Suspect tires must be replaced now. Tire manufacturers are boosting production to help fill the current shortfall, and the exchange terms for consumers should be hassle-free. The replacement program must also be fair nationwide. Vehicle owners in states with relatively low accident rates, like Ohio, have the same right to new tires as people who live in states where there have been more incidents. Experts are already at work trying to determine what caused the problem and whether it is a single cause or many. Why? is one question. When? is another. Why weren't any trends detected earlier? I find it remarkable that NHTSA did not follow up on findings made by a researcher for the nation's largest auto insurer, State Farm, all the way back in 1998. Recalls of this magnitude inevitably prompt a review of regulations and practices.
Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison dismissed her gratuitous advice, declaring he was not here to impress people overseas.
If you think of someone like Elizabeth Warren and Medicare-for-All, that got the full treatment, but Julian Castro, ever since 2012 thought that he was going to be on that stage, maybe the nominee?

Streisand accuses the Trump administration of botching its response to the deadly Chinese coronavirus and claims the president stole credit for his red hot economy from former President Barack Obama. In contrast to Streisand's assertions, Dr. Marc Siegel, professor of medicine at New York University, has said the administration has addressed earlier emerging contagion better than the previous administrations.
Trump has questioned the legitimacy of Tuesday's runoffs, describing them in a tweet Friday as illegal and invalid. Over the weekend, Trump promoted a tweet that criticized Loeffler and Perdue for not being part of an effort by a dozen GOP senators who plan to challenge the certification Wednesday of the Nov. 3 election, a mostly ceremonial recognition of Biden's victory.

With that in mind, my New Year's proposal is that we bring back cool people.

I think it would be a real burden for us in these states or congressional districts that we have to do well in, Clyburn said on ABC's This Week. If you look at how well we did the last time [in the 2018 midterm elections] and look at the congressional districts, these were not liberal or what you might call progressive districts. These were basically moderate and conservative districts that we did well in.

In December, Wheeler handed two more victories to the coal industry that paid him to lobby until mid-2017. In the first week of the month, he proposed softening a rule requiring coal-fired power plants to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. By the end of the month, he announced plans to relax a rule restricting how much mercury and other dangerous pollutants coal-fired plants can release into the air.

Scruggs, who pioneered a musical style known as the 'Scruggs style' which became integral to bluegrass, died in 2012 at age 88. The animated Doodle shows off Scruggs' fingerpicking playing style. Google's Doodle was timed to celebrate the anniversary of the 2014 opening of the Earl Scruggs Center in Shelby, N.C. The Scruggs Center is dedicated to celebrating Scuggs' life and helping to educate people about the North Carolina musical traditions that gave rise to Scruggs' talent. Scruggs' son, Gary, told Google: 'Even though my father, Earl Scruggs, passed away before the Earl Scruggs Center opened, he was involved in its planning stages. It was important for him that the Earl Scruggs Center would serve as more than a museum displaying interesting artifacts and memorabilia, but as an educational facility as well.'

Trump had criticized California for poor forest management, echoing critics who say that environmentalists have been so successful in pushing the government to restrict logging that they have inadvertently created conditions in which wildfires are likely to spread rapidly through dead trees and dense underbrush, and in which the lack of logging roads makes fighting fires harder. (Democrats prefer to blame climate change, though without evidence.)

Some federal workers have had to apply for unemployment benefits and take out loans to stay afloat; while others have had to cancel trips and scale back spending in other ways. Statistics provided by the Department of Labor showed that 4,760 federal employees filed for unemployment benefits in the last week of December, an increase of 3,831 from the 929 who applied the week before.

Helena: Urban deer culling for the fall and winter seasons was suspended by city officials amid budget cuts. The Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission recommended the city of Helena be allowed to continue culling despite budget cuts, The Helena Independent Record reported Tuesday. Former Police Chief Troy McGee made the decision to cut the program when the department was ordered to make more than $470,000 in cuts, city officials said. The program costs the city about $30,000 a year, officials said. The commission sets a quota range of up to 250 designated to maintain the population at desire levels and the city determines the exact number to cull each year within that range, officials said. This will be the first fall and winter the city has not culled deer since 2008, officials said. The city has plans to survey the deer population to determine if it will resume culling operations, Police Chief Steve Hagen said. The city has usually culled about 100 deer a year and populations have remained steady, officials said.

Then we can attribute this change in likelihood to climate change because that's the only thing that's different in these two worlds we look at.

The school currently has grades nine and 10, with plans to expand to 11th and 12th grades. The state charter school's mission is intricately tied to the state's future. A multitude of issues from the leveeing of the Mississippi River to oil and gas development have made Louisiana ground zero for coastal land loss.

MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Lulu.
Roll Call: A proposed House rules package wouldn't just reinstate the old rule that let the chamber avoid separate votes on the statutory debt ceiling 20 times in three decades starting in 1980. The new rules offered by House Democratic leaders, set for floor debate Thursday, would turbocharge the old 'Gephardt rule' into something completely new. It would allow the chamber to spin off a resolution 'suspending' the debt ceiling to the Senate, without a House vote, once the House adopts its own version of a budget resolution. That's a stark departure from the previous Gephardt rule, named for former House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., which required the House and Senate to jointly agree on the same budget resolution in order for the House to avoid what is typically a difficult vote on the debt ceiling. …Congress will have to address the debt limit later this year after a temporary suspension of borrowing authority expires March 1.

That's still a substantial bloc of voters, and in interviews with Iowa Democrats last month, The Post found plenty of them worrying that a divisive candidate could not win the presidency.

Biden has committed to embracing the Democrat Party's pro-abortion agenda that includes codifying Roe v. Wade, funding Planned Parenthood, and forcing American taxpayers to fund abortions through a repeal of the Hyde Amendment.
The largest emissions growth was in sectors that don't get much attention outside climate policy circles: Industry and buildings. The industrial sector added 55 million metric tons of carbon last year, more than four times its annual average in the past decade, because of an uptick in industrial activity. The sector is predicted to grow its gassiness and to become the leading carbon emitter in Texas within three years, according to Rhodium.
WASHINGTON -- With three devastating hurricanes, extreme wildfires, hail, flooding, tornadoes and drought, the United States tallied a record high bill last year for weather-related disasters: $306 billion. The U.S. had 16 disasters last year with damage exceeding a billion dollars each, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported Monday.
Topeka: Psychiatrists are so hard to come by in some rural parts of the state that doctors from outside its borders now commonly treat patients through video conference. Kansas, like the rest of the U.S., is seeing an increase in patients seeking mental health treatment. The state can't find enough doctors, nurses and therapists to treat them, and providers say the problem is worse in the state's least-populated rural areas. The Kansas News Service reports the High Plains Mental Health Center in northwestern Kansas has long struggled to attract psychiatrists for patients in its 20-county coverage area. Executive Director Walt Hill stopped even trying because it typically took him more than a year to fill a position. Attracting psychiatric nurses is hard, too. So Hill turned to providers who conference in from Kansas City, Missouri; Texas; and Oklahoma.
The socialist Prime Minister of Spain narrowly won a vote of confidence in parliament, allowing him to form a coalition government with Pablo Iglesias, a hard-leftist and former Iranian state television host who praised communist dictator Mao Zedong.

Once students graduate, they can pick from more than 90 lawyers chapters around the country. Kaytlin Roholt graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 2014, clerked for two federal judges, served as a special counsel to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley during the Gorsuch nomination, and now practices at Jones Day and is a member of the steering committee of the Federalist Society's D.C. chapter for young lawyers. Regardless of where I am, I know that a Federalist Society event is a place where I can go to sort of stay current in the legal issues, to continue learning while practicing, she told me. What we really try to do on the young lawyers chapter is create spaces for people to engage with these issues that they wouldn't really be able to do during their day-to-day life as a lawyer. Panel organizers try to include advocates of liberal perspectives so ideas get a good workout. Together, the student and lawyers chapters put on about 1,500 programs a year.

There's a growing concern in the scientific community and among environmental organizations that the new administration might take aim at climate change research in particular. Trump has previously called climate change a hoax created by China to hurt the U.S. economy, though he later said he had an open mind on the issue. In the weeks before his inauguration, groups of scientists rushed to copy and preserve federal public climate data out of fear that it would be purged.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So has the administration been slow in its response?
If we wanted to do BECCS in a way that would not risk blowing past key planetary boundaries, we could, but the resulting carbon storage would be far smaller — less than 0.1 billion tons per year, the research found. But then, that wouldn't make a major dent in the climate problem.

We can add that today, renewable fuels account for less than 13 percent of our energy consumption. And most of our renewable energy, by the way, is hydropower, and the greens are increasingly hostile to dams as well. And so if we look at the two forms of energy that the greens truly approve of, namely, solar and wind, well, those two sources account for only about three percent of U.S. energy.

That report was released by President Donald Trump's administration on the Friday after Thanksgiving and Trump immediately declared that he did not believe it, exacerbating concerns about inaction. Trump and his cabinet's climate-change skepticism and aggressive scaling back of environmental protections introduced by his predecessor have dismayed activists, already disappointed by his decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate pact.

Spokane: The city is planning to write off hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid utility bills dating back two decades as it looks to upgrade its payment software. The proposal would forgive more than $450,000 in payments and late fees accrued by 174 ratepayers during the years 1999 to 2013. The Spokesman-Review reports a city official says those payments would be legally difficult to recoup. Nonpayment of utilities, including charges for trash collection, sewer and water services, can result in late fees, liens placed on a property and termination of service. But the debt that is being considered for forgiveness may have been incurred by businesses no longer located in the area or residents who died or moved away. Spokane City Councilwoman Candace Mumm says she wants to make sure city officials have done everything to secure payment before writing the debts off.

There has been a lot of research about the impacts of climate change on different natural and human systems, but relatively little of that has focused on generating hard numbers quantifying the financial costs of those impacts, Diffenbaugh said. This study provides those numbers for flooding, which is one of the most costly natural disasters.

In certain respects, Crazy Rich Asians certainly does commit cultural appropriation, and we must be prepared to acknowledge that.

Cultural appropriation and cultural celebration, despite popular opinion, are not mutually exclusive.

But then we did a speedy withdrawal, which I believe was motivated by politics, and then we had to go right back in. We cannot afford to do the same thing in Afghanistan, but we also have to come to the realization that the only way in which we will stabilize that country is with some type of political reconciliation with the Taliban and it's our responsibility, as the part of an international coalition--

Anchorage: Alaska experienced its warmest year on record, according to federal climate officials.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in its U.S. Climate report said Alaska had a statewide average temperature of 32.2 degrees, 6.2 degrees above the long-term average. It also surpassed the previous record statewide average temperature of 31.9 set in 2016, the agency said. Four of the last six years in Alaska have been record warm years, NOAA said. Ten cities experienced their warmest years ever, including Anchorage, Fairbanks, Utqiagvik, Kotzebue, King Salmon, Bethel, Northway, McGrath, Kodiak and Cold Bay. Alaska set the record despite a December that featured temperatures closer to average, NOAA said. NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information compiled the annual summary. Among the other highlights was rainfall in other states. The contiguous 48 states experienced the second-wettest year on record with 34.78 inches, just 0.18 inches less than the total for the wettest year set in 1973.

The pay as you go rule, commonly known as PAYGO, requires that any increase in entitlement spending be offset by cuts in other entitlement programs, or by new revenue raisers, in order to prevent the deficit from increasing. The deficit jumped by 17 percent in 2018, after the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul passed in 2017. While managing a yawning deficit may be a priority for presumed incoming House speaker Nancy Pelosi, it angers progressives who oppose cutting some entitlement spending in order to increase funding for other programs.

He pointed out that the sections of the law in which the president would have to rely, say the president can declare an emergency that, quote, requires the use of armed force, he can do military construction projects that are necessary to support that use of armed force. That seems to me to not apply in this situation.

It would be particularly important if the world misses its targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In that scenario, greenhouse gases concentrations would pass the maximum levels climatologists say could avoid bringing about extreme consequences of climate change, and hitting the targets would require negative emissions technologies that lower concentrations.

And all of the bells and whistles that make açai bowls so 'Grammable? The granola, peanut butter, Nutella, nuts, additional fruits, shredded coconut, honey, and a whole extra banana on top of a banana base are all sugar, fat, and other calorie bombs, making the bowls by no means a health or diet food.

But the biggest point to draw from this past year is that solidarity actually matters. We've lived, since President Ronald Reagan, in an era of anti-solidarity: Government is the problem; market forces solve all problems. Reagan's big laugh line was always, The nine scariest words in the English language are 'I'm from the government and I'm here to help.'
Democrats are eager to move forward in the House on multiple fronts.
Bernanke's victory was bad enough, but the other finalists were even worse. He was up against — I'm not kidding: Usain Bolt (he runs faster than most people); Gen. Stanley McCrystal (who was ignored by Barack Obama); Nancy Pelosi; Steve Jobs and — my favorite finalist — the Chinese worker. Which one? The one that dipped our toys in lead paint or the one that poisoned our dog food?

Progressive activists and experts are calling on President-elect Joe Biden to expand his policy ambitions after two Democratic Senate victories in Georgia on Tuesday.
Today, Barnett is a professor of constitutional law at Georgetown and an influential voice in the legal wars over the Affordable Care Act, medical marijuana and the like. But his first encounter with the Federalist Society came in 1986, two academic postings ago, when he was a relatively junior professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law. A student invited him to speak on a panel at one of the early Federalist Society national student symposiums. Barnett was reluctant because he thought his perspective would be unwelcome, and anyway, he taught contracts, not the Constitution. But he was ambitious enough to want to rub shoulders with the legal celebrities who would also be invited. So he said yes.
Moreover, the majority of Europeans believe that the influx of immigrants into their respective countries will increase both the crime rate and the threat of terrorism.

In the meantime, as we spend so much of our time indoors, it makes sense to try to limit our personal exposure to these VOCs. There are several things we can do, such as choosing fragrance-free cleaning products and keeping our use of scented candles and air fresheners to a minimum. Research from NASA has also shown that growing house plants like weeping figs and spider plants can help to remove some of the VOCs from indoor air.
But Warren wasn't worried about the competition, saying I think this is great.

Now that the UK has left the EU, it must play a leadership role among democracies in championing human rights and countering the dismantling of freedom in Hong Kong, the genocide of the Uyghurs and the intense repression of religious believers, civil society, lawyers, bloggers, citizen journalists, whistleblowers, and dissidents in China, Rogers said.
And Mercer has made clear he's not afraid to strike out in an independent direction if GOP leaders pursues goals he disagrees with.
Some of his biggest weaknesses, moreover, are with independents and voters in the Midwestern states that elected him in 2016. In Michigan, Democrats just won the aggregate vote for the U.S. House of Representatives by seven percentage points and the governorship by nearly 10 points. They took three of four House seats in Iowa, a state that swung heavily to Trump in 2016.

A trash can graveyard stretches across a five-acre lot in Visalia, the result of the Central Valley city's decision to switch to a three-can system last year. But the city hasn't known what to do with the 30,000 plastic bins rendered useless by the switchover. It was contemplating grinding them up and sending them to the dump — at a cost of more than $300,000.
The Trump administration's expectation is that you will devote yourselves to preparing articles of impeachment against the president, hoping that you will replicate the deadly overreach of the Gingrich-era House GOP. The other expectation is that you will beleaguer the administration with investigations, hearings and general legislative harassment.
Sioux Falls:Police are investigating after an injured man was dropped off at a hospital in a plastic tub. The 18-year-old Sioux Falls man was dropped off at an emergency room Tuesday afternoon, police spokesman Sam Clemens said. The driver left after dropping the man off at the hospital. The victim suffered life-threatening injuries, including skull injuries. Clemens did not know how the man was injured. Police were able to identify the man who dropped off the victim at the hospital through the victim's family members, along with other people who might be involved, he said. We have a lot more questions than answers, Clemens said. The investigation is ongoing, the Argus Leader reported

Even though Bernie has not announced yet, the opposition certainly has, said DeMoro, one of the only national labor union leaders to back Sanders in 2016. They're not trying to take Bernie out; they're trying to take the movement out.
Climate change and abortion are not identical, he said. There are some people, including some bishops, who would like to think that they are, but they're not.
In March, Sanders' campaign became the first to announce it would provide carbon offsets, donations to environmental groups meant to mitigate the environmental effects of extra emissions. Since then, it had spent about $9,000 on them through September. And during his primary challenge to Hillary Clinton in 2016, Sanders paid around $14,000 for such offsets.

One of the challenges of negotiating with President Trump, as Lindsey Graham knows better than anyone else, is I feel like I've signed up for the Trump of the day club. I don't know what position we're going to get on a negotiation from day one to day two. It was Senator Graham who famously talked about Tuesday Trump and Thursday Trump when he and Senator Durbin brought a comprehensive resolution, a bill, to President Trump last year, he embraced on Tuesday and then walked away and announced it on Thursday.
Between 2005 and 2017, CO2 emissions in the U.S. fell by about 14 percent. Administration officials have touted these declines to explain their push to boost fossil fuels, as well as to defend the president's decision last year to withdraw the U.S. from the historic Paris accord on combating climate change.
Joe Biden voted and helped lead the effort for the war in Iraq – the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country, Sanders said in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday night.

He remained consistent with those criticisms Thursday.
But today's politicians face an obstacle that the class of '74 could mostly ignore: the enormous cost of campaigns. Republican members fell out of touch with their districts in part because they were increasingly dependent on a few large national donors, operating through super PACs and political nonprofits such as the Congressional Leadership Fund, which get the bulk of their donations from billionaires in Las Vegas, New York, Texas and Florida. Democrats, too, relied on these outside groups and their own billionaires, but 2018 brought an enormous wave of small donors. And while much of that came from fired-up progressives in solid Democratic districts, even in the highest-profile races, a surprising share came from the candidates' own constituents — for example, more than 54 percent of Beto O'Rourke's contributions came from Texans. A majority of Democratic challengers also refused corporate PAC money, which often runs through Washington lobbyists.
On top of all that, implementing all of these policies could cost trillions upon trillions of dollars.
To someone who loves this country, it is almost inconceivable that Georgia voters have elected to send Raphael Warnock to the United States Senate. Democrat Warnock, a Black preacher who has thundered from the pulpit that America must repent for its worship of whiteness, has edged out Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler to win one of two Senate seats up for grabs in run-off elections. The other race, between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican incumbent Sen. David Perdue, is as yet too close to call.

Today, Israel's ambassador to the UN says of you that you're not welcome in that country and Anyone who calls our prime minister a racist is either a liar, an ignorant fool or both. Do you see a political cost in taking on the pro-Israel lobby in this way?

George Conway's Federalist Society pedigree is impeccable. He has been a member since 1984 — two years after the founding symposium — and he serves on the society's board of visitors. But he has also publicly criticized his wife's boss's actions on occasion. And he shook the conservative legal establishment when, just before the convention, he and a group of conservative and libertarian lawyers announced the formation of a group called Checks and Balances because, they said, Trump threatens the rule of law. George Conway had even told the New York Times that there's a perception out there that conservative lawyers have essentially sold their souls for judges and regulatory reform.

Years ago, her dad came to a meeting with her and never came back again.
Ocasio-Cortez's efforts on Capitol Hill have so far met with mixed reactions from even liberal lawmakers. Her request to establish a committee specifically focused on developing and advancing a Green New Deal mostly fell flat with Democratic leadership, which has instead empaneled a Select Committee on the Climate Crisis to be chaired by Florida Rep. Kathy Castor.

If you want electric service, you're going to have to find a different way to structure the system because no utility will survive. That's the lesson here, he said.
Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, compared the disruptive mood of Democratic voters this year to the right-wing tea party movement in 2010.
These more extreme precipitation events more easily overwhelm infrastructure like flood barriers and drainage, which were built for the tamer climate of the 1900s, not the souped-up climate of the 2000s. The image below shows this is also true for rivers and streams, many of which have seen an increase in streamflow since the 1980s.

Hoeven proposed taking more proactive steps to growing domestic oil production. He pointed to such legislative maneuvers like Congress' recent lifting of the U.S. ban on crude oil exports, which passed after GOP leaders struck a spending deal with Democrats that also extended renewable energy tax breaks.

Now, often these policies enjoy support from guilt-ridden Republicans who have forgotten who they represent. The year 2019 just ended and so now, we can bring some data to this conversation and fully assess the human toll of these policies.
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said in a tweet that Democrats and Republicans should work together to fight climate change, not play politics by threatening to withhold money from survivors of a deadly natural disaster.
It includes a budgetary exemption for 'measures to prevent, prepare for, or respond to economic, environmental, or public health consequences resulting from climate change.' This exemption is irresponsible since arguably it could apply to any radical, progressive, out-of-touch legislation dreamed up next by House Democrats.
STOPULOUS: She's worried about our children and our children's children and what the environment and Earth is going to be like at that point.
We might further observe that World War Two was many things—beyond, of course, the necessary and righteous defeat of fascism. World War Two was also about growing the economy; during the four years of fighting, America's GDP rose 48 percent. Of course, most of that growth went to war production, and yet even so, personal consumption rose 20 percent, as unemployment fell to one percent. Not bad.

One of the biggest dangers of running in winter, as I found out, is falling over. You can lose your footing and have an accident when roads are slick with ice or the snow covers tree roots or uneven pavement.
Staying in, staying warm, and staying engaged for short periods of time during icy interludes can have benefits. Winter hibernation is an opportunity to create some fun and relaxing experiences without having to fly all the way to Hawaii to do it. Think of it as planning a winter staycation.

Biden has set a goal of administering 100 million shots in his first 100 days. The pace of vaccination is approaching one million shots a day, but 1.8 million a day would be needed to reach widespread or herd immunity by the summer, according to a recent estimate by the American Hospital Association. Wen says the pace should be even higher — closer to three million a day.

This year, following the BJP's huge victory in the parliamentary election, even as the Modi government revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special constitutional status and the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Hindu parties in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title dispute case, the party lost Maharashtra and Jharkhand and failed to get a majority in Haryana.
I just constantly tell myself that I should be the only one to define my worth and what I'm capable of, and how I perceive myself. And that I should never source that worth from other people, especially strangers on social media. They don't know who I am, the length of my journey, who I am as a person. So why should I let their words define me? Or allow me to change how I view myself, or to think negatively about myself. I just tell myself that I know my worth, I know my capability, and that's what really drives me.

So Livia, how is everyone managing, especially the animals, being suddenly all together in this house?
Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Ahrens dismissed Gabbard's White House announcement, saying that the Hawaii Democrat has no voter base. Tulsi Gabbard has an even bigger problem than her lack of experience – it's that she has no base of support. Liberals think she's too conservative, conservatives think she's too liberal, and just about everyone thinks her coziness with Bashar al-Assad is disturbing, said Ahrens.
Together, Ocasio-Cortez's proposals would effectively eliminate fossil fuels from most of society, destroy millions of jobs and trillions of dollars of wealth, require 'upgrading' every home and business in America, create a national federal jobs-guarantee program, impose single-payer health care (costing trillions more), establish a new system of publicly owned banks, run up the national debt by countless trillions of dollars, and move the United States closer than ever to socialism, Justin Haskins, a research fellow at the Heartland Institute, wrote in an op-ed for Fox News. If we don't stop it, it will destroy our economy for a whole generation of Americans.
The episode captured the irony, and ultimately the downfall, of Buttigieg's meteoric campaign. In an age of identity and representation, Buttigieg, a married gay man, presented himself as a longtime outsider, one who understood what it meant to be shunned and who promised a politics of inclusion. But Buttigieg could never convince African Americans, a pillar of the Democratic coalition and a group for whom representation has moved to the center of public discussion, that he understood their experience or how to fight for their rights.

Biden has also highlighted his ability to withstand a barrage of attacks from Republicans, especially after some have questioned whether it was appropriate for his son Hunter to sit on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. They have thrown everything but the kitchen sink so far, Biden said in Iowa City on Monday. And I'm just gonna say it...I'm still standing and just getting stronger. Biden also ramped up his visits to Iowa in December and January while focusing more time on smaller and mid-sized communities.
My sense is that some parts of the progressive movement felt kind of unprepared by Sanders' successes in 2016 and now feel like they don't want to miss out on being part of it this time around, said Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for the left-wing group Justice Democrats, which has not endorsed in the presidential primary. There's no question that Sanders has been a huge ally of social movements and community organizations and helped them gain a platform on the national level.
This time last year we were blissfully unaware of what was bubbling underneath the surface of the thoughts in Christian churches and in the mindset of many Americans. We hoped it wasn't true, and even though there were signs over the last decade, the last four years has shown that what we had hoped were merely isolated thoughts of bigotry, racism and elitism were actually more pervasive than we thought.
Jeffrey Emerson, a spokesman for Lighthizer, said it was totally false to claim Lighthizer wanted Democrats at the event, adding: Ambassador Lighthizer is enormously pleased with the signing ceremony. The media is simply trying to distract from this huge success.

For people, corporations, and governments to take action they're going to have to have incentives, William Nordhaus, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on putting a price on carbon, wrote in a recent Yale Alumni Magazine article.
You know, the Senate demonstrated that it's not going to hold this president accountable. It is up to us in 2020. It is our only shot. And as we see this president, as he's demonstrated, interfering in criminal prosecutions, growing more and more emboldened, so much is on the line. We dare not get this wrong. And that means nominating a candidate who can challenge this president on his own terms and put together a big enough winning coalition that we can have some coattails too and make gains in the Senate.

Similar conclusions were reached by the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology, which brought together industry experts and experts from the WHO, OIE and USDA.

For Trump's political rivals, Peduto has upped the ante by tying his potential endorsement to where the candidates stand on environmental matters. He has reached out to the campaigns of former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, hoping that they back his vision for more government funding for green industries.

Last year, Hunter led an unsuccessful push to change the Liberals' delegated system so that all members could cast a vote in the contest.
The convoluted process to choose Wynne's replacement kicks off this weekend with elections to decide who will actually get to vote in the contest. It's a crucial moment for a party at its lowest standing in more than 150 years — and it could be crucial for the province, too.
These extreme events are damaging many of Venice's masterpieces, like the 900-year-old Basilica of St. Mark, known as the Church of Gold. Its marble floors were swamped on November 12, and downstairs water buried the crypt for only the second time ever. The water receded but left behind salt, which italians call the cancer because it eats away at mosaics and foundations. Pierpaolo Campostrini, who helps manage the basilica, pled for his church and his city.
The wave of legislation came as the United States became the epicenter of COVID-19, the rapidly spreading respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. By Friday, the U.S. death toll topped 1,000, with more than 100,000 confirmed cases, overwhelming hospitals and forcing doctors to publicly beg for basic medical supplies. The economic fallout exceeded even the worst expectations: 3.3 million Americans filed jobless claims this week ― topping both Goldman Sachs' 2.25 million forecast from last week and smashing the previous one-week record of 695,000 reported job losses. Yet, as experts blamed the White House's back-footed response for inflaming the crisis, the Trump administration appeared to ramp up its environmental agenda, ordering the Environmental Protection Agency's enforcement division to temporarily stop policing polluters, approving a slate of mining projects, auctioning off new drilling leases and reviving a dormant fight over auto emission standards. The efforts on both the state and federal level offered jarring real-time examples of what the author Naomi Klein dubbed the shock doctrine: the phenomenon wherein polluters and their government allies push through unpopular policy changes under the smokescreen of a public emergency. While we are all paying attention to COVID-19 and the congressional stimulus packages, state legislatures are quietly passing fossil-fuel-backed anti-protest laws, Connor Gibson, the researcher at Greenpeace USA who tipped HuffPost off to the bills' passage, said by email Friday. These laws do nothing new to protect communities.
Maryland's largest city, which has been suffering extended heat waves and coastal flooding as a result of warming that's already underway, has asked the Supreme Court to refer its lawsuit seeking damages back to a state court. Lawyers representing the oil giants named in the litigation want the high court to keep the case in federal court, where they expect to more easily fend off the allegations.
Jackson: Foul weather has postponed plans to kill nonnative mountain goats in Grand Teton National Park. Park officials closed a large area of the Teton Range to the public this week so that hunters could shoot goats by helicopter without endangering people on the ground. Park officials now say snow and poor visibility are postponing those plans. Grand Teton spokeswoman Denise Germann said another attempt could take place in late January or early February. Mountain goats aren't native to the park and biologists worry the 100 or more goats could spread disease to native bighorn sheep. The National Park Service has contracted Oregon-based Baker Aircraft to shoot goats with nonlead shotgun or rifle rounds, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reported. Wintry weather kept Baker from making it to the area, Germann said. Park officials also plan to use volunteer hunters on the ground.

Harris did win that race (barely) and is now poised for another steep and daunting climb – this time a potential quest for the Democratic presidential nomination in what might become the most diverse and seasoned field of presidential candidates in the party's history.
Yes, because for all the talk this past summer of a racial reckoning, a lot of people voted for Trump, who this year increasingly embraced rhetoric and a message that appealed to White identity. Then after he lost, he and his supporters wanted to disenfranchise Black voters, attacking the results in Detroit, Milwaukee and Philadelphia. Some have said it's a bid for minority rule.
Democrats have called for passing new voting rights legislation since the Supreme Court's 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder invalidated portions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 dealing with federal oversight of certain jurisdictions. The House passed a bill in 2019 that would have restored what the Supreme Court eliminated, but the Senate did not bring it to a vote.

The liberal media will be quick to blame President Trump, and indeed he bears some responsibility. Though he made two trips to the Peach State to stump for the GOP candidates, and just the night before the vote held an energizing rally for thousands of supporters, he also muddied the waters with ongoing charges of election fraud and by picking fights with Georgia officials.
I don't think anybody wants a handout or a preferential treatment, he continued. Although that's what we give ourselves every year.

The president is the head of the executive branch and furthermore has the power to pardon, which sort of implies the power to pick and choose who gets prosecuted and put into prison. And that's why since Watergate, we have developed a strong norm, along with a lot of procedural protections, that try to distance presidential political self-interest from the operation of the Justice Department. And broadly speaking, notwithstanding the examples Kellyanne mentioned, that had been respected.

I asked him then, in a widely shared, public letter to cease and desist, he continued.

One in four natural World Heritage sites is highly threatened by climate change, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) global assessment of 241 natural sites.
Ocasio-Cortez, the Justice Democrats, a progressive group that recruited the Bronx-born New Yorker to run, and Sunrise are now poised to throw their organizing muscle behind the ambitious suite of policy proposals, which would move the country toward 100% renewable energy through a series of economic reforms, including a jobs guarantee and heavy public investment in low or no-carbon infrastructure like light rail for commuters.
It also sends a clear message domestically: This administration is willing to make drastic, controversial cuts to fund that strong-power message. That includes slashing spending on foreign aid and the environment, as well as long-standing programs aimed at boosting the arts and humanities, as well as the fortunes of the most vulnerable Americans. The question now is how much the Republican-controlled Congress will go along with that vision.
Perhaps most shockingly, the left has willfully ignored studies like one published in 2017 in the American Journal of Psychology showing a strong connection between marijuana and future opioid use.
Mr. Ryan's statement comes as some prominent Republicans are pushing back against plans from Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and others to turn a perfunctory session on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to ratify the results of the presidential election into a venue to amplify false claims about the election that have been repeatedly debunked by courts, election officials and Mr. Trump's own Justice Department. The Trump campaign had ample opportunity to challenge election results, and those efforts failed from lack of evidence, Mr. Ryan wrote. The legal process was exhausted, and the results were decisively confirmed. The Department of Justice, too, found no basis for overturning the result. If states wish to reform their processes for future elections, that is their prerogative. But Joe Biden's victory is entirely legitimate. Among those on Sunday who condemned the plot was the No. 3 House Republican, Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who sent a message to fellow Republicans saying that objecting to Mr. Biden's win would set an exceptionally dangerous precedent, threatening to steal states' explicit constitutional responsibility for choosing the president and bestowing it instead on Congress. This is directly at odds with the Constitution's clear text and our core beliefs as Republicans, Ms. Cheney wrote. A bipartisan group of centrist lawmakers, including a number of Republican senators — Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Mitt Romney of Utah — also urged their fellow party members to stand down.
I feel the Sunrise Movement and their proposed Green New Deal is a genuinely exciting new development, Ed Maibach, a climate communications researcher at George Mason University, said by email.

In response, youth activists and a new cadre of progressive lawmakers, led largely by the Bronx's own Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), outlined an alternative. The Green New Deal, a policy framework for the kind of federal industrial policy not seen since World War II, quickly gained steam. By the time Democrats began declaring their bids for president the next year, nearly every major candidate embraced the framework, including the ultimate victor, President-elect Joe Biden.

The Momofuku Group had a five-year plan, and now we've tried to accelerate that into six months, Chang said.

Hilo: The Big Island geothermal power station that was knocked offline by a volcanic eruption hopes to produce lower-cost electricity under a new agreement with a state utility, company officials said. Puna Geothermal Venture and Hawaiian Electric Light Co. are seeking approval of an amended power purchase agreement submitted last week to the state Public Utilities Commission. Hawaiian Electric said Puna Geothermal agreed to sell electricity from its restored and enlarged facility, the state's only geothermal power plant, at a reduced price that would save a typical residential customer $7.50 to $13 a month. Puna Geothermal is working to resume normal operations after the Kilauea volcano eruption that began in May 2018 and destroyed more than 700 homes in lower Puna. Lava destroyed the company's substation and covered geothermal wells, while cutting off road access.

He didn't have a conversation with Bill Barr about the Roger Stone case. He had a conversation with the whole world. He put it, as he is want to do, on his Twitter feed, on social media. And he expresses himself, cuts at the middlemen -- I know the middlemen don't like that -- in the democratization of information where he tells everybody what he thinks it and a number of issues, including the Stone case.
Right, so they normally live at a wildlife shelter that Susie runs, which is about 30 miles inland, in the bush. Because what Susie does for a living is she rehabilitates and releases animals that have been orphaned or injured back into the wild.
Michael Bloomberg is advertising and campaigning in the Super Tuesday states, and while still trailing the top tier, Bloomberg is now marginally ahead of Buttigieg across these states. Bloomberg is helped, in part, by doing better than Buttigieg among black Democrats. No one is close to Biden among this group, but Bloomberg is the first choice of 10% of black voters and the second choice of 12%. Black voters are more likely than white voters to feel that he could handle attacks from Mr. Trump well. Both black and Hispanic Democrats are more likely than whites to see Bloomberg as fighting a lot for people like them.

Because incubation temperature of turtle eggs determines the animal's sex, a warmer nest results in more females. Increasing temperatures in Queensland's north, linked to climate change, have led to virtually no male northern green sea turtles being born. For the study, scientists caught green turtles at the Howick Group of islands where both northern and southern green turtle populations forage in the Great Barrier Reef. Using a combination of endocrinology and genetic tests, researchers identified the turtles' sex and nesting origin. Of green turtles from warmer northern nesting beaches, 99.1% of juveniles, 99.8% of subadults, and 86.8% of adults were female. Turtles from the cooler southern reef nesting beaches showed a more moderate female sex bias (65%–69% female).
I hear Vice President Biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new, Buttigieg said in Decorah on Thursday, according to CBS News Reporter Jack Turman. But history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up, is to look to the same Washington playbook and recycle the same arguments and expect that to work against a president like Donald Trump, who is new in kind.
Fort Smith: The director of the Crawford-Sebastian Community Development Council says up to $200,000 may have been stolen from the organization that provides financial assistance, housing and food to the needy. The Times Record reports that CSCBC director Marc Baker said improper invoices had been submitted for vendors that had already been paid. The newspaper said Baker last week reported anywhere from $30,000 to $200,000 of duplicate invoices since July. Fort Smith police spokesman Aric Mitchell said an investigation into Baker's allegation would likely begin Monday. Baker said he contacted the FBI because the funds include money from two federal grants, but he was referred to Fort Smith police. The agency's website says it provides services such as housing, food, utility payment assistance and dental programs to low-income residents in about a dozen western Arkansas counties.

Brattleboro: Leaders of a hospital that is a critical provider of psychiatric and addiction services in the Green Mountain State say the facility faces the possibility of sale or closure amid a disagreement with state officials over funding. Brattleboro Retreat serves more than half the people in Vermont who need psychiatric care, and it provides all of the child and adolescent psychiatric care in the state, according to its chief executive officer, Louis Josephson. Michael Smith, secretary of Vermont's Agency of Human Services, says he has rejected a request for an additional $2 million in funding from Brattleboro Retreat. That request would be in addition to a financial package valued at an estimated $16 million for new beds and a recent rate increase valued at an estimated $3.5 million per year, he said.

President Jimmy Carter did not attend in 1978 and in 1980. President Richard Nixon did not attend the dinner in 1974 and 1972.

It's not just the caucus arrangement that keeps Iowa a fluid race, it's the voters, too: just over a third of those expressing a candidate choice say they've definitely made up their minds. Sanders has the most solidly committed supporters, and this has been true in recent weeks: 48% say they've definitely made up their minds. That's higher than Biden's 27% definite supporters, which is a potential vulnerability for Biden in the final stretch. Another is that his supporters are relatively less enthusiastic than those of other top candidates; fewer than half are.

For too long progressives were ceding that constitutional ground to the right and organizations like the Federalist Society, says Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, a progressive think tank and law firm that fashions originalist arguments. When you actually look at the text and history of the entire Constitution, particularly focusing on the transformative amendments that were enacted in the wake of the Civil War, you really see an arc of progress that pushes our country toward inclusion, equality and greater democracy that tells a very different story from a lot of what the folks on the right, including the Federalist Society, would have you believe about our Constitution. The CAC has made originalist arguments in favor of same-sex marriage, affirmative action and abortion rights. Its position is that those rights are guaranteed by a textual and historical understanding of the original meaning of the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause. The CAC also is using an originalist reading of the foreign emoluments clause as it represents members of Congress who claim Trump is unconstitutionally benefiting from foreign payments.

As plant-based becomes an even more popular term, margarine ― or something like it, as margarine is allowed to have small amounts of dairy ― has been making a comeback. Mass-market brands like Country Crock and Land O'Lakes have joined the fray with their versions of vegan butter in addition to those made by burgeoning brands such as Miyoko's and Forager Project and alternative mainstays like Earth Balance and its sister brand Smart Balance. But is it butter, when the very definition of butter means it must legally be made with a minimum of 80% milkfat, as defined by the Butter Act of 1886? The answer is a firm no on that count, making plant-based butter not necessarily a health halo, but a marketing lie for sure.

The conventional wisdom on negative emissions has so far been to focus on what can be done cheaply while directing government spending toward arresting the growth of emissions by replacing fossil-fueled transport and energy production with zero-carbon alternatives. But reaching those levels of emission removals by 2050 means going through a lot of costly trial-and-error in the next few decades. And though direct air capture requires prodigious amounts of energy to work ― demanding, at the scale modeled in the study, up to 25% of the nation's electricity production ― existing sources of reliable, 24-hour power could render the technology affordable to run at present prices.
The phrase Jacksonian belongs to the foreign policy scholar Walter Russell Mead, part of a famous typology in which he divides American foreign policy tendencies into four worldviews: Hamiltonian, Wilsonian, Jacksonian and Jeffersonian. The worldviews are simplifications (intended to be suggestive and evocative, in Mead's words), and they inevitably frustrate many scholars; nonetheless, they remain a useful way of thinking about how, in our imperial era, American foreign policy tends to work.

For now, both a voluntary emissions offset program, such as that tracked and priced by S&P Global Platts, and the existing compliance-mandated cap-and-trade programs will have a shared role, said Kramarchuk. Cap-and-trade is decades old but never achieved broad adoption, in part because of fragmentation and shallow volume. California, for instance, still engages in a regional cap-and-trade program. And South Korea has taken a lead in expanding its own emissions trading.

Authorities in China also reported a suspected case of the Wuhan virus in Tibet, previously the only region to have avoided the virus . If confirmed, the spread to Tibet despite the implementation of strict checks on travelers and closing of tourist sites will renew concerns about how easily the virus is transmitted, particularly when people are asymptomatic.

Along with suing oil companies, the mayor has also announced his intention to sell off $5 billion in fossil fuel investments from city pension funds. According to officials, securities of fossil fuel companies currently make up less than three percent of New York's $189 billion pension fund, which will eventually be reduced to zero.
New Fortress Energy is seeking to build the terminal, on the Repauno plant site opposite Tinicum Island and Chester, Pa. New Fortress is led by Wes Edens, who is a co-owner of the National Basketball Association's Milwaukee Bucks and argues that natural gas is a bridge fuel to more-sustainable energy sources in the future.

Each year, monarchs in the western United States migrate from inland areas to California's coastline to spend the winter, usually between September and February.
The Green New Deal is a unifying political message that gets back to the basics of creating an economy that works for all people and protects the planet as a result. In fact, a recent poll by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and George Mason University showed that a staggering 93 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of Republicans agree with the basic components of the Green New Deal (our own poll data from earlier this year echoed those findings, showing the American public's overwhelming preference for renewables over fossil fuels). The only other thing that gets such a high level of bipartisan agreement is that Democrats and Republicans can't agree on basic facts.
On Monday, Ramshaw and Zamora are launching the 19th, the organization that grew out of all those meetings, with nearly $5 million in the bank from funders such as Craigslist founder Craig Newmark and Kathryn Murdoch, a climate change activist and philanthropist.

You do not want to act in a way that would invite charges of politicizing an investigation. And this is unprecedented. The FBI, as you said, going into a counterintelligence investigation on the premise that the president may be a pawn, a Manchurian candidate, for the Russians. But what we can say, and I -- it's contrary to what the president said in his tweet there that when you have Mueller having so many guilty pleas, so much smoke coming. Michael Cohen is not going to testify before Congress. I think there's -- there's -- there's fire wherever there's so much smoke. And right now we have smoke billowing from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. There something going on.

The Oxford scientists say their technique would be cheaper than other biofuel methods and that they hope it can be used on a transatlantic trip within three years. Aviation fuel experts outside of the experiment champion the idea but wonder whether it will be feasible at scale since it's more complicated to extract carbon dioxide from the air than from a canister, Brown writes.
While scientists disagree about what's behind the sluggish ocean current, the shift could mean bad news for the climate. The Atlantic Meridional overturning circulation [AMOC] – often called the conveyor belt of the ocean – exchanges warm water from the equator with cold water in the Arctic.

The Thomas fire burned through over 280,000 acres in Southern California in December, leaving the land scorched and flood-prone. Vegetation whose root systems might have held back the mudflow was destroyed, and the stage was set for deadly and fast-moving mudslides as Southern California was deluged with heavy rainfall.
Jacobin founder Bhaskar Sunkara, who (as noted above) was skeptical that Warren could win her state's primary, has warned that socialists can't depend on her to deliver systemic change. Sanders's politics grew out of the fading socialist movement; Warren's grew out of research into bankruptcy.
In the 1970s, Coleman became the first weathercaster on ABC's morning news program.

Omaha: Despite more than doubling releases from its reservoir system, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers still doesn't expect to eliminate all the leftover water from last year's near-record runoff that led to massive Missouri River flooding. The Corps had been discharging about twice the usual winter amount from Gavins Point Dam – the southernmost in the six-dam system. The Corps said it was raising the discharge this month to 30,000 cubic feet per second, an increase of more than 11%. Until a seasonal decrease that began in November, the amount being released had been 80,000 cubic feet per second for months, also more than twice the average. Areas along the Missouri River and its tributaries in parts of Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and Missouri were ravaged by floodwaters in the early spring. Heavy rains later in the year reflooded many areas that had been left unprotected because of levee failures. John Remus, chief of the Corps' Missouri River management, told the Omaha World-Herald the reservoir system needs to make as much space as possible in light of the National Weather Service forecast for warmer than normal weather and higher than normal runoff in January and February. The Corps normally doesn't release more during the winter because of the potential for ice jams and dams upriver, Remus told the Associated Press on Wednesday. Once the river freezes over it essentially becomes a pipe, Remus said, limiting its capacity.
But it is more than the symbolism of the New Deal that is being invoked now. It is its animating purpose: putting people back to work, in the way that FDR did for the U.S., with its crushing unemployment of the time. Back then, that meant investments in rural electrification, roads, and dams.

It hasn't been cold enough to hold the Elfstedentocht in the Netherlands since 1997. A group of enthusiasts in 1989 began holding an alternative event 750 miles away in the tiny Austrian mountain lake town of Weissensee. It's now attracting several thousand skaters, nearly all Dutch, and making for one heck of a party in a town that swells to about 6,000 for the event.
In short, it is time for a big, multitrillion-dollar economic relief package ― for the sake of American families and public health. The results of the Georgia runoff make that kind of legislation much more plausible.

14) A partially secured border is more deadly than an open or well-secured one. Previous administrations put barriers south of most cities in Arizona and California to funnel illicit traffic into areas that were easier to manage or too desolate to cross. This led to a spike in deaths since the desire of people to reach the U.S. pushes them to more remote and dangerous areas.
Paris police set up a security perimeter in the area, with bag searches, a ban on alcohol and traffic restrictions. The Interior Ministry said Sunday that the heavy security measures are needed because of a high terrorist threat and concerns about non-declared protests.
I don't think that's going to be replicable on a regular basis, but if you're Biden you look to that group as your legislative litmus test, and the GOP rump you can conceivably work with even if the Leader needs convincing.

President Trump sent a tweet Wednesday morning announcing that he has ordered the Federal Emergency Management Agency not to send funding to California to assist in the aftermath of deadly wildfires.
MARK LANDLER: Yeah. No, the President said in essence that the Soviet Union has been right to invade Afghanistan. He offered a series of reasons for that that were not factually based. He said it was an anti-terrorism move, it really wasn't. And-- and he also attributed the collapse of the Soviet Union to their misadventures in Afghanistan which is not right, it's not totally wrong but there were many other reasons for the collapse of Soviet Union. But to-- to get back to the political point you were raising, I think the troop withdrawal debate is an interesting one because it is true that he ran on withdrawing American troops from foreign conflicts. I think it's--

The state's emergency alert protocol has been under scrutiny since the October wildfire disaster in Northern California, which left more than 40 people dead.

But how much of the financial toll of disasters like these is due to climate change making things worse, and how much is due to socioeconomic factors like increased population and value of assets? This study helps to clarify this debate among many experts who work in disaster-related fields.

Nearly 10 million jobs lost during the spring still have not returned — especially in restaurants, travel and education — a higher number than at the worst point of the Great Recession. In the post-vaccine world, millions of Americans will have to find new jobs (or entirely new careers), a process that takes time. And that burden is likely to fall disproportionately on Black workers. So far, Black Americans have recovered only 53 percent of the jobs they lost, compared with 66 percent for Whites (and 69 percent for Hispanics).

I have no doubt that we will aggressively move forward to undo as many of the damaging environmental rules and executive orders as we're capable of undoing, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) told HuffPost on Wednesday.
The reality is that, unbelievably, millions of low-income Americans live in communities where there are no normal banking services. Today, if you live in a low-income community and you need to cash a check or get a loan to pay for a car repair or a medical emergency, where do you go?
We're about dignity and a tone that is respectful of the offices that we hold, and the office he holds, she added. We're not stooping to his level, no.
We're using this moment to send a message to the world, said New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer. We believe a green economy is a thriving economy.
Sanford's statements marked a break with about 250 years of North Carolina history. Since the first enslaved people were brought to the colony in about 1700, its White leaders, with exceptions during Reconstruction, endorsed an intimidating system of apartheid for African Americans.
KANDER: I don't think I ever thought about that. I think I thought about it - a piece of theater. So I guess that...
Monday was the first day of Dartmouth's Spring term. So, as I often do at this time, I started teaching my course for non-science majors called Understanding the Universe: From Atoms to the Big Bang.
CBS News: The largest concentration of cases appears to be in the colder mid-latitude areas of China and Europe — and in the United States, [like] Seattle and New York City — but not as large a number in the South. Is it possible that the virus is following colder and not warmer climates?
Consequences for ocean life can be significant even in areas where oxygen is merely low. Sea life may be stunted and immune responses impaired in such areas, resulting in poor survival rates and a decrease in healthy diversity, scientists warn.
Some of the trouble has been bipartisan ― plenty of states with Democratic governors pursued premature reopenings over the summer and have struggled with testing and now vaccinations. Some of it is the result of decades of economic non-policy that left the United States uniquely vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. But it is hard to imagine that Biden could do worse than the Trump administration's raving, dishonest incompetence.
HuffPost does not accept pitches from PR representatives or agents.
Since then, five states ― Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Rhode Island ― and a number of cities ― including New York, Baltimore and Oakland, California ― have accused those companies of breaking U.S. law by hiding the reality of climate change.
Bloomberg, whom polls show is gaining traction in his quest for the 2020 Democrat nomination, released his proposal for overhauling America's immigration and refugee laws on Monday. The plan, based on policies the mayor implemented during his tenure at the helm of New York City, is being touted as beneficial to not only the country's diversity, but also its profit margins.
ROTT: Well, so the issue is that this is the time of year where forest managers and firefighters usually do a lot of the administrative duties and preparatory work they need to for the upcoming season. And because so many - so much of the federal workforce is furloughed right now, those things aren't happening. So that's hiring for seasonal positions, contracts for aircraft that aren't getting done, contracts for heavy equipment.
Sunrise leaders, along with other progressives who have established relationships with Biden's inner circle, have praised his close aides for keeping a thick skin. The Richmond episode didn't shut the door on communications. Other criticism of his picks has been largely brushed off -- a departure from the Obama administration, which had the reputation of taking less kindly to sharp, public pushback.
WALLACE: There's been a war of words over the past week certainly between the president and former New York City --
REPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: The gravity of that word is too big and too important to just throw it around.
Let's just be honest, here. Every time he opens his mouth it's not helpful to America. It's not helpful to anything.
It's now important that we take advantage of this consensus, and fast. The 2018 midterm election should be a clear lesson for the still-forming roster of 2020 presidential contenders: What Americans crave the most is a government that works for the people, not just some of the people. Americans, first and foremost, want their basic needs met and candidates who are willing to listen to their concerns and then work to address them in Washington.
Back at the black-tie gala in Union Station — as McGahn and McConnell conclude what can only be described as a sedentary victory dance; as the four Federalist-friendly justices disperse into the night; as deputy AG Rosenstein and acting AG Whitaker linger for pictures with groups of giddy fans — I ponder: What now? Having reached this summit, what's left for the Federalist Society to conquer?
I've never bought that you play off workers against the environment because what I have seen is good environmental policy means more good jobs, Brown said on the podcast Pod Save America last month.
Van Jones was one of the early proponents of the Green New Deal concept, which he outlines in his 2008 book, The Green Collar Economy: How One Solution Can Fix Our Two Biggest Problems. An Amazon book review describes the book as a re-imagining of FDR's original New Deal that makes the government 'a partner' of the people, and sets about defining the principles of a 'smart, supportive, reliable' partnership. This also happens to be exactly what Ocasio-Cortez promises in her version of the Green New Deal. Wiki said, The book is a detailed proposal for a 'Green New Deal.' In 2009, Jones resigned from the White House under a cloud for supporting the view that President Bush was complicit in the September 11 terror attacks, and his treatise on the Green New Deal failed to get traction.
INGRAHAM: Dismiss this thing, get it on for the country's sake. Congressman, great to see you.
She saw her first painted bunting years ago in Florida, on vacation with her family. They had driven an hour and a half to see the bird from afar, but it was a bucket-list item, a bona fide lifer, as she and many other birders called it.
Such a sweeping policy would almost certainly be dead on arrival as long as Republicans control at least one chamber of Congress or the White House. Krugman noted the political realities for the left, arguing that Democrats can't enact such a plan this year but they should start preparing now, and be ready to move in two years.
WALLACE: -- of the judiciary committee which is going to hold the confirmation hearings --
But there are signs of growing support for market-driven solutions among younger conservatives. According to the Pew study, Republican Millennials are less inclined than their elders in the GOP to support increased use of fossil fuel energy sources through such methods as offshore drilling, hydraulic fracturing and coal mining. For example, 75% of Republicans in the Baby Boomer and older generations support the increased use of offshore drilling, compared with 44% of Millennial Republicans.

The hospital does have eight negative-pressure isolation rooms, but patients with serious complications would need to be sent to a larger institution, such as Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, 90 miles away, Bass said.
Examination of the trends in real-world observations revealed somewhat different results than the climate model portion of the study, but both point to a human fingerprint of varying degrees on the extreme bushfire behavior.
Castro rose to national prominence in 2012 when the then-mayor was selected to give the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention. He joined the Obama administration as the head of HUD two years later, giving him a national profile and feeding speculation that he might become the running mate of his party's 2016 presidential nominee. (Hillary Clinton ultimately chose Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia instead.)
You had [Conservative lawmaker] Michael Gove's famous soundbite that people had enough of experts, Ondrak said of the politician's statement in the run-up to UK's Brexit vote in 2016. He explained that the period set a precedent for civil discourse no longer being about a person's qualifications to speak on a matter, but far more about feelings and emotion, and the idea of truthiness -- the latter meaning that it feels like the truth and therefore I'm going to believe it.
Instead, they warmed to Warnock's alarms about police brutality and promises of criminal justice reform. Warnock hewed closely to the platform of President-elect Joe Biden, with vague promises about investing in infrastructure, investing in climate and in education; if voters wonder where the money will come from to fund these initiatives, a visit to his campaign website will not satisfy their curiosity. There is, understandably, no mention of taxes.
Because the oceans are so large and less variable than the atmosphere, it makes ocean heat content a much better gauge for the pace of global warming.
The first signal Trump has given that he may be willing to talk about the wall impasse came Tuesday, when he tweeted, Let's make a deal? He's invited Democratic and Republican congressional leaders to a White House meeting Wednesday on border security.

In accepting the gavel, Pelosi will give a nod to the new era of divided government with a pledge to reach across the aisle in this chamber and across the divisions in this great nation, according to excerpts of her prepared remarks.
Not enough dams have been built over the time that the population has grown and infrastructure has remained the same and that's why the city now finds itself in the position that it's in, she says.
The facts need not detain us here – because there aren't any. It's just speculation – could, may – gleaned from conversations with tame experts at institutions like the notoriously alarmist and fervently left-wing Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. And there's plenty more nonsense where this came from, as Thomas Williams reported here earlier.
The Democratic wins in the state are a major boost for what President-elect Joe Biden's administration can potentially accomplish in its first two years.
Eliminating the influence of corporate money in politics is another one of Ocasio-Cortez's signature issues. Most of her campaign funds came from small donations of $200 or less. She did accept some money from labor unions, but she refuses to take any contributions from corporate political action committees. She's angered some of her colleagues in the House by encouraging primary challenges of Democrats who accept corporate money or oppose progressive policies.
The Camp fire could come at a serious cost to power company PG&E. Dozens of Camp fire victims have sued the utility for its alleged role in the blaze, saying it did not properly maintain its power lines. Their lawsuit points to PG&E documents that indicated a failing transmission line was in the area where the massive blaze was believed to have started.

Our World in Data, an online publication based at Oxford University, also expects the number of people around the world with higher-education degrees to increase as advanced skills become more important in both developing and developed economies. The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis projects that this number will reach 1 billion by 2030 and 3 billion by 2100, compared with 725 million in 2015. Although the improvement isn't in every country, Green says the rise in the global average is still a striking win. — Joanne Lu

The nation's 644 billionaires have enjoyed a staggering rise in wealth since the pandemic shuttered the economy in March, with the group gaining almost $1 trillion in total net worth, according to a recent analysis. The spike in wealth coincides with what some economists are calling a K-shaped recovery, with the rich regaining their footing while poorer Americans struggle with lost wages and jobs.

It is by now an old story: James B. Comey, who as director of the FBI rebuked Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server and then announced that his office had reopened an investigation into the matter about a week before the election, was lambasted by Democrats for what many said were unconventional moves. Trump, then a candidate, praised him. It took a lot of guts. I really disagreed with him. I was not his fan, Trump said as the election neared. I tell you what, what he did, he brought back his reputation. He brought it back.

In 2020, the Space Force became the first new military branch since the Air Force was established in 1947, in part because of bipartisan support in Congress, which concluded that space — like the land, sea and air — is a warfighting domain that needs to be defended. It's here to stay, said Rep. Kendra Horn (D-Okla.), who lost her reelection bid but served on the House Armed Services Committee and as chair of a subcommittee on space. It was not about this administration — this was a long-term, thoughtful and bipartisan effort looking at the current and future needs of our national security.

The future government will have to tackle the issues the current one hasn't. It will have to at least form a view of the role Germany should play in Europe and the world. On the economic front, it will have to decide what to do about the state of the economy. There is the matter of a short-term fiscal stimulus, advocated by economists both German and foreign. But there is also the question of what type of long-term public investments the country needs to overcome the structural flaws of its economic model.
Biden has said he would rejoin the World Health Organization, which President Donald Trump began to withdraw from in July, and reestablish the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, which was eliminated by the Trump administration in 2018.

The threat is clear. Fifteen of the state's 20 largest fires have occurred since 2002. The Mendocino Complex fire, which burned more than 450,000 acres north of Santa Rosa in July, surpassed last year's Thomas fire as the largest wildfire in California's history.
As now-Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recently said in a tweet, People are starting to realize our issues aren't left and right, but top and bottom. That perfectly expresses the opportunity Democrats have in 2019, to set the stage for the 2020 race and run as a party that has real solutions to put people to work and propel our economy, and our planet, into the future.

Though no timeline was set, many people expected this would take four to five years.

The report says the changing climate poses a cascading series of linked risks, like storms destroying aging bridges and roads, which will then make it harder to move food and fuel around the country, and droughts making it harder for power plants across the West to safely generate electricity due to a lack of required cooling water.

Wellesley: A college employee who posted a controversial Facebook post about Iran bombing the U.S. was suspended Wednesday. Babson College's director of sustainability, Asheen Phansey, faced disciplinarian actions for a post he made on social media on Tuesday that suggested Iran list 52 American cultural sites that Iran could bomb, the Boston Herald reported. President Donald Trump posted on Twitter on Jan 4. that the U.S. has targeted 52 Iranian sites in reference to rising tensions between the countries. In the now-deleted post, Phansey wrote, In retaliation, Ayatollah Khomenei should tweet a list of 52 sites of beloved American cultural heritage that he would bomb. Um… Mall of America? Kardashian residence? In a statement Wednesday, the former employee said, I regret my bad attempt at humor. As an American, born and raised, I was trying to juxtapose our 'cultural sites' with ancient Iranian churches and mosques. I am completely opposed to violence and would never advocate it by anyone. I am sorry that my sloppy humor was read as a threat.

However, President Obama has commandeered this elastic doctrine of prosecutorial discretion and stretched or manipulated it beyond all recognition and reason. It has become his political Gumby toy with which he exerts his will whenever he fails to get his way with Congress.

He treats the doctrine as a magical incantation shielding his arbitrariness.

It's gotten so bad that the state department of education has had to issue emergency teacher certifications to replace teachers as quickly as possible.

Van Drew was a conservative Democrat from South Jersey who was often given a pass from party-line votes on sensitive, progressive legislation during his tenure in the state Legislature, on the grounds that those votes could harm his chances at reelection.
Enormous numbers of sub-Saharan Africans have said they would migrate immediately to Europe if they had the chance and are only held back by the seemingly insurmountable obstacles to doing so.
Many attribute the win to an upsurge of Black voters in the state's urban centers and growing suburbs, but others say Biden was helped by a depressed Republican vote led by moderates who were disgusted at Trump.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and the Senate would say--such as, me winning or losing--this is all campaign 2020 that they're gesturing towards and immigration is one of those issues that divides people. But it makes them emotional and fired up, as well. Is that actually a conversation about border security or is it a conversation about politics?
And we're going to give our elected officials a deadline. They've got to get an answer to us by Feb. 26 or face the consequences, warns Ornstein. He says activists around the country will occupy members' offices in what the group calls a nationwide day of action.

Some corals, however, are able to recover if ocean temperatures return to normal and they're given enough time to build up their health. But it usually takes 10 to 15 years for the fastest-growing species to recover, the paper states, and far longer for the full complement on a reef.

China's deal with the E.U. is both a rebuke of Trump and a sign of the challenges facing Biden. China's leader, Xi Jinping, made a video appearance on Wednesday with European leaders to approve the investment deal. Credit... Pool photo by Johanna Geron A trade pact with 14 other Asian nations. A pledge to join other countries in reducing carbon emissions to fight global warming. Now, an investment agreement with the European Union. China's leader, Xi Jinping, has in recent weeks made deals and pledges that he hopes will position his country as an indispensable global leader, even after its handling of the coronavirus and increased belligerence at home and abroad have damaged its international standing. In doing so, he has underlined how difficult it will be for President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. to forge a united front with allies against China's authoritarian policies and trade practices, a central focus of the new administration's plan to compete with Beijing and check its rising power. The image of Mr. Xi joining Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President Emmanuel Macron of France and other European leaders in a conference call on Wednesday to seal the deal with the European Union also amounted to a stinging rebuke of the Trump administration's efforts to isolate China's Communist Party state. The deals show the leverage Mr. Xi has because of the strength of the Chinese economy, which is now the fastest-growing among major nations as the world continues to struggle with the pandemic.

Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. Top White House officials and senior congressional aides will meet again today to try to find a way out of the shutdown. So far their talks have yielded nothing. Yesterday the administration stuck to its demand for 5.7 billion dollars to build a border wall. Democrats insisted the government needs to reopen while negotiations continue. With no deal in sight, trash is piling up at the nation's national parks and some eight hundred thousand federal workers won't receive paychecks until the government reopens.

And we - if we're working on a moment in a show, for instance, we'll be talking about the characters and the situation that we're about to musicalize (ph). And Fred may have an idea or a phrase, and from that phrase maybe we'll develop a rhythm.

They mean socialism, Loeffler told a crowd Saturday in Carrollton, Ga., referring to her opponent, Warnock, along with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). The Green New Deal, she added, would cost every family $75,000. (There was no cost estimate in the actual plan.)
How well is this setting up for Bernie Sanders to be the Democratic nominee?
Flipping the Senate would be huge to get votes on popular bills blocked by Mitch McConnell, Pappas tweeted. He went on to list several items including $2,000 stimulus checks, infrastructure, action related to climate change, the DREAM Act, and voting rights. America needs this, he added.
In particular he remembers the House Agriculture Committee's attempt to take on cryptocurrency. Premised on the possibility that bitcoin might fall into the same regulatory category as soybeans and corn, July's hearing opened with a panel of technologists trying to explain blockchain technology.
COONS: So, compromise and while the government is shut down, I will remind you we got 41,000 federal law enforcement officers out there today being forced to work without pay. We've got farmers all over the country not getting the relief payments for the impact on the soybean industry due to tariff war.
Much has been said about Biden and McConnell's past working relationship, but Democrats say it would be far better for their progressive agenda to get the Senate out of GOP hands.
WALLACE: It went from the 60-vote margin to 51, and then the Republicans did it for the Supreme Court.

The Midwestern former mayor has argued that it will take nominating someone from outside Washington for Democrats to win in November. He also has pushed back against criticism that he lacks the experience to be president. And in the final days before the Iowa caucuses, Buttigieg began to draw finer distinctions between himself and some of his top rivals.
Ocasio-Cortez said she will join California Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna on Thursday -- the first day of the new Congress -- to oppose the so-called pay-go rule backed by Pelosi. That rule would require that any new mandatory spending for entitlements or tax cuts be offset by other separate revenue increases (such as tax hikes) or budget-cutting measures so that the new spending does not expand the federal defecit.
But the center doesn't have any special capabilities for handling infectious diseases, local officials said. The center is used for training. It has isolation hospital rooms — located in a former Army hospital building — but they are mostly just props, with fake equipment and light switches that exist only as paint on walls.

Perdue's closing message was littered with attacks, saying in a minute-long video that if Republicans lose, undocumented immigrants will vote, Americans' private health insurance will be taken away, and Democrats will pack the Supreme Court and defund the police.

Gabbard, a native of American Samoa, was elected to the Hawaii State Legislature in 2002 at the age of 21, the youngest woman to be elected to a state legislature in U.S. history at the time. She left office in 2004 and volunteered to be deployed to Iraq. She would return in 2006, work for Hawaii Senator Daniel Akaka, then return to Iraq in 2009.
The violence of the 1898 coup in Wilmington, in which white supremacists overthrew the elected Black local leadership (described in Wilmington's Lie by David Zucchino), gave way to a system of Jim Crow segregation that disenfranchised Black people and made them second-class citizens. It was that system that four Black college students protested when they sat down at a Woolworth's counter in Greensboro in February 1960 and refused to leave until they were served, sparking a wave of sit-in protests across North Carolina and the South.
Perhaps one part of the problem is Congress-illiteracy among tech reporters.
And, if we are serious about reforming our financial system, we have got to establish a tax on Wall Street speculators. We have got to discourage reckless gambling on Wall Street and encourage productive investments in the job-creating economy.
But Rebekah's concerns about the crushing social and economic effects of pandemic restrictions took a conspiratorial turn after she read an Instagram post that she said made her question information shared by the media. She researched the matter online, churning up information that, while not supported by facts, nonetheless backed up her growing suspicions.

One afternoon in South Bend, I walked into my church, having once believed that something inside would make me forever an outsider — and walked out a married man. And in some of the most conservative counties in Iowa, and in more than 20 counties I've visited that voted for Barack Obama and then Donald Trump, I've witnessed the makings of an American majority made up of progressives, moderates, and even what I like to call future former Republicans sickened by the actions of this president, ready for something better.
And this trend exists outside of Canada, too: American men are also less likely than women to heed coronavirus-related health warnings.
In the best of times, women do twice as much unpaid care in Canada as men do, Sarosi said. This is really growing exponentially now, with the closures of schools and daycares, and caring for the elderly and sick.
While the Federalist Society may never take an official position on anything, conservative funders know who their friends are. Ever since the founding symposium at Yale in 1982 was bankrolled largely by conservative organizations, the society has enjoyed steady financial support from the right. The group raised $20 million in 2017; more than $300,000 came from interests related to conservative activist funders Charles and David Koch.

Those victories give Democrats 50 seats in the Senate, , which would effectively give them control because Vice President-elect Kamala Harris represents the tie-breaking vote.
They observe Western democracies, such as our Congress and its policy paralysis, and cheap partisan vitriol and say, no thanks. They follow Brexit and think, that's another competitor gone.
If elected, much of what he proposed, including new spending and the establishment of public utilities, would require Stringer to marshal allies in the City Council, Albany and Washington to enact new legislation. And the executive job in a city with an economy bigger than that of most countries offers a powerful bully pulpit.
In very broad strokes, the Green New Deal legislation laid out by Ocasio-Cortez and Markey sets goals for some drastic measures to cut carbon emissions across the economy, from electricity generation to transportation to agriculture. In the process, it aims to create jobs and boost the economy.

Perhaps no one better personifies the up-and-down experience of being frenemies with Trump than Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.). The two have plenty of reasons to dislike each other: Trump gave Graham's cellphone number to the world, a tactic of harassment known as doxing, when both of them were competing in the Republican presidential primary. And Graham, an early supporter of the probes into Russian collusion so loathed by the president, has offered somewhat regular criticism of Trump.

The Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act will criminalize doping conspiracies that target international sporting events and put the power of federal law enforcement behind clean athletes. Tools like subpoenas and searches and seizures will be used to hold corrupt sport administrators accountable. The act will protect whistleblowers and allow athletes to seek restitution when they are defrauded by dopers.
It was the dawn of the quants, when Wall Street was beginning to appreciate the power of computers to turbocharge trading. Mercer and Brown set to work designing complex mathematical models that made trading dramatically faster and their work eventually paid off.
The classroom is the ideal place for this conversation between the sciences and the humanities to unfold. By exposing students to the two sides of the cultural divide, we stand a chance of building bridges that will actually close the gap. Scientists should read from original sources, and humanists should grapple with scientific concepts such as relativity, quantum physics, evolution and natural selection, plate tectonics, climate change, and the expanding universe. Scientists should recognize that some research topics — AI, biotechnology, climate change, life extension, the nature and pervasiveness of faith, and many others — need to be investigated together with humanists as a joint effort; inasmuch as they impact society as a whole, they are not just scientific research projects.
The Green New Deal is a broad, nonbinding resolution put forward two years ago by Ocasio-Cortez and other liberal lawmakers to cut U.S. contributions to climate change in just 10 years. Biden and top House Democrats are instead aiming to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.
Trump returned fire, calling him Liddle Bob Corker in October and saying the senator begged for his endorsement and decided not to run for reelection only when the president declined. He later said that Corker couldn't get elected dogcatcher in Tennessee.

Germany has become increasingly tied with the communist regime, with China becoming the country's largest trading partner in 2018, with some €200 billion in trade. Merkel has argued that closer ties with China are the only way for the world to solve pressing issues, such as supposedly man-made climate change.

The standoff occurred on the territory of the Wet'suwet'en clan Unist'ot'en in northern B.C. Peaceful, unarmed opponents gathered at a checkpoint to block a bridge and stop construction. On Jan. 7, 2019, RCMP officers carrying rifles moved in and arrested 14 people to enforce a court injunction.
It is no secret that millions of Americans have become disillusioned with our political process. They don't vote. They don't believe much of what comes out of Washington. They don't think anyone is there representing their interests. In my view, one of the reasons for that deep disillusionment is the widespread understanding that our criminal justice system is broken and grossly unfair – and that we do not have equal justice under the law. The average American sees kids being arrested and sometimes even jailed for possessing marijuana or other minor crimes. But when it comes to Wall Street executives, some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in this country, whose illegal behavior caused pain and suffering for millions – somehow nothing happens to them. No police record. No jail time. No justice.
Someone's going to have to prove to me how that can be accomplished because it looks to me like for the foreseeable future we're gonna be using a substantial amount of fossil fuels, said Rep.

Wheeler took over the agency six months ago when scandal-plagued former Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned in disgrace. Close allies of Pruitt, including Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), swiftly touted Wheeler as an adequate replacement who would reliably carry out Trump's pro-fossil-fuel agenda.

Given the failed federal response to COVID-19 so far, that can only mean improvement. On public health, the record is one of unmitigated disaster. Where South Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand, Singapore and other places swiftly implemented effective measures to avert both mass death and economic calamity, the United States has been an uncoordinated and morally callous disgrace.
The Canadian Forces announced Tuesday that it was temporarily moving an unspecified number soldiers from Iraq to Kuwait due to security concerns.

Interest rates remain at or near historic lows and the Federal Reserve has a bevy of actions it can take should they rise. Inflation sits at just 1.2%, well below the Fed's target rate of above 2%.
Barnett's experience is a typical example of how different the society is from the stereotype of a traditional top-down Washington pressure group. The society itself lobbies for no policies; it never signs amicus briefs or represents clients in cases. No one at Federalist Society headquarters in Washington dictated Barnett's moves or told him how to advocate for what positions. It's just that at a few gatherings made possible by the Federalist Society that Barnett happened to attend, synapses fired, a corner of the hive mind engaged, and Barnett took it from there. Multiply that chemistry tens of thousands of times over the past 36 years and you have the Federalist Society's true source of power.

If anything, companies are outpacing governments in embracing the Paris goals -- which is exactly what the world needs. Governments regulate and incentivize, but actually cutting emissions largely falls on others to implement. Companies have to do much of that -- and society has a stake in helping them. How can we accelerate that change further and faster?
When you don't know where you're going, the old saw opines, then any road will get you there. And right now it looks as if the administration really has no idea where it's going or what it wants to achieve with Iran.

If you want to try making sense of the gobbledygook, let's start with the biggest logical inconsistency. If Afghanistan brought down the Soviet Union — and virtually no credible historian or policy expert would deny it played a part nor argue it was the sole cause — why would Russian President Vladimir Putin go back in?

A group of Bernie Sanders supporters who now call themselves Justice Democrats encouraged Ocasio-Cortez to run for office and gave her training and support. She built a grass-roots coalition that took on the Democratic machine by going door to door arguing that she could represent the district better than a ten-term incumbent who spent most of his time in Washington.
This is an area of hot debate and research among scientists and probably is a mix of human-caused climate change and natural variability, said Furtado. Climate change hasn't made the polar vortex more extreme, but it probably is making it move more, which makes the weather seem more extreme, he said.

Denver: The state is starting off 2020 with plenty of snow in the mountains. Mountain snow moisture statewide is 122% of the usual amount for this time of year, according to the Natural Resources Conservation Service. High-country snow moisture is up 30% compared to this time last year. All areas measured by the federal agency have above-average snow moisture. Early-season snows boosted snowpack in the northern part of the state. Snow has fallen in southern ranges more recently, evenly boosting snowpack levels statewide, the Denver Post reports. Light mountain snow is forecast in northern Colorado in the days ahead. Much of Colorado's mountain snow moisture accumulates in late winter and early spring.

Under the Paris accord, the U.S. sent some $1 billion to the Green Climate Fund that is guided by the U.N.

And the WFP endorsement crystalized a residual sense from the 2016 election that Sanders had not yet mollified critics in the activism community who considered him unduly articulate about and focused on questions of racial justice. His groan-inducing remarks at the She the People conference in Houston for women of color in April and his absence at the Netroots Nation conference in Philadelphia in July contributed to a sense that Sanders had missed his moment. While those activists do not directly affect votes in the early primary and caucus states, they are influential in liberal organizations and websites that help shape perceptions of candidates.
The report also pointed to a lack of experience and high turnover within the ranks of the Criminal Investigation Department, leading to problems with launching sufficient investigations.

For the first time, there is no unique donor threshold to help candidates qualify for the debate. This could benefit billionaire Mike Bloomberg who has said he would not seek donations for his presidential bid. The requirement has kept him off the debate stage in the past.

Free trade agreements include deeper provisions that go beyond trade barriers and more partners can significantly reduce the cost of trade, which, in turn, helps boost trade flows.
But on the other side, we do have those who still believe that it's integral to our identity, that the economy would collapse if we didn't have it.
But claiming the Senate majority does offer Democrats some reasonable grounds for optimism, should the clear electoral indications from Tuesday hold. For the next two years, at least, President-elect Joe Biden's party will be able to control what bills receive votes and when. Most importantly, Democrats will have much greater influence over the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic and the economic support that must go hand-in-hand with national public health efforts.

On December 20, the congresswoman spoke to The Intercept's Jeremy Scahill. On Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, she said: Well, you know, I do think that we need new leadership in the Democratic Party.

But now that President-elect Joe Biden has delivered on that central promise, there's less left to bind together the coalition that spanned from socialists who backed Bernie Sanders to suburban Republican women who once supported Mitt Romney. Keeping Democrats on the same page would help Biden enormously — if he can do it.

ED O'KEEFE: So there is, essentially, two numbers to look at on Tuesday night. There's the perception number, who wins the state? Who can say that they walked away winning the most states? But the more important number, ultimately, is the nomination number.

She did well in school, and with the help of scholarships, loans and financial aid, attended Boston University. But in her sophomore year, her father died of cancer.
Honestly, I don't really need his validation for what happened, she said. I'm not looking for him to come forward and tell the truth and honestly I expected him to do that. I think it speaks to how he's treated these allegations in the past and it used to work before but that's not the case anymore and we're being heard and our stories are taken seriously.

Happer is an intriguing and controversial figure. He was born in India when it was a British colony, the son of a Scottish military officer and an American medical missionary. His mother, with young Will in tow, spent part of World War II working as a physician at the secret Manhattan Project site in Oak Ridge, Tenn. The family later settled in North Carolina.
However, before Pelosi can achieve any of these goals, the partial government shutdown must end. President Trump is refusing to sign any legislation which does not include funding for a border wall, which Democrats in the House and Senate are unwilling to provide.

Climate change Yang's climate plan looks to set incentives for private companies and entrepreneurs to reduce emissions and contribute to renewable technology. He has applauded the vision and the ambition of the Green New Deal and called for a carbon tax; he has also stressed the importance of ending tax breaks for the fossil fuel industry. He supports building more nuclear power plants, saying on his campaign website that he wants to work to make it easier for new nuclear plants to open up in appropriate areas. Yang says that the United States should rejoin the Paris climate deal but that it doesn't go far enough in emissions reduction. See all candidates
Other species may also have tipped over the brink of extinction, he said.
Anchorage: More than two dozen tribal groups oppose a federal land-use proposal that could open large areas of wilderness to future mining in rural Alaska. The opposition is in response to a proposed Bureau of Land Management update to its resource management, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The Bering Sea-Western Interior Resource Management Plan covers 21,094 square miles in Alaska's western and interior regions. The agency announced its preferred proposal in March, known as Alternative C, which would make mining an option on nearly all the land in the plan. The proposal would increase available mining land from the current 13,594 square miles established in the 1980s.
The B.C. court recently granted another injunction against protesters and the RCMP is ready to enforce it with officers patrolling the area. The hereditary chiefs are demanding they leave.
In 1955, a milk arsenic poisoning case was linked to the deaths of more than 100 children. Soon afterward, in a separate scandal, scientists documented horrific symptoms among people who had eaten seafood in Minamata in southern Japan.

Young has been a longtime critic of Trump, even lamenting his past use of his music.
Biden supporter Richard Marsh of Cedar Falls, Iowa, cited the former vice president's foreign policy experience as one reason for his support. Marsh, who was at Biden's headquarters in Waterloo on Saturday morning, said Biden's connections with other world leaders will create more stable relations in areas such as the Middle East.
The question is whether one of Trump's final political acts will push Republicans to victory or hand control of Congress to Democrats.
He admits there are limitations. Citizen observatories are not labs, though their trainers work to put checks, balances and cross-references to keep the data as reliable as possible — and to keep the people safe.
Citizens are finally saying, 'We've had enough climate change, and we've had enough air pollution, and the last thing we want is the region to be inundated with even more bad air,'  said Matt Dixon, a Pittsburgh environmental activist.

The survey says Trump is generally more popular among those on the political right in many of the nations that were polled. Trump's popularity in Israel (70%) partly reflects his decisions to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and to withdraw from the Iran nuclear accord.

SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-South Carolina/@LindseyGrahamSC): Yeah. It was pretty clear to me that we're never going to have a deal unless we get a wall as part of it. Dick Durbin is a reasonable guy, but he's not leading this parade. We're having to negotiate with people who want to abolish ICE, not support ICE. We're having to negotiate with people who see the border patrol agents gassing children, rather than defending our borders as professional law enforcement officers and we're negotiating with people who will give us one dollar for the wall, even though, it's immoral and accuse all of us who support a wall as part of border security as racist. As long as the radical left is in charge we're never going to get anywhere. The President will compromise but he will not capitulate. So that's where we're at.
It's a very different exercise than defending a criminal defendant where the lawyer might say, 'Sure, murder should be illegal, but my client didn't do it,' said Marco Simons, general counsel at the environmental legal nonprofit EarthRights International.

It turns out, it's not where we go to church (or don't) that determines our opinion on climate. It's not even our religious affiliation. Hispanic Catholics are significantly more likely than other Catholics to say the earth is getting warmer, according to a 2015 survey, and they have the same pope. It's because of the alliance between conservative theology and conservative politics that has been deliberately engineered and fostered over decades of increasingly divisive politics on issues of race, abortion and now climate change, to the point where the best predictor of whether we agree with the science is simply where we fall on the political spectrum.

Control of the Senate significantly changes what President-elect Joe Biden could do, but most importantly, his party will now be able to set the legislative agenda. Democrats failed to make the kind of gains in Senate races in November that many had forecast, with GOP incumbents staving off strong challenges in several states. But with narrow control, they will wield the gavels for Senate committees, call hearings and decide which items get top priority.
Advocates, meanwhile, upped the ante. Groups such as New York Communities for Change and the local chapters of Democratic Socialists of America and the Green New Deal-crusading Sunrise Movement started demanding the government replace Consolidated Edison and National Grid, the investor-owned utilities that currently deliver the city's electricity and heating gas, with government-run alternatives. And activists stepped up fights against new gas pipelines into the city, including one currently under construction in North Brooklyn.

But many teachers told me they're supported by the Next Generation Science Standards, written in 2013 to overhaul science teaching. Created by officials from 26 states and several national science education organizations, the standards take climate change as a given, expecting students to be taught that human activities contribute to global warming and that the phenomenon is having a dire effect on human life. They also go deep on solutions, such as clean energy. So far, though, only 20 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the standards, although 24 other states have drawn up their own guidance based on them.
Starting Feb. 1, Cape Town will force residents to cut their water consumption to 13.2 gallons per day, down from 23 gallons. The city has already banned filling swimming pools and washing cars. Also in an October mandate, people were asked to take two-minute showers and limit use of appliances, such as dishwashers and washing machines, Pumza Fihlani, a BBC correspondent in Johannesburg, tells Here & Now's Robin Young.
President Obama's decision that existing laws shall not be enforced against some 5 million illegal immigrants violates his sworn constitutional duty. Article II, Section 3 requires that the President shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed. Nowhere is it written that the chief executive is granted the latitude to pick and choose which laws he wants to enforce. He cannot ignore or nullify laws he does not like because the constitution gives him no power not to execute laws. To infer such latitude would invite an authoritarian rule anathema to our founding fathers' vision. President Obama admitted as much when he said, The fact of the matter is, there are laws on the books that I have to enforce. He was specifically talking about immigration laws.
Theater blooms in the fertile ground of political turmoil. It's one of the form's most resilient characteristics. Revolt sometimes springs directly from the stage; a dissident Czech playwright, the late Vaclav Havel, after all, rose out of revolution to lead a country away from Soviet domination.

Another piece of legislation proposed and debated by Democrats would fund six of the seven unresolved spending bills through Sept. 30. That bill, which the White House has also said will not become law, was approved by a 241-190 vote at approximately 10 p.m. ET, with seven Republicans joining Democrats to vote yea. The measure puts together six of the seven unresolved appropriations bills in one package.
The political capital that needs to be invested, the intense gathering of allies to push this through Congress, just requires an all-out effort, Inslee said. That's not going to be done just because somebody now decides they're interested in climate change. It takes someone who's frankly cared about it for years and years.
Mr. Trump has long claimed that the wildfires which have plagued California were a result of forest mismanagement, instead of the scientifically accepted theory that climate change is impacting the acceleration of forest fires in the state. He has also said that the Finnish president told him that Finland did not have forest fires because its citizens spent time raking the forest floor, although the Finnish president denied ever talking to Mr. Trump about raking.

We hope that the president and senior administrators use him more fully, said former congressman Rush Holt, chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In other administrations, that's not so. We'll see how this develops.

There's a growing consensus among scientists that climate change is what's making hurricanes stronger and more destructive. That's very bad news for the Bahamas, a string of more than 700 low-lying islands stretching from Florida nearly down to Cuba, in the heart of what's come to be known as Hurricane Alley.
Buttigieg's, Biden's and Bloomberg's campaigns all say they are also paying for carbon offsets.
The coalition is also taking lessons from past attempts at climate actions including the comprehensive climate package, known as Waxman-Markey, that attempted to create a cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions. The bill, colloquially named for then-Rep. Henry Waxman of California and Sen. Ed Markey, then a representative, passed the House in 2009 and died in the Senate. Leaders of the effort say that one of the reasons that effort collapsed was that it was too much of an insider play and did not engage organizers and workers in the field, mistakes that organizers say they won't repeat.
There needs to be a limit placed on carbon emissions from the power sector, Williams said. We're talking about setting a firm statewide limit on the CO2 emissions coming from the power sector that would then incentivize the development of a cap-and-trade program.

And it was important for me to state to the over 30 congressional leaders that were here that the main, the root cause of the problem is that we are a colonial territory of the United States and I wanted to ask them to forcefully take this as a battle of their own, as they have with, for example, statehood for Washington, D.C.
Yet, the events of 175 years ago also point to the reasons secession remains unfeasible, even if it somehow could occur peacefully and with the federal government's assent (a very big and unlikely if). The Republic of Texas controlled less than half the territory it claimed, beset from the west by powerful Native peoples, particularly the Comanche that raided Texas with impunity, and from the south by a much larger and more powerful Mexican republic. Americans in California faced similar problems, battling against local Mexican authorities and California's numerous Native peoples. They initiated the Bear Flag Revolt as a preemptive strike against what they believed would be Mexico's imminent confiscation of their illegally obtained land. Americans in Oregon were more secure in the moment, outnumbering both Natives and British settlers in the Willamette Valley, but if they tried to expand beyond this region then the threat of Oregon's Natives and the British Empire would become much more acute.

29) The State Department keeps U.S. law enforcement from being more aggressive against cartels.

In those purported calls, the partial audio of which was published online by The Sun, Prince Harry allegedly said the mere fact that Donald Trump is pushing the coal industry is so big in America, he has blood on his hands. But Trump will want to meet you to make him look better but he won't want to have a discussion about climate change with you because you will outsmart him.

The public outrage at Guillén's murder forced an independent review of the base, led by a five-member civilian team.

The results: By mid-century (2039–2059), the average annual snowpack will fall by 54.4 percent compared to the late-20th century baseline. By the time today's teens are in their 70s, it will be 79.3 percent beneath the old standard. To analyze massive amounts of water, planners think in acre-feet—the amount needed to submerge an acre of land by one foot. At the end of the last century, the Sierra Nevada captured an average of 8.76 million acre-feet. By mid-century, they project, the average will fall to 4 million acre-feet, and by century's end, 1.81 million acre-feet.

LIASSON: What happens next is that House and Senate negotiators from both parties start talking to each other. The president has said that at the end of three weeks, if he doesn't get money for a wall, he will either declare a national emergency - in other words, build the wall himself with unobligated Pentagon funds - or shut down the government again. But no one I've talked to on either side of the aisle thinks that he will actually shut down the government again. Some people do think that declaring an emergency is still his endgame. But many Republicans are against that because they say it'll set a precedent. And a future Democratic president could declare an emergency for gun safety or health care or climate change. And these Republicans say that any kind of an emergency declaration would be tied up in court, and he would end up getting no wall after all.

So, you know, back off a little with the tweets and the comments and take the advice of your attorney general, sure. But the fact of the matter is I think that the president is right in the opinions that he expresses and he's right to be concerned about unequal justice.

Mann is among the chorus of international climate scientists who argue that to save life on Earth as we know it, wealthy nations like the US need to switch to carbon-free electricity by 2030. This would mean 80% of current coal reserves would need to stay in the ground, he wrote.
As premier, he says he would hold town halls four times a year to hear directly from voters. He also says he'd create a more respectful legislature by meeting with opposition caucuses at the start of every session.

Heavy rain in Southern California has triggered mudslides and debris flow in parts of the state scarred by recent wildfires, leaving people trapped in homes and cars as highways were shut down in the dark early Tuesday morning.
Plus, we'll ask our Sunday panel about Michael Bloomberg's rise in the polls, and accusations of sexism in the workplace.
The impact of the crisis has been so severe on market demand that all G20 leaders are turning to overcapacity, following the example of China. Until current overcapacity is absorbed, the recovery will be slow.
When asked if climate change fit into that, he repeated that they'll focus on the core mission.
The Amazon forest produces about 20% of the world's oxygen, and is often called the planet's lungs. According to the World Wildlife Fund, if it is irrevocably damaged, it could start emitting carbon instead -- the major driver of climate change.
The message is very simple: This is the first time in history that a government has been shut down while our new electeds have assumed responsibility, New York Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, said afterward.
The Climate Reality Project also reports that making the connection between global temperature rise and wildfires is also pretty simple science: Droughts dry out the land, killing plant life – which then also dries out itself, becoming far easier to ignite.

The gaffe comes as the Iowa caucuses head to a finish, while simultaneously the impeachment trial continues to move forward in the Senate. Biden, who once led his rivals by double digits in the first caucus state, has fallen behind Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), with some speculating he may not place high enough to receive a single delegate.
I understand the issue with President Trump and he certainly has reversed course a few times. What I'm asking you now, and this is -- we are in week four of the shutdown, so the situation has become dire.
The issue also came up in August, when Sanders traveled to Paradise, California, which had been ravaged by wildfires, to unveil his plan to fight climate change. He was unapologetic.

Economists have debated how effective the New Deal was — its spending was probably too low and not sustained enough to generate the kind of recovery the economy needed. Nonetheless, it left a lasting legacy by transforming the country at a crucial time.
SANDERS: You know, many of my opponents are saying, oh, Bernie. It's too much. We can't pay teachers a living wage. We can't make public colleges and universities' tuition should free. Really? That's exactly what we intend to do.

Justice Democrats, the climate-focused Sunrise Movement and their allied think tank, Data for Progress, and media firm, New Deal Strategies, have also sought to counter claims that Democrats' disappointing performance in November's congressional races is due to left-wing activists' adoption of unpopular slogans like defund the police. Instead, they argued in a joint memo that Democrats failed to adequately articulate the ways they planned to materially improve voters' lives, noting, for example, that two losing Democratic Senate candidates failed to use the words jobs or economy in any digital ads.

Market purists bring up the idea of Adam Smith's invisible hand. They'll say it's not for us to debate responsibility and sustainability, that every company should focus on maximizing its share price, its profits ― that ultimately they are accountable to the bottom line.
The risk in business is that most corporations get a lot of conflicting demands ― demands to make a profit, demands to do good for society, demands to be good stewards of the environment ― and when faced with all these conflicting demands (some of them are conflicting at least on a short-term basis), the rational response is hypocrisy. They say one thing to shareholders, they say something else to stakeholders. They'll have an annual report for shareholders and a separate corporate social responsibility report. In one they'll talk about the good things they're doing for the world and in the other they'll talk about dollars and cents and profits.
Because of the courageous leadership of Georgians, America will have a Democratic Senate working hand-in-hand with our Democratic House Majority and President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement Wednesday.
Ocasio-Cortez wants to impose her radical, socialist vision on every single American citizen, a fact most of those in the mainstream media who have spent the past several months fawning over her refuse to tell the public. We must stand against these assaults on capitalism and our personal freedoms, or else the next generation of Americans won't have access to the same liberties millions of our forefathers sacrificed for. For those of us who support free markets and personal liberty, losing this ideological battle is not an option.
But Pelosi has more experience managing those dynamics than they might realize. Former congresswoman Lynn Woolsey (D-Calif.), a leader of the Democratic antiwar bloc, said Pelosi skillfully managed that aggressive faction while she was sparring with Bush over Iraq.

Many Democrats also see legalization of marijuana as a new way to generate more tax revenue to grow government, and they don't care if people are harmed. It is only logical to suggest that many of those adversely impacted by marijuana legalization would need more government services like unemployment, health care and welfare programs to assist them.
Provo: The state's number of drug overdose suicides has potentially been underreported by 33%, according to a new study. Published in the journal Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior, the study came to the conclusion after looking at 2,665 overdose deaths from 2012 to 2015 in Utah, the Provo Daily Herald reports. Paul Nestadt, one of the paper's authors, says the nation's opioid epidemic has clouded suicide classification across the nation. If you work in mental health, it is pretty clear there is a lot of overlap in the symptoms of someone who is using opiates and someone who may be suicidal, Nestadt said. State health officials say roughly 630 Utahns die from suicide and about 4,570 attempt suicide every year. Utah's suicide rate is above the national average, causing the deaths of 22.7 per 100,000 people in 2017, compared to a national rate of 14 people per 100,000. According to the study, that rate could be significantly higher.

Paul and Hersh assume that government spending is about or a little more efficient at boosting economic growth than its direct outlays ― payments are spent on other activity, which in turn encourages more activity.
Georgia's Senate runoff contests were viewed by left and right as critical to the future direction of the country. Republicans see Democrat control of the senate possibly leading to fundamental and damaging changes in our nation. Given the chance, Democrats may push to change the Electoral College, pack the Supreme Court, allow Puerto Rico and Washington D.C. to become states and other measures that would guarantee one-party rule and pave a progressive pathway to the future.
Matthew Lawrence, a law professor at Emory University, argued in the Yale Journal on Regulation this week that Biden's administration could even use the law to undo waivers granted to states to enact Medicaid work requirements — a policy change that would otherwise need the support of 60 senators.
My Year Abroad, by Chang-Rae Lee (February)
On Tuesday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced plans to launch the largest, most comprehensive plan in the nation to guarantee health care for all in the city -- including illegal immigrants.
The (World Heritage) Convention says you have to identify those unique sites and transmit it to future generations. If we have nothing left to transmit, this is a dramatic situation.

Come December it was the Google chief Sundar Pichai's turn to visit the Capitol and watch Rep. Steve Cohen, the 69-year-old Democrat from Tennessee, wave his hands in the air and complain: I use your apparatus often, or your search engine, and I don't understand all of the different ways that you can turn off the locations. There's so many different things!
JOSH HOLMES, FOUNDER, CAVALRY: Well, first let me respond to my good friend Jane's criticism. His book is named to The Long Game, which, unfortunately, is not the end of the untruths or misunderstands that we had about Mitch McConnell's role here.
Depending on how you interpreted Gavin Newsom's campaign slogan Courage For a Change, he either has more courage than Jerry Brown — his campaign says that's not what they meant — or that Newsom has the courage needed to bring about big changes.

On the campaign trail, he spent little time in the photo line taking pictures with voters, and declined to take questions, something most of his competitors did. Instead, Bloomberg held comparatively short events that had the production value of a general election rally. Bloomberg focused heavily on Super Tuesday and battleground states. During an election night event in West Palm Beach, Bloomberg showed no signs he planned to drop out.
Prepping to go out into the cold and exercise is more of a mental hurdle than a physical one. It can be just too tempting to stay warm and cozy on the couch. Arrange to run with a friend. Not only will you be safer than if you run alone but you'll also have someone to hold you accountable for your fitness goals.
Conservative commentator Ben Shaprio compared Pelosi and Schumer's look to that of the nefarious fictional villains from the James Bond spy franchise, before reposting another Twitter user's image depicting Schumer as a used car salesman. Others likened Pelosi to the aristocratic character Lucille Bluth in the television comedy series Arrested Development.
Protesters marched past Freedom Plaza, their scheduled dispersal point, and toward the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue NW, where the group broke into another round of the feminist chant.
According to a new study published Feb. 5 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, there may be more than 15 million gallons (58 million liters) of mercury buried in the permafrost of the Northern Hemisphere — roughly twice as much mercury as can be found in the rest of Earth's soils, ocean and atmosphere combined. And if global temperatures continue to rise, all that mercury could come pouring out.

 The U.S showed less social support, less sense of personal freedom, lower donations, and more perceived corruption of government and business. 
Natural gas, which has become a cheap and attractive competitor to coal, is cleaner-burning, but it is still a fossil fuel, emitting about half the carbon dioxide that coal does. Earlier studies have found that switching over all the world's coal plants to natural gas would do little to curb climate change.
He said his campaign sought to cut through the noise of the culture wars and instead focused on the concerns of ordinary people.
The number of people having that conversation is larger today than it ever has been in the past, said Mark Misczak, who a longtime emergency manager who spent the bulk of his career as a Federal Emergency Management Agency leader under multiple presidents. The disasters, as terrible as it sounds, provide an opportunity to re-envision how things function and to consider that resiliency.
But if humanity does not reverse course on climate change in the coming year, we will find ourselves locked into escalating warming for decades to come. This is the one chance we have, German climatologist Niklas Höhne told The Post. Governments will not spend this much money again in 10 years.

Let's not forget: President Franklin Roosevelt signed this bill into law precisely to prevent Wall Street speculators from causing another Great Depression. And, it worked for more than five decades until Wall Street watered it down under President Reagan and killed it under President Clinton.
While the Air Force Academy investigated and took steps to correct these problems, greater oversight of response programs and personnel is required at all three Academies, it said.
Part of that work, said Ing, is helping to build capacity on the ground in a state-by-state level.
WALLACE (voice over): Alda has embraced tech and social media and talks
And here in the House, we look forward to working closely with him, as well
The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States' wealth to other countries, Trump said. It's to give their country an economic edge over the United States. That's not going to happen while I'm president. I'm sorry.
NASA's GIS dataset shows 2020 as the warmest year, but only by a minuscule margin, whereas the NOAA and Berkeley Earth data show 2020 a hair behind 2016 for the warmest year globally on record. Just last week the European climate agency Copernicus showed 2020 tied with 2016.

Yeah, I think for those people who are experiencing these impacts firsthand, and for those who are watching them play out online, on their TVs around Australia, this is one of the first times we're really experiencing as a country what climate change feels and looks like, just how apocalyptic it can be, and just how much our ecosystems can be devastated. And so for these people, they're really hoping that this is a moment where the government is finally going to act and change its policies around this issue.
Republican senators and senators-elect say they will join Senator Josh
He added, You don't have to be religious to see the moral dimensions of this because frankly, every religious and non-religious tradition tell us that we have some responsibility of stewardship, some responsibility of taking care of what's around us- not to mention taking care of our neighbor... At least one way of talking about this is that it's a kind of sin.
Mandelblit is a collaborator, read freshly sprayed graffiti on a wall alongside Israel's coastal highway this past week after reports that he is moving to indict.
SAGAL: Right. And in The Shape Of Water, you had a particular challenge because not only did you have to be otherworldly and alien, but you had to be attractive.
But first, today we learned there's a secret abandoned basketball court at the top of Disneyland's famous Matterhorn Bobsleds ride. Back in the day (aka the '70s and '80s) the park hired guys and gals to climb around outside of Disney's favorite mountain; the small court was a spot where they could chill between shifts or when the weather was bad. The climbers still make appearances from time to time, but according to WDW News Today (a Disneyland and Disneyworld specific online news org — yep, that's a thing), now the court is used by costumed cast members before their nightly flight to the castle fireworks celebration.
He was a governor of unusual energy, creativity and vision. A Harvard University study in 1981 ranked Sanford as one of the 10 best governors of the century. Campbell considers Sanford one of the greatest governors in American history and the finest Southern governor. His words and actions and thoughtfulness mattered, Campbell said. He stood out as a beacon of hope for African Americans, not just in North Carolina but across the country.
We must remember that as long we do not treat this crisis as a crisis, and as long as facts and science are being left completely ignored, then we will not be able to solve this crisis, she said. Before we came here, we had a few demands for this WEF and of course, those demands have been completely ignored. We expected nothing less.
Women across the country sent a final rebuke to President Trump before the 2020 presidential election. Though organizers have for weeks tried to put three main issues at the center of the march — climate change, immigration and reproductive rights — Saturday's protest remained very much about the man in the White House.
For the purposes especially of this product, we do not try to parse those apart, Deke Arndt, chief of the monitoring section at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information, said on a call with reporters. We're more interested in quantifying what's going on. Both the economists and physical scientists will retrospectively look at that, but those sort of happen at the speed of science.
Western populist movements, like the Brexit vote, also laid the groundwork for people to ignore warnings from experts around the middle of this decade, says Joe Ondrak, a senior researcher at fact-checking organization Logically.

Around the same time, QAnon, a dangerous online cult that believes US President Donald Trump is secretly fighting to bring down a cabal of pedophiles, also found a wider audience in Europe. A CNN investigation reviewed Facebook pages and groups related to the QAnon conspiracy based outside the US and found at least 12.8 million interactions between the beginning of the year and the last week of September.

Our obsession with sports seemed unstoppable until it was pitted against an intractable pandemic. Then everything halted in 2020 for several months, and when the games returned, they were sterile, inspiring uneasy feelings and poor television ratings. Like everything else infected by the novel coronavirus, athletics were literally sickening.
But Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said more whales, dolphins, sea turtles and other marine species will be needlessly killed. She pledged to reintroduce the bill during the new Congress and push for quick enactment once President Biden is in office.
2. If you didn't like Shakespeare in high school, don't worry. His work was never really meant to be read as a book; it was written for the stage. Seeing it as intended will change your perspective.
What would be lost is a city where so much of the art interprets the natural beauty of light that arrives twice a day, once from the sun and once as it is reflected back off the water, but Venice is no longer just something beautiful to look at. Its fragility is a warning to the rest of the planet that this ancient city is under pressures from forces it cannot control. Venice is not alone. In a world of warming temperatures and sea level rise, no place is an island.
For so much of American history, we've been sort of enamored by assimilation, whether it was racial uplift in the Black community, like the talented tenth leading the charge, as well as many immigrants, trying to learn English and sort of blend in and assimilate.
'Adaptation means change, and change is hard'
The U.S. has seen its happiness slide happiness over the last decade. In 2007, it ranked No. 3 among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. But it now hovers at 19th place, partly due to the political discourse. The predominant political discourse in the United States is aimed at raising economic growth, with the goal of restoring the American Dream and the happiness that is supposed to accompany it. But the data show conclusively that this is the wrong approach, economist Jeffrey Sachs wrote in the report.
We must not downplay the importance of our own responsibility in interaction with nature, Francis told the Diplomatic Corps accredited to the Holy See. Climate changes, with the global rise in temperatures and their devastating effects, are also a consequence of human activity.
Her remarks came in an interview with Anderson Cooper for the CBS show 60 Minutes. Excerpts for her appearance were released Friday ahead of a full broadcast Sunday evening.
COONS: Thank you, Chris. Thank you.
If the pandemic does any good at all, it will be to stimulate public demand for a food system that addresses these problems and puts health and public welfare first. Let's hope the new administration takes on this challenge and gets busy creating a food system that ends food insecurity, prevents diet-related chronic disease, protects against COVID-19, and while we are at it, produces less waste and environmental damage.
Trump claimed in his veto message on Friday that the legislation would cause Americans to import more foreign seafood and worsen a multibillion-dollar seafood trade deficit.
WALLACE: Donna, haven't Democrats learned their lesson? Move on from impeachment and investigations?
Bernie Sanders has seen a boost in support in the weeks leading up to the caucuses and sat atop many of the polls that have come out in January. While he has been one of the candidates stuck in Washington, his campaign has flooded the state with high level surrogates like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, filmmaker Michael Moore, and Sanders' wife, Dr. Jane Sanders. The Vermont senator has spent some of his final days in Iowa stressing that his political revolution can begin here.
November's fire in the northern California town of Paradise was the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century, killing at least 85 people and destroying nearly 14,000 homes.

Speaking to state media Tuesday , Zhong Nanshan, one of China's leading respiratory experts and a hero of the 2003 fight against SARS, said he expected the peak to come in up to 10 days.
Republicans, meanwhile, made peace with their dismal new reality as the minority in a body where the majority reigns supreme. Leadership offices have been downsized, lofty titles have evaporated, and raw power has given way to ineffective protests.
Trump's America produces approximately 14 per cent of global CO2 emissions; Brazil about 1.5 per cent; India 7 per cent; and China nearly 30 per cent. Since none of these economies has any intention of driving change on the CO2 production front any time soon, it will put Boris Johnson's attempts to take Britain's economy Net Zero by 2050 into tragic, painful and embarrassing perspective.
He's been in office for almost half a century. I follow this rather carefully and I don't know of a single piece of religious liberty legislation he's ever penned. If he's in favor of the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, well, that's rather deceitful because he's now in favor of the Equality Act which, if it were passed … would literally destroy the Religious Freedom Restoration Act signed under President Bill Clinton.
Newsom, who is California's 40th governor, takes over the post after serving as lieutenant governor under the Golden State's former leader Jerry Brown. Under Brown, California led the nation in the battle against the Trump administration's policies on everything from immigration to climate change.

Biden has pledged to limit and cap child care costs for many families. He will offer tax credits to help low- and middle-class families pay for child care. Parents earning less than $125,000 annually can get back up to half what they spend on child care for kids under age 13. The cap is $8,000 for one child or $16,000 for two or more children. And families making up to $400,000 can qualify for partial credits.

But while Trump claimed in his speech that he had terminated the GCF, Melanie Nakagawa, a former deputy assistant secretary for energy transformation at the U.S. Department of State under Obama, notes that the $1 billion that the U.S. did provide is already in the system. The check is in and it is already having an impact.
That repudiation should be made clear and decisive on the basis of the Klan's hypocrisy and the violence, disorder and the race and religious hatred known to be an inevitable product of the organization and activity of that body, Johnson wrote, according to a brief in The New York Times on Sept. 17, 1924.

You mentioned conspiracy theories being pushed by some elected officials, such as the president and members of Congress.
Unified control of the government is extremely rare in American politics and the next nine months could be the last time they have unified control for another 10 years, said Waleed Shahid, a spokesperson for Justice Democrats, a left-wing group that has hired a political director to advance its agenda on Capitol Hill. Delivering results is much more important than bipartisan branding or anything like that.
I'm the daughter and granddaughter of veterans. We're the fifth largest
In both states, Sanders is seen as best able to address the issues and concerns of young voters, Hispanics and working class voters. Biden is seen as best able to address the concerns of black voters, while Warren is seen as best able to address the concerns of women. Voters in California and Texas trust Sanders best to handle a number of issues, particularly health care and climate change. When it comes to Sanders' plans, majorities of his supporters in California and Texas think he has the right approach, even if he won't get all of his initiatives done if elected.
So people looking at that scratch their heads.

PRAGER: The problem is -- it's a big problem. We enjoy each other too much. We're looking for problems.
Just because something is labeled organic, natural or gluten-free doesn't make it the healthier choice by default. All-natural doesn't legally mean anything; food manufacturers and purveyors can slap those words on anything and call it a good day in marketing. This term is not regulated by the FDA, which means there are no repercussions to calling food made with artificial ingredients, chemical sweeteners, preservatives, or anything else, natural.
In conclusion, Ehrlich warned that sometime in the next 15 years, the end will come, meaning an utter breakdown of the capacity of the planet to support humanity.
A new and fast-growing ETF worth a look is direct the AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF MSOS, +0.89% that launched in September. It is actively managed and includes indirectly related companies, microcap marijuana startups and other interesting twists on this trend. The ETF is reasonably established with $250 million in assets, and could be worth a look for those looking to cast a wider net on the sector.
COONS: I think the president should test that by making it clear what concessions and what compromise he's willing to put forward. Look, Chris, you know me, I work with Republicans regularly. I've been on the phone with a half-dozen Democratic and Republican senators in recent weeks and several different efforts by Republican senators to negotiate a compromise, got cold water thrown in them the next day by the president publicly, even one effort that was being led by Vice President Mike Pence.
Technological change is intensifying. We're becoming terrified by social media, by information, and in this state of high anxiety, we're looking to attach that anxiety to something, he says. And cultural change, demographic change, is what we're attaching it to.
New initiatives require a sustained effort and a long-term view to give such efforts the best chances for success over time, the report concluded.
Reuters Trump had announced in November that he planned to nominate Wheeler to be the permanent administrator of the EPA.
It's like being the sole member of an even-worse EU with knobs on, over whose politicians you have no more democratic control than you did over the EU's because they're there for the next four years at least with a massive majority.
But critics say the New York-based money manager is already showing weakness in its commitment to environmental issues. Specifically, they say BlackRock is being too passive in pushing for change in the agricultural and commodities industry, which many believe to be the second-largest contributor to climate change after the energy sector.
Two HHS officials — Darcie Johnston, director of intergovernmental affairs, and Kevin Yeskey, principal deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response — said in a Feb. 23 meeting with local officials that the patients would be flown from California to the Fort McClellan Army Airfield in Anniston, according to multiple local officials.
We live in a country today that has an economy that is rigged, a campaign finance system which is corrupt and a criminal justice system which, too often, does not dispense justice.
Dr. Shaman: Like I said, I'd really like to see laboratory experiments on coronavirus survival repeated but this time with different temperature and humidity conditions. That would be much more compelling to me than any other studies done so far which try to tease apart various effects from population-scale data. There are a number of studies posted on medRxiv related to this which can provide some perspective.
I mean, so that's obviously not these animals' natural habitat. So how did they end up in this living room?
The UN committee said it is concerned by the refusal to consider free, prior and informed consent in regards to these large-scale development projects, and alarmed by the escalating threat of violence against Indigenous people. It urges Canada to guarantee no force will be used against them.
If you board a train in Baltimore, headed to Washington, D.C., you'll pass over the Thomas Viaduct, a stone bridge built 180 years ago. If you pour a glass of water in Chicago or Philadelphia, it might reach you through century-old pipes. Fly into Minneapolis or Albany, New York, and you will land at an airport built in the early days of aviation.
Despite warnings since 2004, local government officials are criticizing South Africa's national government for its slow response to the crisis. As The Los Angeles Times notes:
This is a guy who put together a $9 billion tax credit plan to try to lure Amazon, but yet he wants to toss these jobs away? said Allegheny County Councilman Sam DeMarco III (R), referring to Pittsburgh's unsuccessful effort to lure Amazon's planned East Coast headquarters. (Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

Then another colleague, Marta Domínguez-Delmás of the University of Santiago de Compostela in Lugo, Spain, noted that she dated old shipwrecks by analyzing the tree rings in the wood found underwater. The team wondered whether perhaps tree-ring data from Caribbean shipwrecks could push the region's hurricane history further back in time.
WALLACE: This passion for communicating also led Alda to start a hit
You mustn't believe what you read, no one has stripped us of our titles, he reportedly said.

Commemorating the U.N.'s International Migrants Day Friday, Father Baggio said that a whole series of dramas that existed before the pandemic are still there and some are even aggravated. Among these, there was also the tragedy of displaced persons, refugees, migrants who were raped or whose rights have been violated.
Pelosi told Elle magazine in a recent interview that she views the vitriol thrown her way by Republicans and some Democrats not as hatred but as respect.

Her vulnerability to a challenge could speak to the changing nature of the Democratic electorate. Support for a Green New Deal unites disparate primary voters from the 2016 election. Among New York 4th Congressional District voters who picked Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in 2016, 55 percent said they would support a pro-Green New Deal candidate, compared to 8 percent who wouldn't. Among voters who picked former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primary, support for a Green New Deal proponent hit 46 percent, compared to 19 percent who don't.
The same goes for cult favorite Bulletproof Coffee, a favorite of keto fans that's enhanced with grass-fed or clarified (ghee) butter and MCT (medium-chain triglyceride) oil. This intentionally high-calorie beverage is often used as a meal replacement and beloved by keto dieters and intermittent fasters (both lifestyles that have their own hosts of problems when taken too far or for too long, asserted Peacock). However, its efficacy again is in the caloric deficit it creates by taking the place of a meal. In and of itself, it's not doing anything else to help your fitness goals. In fact, although it's fine in moderation in conjunction with a balanced diet, Ramirez cautioned that if you are drinking it, be aware that it is high in fat and bloodwork should be monitored accordingly.
They're so far past the end of their rope, she says, they can't even see it anymore.
If Ossoff defeats Perdue, Democrats will hold the presidency and control both the House and Senate, which could allow the party to carry out more progressive policies.
We should decriminalize people who are coming here, crossing the border.
Yet by the time that new technologies to foster development in Amazonia had come along—including air conditioning, mosquito abatement, and the helicopter—a new and hostile political attitude had taken hold.
But the difference now, Burger said, is that the claims are being brought under state, rather than federal, common law — and that strategy remains to be tested.
Some of Happer's scientific critics, though, see it as something more: a visceral distrust of scientists who study environmental risks.
If case one doesn't work out, we have other options.
Pressed on the advice she's gotten on dealing with Trump, Pelosi insisted she makes her own advice — a point she made by paraphrasing a passage from a 57-year-old papal encyclical.
As average temperatures rise across the planet, the frozen Arctic is heating up faster than anywhere else.
I am also cognizant, as someone who lives in the suburbs, that the demographics of our district are different. And that's a beautiful thing, because it shows that progressives can win anyway.
Warren's trip to New Hampshire came the day after another progressive lawmaker – Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii – announced her candidacy for president. Other liberal lawmakers – such as Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jeff Merkley of Oregon – are also making moves toward running.
You will find below our first list of contenders for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. There are 35 individuals who have at least expressed interest in running. Some have already filed papers, some have set deadlines for themselves, while others seem more likely to be just musing in the media.
CNN has reached out to Corbyn for comment.
Back in Hope Town, Winslow said they have the funds to bury their lines. Americans with second homes here add a lot to the economy, Winslow's family foundation has donated nearly a million dollars to rebuilding efforts.

I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion. We share a common goal, Biden said. And together, we'll defeat Donald Trump. He then reiterated, We'll defeat him together.
Experts say the devastating and unusually powerful hurricanes that have struck the East Coast over the past decade have done more than any politician could to raise awareness of just how much risk the nation faces. Heavy flooding in Texas, warming ocean waters in the Pacific Northwest and New England, and eroding islands in Alaska are adding even more weight. Scientists for years have been warning that ocean levels are rising, and that storms will become more violent.
Trump's tweets about attacks don't count as congressional notice, Warren says in Iowa
A draft text of the plan circulating Congress includes a framework aimed at eliminating greenhouse gas emission from manufacturing and agriculture and dramatically expanding energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable sources. The proposal describes this effort as a historic opportunity to virtually eliminate poverty in the United States and to make prosperity, wealth and economic security available to everyone participating in the transformation.
According to the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, the amount of ice flowing out of the Thwaites and nearby glaciers has nearly doubled over the last 30 years. Melting ice from the Thwaites into the Amundsen Sea already accounts for approximately 4% of current global sea-level rise — a number that would significantly increase when the glacier crumbles.
California saw major wildfires this year and according to the Nation magazine, there's a clear culprit -- private homeownership is the problem.

Complicating matters is the education levels of recently admitted refugees has plummeted, according to data analyzed by CIS. In 1996, only 35 percent of incoming refugees lacked a high school diploma. By 2015, the number had skyrocketed to 51 percent. The low educational attainment levels help explain why 56 percent of refugee households received food stamps or other government benefits in 2015.
Nobody's going to get kicked out of their houses, Mulvaney told reporters Thursday afternoon, reiterating that many of the HUD cuts were related to infrastructure and would be addressed in the massive infrastructure plan the president wants to implement.

You had a Prime Minister so bedazzled by greenery that he actually chose to share a platform with Deep Green, Malthusian purveyor of outrageous alarmist propaganda Sir David Attenborough and spew all manner of scientifically illiterate guff about the beneficial trace gas CO2 sitting menacingly over the planet like some malign tea cosy

With Joe Biden's inauguration as US president this month, and the expectation that the United States will rejoin the Paris Agreement, countries planning to make dramatic reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions make up almost two-thirds of the world's current emissions and 50% of global gross domestic product.
Across Asia, many countries have put in extra screening at airports and warned citizens to avoid travel to China. To China's north, neighboring Mongolia has imposed stringent border checks on travelers coming into the country. Indonesia and the Philippines have both introduced extra restrictions on Chinese tourists, while Japan has upgraded its response, allowing authorities to force the suspicious cases for hospitalization and testing.
Fortunato Ortombina: No, no, no, no, no. If the water arrives, on the cable, on the line, where you have electricity, it explode. It explode.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg took a direct jab at Justin Trudeau's environmental record, sharing an op-ed on Twitter criticizing the prime minister's hypocrisy on climate change.
Today the world faces a different kind of global threat, similarly metastasizing after years of failing to confront it. Keeping the planet from warming beyond recognition requires an unprecedented economic effort to halt climate-changing emissions. But even the most optimistic scientific projections call for not only stopping the output of carbon dioxide but also removing the vast concentrations of the gas already in the atmosphere, where it will continue to trap heat for more than a century to come.
Rather, the model is the decade before that year of decision, 1846, when tens of thousands of White Americans left U.S. borders to establish their own societies modeled on their own ideals. Some went to the Republic of Texas, where they could legally obtain massive amounts of free land and own countless enslaved people without any Northern antislavery opposition. Some went to the idyllic climate of Mexican California, where they could also claim (albeit illegally) massive amounts of free land, which would be worked by Indian peons — in reality, another form of unfree labor. Some Americans went to the Willamette Valley in Oregon Country, where they could obtain a more modest amount of free land and have a local government that entirely prohibited slavery — while also prohibiting all Black migration into the region. Another group, the Mormons, went to the Salt Lake Valley, where they could practice their own version of Christianity without harassment from the U.S. government or other Americans.
Such a rapid accumulation of individual wealth hasn't happened in the United States since the time of the Rockefellers and Carnegies a century ago, and we as a society are only just beginning to grapple with the ethical implications.
Sanders: Here? Well, of course, it is. And I am accepting my constitutional responsibility. But what I'm saying, obviously, it's at a disadvantage.
In contrast to development banks and rich country governments, the GCF also has a governing structure that gives developed countries a say over which projects get approved. The GCF was set up within the umbrella of the United Nations system expressly for this purpose. And its governing board is equally divided between representatives of developed and developing countries — winning valuable buy-in from the recipient countries, says Brown, a former international climate finance negotiator at the U.S. State Department.
CBS News asked Dr. Theresa Crimmins, director of the USA National Phenology Network, if such a widespread early arrival of spring is unusual. Yes, she replied, this year stands out, because so much of the country is showing such an early spring. Huge swaths of the Southeast have had the start of spring arrive 2-3 weeks and more early.
It was a moment she needed now more than ever. She had spent the holidays grieving her father, who died of covid-19 in Wisconsin. She had wept watching the ball drop in Times Square on New Year's Eve, hearing a performance of Pentatonix on TV at home with her children.
Some of the partygoers were convinced that Sanders needed to run because he was the most electable candidate in a head-to-head matchup against Trump.
To rub salt into the wound, your new Prime Minister made a speech singing the praises of free markets – as if to taunt you with what might have been if only you had elected an actual Conservative government. [See Matt Ridley's tweet below]

That strategy, built by communications director Lis Smith, allowed Buttigieg to rise to prominence in a field that didn't seem likely to have much room for someone like him. Along the way, it underlined a key point about politics in the Trump era: Even without experience, money or organization, if a candidate — even an un­or­tho­dox one — knows how to play the media, he can catapult to prominence.
And when it comes to LGBTQ issues, this is, I think, the most important thing is not the treatment of candidates, it's what's happening to individuals and families across the country from brave service members who have their careers threatened --
His campaign is making payments to NativeEnergy, based in Burlington, Vermont, which is the same company that Clinton used for them during her presidential bid in 2016. That's also the same firm Warren uses, with her campaign paying a little more than $10,000 to it in September.

There's no federal government response, really, at all. And the way that Australia fights fires is primarily with volunteers. And as these fires become more and more intense, these firefighters are becoming fatigued. But the prime minister says he's not going to pay them.

Salem: The state's correctional facility for girls and young women had among the highest rates of sexual victimization in 2018, according to a federal report. In the report, 42 girls and young women at Albany's Oak Creek Youth Correctional Facility were surveyed; 14.3% reported being sexually victimized in 2018. That's more than twice the national average of 7.1%, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Oregon Public Broadcasting says the report does not distinguish sexual abuse reports in individual facilities made against staff versus those made against other youth. Other Oregon facilities above the national average include St. Mary's Home for Boys in Beaverton at 11.1% and the Rogue Valley Youth Correctional Facility in Grants Pass at 10.3%. All other Oregon juvenile facilities fell below the national average. The National Survey of Youth in Custody conducted the report.
When Bolsonaro was running for president, he made campaign promises to restore the economy by exploring the Amazon's economic potential.

And so we've already been paying the costs, except we have not been getting any of the benefit. And so what we're here to say is that government is not just for cleaning up other people's mess, but it's also for building solutions in places where the private sector will not.
Obviously, there is no comparison to this president and the way that he has treated and talked about women and people of color and continues to do so to this day. But we, in our party, hold ourselves to the highest standard. And it is going to be critical for us to have a nominee who cannot authentically lead and who can show growth on these challenges.
If we have learned anything from 2020, it's that our response to this crisis must be transformative. The idea of returning to normal often emerges in discussions of resilience. But we know a normal that is extractive of BIPOC communities and the planet is unacceptable. 2020 has shown that we need to think more holistically about what resilience should look like, and that issues of climate, housing, health, and economic justice are all intertwined.

And the fear that comes with that, of 'I don't want to screw it up.'
Tonight, Democratic presidential hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden will debate each other one on one.

Perdue endorses the effort to overturn Biden's win, and Loeffler says she's 'seriously looking' at it. I'm encouraging my colleagues to object, David Perdue said on Sunday. This is something the American people demand right now. Credit... Nicole Craine for The New York Times Two days before runoff elections in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate, one of the Republicans on the ballot encouraged members of his party to overturn President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory in the November election. David Perdue, whose term as a senator ended on Sunday when the 116th Congress concluded its term, called on Republicans in the Senate to defy the results of the election and indulge President Trump's attempts to remain in power. I'm encouraging my colleagues to object, Mr. Perdue said on Fox News. This is something the American people demand right now. The other Republican in a runoff race on Tuesday, Senator Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, continued to repeatedly pledge loyalty to Mr. Trump. Ms. Loeffler, however, declined to directly answer questions about a plan backed by nearly a quarter of Senate Republicans to vote against ratifying the results of the presidential election absent a 10-day audit of returns in certain states. Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Ms. Loeffler said she was seriously looking at supporting the attempt to contest the election, but did not commit to it. Everything is on the table, Ms. Loeffler said.

The Sites Reservoir would be filled by significant water diversions from the Sacramento River, which could harm the river's dynamic flow-based ecosystems. More than 20,000 acres of federal and state public lands along the river that were acquired to protect and restore the river's riparian and aquatic habitats, could be degraded by the diversions. In addition to reducing flows in the Sacramento River, the reservoir would drown up to 15,000 acres of existing oak woodlands, grasslands, wetlands, and agricultural land in the western Sacramento Valley. Impacts associated with the reservoir footprint would harm the federally protected bald eagle, a host of other sensitive wildlife species, several rare plants, and significant historical and cultural resources. The Sites Project Authority, a consortium of water districts and local governments, claim that the reservoir could store up to 1.8 million acre feet of water (making it the seventh largest reservoir in the state) and reliably yield about a half million acre feet of water annually for communities, farms, and the environment. But this yield estimate fails to adequately consider the effects of climate change, chronic drought, and reservoir evaporation on project storage and deliveries. …
A number of these projects need money, she says, and it's not clear that the city will have enough time to raise the money that they need to fund these rather ambitious projects.
Jim Watson, general manager of the Sites Project Authority, told Breitbart News that he was confident the project would proceed, given the support of the voters for water storage when they passed Proposition 1. He noted that $816 million had been set aside for Sites — the largest project funded by the proposition bond, compared to several competing projects. He added that local water agencies had also been working with state and federal authorities in preparing studies for the project.

Look, then, for a renaissance, on Broadway and other stages, in plays by Black artists and other people of color. The groundwork is being laid — if the coronavirus vaccines are distributed fast enough — for a return to live performance with far more input from generations of Black playwrights, directors and administrators. As a result, the theater world will find itself connected in a profound way to the world evolving just outside the playhouse doors.
Hands and hand prints, usually red but in one notable instance white, are motifs in Dwayne Eugene Martin's paintings. These images might symbolize many things, but among the unambiguous meanings is work. The artist's Honfleur Gallery show, Rise, features pictures of African American exploitation, rendered by Martin with evident struggle and even anger. For the D.C. native, painting is a form of physical exertion, akin to the toil of the Black people whose efforts are suggested (but not literally shown) in The Hands That Built America.

REPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: You know what I would add to what Max is saying, and what I think is lost a little bit in the discussion of Trump's strategy, is this idea that we don't have a good plan with our allies. We are always at our strongest as a country when we are moving forward with our traditional allies and NATO, for example, that is when we're able to get the space to have diplomatic relations, which-- which when we bring world approbation to bear. And so when we're in an era where we're treating our traditional adversaries better than our allies, I think that is making it more and more difficult for us to operate from a point of power on the world scene.

The traditional liberal response to the Federalist Society has included pointing out how suspiciously convenient it is that the jurisprudence advocated by society members so often yields conservative results.

He predicted Iranian leaders will become more popular in their own country as its citizens rally behind them after the attack.
We could achieve substantial amounts of bioenergy potentials, but this would really come at the cost of extensive environmental damage in many other dimensions, Heck said.
I just want Tessa and Scott to win the gold they were robbed of in Sochi and also get married and make babies. I'm easily pleased. — Elizabeth Cotignola (@LaDiavolina) February 19, 2018
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. But what he's not open to is a lecture by the Speaker of the House. I'll give you a dollar. He's not open to the people on the left accusing his border patrol agents of being Gestapo agents gassing children. He's not open to the idea that the wall is immoral. So if you bring Dick Durbin's to the table, we'll fix this.
Hundreds of participants carried wire hangers wrapped in pink paper with the #noban hashtag on one side and Warning: this is not a surgical instrument on the other.

In geology, permafrost is defined as any soil that has been frozen for more than two years. In the Northern Hemisphere, permafrost accounts for about 8.8 million square miles (22.79 million square kilometers) of land — or roughly 24 percent of exposed Earth, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Over time, naturally occurring compounds in the atmosphere, such as mercury and carbon dioxide, can bind with organic material in the soil and be frozen into permafrost, potentially remaining trapped underground for thousands of years before it thaws, the new paper said.

Sanders: Course I will. Do you know exactly what health care costs will be, one minute, in the next 10 years if we do nothing? It will be a lot more expensive than a Medicare-for-all single-payer system.
What's the issue? And then, depending on the issue, the question is whether you're going to lose Democrats, said Jim Manley, a former spokesman for Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.
The city's 2020 Democratic primary cemented climate as a winning issue. Green New Deal backers won more than half a dozen seats in the state legislature and in the U.S. congressional delegation, unseating entrenched incumbents.
With Ottawa's work on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement gradually receding from centre stage, a four-premier delegation from the Council of the Federation took its turn in the spotlight in Washington, hoping to convince gubernatorial counterparts of the importance of closer trade ties with the provinces.
GONYEA: And a boast about the small-dollar donations to fuel his campaign.
According to a CBS News poll released Wednesday, 7 in 10 Americans don't think the issue of a border wall is worth a government shutdown, which they say is now having a negative impact on the country. But partisans don't want their own side to budge: 65 percent of Republicans say President Trump should refuse a budget unless it includes wall funding, and 69 percent of Democrats think congressional Democrats should keep refusing to fund it.
JOHNSON: I'm not sure what else John would really add to this. I haven't spoken to him since - we really talking about Ukraine. We share the same position, but from my standpoint, President Trump has been unbelievably consistent in why he had reservations about Ukraine. And it starts as a candidate when he didn't think Europe was doing enough in their own defense. And then, throw that into that mix, the corruption of Ukraine.
I'm running for President because it's time for new leadership and to make sure opportunities I had are available to every American, he said.
The annual New Year's celebrations took place amid tight security, with about 1,300 officers deployed throughout the heart of the German capital and revelers banned from taking fireworks, bottles or large bags into the fenced-off party zone.
I view myself the same way everyone else views me: as an outspoken progressive who is laser-focused on delivering results for the people of New York's 17th Congressional District. That means I am going to work with members of the Squad, as well as progressives who are not members of the Squad, centrists and, yes, even conservative Democrats and Republicans.
Additionally, officers in Connecticut who make arrests or regularly interact with the public now have to prominently display their badges and name tags on their uniforms. All officers in the state will have to undergo a behavioral health screening every five years.
McKay has always had a smug problem. This is what undermined his comedies with Will Ferrell, what most undermines Vice, and why he wears a scarf in public. McKay despises anyone not enlightened enough to share his beliefs and is even more disgusted with those who enjoy life rather than obsess over politics, those more interested in the next Fast & Furious movie than they are in using Twitter to own the Republicans.
Whether we move toward more intuitively created tech that surrounds us or that incorporates into our bodies (yes, that's coming), I am going to predict that carrying around a device in our hand and staring at it will be a thing of the past by 2030. And like the electrical grid we rely on daily, most tech will become invisible.

CONWAY: It's far worse. Oh, my goodness, it's far worse. And, by the way, that was fully litigated. That happened in October 7th. He won a month a later. And --
Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who resigned Jan. 2 under a cloud of ethics scandals, told the National Petroleum Council last month that the administration's regulatory philosophy is to partner with the fossil fuel sector, which he said was at the leading edge of technology. The U.S. has lead the charge in cutting emissions of CO2 and methane, a potent greenhouse gas, he added.

In a statement Wednesday, Biden said that Georgia's voters delivered a resounding message yesterday: they want action on the crises we face and they want it right now. On COVID-19, on economic relief, on climate, on racial justice, on voting rights and so much more. They want us to move, but move together.
INGRAHAM: Got to get it in the rearview at this point. Governor and Mollie, thanks so much.

Howard had 208 receiving yards — including touchdowns of 53 and 51 yards — in a 45-40 win on Jan. 9, 2017 while Smith watched as a freshman reserve.
Long-term, given the filibuster and a united Republican front, other priorities, like immigration, climate change and infrastructure, will face an uphill climb.
That opportunity might have presented itself last weekend since Sanders, Warren and others were campaigning in Iowa and then went to South Carolina for Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebrations and then on to Washington to be in the Senate. But they didn't share private flights.
Leaving the underlying treaty — the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change — would be faster and could be completed within a year. But that treaty was ratified by the U.S. Senate. Presidents have unilaterally exited Senate-ratified treaties before, but it's rare and controversial.
ANDERSON COOPER: You're willing to compromise?
Other plaintiffs are the Sea Turtle Oversight Protection and the Turtle Island Restoration Network. The lawsuit asks the court to rule that several federal agencies are in violation of the Endangered Species Act and order them to designate sites – unspecified as yet –as critical habitat for the turtles.
Three months ago, I entered the race for President to defeat Donald Trump. Today, I am leaving the race for the same reason: to defeat Donald Trump — because it is clear to me that staying in would make achieving that goal more difficult, he said. I'm a believer in using data to inform decisions. After yesterday's results, the delegate math has become virtually impossible — and a viable path to the nomination no longer exists.
He said his biggest accomplishments were passing a child protection bill that laid the groundwork for Indigenous-led child welfare agencies, reorganizing autism services and delivering the Pan Am Games in 2015.

He was also never able to completely put behind him his mayoral administration's implementation of the controversial policing practice, stop-and-frisk. Questions surrounding past comments he is alleged to have made to women who worked for his company, Bloomberg LP, also surfaced as his campaign built momentum. In February, after pressure from fellow Democratic contender and Elizabeth Warren, Bloomberg released three women from non-disclosure agreements in an effort to promote more transparency at his company.
So since I visited Susie and there was this little lull in the fires, it's picked back up again, and whatever small amount of rain fell, authorities are saying, really made no difference to the fires that are continuing to rage all along the coast. And we've got weeks, if not months, left of them.
I met Leo at the Federalist Society's offices in Washington. Despite the fact that in his personal capacity while on leave from the society he put so much effort into advising the Trump administration on judges, he endorses the network theory of the society, telling me, It's less about who gets what job and more about building a community that can be self-perpetuating and self-sustaining and self-driving.
Control of the Senate is up for grabs after voting ends Tuesday. If both Ossoff and Warnock win, Democrats would force a 50-50 tie in the Senate. Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris would serve as the tiebreaker, handing control to Schumer.
It's harmful for animals that build shells, like oysters, and spells big trouble for the Pacific shellfish industry, worth more than $100 million.

In a statement after the report's release, Edward Acton, Vice-Chancellor of the University of East Anglia, expressed hope that report would put an end to the wilder assertions about the climate science community.
Today Speaker Bercow told the House of Commons that he could disregard precedent and change procedure as he wished, while admitting that he hadn't fully thought through the implications of this.
SAGAL: Yes, that's true. It was an elaborate stunt. He didn't want to do the stories anymore. And it worked. Now he has his own news channel on YouTube.
The proposals are likely to be published in the federal register this week, and they will undergo a process of public comment and hearings. The government is likely to issue final regulations in the fall.
Armstrong bet that the global mean temperature would not change; in other words, that temperature increases and decreases would tend to balance out over time. That forecast is consistent with a statement in the aforementioned IPCC technical report: In climate research and modeling, we should recognize that we are dealing with a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore that the long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.
The president's policy differs from that of his predecessor. During former President Barack Obama's tenure in the White House, the number of displaced persons being resettled in the U.S. increased drastically. Between 2008 and 2017, more than 67,000 refugees on average were admitted into the country. The total would have been larger if Republicans had not stymied Obama's efforts to admit 110,000 displaced persons, most notably from Syria, during his final year in office.

Forcing researchers to disclose their raw data has for years been a top priority for conservative Republicans — including some now working in the EPA's upper ranks. The new rule was modeled on a bill championed by former House Science Committee chairman Lamar Smith (R-Tex.). One of the panel's former staffers, Richard Yamada, helped write an early version of the regulation while serving at the EPA.
In most cases the SSW propagates down through the clouds to the Earth's surface over the course of a few weeks. When this happens it throws the Arctic upper-level wind patterns off-kilter and the domino effect leads to convoluted jet stream patterns around the world in the mid-latitudes like Canada, the U.S., Europe and Asia. That means it will almost certainly result in some extreme winter weather, and given the expected pattern in the U.S., that will most likely happen along the East Coast.
In early 2017, the Vatican invited Dr. Ehrlich to speak at an academic conference titled 'Biological Extinction, sponsored jointly by the Pontifical Academy of Science and the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences.
I am thrilled about joining the Judiciary Committee because I have centered and see an urgent need for democracy reforms in this country. We talk a lot as progressives about big structural changes ― Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, housing as a human right and policies that would reflect that. But none of that stuff is possible unless we root the corrosive influence of money out of our politics. And also, draw congressional districts in a way that will cause members of Congress to be responsive to the American people.
INSKEEP: We met Ocasio-Cortez inside that office. Sunlight fell through the oversized window onto her fuchsia suit. Her office is still a fraction of the size of the committee chairmen who hold real power in Congress, though she has something they do not. The 29-year-old is a media star. She has been since she upset a leading Democrat in a New York City primary last year. Her surprise victory cast her as a party insurgent. Her label as a Democratic Socialist also alarmed conservatives, who now see her face constantly on Fox News.
So she founded the Boris Lawrence Henson Foundation, named in honor of her father who served in the Vietnam War. The foundation is working to bring more mental health support to schools in Black communities as well as to increase the number of Black therapists. Recently, the foundation offered free virtual therapy to African Americans affected by the racial unrest and the covid-19 pandemic, which disproportionately affected people of color.
MEREDITH: President Trump repeatedly criticized McCabe over his role in the Russia probe and tweeted Saturday that McCabe, quote, authorized media links to advance personal interest.
Due to the volume of submissions, it is not possible for us to respond to every submission individually.
But the worst thing for a party is if David Perdue and I don't win on
MARGARET BRENNAN: And that would mean we wouldn't get to hear congressional hearings and on the record an explanation to the American people. More to talk about on the other side of this commercial break.
The bill would have phased out use of large-mesh drift gillnets in federal waters off California over a five-year period, the Associated Press reports. These nets, used to catch thresher sharks and swordfish, often entangle other marine life, including whales, dolphins and sea lions, and are already prohibited in U.S. waters off the Atlantic Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. In 2018, California passed a four-year phaseout of the nets in state waters.
Mobilize — that's the key word here, says Leonardo Martinez-Diaz, a former deputy assistant secretary for energy and environment at the U.S. Treasury in the Obama administration. The term was specifically chosen to underscore the understanding that only a portion of the $100 billion per year would come directly from rich country governments. The plan is to motivate mostly private sources of capital — for example, for-profit corporations — to invest in efforts that help poor countries deal with climate change.
Beyond the impact from flood events, Diffenbaugh says the study goes further by establishing a methodology for economists to apply on various forms of extreme weather going forward. The study provides a framework for calculating how much climate change is likely to cost in the future, as well as the economic value of reducing emissions in order to limit the level of global warming, he said.
Now, of course, in the future, since we know so much more than we did then, we can make growth clean—that's the point about carbon capture, and other new technologies. And yet at the same time, clean growth is still growth, and that means more. Yet are the environmental greens, as opposed to the Green New Dealers, really on board with that? We'll have to wait and see if that split is real, and if it can be bridged.
The whole thing seemed like a lark to seasoned political analysts; Buttigieg was 37, barely old enough to be president, and he had never even held statewide office. That changed on March 10, when Buttigieg took the stage for his first nationally televised town hall on CNN. Within the Buttigieg campaign, staffers later referred to it simply as the CNN Town Hall, although he had since conducted many others.
DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there, Steve.
I don't want to speak for the president. I don't want to lock him in, but I'm confident what I just described with a few other things would be a deal acceptable to the White House. And a lot of Democrats -- and I'm just so frustrated -- we can't get in a room and hammer it out.
This strategy also coincides with a long-established tendency of Republican Party leadership, since the 1970s, to run up federal budget deficits when they are in power and then return to fiscal conservatism when the Democrats take office. And finally, there are also some true believers in high Republican places; Mitch McConnell used some of these in the Senate to tell Trump no can do just before the election, when Trump leaned on Republican senators to reach a deal with the Democrats on the Heroes 2.0 COVID stimulus bill. Trump backed off, perhaps calculating that a fight with Senate Republican leadership just before the elections was not worth the risk.

UNDER THE INFLUENCE features stories about diverse influencers of all ages and races around the world, on topics such as how much money style and beauty influencers make; what it's like to work behind the scenes on a social media campaign; and the industry's (poor) representation of diverse people and voices on social media, etc.
Queens officials, including Constantinides, have long blamed the plants for the two neighborhoods' high levels of asthma, which earned one part of northern Astoria the nickname Asthma Alley. In 2017, the city council passed legislation requiring the utility operators to stop using No. 6 fuel oil by 2020 and No. 4 oil by 2030. The new bill would be the first to lay the groundwork for phasing out the plants altogether.
This is a global problem, and it still isn't being taken seriously
Pelosi then outlined priorities for Congress and for mayors across the country, including infrastructure, public education concerns and immigration reform. he said mayors needed to address three major issues in coming years: economic inequality, climate change and housing crises in cities across the country.
Hello! It's a new day! Who's ready to PUSH? Ocasio-Cortez said in an emoji-filled tweet on Wednesday. Ready to PUSH for retroactive COVID relief? And to PUSH for student loan cancellation? For climate justice? Healthcare? Voting rights? Ending the death penalty? What policies do you most want to PUSH for?
Our analyses show that exceeding the 2 degrees Celsius level of global warming identified in the U.N. Paris Agreement is likely to result in further intensification of extreme precipitation, says Diffenbaugh. So, if the future is anything like the past, we can expect continued increases in flood damages from future changes in precipitation.

Attaching a price to emissions and allowing emitters to offset their pollution with a credit-swapping system is considered one tool in the fight to slow man-made global warming. The next United Nations Conference of the Parties (COP), to be hosted by the U.K. in Glasgow in November, is expected to formalize international trade in carbon credits under the Paris Agreement.
In 2021, the world will need to reduce emissions on the same scale while simultaneously controlling the coronavirus and rebuilding the economy.
President-elect Joe Biden returned to Georgia on Monday to help boost Democratic Senate candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock a day before voters determine if the new administration's agenda will have an easier time getting through Congress.
That will change under my administration. Equal Justice Under Law will not just be words engraved on the entrance of the Supreme Court. It will be the standard that applies to Wall Street and all Americans.
SCOTT PELLEY (60 MINUTES): How do you view this emergency?
The Democrats are running as moderates to win in the once-deeply red state that President-elect Joe Biden narrowly nabbed.
Here is a list of some people in Trump's orbit who have found themselves as sometimes enemies, sometimes allies of the president. You could call them the president's frenemies.
If you look at it right now, you are seeing outbreaks in the Northern Hemisphere countries, which is not unexpected. You are seeing it in Europe and Iran, which are colder, but you are not yet seeing large numbers in Australia, which is in summer right now, and you are not seeing it in the deep tropics where it's warm all year round. This suggests that maybe this coronavirus has some temperature or humidity sensitivity that limits its circulation when conditions are warmer or more humid.
This is really about providing justice for communities and just transitions for communities. So really the heart of the Green New Deal is about social justice and it's about allowing and fighting for things like fully-funded pensions for coal miners in West Virginia, fighting for clean water in Flint, and fighting for the ability of indigenous peoples to take a leadership role in in where we're moving as a country.
He says this is an issue for the states and not the federal government.
It's been the worst year we've ever seen, said Emma Pelton, a conservation biologist with the Xerces Society who helps lead the annual Thanksgiving count. We already know we're dealing with a really small population, and now we have a really bad year and all of a sudden, we're kind of in crisis mode where we have very, very few butterflies left.
At that point, the primary was effectively decided. Biden was on track to be the nominee and his team launched a more aggressive courtship. Biden aide Cristobal Alex, who had made the initial call last year, reached out again -- this time to schedule a conversation with Weber and Prakash. Symone Sanders, a senior campaign adviser, and Biden policy director Stef Feldman also wanted to chat.
OCASIO-CORTEZ: Yeah. And I think it - I think that is always the crux of it. So when we decide to go into the realm of deficit spending, we have to do so responsibly. We ask, is this an investment or is this actually going to pay for itself?
Warnock and Ossoff campaigned on ending the coronavirus crisis, which has infected more than 20.8 million Americans and killed at least 354,000, in order to reopen the economy. They pushed for debt-free public college and a new Voting Rights Act. And they attacked the Republican senators for their multimillion-dollar stock transactions during the pandemic, alleging that they profited off it. The senators have denied any wrongdoing.

In their first act in the minority, House Republicans moved to force a vote on tax cuts — which would have interrupted Democrats' plans to hold votes on funding federal agencies, as well as coming bills on health care, ethics and other issues. Democrats immediately voted to kill the proposal on a party-line vote.

If you missed the broadcast, or just want to relive the biggest moments, here are the ones that will likely be on everyone's lips.
Olson told Kroft that a trove of documents she has collected proves every president since Lyndon B. Johnson has known about the potentially catastrophic effects of fossil fuels.
Warren still has her share of wins from which to take heart. In addition to the Working Families Party, she has at her side former Housing Secretary Castro, climate expert Rhiana Gunn-Wright, the group Black Womxn For, and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has adopted the role of attack dog with gusto.
People in their communities know their communities best, Ing said. We are all the expert of our own experiences, just kind of recognizing that and supporting that by not just bringing money into a state, but creating a way where people can come together cooperatively, build their own local coalitions and then we can support that.
And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next FOX NEWS SUNDAY.
But sometimes it can be hard to grasp what all the numbers and stats mean. For instance, when scientists say Earth's average surface temperature has gone up about 1 degree Celsius over the past 150 years or so, what does that really mean? Besides, hasn't Earth's temperature always fluctuated?
The findings mirror larger global trends. Natural disasters cost insurance companies a record $135 billion in 2017, according to figures released last week by Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurer. Counting uninsured losses, that figure climbed to $330 billion. The only costlier year was 2011, when the Tohoku earthquake in Japan contributed to a total of $354 billion. Disasters in the U.S. made up 50 percent of this year's losses, the German company said, compared to 32 percent on average years.
[He] is looking forward to engaging more on the issue as it continues to develop, Chris Evans, a spokesman for O'Rourke, said by email Friday. As he mentioned while traveling to every county across Texas during his senate campaign, he's proud to come from a renewable energy producing state that is number one in wind power production, number one in wind power jobs and number one in solar energy potential.
Michael Bloomberg is pledging to fill a funding gap created by President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, offering up to $15 million to support the U.N. agency that helps countries implement the agreement.

The 24-year-old singer and model, who was representing the Philippines, wore a sparkling red dress that she said was inspired by the Mayon Volcano, as she was handed the crown in front of a roaring crowd.
MICHAEL CROWLEY: No, that's a huge problem here, Margaret. Think back to what happened when Hurricane Dorian was hitting the United States last summer President Trump made an inaccurate comment about the hurricane's path and was criticized for it. And then a day or two later, he's holding up a map showing the storm's forecasted path in the Oval Office and it appears to have been doctored with just the kind of sharpie pen that President Trump loves to use to sign documents. It really looks like they were altering information they were giving the public to make the President look good, to cover up for a mistake he had made. And President Trump has repeatedly bungled basic facts, including numbers of victims in the country. Yesterday he got the gender wrong of the person who died in Washington although he may have been briefed inaccurately. I will say, Margaret, that I do think that that briefing yesterday was a step in the right direction. Having all those health experts there--
Also, some Brits fear Meghan is taking Harry, the much-loved younger son of much-lamented Princess Diana, far away from them. Will they now move to Canada and take their 8-month-old son, cute-as-a-button Archie, with them? Thus, the alarm klaxons going off.

I think it's like a really weird instinct that the Democratic Party develops to not be exciting intentionally, said Sean McElwee, co-founder of the progressive think tank Data for Progress. Most of politics is getting people excited enough to show up and vote for you. And I think that a Green New Deal and Medicare-for-all — these are ideas that are big enough to get people excited and show up to vote for you.
The Natural Resources Defense Council contends that the project violates clean-water laws and regulations. Actor Mark Ruffalo co-wrote an op-ed in the New York Daily News attacking the project. Every part of the way LNG is extracted, transported and stored is dirty and dangerous, it said.

When I saw her, I said, 'Mom, that's not her hair' – there was a fake bun glued to her head. Her head had been blown out at the back, Shonta told Fox News, stressing that the body showed multiple bullet wounds rather than only one, as they had been informed. My family never got answers.
In November, he blasted schoolchildren who were organizing protests for action on climate change. Organizers criticized Morrison in an email to CNN at the time. They said he did not listen to climate scientists and failed to take action to stop dangerous climate change.
GROSS: It's just that it's a terrifying piece of history, particularly for Jewish people.
Curtis described the value of the project in terms environmentalists might understand: given that the state's climate is changing, and becoming warmer, that means more of California's annual precipitation is falling as rain, rather than snow.

A recent study by Potsdam Institute climate scientist Marlene Kretschmer found the polar vortex has weakened and meandered more often since 1990, but that study focused more on Europe. Ongoing research shows that there seems to be a similar connection for more frequent Arctic cold snaps like what the U.S. is now experiencing, Kretschmer said.

Diplomats have expressed concern that Beijing is promoting a vision of trading networks centered on great powers such as China, which would erode the rules-based system under the World Trade Organization in which all competitors are treated equally.
But the dotted line comes from computer models — from scientists reconstructing Earth's surface temperature. This gives us very, very coarse information. It averages Earth's temperature over hundreds of years. So we can see temperature fluctuations that occur only over longer periods of time, like a thousand years or so. Any upticks, spikes or dips that occur in shorter time frames get smoothed out.
It's hard to know for sure, but I'm fairly confident this is another example of Doug Ford and people around Doug Ford deciding that they want to unleash attacks against me, Del Duca said.

Highlighting the national discord, four Alberta Conservative MPs released a document called the Buffalo Declaration, calling for equality and a louder voice for Alberta at the federal table.
The Buffalo Declaration is a 13-page document and accompanying webpage released on Feb. 20 signed by four Conservative members of Parliament. It outlines concerns about Alberta's role in the federal government and what the signees call a push for equality for the province. The authors definition of equality has a number of different pillars, from repealing carbon taxes to changing the size of Parliament.
Davenport says that the flood damage cost from rainfall in Hurricane Harvey, which dumped up to 60 inches of rain on Texas's Gulf Coast, made up about 20%of the $199 billion evaluated in her study. A series of studies after Harvey found that climate change resulted in the storm dumping up to 38% more rainfall than it otherwise would have.
But in the new paper, scientists argue that deploying BECCS technology on the scale needed to address the problem would use up massive amounts of water, fertilizer and land. That would probably lead to large environmental problems or even destabilize key planetary systems, wrote Vera Heck of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and three colleagues.
Andrea Dutton, a geochemist at the University of Florida, agrees.
One night in 1897, a mob of armed White men surrounded the Kentucky home of George Dinning, a freed slave who was wrongfully accused of stealing livestock. Dinning fired back in self-defense, killing one of the men. We've all read enough history to know how such stories end, but this one takes a remarkable turn: With the help of a Confederate soldier-turned-lawyer, Dinning triumphs in court, becoming the first Black man in America to win damages after a wrongful murder conviction. Pulitzer-winner Colson Whitehead, author of The Underground Railroad, has praised Montgomery's book as inspiring and terrifying in its timelessness.

So when these fires start in September, Mr. Morrison is really slow to respond.
Terror acts committed by Iran's proxies have continued unabated and the Islamic Republic was behind the rocket attacks on our embassy in Baghdad and in Basra in 2018. The Shiite militia rocket attack that killed an American contractor and wounded four U.S. troops, just two weeks ago was the 11th barrage in just two months.
Like the avocado. Americans ate 2 billion pounds of avocados last year, two-thirds of which were imported – mostly from Mexico. That's because avocados grow year-round in Mexico's climate – but not in California's. But researchers in the Golden State — America's biggest producer of the green fruit — are working to change that.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, he is.
But we if we get a rise in crime, like we did in the 90s, it is going to swing back again. Right now, we are living off of the law enforcement reforms that said policing matters, that incarceration matters, and we've gotten lazy, and the elites are back in the saddle, you know, and it's going to take a lot of thousands of more black lives lost to criminals who should be in jail before this gets turned around.

And then a strange thing happened, he told the audience. Instead of running the old computations in one-one hundredth of the time, the powers-that-be at the lab ran programs that were 100 times bigger.
Meanwhile, former Vice President Joe Biden has not taken a stance on the issue. A Biden spokesman told Fox News he did not have a comment at this time.
And that is where this study lays to rest a misconception about whether there was a global warming hiatus between 1998 and 2013. If you look at a short-term snippet of the surface temperature record, one could conclude that warming was negligible during that 15-year period. Those skeptical of climate change often refer to this to poke holes in the evidence.
Barring a bizarre-but-not-mathematically-impossible shift in the Georgia vote tallies, These fiscal decisions will be in the hands of Democrats.

Immerath is a rural farming village in west Germany, northwest of Cologne. At one point, it was home to about 1,200 people, according to The Washington Post.
The plan also includes legislation that would create customized water-use limits for urban water districts, which would risk state enforcement if they fell short. Lawmakers also are considering whether to allow districts to enforce drought regulations, a power now reserved for the state.

Locusts can move about 90 miles in just one day.
One option to consider is suspending Ötzi in a giant block of ice. He'd still be visible, but access to scientists would be limited, says Peschel, who's also in charge of evaluating requests to study Ötzi. Another idea is switching from an oxygen atmosphere to a nitrogen one, which would be less friendly to bacteria. Or, Peschel says, it would be possible to vacuum-seal Ötzi like a steak. (But we don't want to eat Ötzi, he clarifies.)
Biden has repeatedly said the values that uphold American democracy are on the line and he's in the strongest position to restore them.

Bigger solutions come with bigger price tags: Just fully protecting East Boston, home to Boston Logan International Airport, could cost the city up to $200 million. But city officials say that would ultimately prevent more than $443 million in estimated damage from a large storm. Researchers expect sea levels to rise 36 inches by 2070, leaving Boston with the likelihood of being flooded every month during the highest tide.

Despite this, Democrats are high off of a crucial win Tuesday night, which came in spite of continuous attacks against the election process in Georgia and constant unsubstantiated declarations by Trump that widespread voter fraud occurred in November.
All told, the two men increased their net worth by a staggering $200 billion last year, a sum greater than the gross domestic products of 139 countries.

I'm not talking about stock-picking; picking the right index was just as important. Consider that for the year, the Nasdaq-100 NDX, +0.38% increased roughly 44%, its fifth-best year ever. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.29% had a pretty good year too, but its returns of about 16% were only roughly a third of the Nasdaq-100's gains. Lagging even farther behind was the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.58% , up only 7% on the year.

The result of Trump's inanities and the world view it represents will be more aggressive foes (both nation states and terrorist groups); the decline of friendly, liberal democracies as belligerent authoritarian regimes emerge; a world economic system dominated by China; a less dynamic American economy; the re-creation of ungovernable havens for terrorists (as was the case before 9/11); nuclear proliferation; and unabated climate change. It's not a world any of us should want to live in.

Researchers have already observed climate-change-induced permafrost thawing, and there is likely more on the way: According to a 2013 study, the Northern Hemisphere will lose anywhere from 30 to 99 percent of its permafrost by 2100, assuming current human greenhouse-gas emissions continue unabated.
By contrast, President Obama is bestowing a wholesale, blanket amnesty for an entire class of nearly 5 million people. He is doing so not for the reasons allowed by law, but for purposes that appear to be purely political. This is a flagrant abuse of prosecutorial discretion. His expansive action exceeds his authority in ways that none of his predecessors ever envisioned. And it is a radical departure from any of the executive actions issued by previous presidents.

So here's the question: I understand the idea that you don't want a 2,000- mile wall, but you have supported, and a lot of Democrats, including Pelosi, including Schumer, have supported a border that includes hundreds of miles of fencing. So why not make a deal, a deal that right now without opening the government, why not make a deal that Lindsey Graham was talking about, some money for border barriers, fencing, wall, whatever you want to call it, in return for some concessions on Dreamers and on TPS immigrants?
Remember in 2012, Joe Biden toured the country right before the campaign or during the campaign said, bin Laden is dead. GM is alive. Then when Hillary went into Libya and Gaddafi was pretty horrifically murdered on the street, she said, we came, we saw, ha-ha-ha, he died. He hasn't done that.

As women fill a quarter of the seats of Congress, the idea that they are more collaborative than men is becoming axiomatic. Hopefully the prophesy will be self-fulfilling, and a buttress to the shift in tone.

Columbia: Gov. Henry McMaster wants to expand full-day pre-kindergarten for low-income 4-year-olds to every school district across the state. The program was created in 2006 in response to a lawsuit by poorer, more rural school districts and didn't cover all the districts in the state. McMaster's $53 million proposal would expand the 4K program to the remaining 17 districts. Several are among South Carolina's largest districts, including Beaufort, Charleston, Greenville and Richland District 2, according to The Post and Courier of Charleston. McMaster told the newspaper the expansion of the 4K program is crucial to his efforts to improve education to keep economic development humming in South Carolina. Several senators and House members praised the Republican governor's proposal. Democratic Sen. Vincent Sheheen of Camden has been pushing for universal pre-kindergarten for years and said it can only improve education across all grades.

According to a 2015 U.N. study, the world is expected to have a population of about 8.5 billion people in 2030 — about a 15 percent increase in the size of humanity in just 15 years. India will have surpassed China to become the world's most populous nation, while demographers forecast a pronounced population surge in sub-Saharan Africa, which will soon be home to the world's most youthful societies. The number of megacities may double by the end of the decade, with close to two-thirds of humanity living in urban centers.
In her experience, Dr. Hayhoe has found that the best way to neutralize the partisan charge on climate change is not by appealing to science — which some prominent Republicans, such as Senator Ted Cruz, have cast as a competitor to religion — but by emphasizing shared values.

The pandemic revealed severe flaws in our political, economic and health system that tolerated elevated risks to front-line essential workers and extremely high financial losses to small businesses owned by people of color. The pandemic widened the racial economic gap between haves and have-nots. Government pandemic stimulus and relief dollars followed a predictable pattern of money following money, money following power, and money following whites.
Barack Obama had used his authority as president to join the Paris accord without a vote in Congress. That means Trump can remove the U.S. from the accord without a vote. But it will take awhile: Under the terms of the agreement, he wouldn't actually be able to withdraw until November 2020.

Even when the crowd simmers down, it's so hard to hear in the cavernous hall that the words of retiring Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah — who is receiving an award — are mostly lost to history. Whatever he's saying, I'm sure it's good, says Lew Olowski, who, like me, has crept closer to try to hear. He was a human rights activist studying at Georgetown Law a decade ago when, he tells me, joining the Federalist Society expanded his mind to see both sides of issues. Now he's general counsel for an organization helping poor pregnant women get a leg up and, not incidentally, keep their babies. His ears prick up at isolated morsels of Hatch's talk: … religious freedom … administrative state. … See what I mean? Olowski says. Music to my ears.
Biden himself has said he plans within the first 100 days of his presidency to push for the passage of the Equality Act, which aims to extend federal protections in the areas of housing, education, credit and services to the LGBTQ population. That's critical, activists say, since only 21 states have anti-discrimination laws on the books. Read more.
And in the current social climate, that message may be more relevant than ever.
In a statement, Jones said he was extremely relieved the review was over. We have maintained all along that our science is honest and sound and this has been vindicated now by three different independent external bodies, he said.

Given the decreasing emphasis on candidate qualifications and the increasing ability for campaigns to speak directly to voters on a national scale, however, this could be the cycle. Certainly, O'Rourke's strong second in bright-red Texas gives him something to talk about.
We're not only learning about different cultures which, you know, teaches us understanding, but we also broaden our view of the world. And I think that's an amazing thing. Because with that, we're given the platform to share our experiences. And if we can share a message of inclusivity, of understanding and respect, I think that in itself is a really great thing, too.
And particularly during the winter months, hearty Minnesotans gear up for some of the coldest living conditions in the northern hemisphere. In -20°F temperatures with only 15 mph of wind (which is common), frostbite can occur in as little as 10 minutes. Minnesota winters are not only dark and cold, but also potentially fatal.
Plains bison were almost wiped out entirely in the late 1800s by over hunting, largely the result of colonial settlers on the prairies. Bison populations had remained steady for thousands of years previously and were incredibly important to Indigenous communities.
As for the others, they better find a way to get famous pretty quick.

Forty-three countries pledged a total of $10.3 billion to get the ball rolling for the first several years — though no exact time period was specified for how long that money is supposed to last. So far, the GCF has committed $2.2 billion to 43 projects.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --this would be a spoiler in just--
Now, I completely understand why CNN (and the Washington Post and the New York Times and NBC News and the rest) would not hire Trump supporters. The media have an agenda. They want to drive Trump from office by any means necessary, including the use of violence, and will do anything to stop him from serving a second term or furthering his mandate. That I get… There is no mystery about that…
In part, because there's some truth to the argument.
Less surprised, but no less dismayed, were some of the tech advocates who have spent years trying to discuss issues like net neutrality and data privacy on Capitol Hill with representatives and staffers they say are somewhat less than engaged.
MIKE POMPEO: Look, we can't get into hypotheticals about what it would take exactly but there is a detailed set of commitments that the Taliban have made about the levels of violence that can occur, the nature of what's got to take place. We are hopeful that in the coming days, there will be inter-Afghan negotiations that commence as well. That has not happened before. It's going to be rocky and bumpy. No one-- no one is under any false illusion that this won't be a difficult conversation. But that conversation for the first time in almost two decades will be among the Afghan people. And that's the appropriate place for that conversation to take place. We're-- we're prepared to do what it takes to ensure that we keep America safe. We've asked everyone there to reduce the levels of violence, both the Afghan national--

Let's go to New Jersey: A third grader was getting ready for quiet time at school. During this time the kids can read a book, sleep, rest or whatever. This little girl, her name is Mariah, decides she's going to read her bible. The teacher walks over to Mariah and tells her that the bible is not appropriate reading material and she has to put it away. Mariah was upset and confused.

DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: And then I wonder if the media organizations are going to send out a bunch of reporters all across the nation to find out what actually is happening in this country as they did after the 2016 election results.
Tonight, President Trump reaffirmed his commitment to addressing the humanitarian and security crisis at our nation's southern border, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a statement. His proposal to increase security through physical barriers suits the reality on the ground. It's what career Border Patrol experts support and are asking for. And it simply builds on earlier legislation that Senate Democrats like then-Senator Obama, then-Senator Clinton, and Senator Schumer previously supported with enthusiasm.

At this moment of crisis, as Covid-19 continues to ravage our state and our country, when hundreds of thousands have lost their lives, millions have lost livelihoods, Georgia families are having difficulty putting food on the table -- fearing foreclosure or eviction, having difficulty making ends meet -- let's unite now to beat this virus and rush economic relief to the people of our state and to the American people, Ossoff said earlier Wednesday ahead of CNN's projection.
The problem, though, is that many of these statements, these feel-good pronouncements and glossy reports that are coming out of Fortune 500 companies, are not being backed up with substantive action.
The emergency legislation would be paid for with borrowed money, adding to trillions in debt the government has already incurred to confront the pandemic. Aides said Biden will make the case that the additional spending and borrowing is necessary to prevent the economy from sliding into an even deeper hole. Interest rates are low, making debt more manageable. Inflation is below the Federal Reserve's target, indicating that the economy has enough slack to withstand additional demand introduced by deficit spending.
As Democrats prepare for the 2020 presidential election cycle, they are full of eager anticipation, if not outright confidence.

Israelis give the United States its highest rating on the survey (83% favorable). Elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa, attitudes are more negative, especially in Turkey, where just one in five (20%) have a favorable opinion of the United States, the lowest percentage registered in the survey.
This determination to argue, against all evidence, that the planet is in a warming phase and that we must do more to try to cool it down would be quite funny if it didn't have such terrible real world consequences.

Fredericksburg: A cancer patient says her faith in humanity has been restored after she received thousands of pieces of mail from around the world this holiday season. The Free Lance-Star reports Jean Lee, 61, hoped a few cards would help as she battled the depression of ongoing treatments for a cancer with which she was first diagnosed in 2003. So the Stafford County woman posted a request on Facebook, asking people to tell her about their lives and hometowns. That led to a segment on a Washington TV station, and her story continued to spread. Lee said she received a package from Antarctica, a scarf from England, Kona coffee from Hawaii and a clock-jewelry box made by inmates at a Tennessee correctional facility, who paid $25 to ship it to her, the newspaper reports. When I say this whole experience has given me hope, that's coming from a woman who was very jaded, Lee told the newspaper.
Still, the emerging skepticism is frustrating for a candidate who views his ties to the black community — built over decades in the Senate, and solidified by serving as the No. 2 to the first black president, Barack Obama — as a central pillar of his candidacy.
Our response to this crisis must be transformative.
Manchin considering returning to W.Va. for gubernatorial run - W. Va. Metro News: U.S. Senator Joe Manchin is once again considering running for Governor of West Virginia, according to several people who are familiar with the Senator's thinking. When asked Friday about his interest in the governor's race, Manchin fired a shot across [Jim] Justice's bow. 'The state of West Virginia deserves and needs a full-time governor,' he said. Manchin is already getting calls about 2020, some from Democrats who themselves are thinking about running for Governor and want to know his plans and some from West Virginians encouraging him to run. Also, he could run for Governor while continuing to serve in the Senate. … [T]he idea keeps surfacing and the dynamism of the legislative session that just started in Charleston is far more appealing to him than the protracted partial shutdown that's now gripping Washington.
We need to overcome the human instinct to focus on ourselves when we are faced with a dangerous situation in order to look beyond, to notice the situations of others.

The 21st century has its own new challenges. Leading it is not an American birthright. And the competition — with fundamentally different values — is bringing their game.
There is a counterargument, which issues from the offices of the lawmakers themselves. Sen. Orrin G. Hatch ­(R.-Utah), who leaves office Thursday at age 84, was pilloried during April's Facebook hearings for asking Zuckerberg: How do you sustain a business model in which users don't pay for your service?
Today, we don't need the hellfire and the pitch forks, we don't need the rivers of boiling blood, but we do need a national usury law.
Preliminary data from the Rhodium Group, a research consultancy, found that emissions rose 3.4 percent last year. That's even as Americans' reliance on coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, hit a 40-year low.
The average age in the Senate has ticked up steadily along with that of the population, as it has in the House since at least the 1940s, when Congressional Quarterly began keeping track of ages in the lower chamber. It's hard to be certain given incomplete and sometimes inconsistent age records, but the just-concluded 115th Congress appears to have been the oldest in history — with an average age of 58½ as of the day it convened, if you combine Senate Historical Office and CQ figures.
Air pollution is a serious health concern, responsible for millions of premature deaths each year, with even more anticipated due to climate change.
Detroit — Joe Biden had a heated exchange with a construction worker who accused him of trying to take Americans' guns away during a campaign stop in Michigan, one of six states holding primaries on Tuesday.
The leak, which came just hours after Biden himself campaigned for them in the Peach State ahead of Trump's rally for Loeffler and Perdue late Monday night, was brutal. Biden's team, Politico wrote, is privately skeptical about Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock's chances. Losses by the two Democrats, too, will drastically change what Biden is able to accomplish in his administration once he takes office on Jan. 20.
ROVE: Yes, well, this happened in the aftermath of the firing of Comey. This was leaked to The New York Times, which says something about the culture inside the FBI. The only good news out of this is in all likelihood, since Comey was fired in a very short period of time, less than two weeks later, Mueller is appointed. This was probably immediately subsumed by Mueller -- the Mueller investigation and has been, I suspect, handled in an entirely appropriate way.

I don't think that we have seen the dreaded 180 from the Biden team, where it's that they won and then they're immediately ghosting us and not talking to us and not involving us in this process, Prakash said. They have involved us in several of the processes, taken our recommendations really seriously.
The agreement also scrapped NAFTA's Investor-State Dispute Settlement system, which gave corporations extensive authority to sue foreign governments, said Lori Wallach, a trade expert at Public Citizen, a left-leaning advocacy organization. That's a dramatic change, Wallach said.

The Central Valley Project — a federally run network of dams, reservoirs, and canals that waters about a third of California's irrigated farmland and provides water and electricity to millions of urban users, all from snowmelt — could become what economists called a stranded asset in such a scenario: a multi-billion-dollar public investment that lacks sufficient water to perform its tasks.
As the temperatures dropped and rain fell over the region Sunday, devoted birders returned. By midday, more than 100 people had visited the park, the majority of whom said they had come to see the bird, according to one visitor-use assistant for the National Park Service.
This year, expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when Western countries colonized poor countries, stripping them of resources and autonomy. People who work in the field know that much of the money, influence and decision-making about how to help low-income countries still comes from wealthy countries — with little input from the people who receive the assistance.
We will continue to challenge this using our rights protected under the Canadian constitution. That is what is asked of us as leaders by our people and by future generations that are praying we are standing up for the environment that we will hand down to them one day.
Many nations—including the United States—began attaching population control measures to aid packages to third-world countries, meaning that the amount of aid received became conditioned by the state's ability to coercively reduce its own population.
As Japan grapples with issues such as climate change and an aging population, however, the co-op expects to face big challenges. Climate impacts in Japan, for example, are expected to include changes in crop yields, a decline in the quality of agricultural products, and changes in the number of fish caught, according to analysis published by the government.
While reconciliation could be powerful tool — especially if Democrats use it twice in one year, as Republicans did in 2017 — the narrow margins in both chambers mean leaders will have to thread the needle in writing bills. Repealing some of the 2017 tax cuts would meet the rules and have broad Democratic support, for example, while the Green New Deal would likely have a tougher time on both counts.
We wish that the UN would pay as much attention to the majority of First Nation groups that support important projects such as the Trans Mountain and Coastal GasLink.
Within the coalition, Pablo Iglesias will serve as deputy prime minister, with a remit of combatting allegedly man-made climate change and reducing poverty under Spain's 2030 agenda, according to El Pais.

He added: I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack. But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got.
Several students at the forum criticized university President John Anderson for his perceived inaction. Others questioned the campus' climate and ongoing problems with discrimination. Anderson promised to change the culture after apologizing to students.
Winter storms have blanketed California's Sierra Nevada in snow, but the drought-prone state is still off to another drier-than-normal start to the crucial wet season, state officials said Thursday.
House Republicans start cracking - Roll Call: The number of House Republicans supporting Democrats' bills to reopen the government increased slightly on Thursday. On Thursday, the House voted 244-180 to pass a Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development spending bill and 243-183 to pass an Agriculture appropriations bill for fiscal 2019. The votes come after the House passed a Financial Services spending bill on Wednesday. A vote on an Interior-Environment appropriations bill is planned for Friday. The Senate has no plans to hold a vote on any of the bills.
The Duke and Duchess were so happy to reconnect with the women and hear about the projects they continue to develop to help those in their community and beyond, read the caption.
Since 1970, the ocean has warmed 40 percent more than previous estimates, according to climate scientist Zeke Hausfather, one of the authors of the study.
That's especially true for Disney, which doesn't need these films to supercharge its already-robust Disney Plus service. Executives know that billions await if they just hold out. In fact, it's not even clear that all of Warner Bros.' films will really be on HBO Max. A few of them, such as Dune, have deals or financial backers that may not give the studio the final say.
That would provide a no-strings-attached income supplement to anyone living on less than $34,000 individually or $48,000 as a couple.
People seeking permits for big projects can face significant uncertainty and delays that can increase costs, derail important projects and threaten jobs for American workers and labor union members, Trump said.
LINDA EMOND: (Singing) There were others - quite a few. Some were strangers. Some I knew. But he always comes home to me. Late for dinner quite a lot. Do I argue? I do not. For I wake in the morning and see he's laying there close to me at home. I know you think I'm foolish. I ought to be more strong, combat him, defy him. But I say you're wrong. I've children, a marriage. I'd do it all again. It's just an inconvenience he puts me through now and then. So I'm staying.
The partisanship, rancor and dysfunction of the Trump shutdown is exactly what voters rebuked in November, said Rep.-elect Joe Neguse of Colorado, a new leader of the freshmen class, in the Democrats' weekly address. And that is why on Jan. 3rd, when the new Democratic House majority arrives, we will bring the hope, vision and goals of effective governance back to the forefront.
Meanwhile in Albany, the new Democratic majorities in both houses of the New York Legislature are preparing to push the Climate and Community Protection Act, a bill that would mandate 100 percent renewable energy across the state by 2050. The CCPA has repeatedly passed in the state Assembly since it was first introduced in 2016, but the previous Republican majority in the state Senate refused to hold a vote on it. Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), who now says he wants to shift the state to 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2040, declined to champion the legislation last year.
We think Democrats generally are underestimating the potential for Trump's re-election. But there's no denying that the party's nomination is viewed as a prize of great value.
The Bray family, at least, is erring on the side of not underplaying the situation — or the need for everyone to contribute to solutions. Amber Bray recalls the day the U.N. panel issued its 12-year warning. When Arianna came home from school, Amber told me, she hugged her daughter tight and, with tears in her eyes, apologized. Both said that day changed their perspective and rallied the family to work harder to reduce its environmental impact. Some parents might think they should shield their children from the realities, Amber says. I believe it's my job as a parent to prepare my children to be ready, make good choices, be part of the solution. It's a disservice to our children if we don't teach them about life's dangers and how to protect themselves, even as we pray it is never necessary.

After the new Congress is sworn in Thursday, Democrats are expected to formally elect Pelosi as speaker, the top-ranking official on Capitol Hill and second in succession to the presidency. She previously served as speaker when Democrats last held control of the House, from 2007 to 2010.

For example, millennial drivers living with their parents typically pay far higher annual premiums ($1,750) versus other demographics, a Compare.com study determined. But those price premiums are just the average, according to the website's CEO, Andrew Rose. That makes shopping around all the more important, he said.
If Warnock and Ossoff do win, Democrats will have full control of Washington for the first time in a decade, since they lost the House in 2010.

So far, two other indigenous people — an 87-year-old woman from Para and a man from Manaus — have died from coronavirus. Brazil has had more than 19,600 confirmed cases and over 1,000 deaths from COVID-19.
The mobilization effort paid off. Turnout among Black voters jumped across the state, from Atlanta to smaller cities like Savannah to rural counties with large Black populations in the state's southwest, after lagging behind other groups during the general election. It was the major reason Warnock and Ossoff were able to improve on Biden's performance from November.
Trump called the original NAFTA a catastrophe and said revamping the deal was the reason he ran for president and abandoned the beautiful, simple life of luxury I lived as a private businessman and celebrity.
If Bernie does or doesn't get in, my concern is whether the progressive vote splits up and we have the same kind of nominee we had last time, said one early-state operative who was still deciding which candidate to work for. It would be great to have one strong, progressive voice. It's not going to happen.

ASTORIA, N.Y. ― A top New York City councilman is preparing to introduce a bill mandating that the city come up with a plan by the end of the year to phase out nearly two dozen gas-fired power plants and replace them with renewable sources of electricity.
They love him in Israel and India. In the Philippines and Kenya. Oh, and in Nigeria.
The survey published Wednesday was conducted in the spring and summer of 2019, well before the Trump administration's slaying of Gen. Qasem Soleimani, an action that has brought fresh scrutiny to one of Trump's signature foreign policy moves: exiting the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. It has led to increased tensions between Tehran and Washington.
So is this sudden cooling an even-worse thing? Not necessarily. As Brown goes on to explain in his piece, you can't extrapolate trends from such a short time scale. Well, not unless you're a climate alarmist… As we know from long experience, if it had been the other way round – if the planet had warmed by 0.56 degrees C rather than cooled, the media would have been all over it.
SENATOR DICK DURBIN: Well, I would just say, do you remember the President's words, how could you forget, a concrete wall, two thousand miles long from sea to shining sea, paid for by the Mexicans. How many times did he say that to the American people? That is not what any of us have ever voted for in the past.
Chlorophytum comosum, a kind of spider plant, can take up more than 90% of o-Xylene, found in fuels, and p-Xylene, found in plastic and rubber products. Smokers may also want to keep this plant around: Over a few days, it can absorb 90% of formaldehyde and carbon monoxide, ingredients of cigarette smoke.
I saw it, and it made me mad, Harris writes. I have too many memories of my brilliant mother, a breast cancer researcher who migrated from India to go to graduate school, being treated as though she were dumb because of her accent. Memories of her being followed around a department store with suspicion, because surely a brown-skinned woman like her couldn't afford the dress or the blouse she had chosen.

The architects of the Paris Agreement included Christiana Figueres, who until recently led the UNFCCC.
One thing that has happened in the polling is that the border wall has gotten a little bit more popular. It's still net unpopular right now. Forty-two percent of people say they support a wall. That's up from 34 percent a year ago. But 54 percent oppose the idea, down from 63 percent a year ago.
The idea that the Chinese Communist Party will live up to the goal of abolishing slave labour appears to stand in direct contradiction to actual CCP policy, however, as the country has been accused of building factories in at least 135 concentration camps in the Xinjiang region, alone.

With money came staff and the need to scale his operation in less than half the time of some of his competitors. His Iowa state director hit the ground in the first days of May. By September, the campaign was opening 20 offices in the state in 20 days. The Buttigieg campaign had to find what talent was left in other early states, too.
In the 19th century, debates over drivers of economic growth - tariffs or free trade - dominated the political scene. Mercifully, the idea of free trade has persisted but it now faces serious challenges.
I mean, I liked him. We went off for coffee after our committee meetings a couple of times, says Michael Bender, an emeritus professor of geoscience and climate researcher.
One of the reasons we published this paper was that these explosively developing cyclones were most prevalent during the wintertime — and the winds themselves tended to be of hurricane force. Impacts of these cases were often comparable to those of hurricanes. But many people would mistakenly let their guard down once hurricane season was over. This happened a lot with marine and coastal interests. Our goal was to help raise awareness that damaging ocean storms don't just happen during the summer.
As Bloomberg News has reported, Bolsonaro carried chunks of metal with him on the campaign trail, all to make a point about the value of mining. One of those chunks was of niobium, which is one of the rare-earth elements that undergird the modern economy. Because it is needed to strengthen steel and semiconductors, niobium is precious; it sells for about $42,000 a ton. Brazil has 40 million tons of niobium, and if we do the math, that's $1.68 trillion—which is a lot for a country whose annual GDP totals barely more than $2 trillion. The metal is already being mined in Brazil, but Bolsonaro's point is that there's a lot more niobium in the country–and many other rare earths, too; Brazilians just have to find them and get them out of the ground.
As has been the case in other contests, Sanders is boosted by solid support from younger voters. Nearly half of voters under 45 in California — and more than half in Texas — pick Sanders as their first choice. In California, Sanders is the first choice among white and Hispanic voters, while he trails Biden among black voters. In Texas, he polls about evenly among white voters with Biden and Warren, but leads among Hispanic voters.
The remarkable event is called a Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW), and it involves the temperatures 50,000 to 100,000 feet above the ground. It disrupts the typical winter climate pattern in the Arctic stratosphere famously known as the polar vortex, and typically leads to more extreme winter weather in parts of the United States.
Wall Street closed the books on 2020 with a decidedly good year for U.S. stocks. But as is so often the case, your performance varied significantly depending on what you owned.
And on climate change, nearly two-thirds of Americans believe government should act more aggressively to combat climate change. They also want the government to go further to reduce greenhouse gases, restrict power plant emissions, require more fuel-efficient cars and tax corporations based on their emissions.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But you support a drawdown?
Sanders is trying to counter the assumption of many in the so-called Democratic establishment that he is too liberal to win a general election.
Democrats now expect Rep. Nancy Pelosi to become the next speaker of the House after she put down several small rebellions by centrists. But at least one House Democrat is already facing a primary challenge over her refusal to back Pelosi (D-Calif.), and at least nine more are being looked over by left-wing groups that want to continue moving the party in their direction.

But such a phenomenon has marked the late innings of all great bull markets, he argued. And the current run-up from the March 2009 low is unlikely to be an exception.
The team's findings provide a method to separate the costs of the different variables — vital pieces of the puzzle for policy makers who must weigh the costs of action versus inaction. Armed with this understanding, they can use cost-benefit calculations to determine how, and how much, to invest in climate mitigation and adaptation.

In 1980, Congress passed legislation to require credit unions to cap interest rates on their loans at no more than 15 percent. And, that law has worked well. Unlike big banks, credit unions did not receive a huge bailout from the taxpayers of this country. It is time to extend this cap to every lender in America.

Privately, his advisers point to that as a key pivot point in Buttigieg's campaign. Instead of delivering a triumphant victory speech on national television to a party eager for a savior, he was slammed for declaring victory prematurely. Instead of a week of coverage of his triumph, outlets focused on the reporting debacle.
In 1965, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., said that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.
A draft proposal, which calls for a select committee to be formed to create an official plan, calls for eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and agriculture while dramatically expanding energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable sources as well. It also demands a job guarantee program offering a living wage job to every person who wants one.

Unlike the Stranger, Rousseau is not proposing new laws for a new city but defending the existing laws of what he regards as an exceptionally healthy modern polity. Unlike the Stranger, Rousseau is not seeking to moderate excessive manliness, but to warn the Genevans against an unhealthy ascendance of women and feminine tastes, which would inevitably accompany the introduction of a theater into their city.
In India alone, 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020, according to a government report. And an August report from the World Resources Institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one-quarter of the global population — including Botswana, India, Iran and Mexico — are using as much or more water than they can replace.
Studying that emotional response forced Duffy to reevaluate her syllabus. This past fall, she added a second lesson about solutions, highlighting the drop in the cost of renewable energy and improvements in battery technology for storing clean energy. It's a strategy Duffy says is necessary for any climate communicator, but especially one working with young minds. There's a danger in having the instruction emphasize climate catastrophe, she says. It's tempting to say how bad things are, how much we need to stop it. But at some point you've accidentally said this is a foregone conclusion. We can overemphasize how scary it is to the point where people feel hopeless and panicked.
So let's take a moment to drill down, pun intended, on that new discovery. At current prices, that new oil, in the waters south of New Orleans, is worth about $59 billion. For purposes of comparison, the GDP of the entire state of Louisiana in 2017 was $246 billion. Which is to say, $59 billion is an appreciable bump.

The shipshape Pfalz Castle (built in the middle of the river in the 1300s) worked effectively to tax medieval river traffic, raising its chains when boats came, and lowering them only when merchants had paid their duty. Those who didn't pay spent time touring its prison, on a raft at the bottom of its well. Along the Rhine, it seems each castle comes with a story.

SHANNON PETTYPIECE: Right. At this point, both side think they have a winning hand politically. No one is facing any real political pressure. And part of that, again the holidays, people weren't really paying that much attention. But for the White House, they see this (INDISTINCT) politically. Democrats, you know, they are not really feeling any political pain at this point. So that changes at the end of this coming week when Friday, when federal employees start missing their first paycheck. There are services. People will start noticing getting their passport renewed, going to a national park on the weekend. So then, you get the political pressure starting to ratchet up. But because the sides are so far apart, I don't think this ends without one side caving under political pressure, and right now no one's feeling it. So it goes on and-- and-- and there's no urgency.
As people took to the streets to demand an end to violence against Black people at the hands of law enforcement, communities attempted to address some of the underlying challenges in a number of ways.

These delicate ecosystems rely on ocean currents to supply their food and disperse their offspring, Prof Murray Roberts, who co-ordinates the Atlas project at the University of Edinburgh, told BBC News. Ocean currents are like highways spreading larvae throughout the ocean, and we know these ecosystems have been really sensitive to past changes in the Earth's climate.

Only one group of Americans disagreed. U.S. expansion caused headaches for the Mormons, who had first chosen to go to the Salt Lake Valley because it was an isolated, arid corner of far northern Mexico. By the time they arrived in the region, however, it had been conquered by the United States in the U.S.-Mexican War, a geopolitical foe they could not hope to challenge. Britain, Mexico, Native people, or, for the, Mormons, the United States itself: In 1846, it was impossible to be left alone.

The burden wouldn't necessarily need to fall on the U.S. alone. The European Union, given its similar size to the U.S. economy, could take a lead role. The U.S. could also marshal its allies in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the 37-nation club of rich democracies, to aid in the effort.
So it seems for Harris and Booker, as well.

It would send a message that companies can come to Canada and spend hundreds of millions of dollars, and years — a decade in this case — walking through a regulatory process in a country that is supposed to represent the rule of law, and then an arbitrary political decision at the end of the process, without any transparency, can suddenly scuttle all of that? he said.

Washington:Neighbors in a Northeast D.C. community quickly mobilized to help their neighbors who lost everything in a raging fire Sunday, WUSA-TV reported. Neighbors donated everything, from school supplies to toiletries. James Caviness-Bey was working overnights at Wal-Mart when he got word of the fire, with his family still inside their Madison street home. But on Wednesday night, he was able to thank D.C. firefighters for their quick response. He also recognized the person he calls the real hero: his wife, who ran back into their burning home when she realized their 2-year-old grandson was still inside. With the flames intensifying, Edwina Caviness-Bey dropped her grandson from the second floor window into her son's arms. From there, she had no choice but to jump out. She had second-degree burns, a fractured pelvis and wrist, and is still in the intensive care unit preparing for surgery. Caviness-Bey, his son and grandson all got to thank their neighbors Wednesday night. Even the family dog, whom for hours they thought had died in the blaze, made an appearance. Neighbors are planning another donation drive to support this family in the coming days. In the meantime, they have set up a GoFundMe page.
The Senate, under McConnell's leadership, has failed to act with urgency on any of this.

You don't have to know what you want, you just have to make sure that the incumbent president gets the blame for whatever goes wrong. But you also have to have some kind of an economic agenda.

Earlier this year, the organization launched an all-out defense of Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, a co-author with New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of the Green New Deal resolution, against a Democratic primary challenge from Rep. Joe Kennedy III this summer. Its successful marshalling of progressive energy behind Markey, in what most viewed as an uphill fight to win renomination, underscored the potency of the group's political operation -- and projected a sense among the Washington elite of the outsiders having a growing handle on the inside game.
So far, that has not been the response. ExxonMobil has instead reacted strongly to the claims, seeking in Texas court to depose California state officials and others involved in bringing the cases for potential claims of abuse of process, civil conspiracy, and violation of ExxonMobil's civil rights.
However, it still falls short of the goal the U.S. set in the 2015 Paris Agreement of a 26% to 28% drop below 2005 emissions levels. While President Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement in 2019, President-elect Joe Biden has vowed to rejoin it. Still, even with 2020's reduced emissions levels, the U.S. does not appear to be on track to meet the agreement's 2025 goal as economic activity picks back up, according to Rhodium Group.
Sanders's emphatic win in Nevada illustrated his potential to expand his coalition far beyond the ceiling of 25 percent or 30 percent that many party-establishment figures and commentators assumed he had. In Nevada, Sanders won with 29 percent of whites, 51 percent of Hispanics and 27 percent of blacks, according to entrance polls of Democratic caucus-goers. He won a staggering 65 percent of caucus-goers under 30 years old, and he carried every other age group except for caucus-goers over 65 years old, which former vice president Joe Biden won.

That outcome underscored one of the biggest barriers to Guthrie's work: Education and youth groups don't always see climate change as having a direct link to children if they're not being displaced by a disaster — and sometimes not even then. Still, more schools have picked up the S4CA resolution model, and in September, Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) introduced a nonbinding resolution acknowledging climate change as a social justice issue and supporting more climate education. By failing to address climate change in a meaningful way, we are failing our children, she said in a floor speech, and they know it.
The Trump administration has repeatedly pointed to declines in U.S. carbon emissions to justify its fossil fuel-focused energy dominance agenda. But a new analysis has delivered a blow to that defense, concluding that the nation's greenhouse gas emissions rose sharply in 2018.

SEN. SANDERS: Well, MARGARET, it is not only- it is not only the amount of money that we raised, and that is a phenomenal amount, it's how we raised it. We don't have a super PAC like Joe Biden. I don't go to rich people's homes like Joe Biden. I think Joe has contributions for more than $40 billionaires. What we have done is received more campaign contributions from more Americans than any candidate in the history of the United States, averaging eighteen dollars and 50 cents. This is a campaign of working people and by working people. And I'm extraordinarily proud of that. But we have enough money now not only to take us through Super Tuesday, but take us through the entire process fueled by the contributions of working class people all across this country.

Though the president-elect narrowly won the state in November, they attribute that to a powerful anti-Trump sentiment that did not translate down the ballot. Perdue received about 88,000 more votes than Ossoff, and the top two Republicans combined got more than 636,000 votes than Warnock in the special election. One former Democratic official said few Democrats, if any, are preparing for victory.

Weinberg is far less certain about the country's long-term prospects. There are millions of people who believe Trump when he says the election was stolen from him. A new administration won't change their minds.
With warming global temperatures and most sea turtle populations naturally producing offspring above the pivotal temperature [14], it is clear that climate change poses a serious threat to the persistence of these populations.
The Kurds were happy and did greet us as liberators. But with the evil Saddam gone, Iran was also empowered and started building many of the IEDs that killed so many coalition forces.
Americans can save even more with tax-advantaged health plans. Some employers offer health savings accounts (or HSAs), which offer tax-free contributions, growth and withdrawals. Workers must have a high-deductible health plan to qualify however (which means they'd be paying more up front for their medical expenses before the insurer begins covering costs). Flexible Spending Accounts allow employees to contribute a specific amount of their salary upfront, and then use that money to spend tax-free on medical expenses throughout the year. Money in an FSA must be used before the end of the year or will be forfeited.
Added Kenney: We have a long way to go yet, but at least we feel that some of our issues are being listened to.
More recently, Trump's Interior Department finalized a rule that permanently slashed protections for hundreds of species of migratory birds by legalizing all unintentional killings, including those caused by oil and gas infrastructure, power lines and wind turbines. And the EPA completed a so-called science transparency rule that will block certain peer-reviewed scientific studies from the rule-making process.

This guaranteed a large round of unnecessary layoffs for teachers, firefighters and other public servants. But it also encouraged disastrous pandemic policies. In order to boost tax revenue to balance state budgets, governors encouraged reckless reopening strategies, hoping to get money to local businesses that would make their way to state coffers. The results for state budgets were disappointing, but more importantly, they encouraged the spread of a deadly virus.
Since the 1970s, Democrats and Republicans have sorted themselves by party, with less room for internal dissent and less of a will to criticize or challenge a president from one's own party. Both parties have been willing to grant the president more authority when it served their purpose. The main dynamic for Democrats has centered around party leaders supporting presidents who use executive action, through regulatory orders and rule making, to deal with urgent policy problems that congressional Republicans oppose. Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton turned to executive power to deal with energy and climate change when Congress refused to do so. President Barack Obama did the same on immigration after congressional obstruction prevented compromise legislation from passing.
A palm tree not only brings you memories of vacationing on a tropical beach, it also helps regulate humidity levels.
Among Republicans — even those worried about climate change — the package, with its liberal economic ideas, will also likely be a nonstarter.
On average the pattern the next few weeks should feature a ridge of high pressure with warm and dry conditions in the U.S. West and a dip in the jet stream, called a trough, in the east with disturbances (areas of low pressure) rotating around the trough. Any of these disturbances has the potential to turn into a winter storm. CBS News

We now know that women candidates have been outperforming men candidates since Donald Trump was elected, Warren said in Davenport on Sunday, according to CBS News Campaign Reporter Zak Hudak. Warren also reintroduced her argument, which she frequently made over the summer, that she's a fighter who can defeat Mr. Trump and deliver progressive victories in Washington.

MONIZ: Well, actually, first of all, let me say I stand by that Paris statement. I believe it's true, and the recent polls show that there is increasing understanding and acceptance in the public both about the realities of climate change and about the need to address it. Now, in reality, you're absolutely right. But I think the trend remains and will remain going towards lower carbon. The problem is that we were not then and we are not now working on a sufficiently accelerated path to low carbon to meet the 2 degrees, let alone the substantially less-than-2-degree, goal.
The enduring power of alarmist theories such as Ehrlich's, which somehow survive being exposed as utterly false, should give people pause before embracing similar theories and their practical corollaries, even when based on settled science.
The developing relationship between Macron and Merkel blossomed at the end of last year, when the French president announced that the Franco-German couple would become the heart of Europe and work to stop the world descending into chaos — making not-so-thinly veiled criticisms of U.S. President Donald J.

I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe.
KANDER: The interesting thing is that I listened to everybody but Kurt Weill because I knew that was a dangerous area to be walking into. I listened to lots and lots and lots of German jazz and German vaudeville music of the '20s. But I stayed away zealously from listening to Weill at all. What I think happened is that the kind of Kurt Weill musical pieces that we hear in our heads were influenced by the same thing that I was sort of digging into. His early music and more serious music is in many ways in a totally different style and quite wonderful and slightly academic. When he comes to writing to his musicals or operas, if you will, he's reflecting the sounds of those vaudeville houses and German jazz and that sort of sleazy world that I was trying to reflect, also. But the actual influence of Weill's music itself was nonexistent.
Obama's green jobs program was a notable failure, with many investments failing to pay off — most notoriously the solar panel company Solyndra, which failed after Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and others held it up as a model.
Humanities students, on the other hand, are (with, of course, brave exceptions) typically those who eschew the sciences or, at least, math. Their training is also technical, involving lots of reading and critical writing. You can often tell, when you teach this kind of class, who the scientists and the humanists are. All you have to do is write an equation on the blackboard and look at the class. Humanists' eyes will quickly glaze over. The scientists will perk up. As you read from Aristotle's Metaphysics, the opposite will happen. To bridge this gap is the challenge.

Meanwhile, advocates for agricultural workers may press Democrats to halt a new Trump rule that will drive down the minimum wage on farms. The outgoing administration has moved to phase out a survey that helps determine the base pay for agricultural guest workers; the new methodology will produce lower pay rates for poor migrant workers and slash farmers labor costs. The Labor Department finalized that rule in early November.

Tallahassee: State health officials say there were nearly 3,400 hepatitis A cases in 2019. According to statistics through Saturday, there were 3,395 cases – including 63 new cases reported the prior week. To underscore the outbreak, the Panama City News Herald reports the state totaled 1,175 reported cases of hepatitis A in the five previous years combined – with 548 of those cases in 2018, according to state Department of Health data. Hepatitis A can cause liver damage and is spread through such things as fecal matter. That can include transmission by people not properly washing their hands after going to the bathroom and contaminating food or drinks. Health officials urge people to get vaccinated against the disease. As of Saturday, Pasco County had the most cases in the state in 2019, with 414.

And I believe climate's been changing since the inception of this planet, right? All I know is what is obvious to me. And that is when it rains, the water has nowhere to go except to the Mississippi River. But is it related to - what? - driving cars and eating beef? I'm not convinced of that.
President Obama claims he is entitled to overhaul immigration laws in the name of prosecutorial discretion. It is one of those wonderfully fungible phrases in the law. Elastic because it is vague and ambiguous. Useful because it can be easily abused. Mr. Obama has appropriated this doctrine to argue he has near boundless discretion to amend, revise, waive or suspend the execution of immigration laws. As chief executive, he is empowering himself to decide what laws may be enforced or ignored and what persons may come or go across our southern border irrespective of what the law actually states.

He made a calculation that as long as this general was alive, things would be more dangerous for the United States. Soleimani was not acting as a brake on the Iranian regime. He was acting as an accelerant.
The good news, he said, is that the technology to dramatically decarbonize the global economy doesn't need to be invented — it already exists. Equally important is for consumers to understand that less-polluting ways of living can make a major difference, coupled with finding the will to maintain some of those lifestyle changes, such as flying and driving less, after the pandemic ends.

I've asked him those questions, and I'm very comfortable with those answers. So, I think you'd be a great attorney general, great job by the president to pick Mr. Barr. I see no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians, but that would be up to Mr. Mueller to make his report to attorney general and he soon will I hope.
My hope is, is that our withdraw from Syria, I assume that the president's going to fulfill it, is done in an orderly fashion. But let's recognize our withdrawal empowers Russia, it empowers Iran, it empowers the Syrians. And the ultimate result of it may be Iranian-supported militias on the northern border of Israel, which is anathema to our interests and our allies.
We've see how fluid it is. Of course I don't have billions of dollars of my own money to pour into the airwaves.

TRUMP: Dealing with these people is ridiculous. I don't know if they know how to make a deal.
Perhaps the biggest change of the Trump era is the approach of Republican leaders. In the past, they indulged these theories but never really espoused them. Today, elective officeholders embrace them openly, in the face of explicit counterevidence from the government they purport to run. National security officials have repeatedly stressed in recent weeks that Ukraine did not meddle in the 2016 election and that those who repeat the claim are advancing pro-Russian propaganda. Yet most Republican members of Congress now seem to believe this theory, pointing to a thin report in Politico that documented no top-down, coordinated interference. Trump's racism (calling Mexican immigrants rapists; telling four congresswomen of color who are all U.S. citizens to go back to their crime infested home countries) and anti-Semitism (he implies Jews are loyal primarily to Israel and motivated mostly by money) align well with old allegations that Jewish bankers and assorted globalists have enriched themselves while inflicting economic havoc on the people, as his closing 2016 television ad suggested.

There are four endemic coronaviruses [a family of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses] that circulate within humans.

Medical bills can get expensive, but patients sometimes have more control over these costs than they realize.

Simply finishing the Shasta Dam to its design height [of 800 feet] could add nine million acre-feet to the system, McClintock says. Indeed, the Trump administration, is proposing to raise the dam by 18.5 feet, increasing the capacity of the dam by 7 percent (630,000 acre-feet) — if tiny salamander species that environmentalists wish to have declared endangered do not stop plans for expansion.

Following Sanders's resounding victory in Saturday's Nevada caucuses, and with polls showing him on the rise, Democrats are entering a season of open warfare over whether Sanders (I-Vt.) is equipped to beat Trump in what could be a brutal general election. The senator and his allies insist he could, but his detractors say he is too polarizing to win in November — and could severely cost Democrats in congressional or state races if Republicans use Sanders's self-description as a democratic socialist to paint all Democrats as extreme.

The following is an abbreviated version of the conversation.
One part of Georgia to watch in the #GASen runoffs tonight is an area I like to call Ruby Red North Atlanta. Cherokee, Forsyth and Hall are the three largest Trump counties in the state.

Brainard, a Republican, said he doesn't consider climate change a political issue, but he acknowledged he sometimes has to tailor his message for different audiences. Liberal groups, for instance, love that the city replaced it's streetlights with LEDs, reducing electricity consumption and therefore the emission of greenhouse gasses. Conservative groups, he said, are usually more interested in the fact that the switch saves the city 20 percent on its electricity bill annually.
This is just one small statement that they should not continue to have undue influence over our decision-making over the existential threat against our nation, Inslee said by phone Tuesday night. This challenge calls for the scale of national effort similar to when we went to the moon, similar to when we beat fascism.
The challenge for scientists is to monitor when the AMOC may reach a tipping point when the system can't recover quickly.
President Trump decided that the status quo was unacceptable. He was and is correct. Now, I want to say it's very important. You know my views on these endless wars. It's important that the President listens to his judgment here, that he doesn't listen to the same people who got sucked into Iraq in the first place.
Thank goodness the publishing industry keeps churning out new books. Like your busy menu of Netflix or Amazon Prime offerings, there's something on publishers' lists for everyone.
Bradley isn't there yet. She still comes to these meetings and works with local biologists, representing her neighbors and others who've long since given up.
KURTIS: For example, Doug Jones is one of the most successful actors in Hollywood, but you'd never recognize him. That's because he plays most of his roles buried under 20 pounds of latex.
Some of the judges were treated as rock stars, especially Amy Coney Barrett, named by Trump to the 7th Circuit. More than one convention speaker got a rise out of audiences by recalling Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein's gaffe of telling the Catholic Barrett during her confirmation hearing that the dogma lives loudly within you, and that's of concern. The lunchtime panel on stare decisis (the legal doctrine that calls for courts to respect precedent) was full — and several attendees told me it wasn't the topic that drew them, it was the presence of Barrett moderating the panel. Judge, welcome back to Washington — and I hope you'll come back for good sometime soon! one of the panelists, Kannon Shanmugam, an appellate advocate and partner at Williams & Connolly, said to Barrett, drawing cheers from the audience.
Reinsurers, which are in the business of insuring insurance, are experts in managing risk and rarely get caught off guard. Analysts have said reinsurers may need to take a fresh look at their risk models as the planet warms and storms become more intense.
This is a good day for the Green New Deal movement, said Daniel Aldana Cohen, a University of Pennsylvania sociologist who published a study tracking the evolution of New York City climate policy in the journal Environmental Politics in September.
California saw some of the worst fires in state history late last year; the Thomas fire burned over 1,000 structures.
DICK MONKS: But this is where people want to be. I think Sanders can win because people really want him.
Jennifer Norris, an Air Force veteran and military crime analyst who has focused on Fort Hood issues since 2016, said in order to look forward, one also must look back.
JONES: OK, Lane. I'm rooting for both of us here.
Hayhoe thinks that American's resistance to climate change has more to do with the perceived solutions such as taxes, government legislation, and loss of personal liberty than with the theory of climate change and its causes.
I'm not — I'm not sure of the answer to that question, Zuckerberg replied, as if he could even be sure it was a question.
They have made a comeback in recent times. 2018 was the first time bison roamed freely in Alberta in 140 years.
It's not about Donald Trump, Ray said later. A virus is not going to just jump on a Democrat. So at times like this, we need to be coming together. No time for politics.
Patients could even save money on their medications by asking doctors and pharmacists about less-expensive versions. Many Americans assume medical expenses at set at a fixed price, but they're not, and patients can comparison shop to reduce costs. Patients can lose thousands of dollars a year by not looking around before going with a medical procedure or prescription, researchers at Harvard, Yale and Columbia Universities found. Fewer than 1% of individuals used price transparency tools, including websites or apps, to find the best prices for medical procedures and medications.
Last year, Atlanta reached a key milestone, meeting a new, stronger air quality standard for ozone. This accomplishment shows progress — but there's still more work to be done.
As the fallout from Fukushima plays out, the cooperative also runs an annual fundraising campaign to support the region's recovery, including supplying a new boat to a local fishing cooperative. The donations have also funded children to go on refresh tours to less contaminated areas for relaxation and thyroid gland checkups.

What should have been a heartwarming photo of the Australian Prime Minister posing with his wife and kids has brought out the best in Aussie banter, thanks to one minor problem: the image showed the PM, Scott Morrison, with two left feet.
As president, I will nominate and appoint people with a track record of standing up to power, rather than those who have made millions defending Wall Street CEOs. Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks will not be represented in my administration.
The National Park System Advisory Board, which was established in 1935, has typically included social and natural science academics as well as former elected officials from both parties. In recent years, it has advised Interior on how to address climate change, among other issues, and how to encourage younger visitors to frequent the parks.
Like Trump, Bush at the time had weak approval ratings and inspired deep enmity in the Democratic base — to the point that some lawmakers floated impeaching him. And while Pelosi was personally against the Iraq War and campaigned against it to win the majority, she was never heard to speak askance of Bush's manhood or any other aspect of his character.
Trump's Wall Could Just Cause Mexican Cartels to Make Better Weed
Fiscal and monetary policy are in general the main determinants of the level of employment and unemployment in our economy, as well as economic recovery at present.

Premier Jason Kenney, in a comment, thanked Aheer for denouncing this odious image and the message it sends.
He sat on the music for a while, but around November 2017, Clark got inspired again by what was going on socially and politically in the United States.
And Trump is saying, we reacted. I showed restraint. Now it's your turn, see what you're going to do, and I don't think they're going to do what everybody thinks we're going to do, because they don't really have any options.
Climate change is also making droughts more likely to occur – and more severe when they do – in Australia. While Australia is no stranger to drought, climate change has exacerbated drought conditions so that when droughts occur, the conditions are in a much hotter climate and, in some cases, with lower precipitation, according to Climate Signals.
Nothing compares to the Olympic Games as a platform for athletes to become heroes, and four years is a long time to wait for another shot at glory. An elite runner's whole career may only last eight years. Due to doping, it is now common for results to change months or even years after the last athlete crosses the finish line.
The bottom line is that central heating won't work for everyone, even if designed right, he said. We're very different people and need some sort of personalization of our environment.
Scientists said the latest data underscored the need for countries and corporations to slash greenhouse gas emissions quickly enough to bring within reach the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement to avoid catastrophic climate change.
He represents the establishment and a tradition of central control, Milloy said.
Williams, winner of best performance by an actress in a limited TV series or movie for Fosse/Verdon, also encouraged people to turn out to the polls.
Among members of Congress, Corker had one of the more bitter public feuds with Trump, which fell into public view after the senator voted against the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He referred to the White House as an adult day-care center and commented that Trump's volatility could set the United States on a path to World War III. He accused the president of debasing the country with untruths, name-calling and attempted bullying.

WALLACE: Yes, let me just really quickly explained that when the Democrats with the majority, Majority Leader Harry Reid changed it for judicial nominees short of the Supreme Court and for cabinet appointees.
If Buttigieg prevails on Monday, it will show there's a desire among some voters for a more moderate message carried by a new voice. The campaign's focus on rural areas and swing counties, combined with aggressive campaign schedule in the final few days, will give many Iowans one more chance to hear from him before making up their minds. He also built an extensive field operation, with 34 offices placed around the state.
These future-focused proposals reflect our priorities as a caucus and as a country -- including crushing the coronavirus, addressing economic disparity, combating the climate crisis, advancing inclusion, and promoting integrity in government.
The announcement from Mayor Bill de Blasio came roughly a week after the Democrat was inaugurated for a second term. It marks his strongest action yet to address global warming and its associated sea-level rise, which devastated the city with massive flooding during Superstorm Sandy in 2012.
We've had so many shocks to the system, he said. People have had a chance to reflect, to say, 'When we do get our lives back, where do we want to live and how do we want to live?'

Like Sen. Bernie Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez is a Democratic Socialist. She believes in universal healthcare, tuition-free public college, and massive government investment to combat climate change. She's been described as both an inspiring and idealistic insurgent, and as a naïve and ill-informed newcomer — as the future of the Democratic party, and as a potential obstacle to its success. Few rookie members of Congress have put such bold ideas on the national agenda and stirred up so much controversy before they were sworn in.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: No one asks how we're gonna pay for this Space Force. No one asked how we paid for a $2 trillion tax cut. We only ask how we pay for it on issues of housing, healthcare and education. How do we pay for it? With the same exact mechanisms that we pay for military increases for this Space Force. For all of these— ambitious policies.
Critics of delisting grizzly bears worry that state management would mean more dead bears, and they're right, in that state management would undoubtedly include hunting.
But the corruption allegations that long swirled around him have solidified. Top aides are now state's witnesses. Police recommend that he be charged with fraud, bribery and breach of trust. In one case, he is accused of accepting bribes in relation to gifts worth $300,000 from wealthy business executives. In the most serious case, he is suspected of influencing regulatory decisions that netted hundreds of millions of dollars for the telecommunications company Bezeq in return for favorable coverage on a news site it owned.
While our campaign has won the ideological debate, we are losing the debate over electability, Sanders said. The recent underdog added that he disagrees that Biden is the stronger candidate to take on President Trump, but that is what millions of Democrats and independents today believe.

When asked about the differentiating views between her and Sanders, Warren said, Well, Bernie sees this differently, obviously…. you'll have to ask Bernie his reasons.
Just a few days later, as soon as she got to Washington, she paid a visit to climate change activists who were occupying her party leader Nancy Pelosi's office. She was the only newly elected member of Congress who decided to drop by during the sit-in, and she called on Pelosi to create a select committee on climate change without any members of Congress who accept money from the fossil fuel industry.
President Trump has stated tonight, and, over and over again in recent weeks, that this country faces a national emergency, said Sanders, who is said to be considering a run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. Well, he's right. But it's an emergency and a crisis that he himself has created.
✅ Michelle Rempel does not represent me.
She has also courted controversy by picking a fight with Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono. Gabbard, in an op-ed in The Hill, accused Hirono of fomenting religious bigotry by questioning one of Mr. Trump's judicial nominees about his membership in the Knights of Columbus.
No one is predicting a 200-yard performance like Howard's. Irv Sr., who was used mostly as a blocker at Notre Dame, knows for tight ends that kind of performance, only happens once in a lifetime.
Sunrise is trying to pull off a balancing act, of keeping one foot inside the halls of power and another with its activist ranks on the streets, that grassroots organizations often tout but rarely accomplish.
Both Republicans and Democrats also said they believe the move would likely be challenged in court, blocking construction of a wall the administration has said is needed immediately to address an urgent crisis on the border.

I found some clues during the three days of the national convention at the Mayflower Hotel that bookended the gala. The judges project is still clearly in high gear, and with two sitting Supreme Court justices in their 80s — Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 85, and Stephen Breyer, 80 — there's an incentive to keep the list of candidates fresh. Numerous candidates-in-waiting were on display at the conference. I counted 24 appeals court judges on the program — including 15 just elevated by Trump — and at least 11 of the names on Trump's expanded list of potential Supreme Court nominees were scheduled to participate over the three days.
McConnell continued: The past eighteen days have shown that Democrats' refusal to negotiate is not due to any principled objection, but simply due to partisan spite for the president. For the men and women of the Border Patrol, for the safety of American families, and for all Americans who deserve a fully operational federal government, I sincerely hope my Democratic colleagues will come to the table and help deliver a solution.
One immediate result voters would notice if Ossoff and Warnock win would be higher direct payments to individuals and families in economic distress due to the coronavirus, Biden said.
The decisions to tap former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm to lead the Energy Department and Michael Regan , now the secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, to head the Environmental Protection Agency have also been met with enthusiasm. But by installing Kerry, McCarthy and Ali Zaidi as his top domestic national climate advisers, Biden has assembled a team with institutional chops and movement trust to lead his climate efforts.
CAROLLA: What we have to do is all stop apologizing at the same time. I mean, if there's one guy with a gun, we just have pool cues and we all need to charge them at once. If we do it one by one, we'll be taken out one by one.
I do think that when there's a wide spectrum of debate on an issue, that is where the public plays a role. That is where the public needs to call their member of Congress and say, 'This is something that I care about,'  she told NPR, adding, Where I do have trust is in my colleagues' capacity to change and evolve and be adaptable and listen to their constituents.
With the upcoming change in administrations, we expect that there will be extraordinary challenges for California in the uncertain times ahead, said the lawmakers.

The viral video the man mentioned appears to be a clip that has been inaccurately characterized by guns-rights groups and on social media in recent days. The clip was taken from a livestream by Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman and presidential candidate who endorsed Biden last week. The video shows Biden in a restaurant with O'Rourke and Amy Sanders O'Rourke, his wife. Biden looks into the camera and praises O'Rourke for his stance on gun control and climate change, and says he will recruit him to work in his administration if elected.
Oceans are warming primarily because of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere by human activity. Emissions in the United States jumped 3.4 percent last year from 2017 — the second-largest annual increase in more than two decades, according to a preliminary estimate by the economic research company Rhodium Group.
The larger point here, Chris, is that we don't have a fundamental disagreement between Democrats who refuse to invest in border security and want open borders and a president who is determined to protect our country. Far from it. All of us have voted for more investment in border security, several times. And the compromise that we worked out before the end of last year, which passed the Senate unanimously, it will give the president another $1.3 billion for border security on top of the $1.3 billion from last year that hasn't been fully spent yet.
So much work has been done to advance the cause with Democrats that pro-pot groups are now turning their sights to Republicans.

But where is everybody else? You might ask. And-- and they are still mulling it. I think we have at least seven Democratic senators who are thinking about it, some big city and small city mayors, Governor Inslee of Washington State said this week he's still thinking about it. So you will see in the coming weeks continued discussions about this people saying, yeah, I'm still thinking about it. Unless you think it's just empty talk, I-- I heard a story from somebody who met the former vice president at an event and said to him, my mother really wants you to run.

Friday's carnival-like protest brought the cobbled streets of the Lausanne city centre to a standstill, with demonstrators calling for urgent climate action and booing as they passed a branch of Credit Suisse, which campaigners criticise for its fossil fuel investments.
Those of us who claim to follow Christ have an opportunity, if not a responsibility, to fix what is broken and to help bring back a kind and just society that honors every person as a beloved child of God.

In a separate report released on Wednesday, 20 scientists from 13 institutions from around the world reported that 2020 had the highest upper ocean temperatures on record. The study focused on the upper 2,000 meters of the world's oceans. The oceans act like a bank account accumulating interest — more than 90% of excess heat from climate change is stored in the oceans.
She noted that she later found her brother's camera, complete with photographs at the apartment that night of people who had vowed that they were never there. When she pushed for an independent medical examination, she was told it seemed more like her brother had been hit, and his brain was jarred.
Now two years later, Obama was elected in part on his promise to pull us out of Iraq. Of course, Obama took a completely different approach. He made things worse. He thought that as long as we ended combat operations in Iraq, we could bribe Iran to get better behavior from Iran. So, the $1.7 billion was the settlement of a decades old arbitration claim between the U.S. and Iran. An initial 400 million of euros, Swiss francs and other foreign currency was delivered on pallets, January 17th. Now that's the same day, Tehran agreed to release four American prisoners.

The Congress Party, which ran Delhi for 15 years from 1998 to 2013, was rendered irrelevant in this election, ending up with zero seats again. There were a few rallies that Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi addressed, but these barely registered with voters.
But in 1986 he ran for the U.S. Senate and won — only to be turned out of office by voters after one term. North Carolina always was ambivalent about Sanford; he ran in statewide elections four times, winning twice and losing twice.
In the Opinion essay No More Phones and Other Tech Predictions for the Next Decade, Kara Swisher expresses her belief that technology will bring positive changes in the next few years:
In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in July in Little Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania, one that upheld a Trump administration rule exempting religious groups from Obamacare's contraceptive mandate, self-professed Catholic Biden vowed to reverse protections for religious groups such as the Little Sisters.
Last month, Van Drew pivoted in a different direction. He joined the Republican Party and pledged his undying support for Trump, thrusting the once quiet, below-the-radar South Jersey district into the center of the national debate over the potential perils and payoffs of Trump's impeachment for both parties.
The study also lays to rest a long-standing discrepancy in the climate science community, namely the question of why climate models over-project ocean heating. According to this new study, it turns out they don't.
The politics have drastically changed since then, R.L. Miller, the president of the political action committee Climate Hawks Vote, said by email. Sunrise is a grassroots-driven group, unlike some of the top-down green groups pushing Waxman-Markey, and they have both energy and moral clarity on their side.
A different type of health threat is posed by climate change and air pollution, which also made the list of biggest concerns.
You'd end up with a Chancellor who suddenly revealed himself to be as bad as, if not worse than, Philip Hammond — only one who is entirely unsackable, because he pushes all the appropriate racial/religious minority buttons.
Sanders: I have, of course. I am sorry for what Secretary Clinton had to say. I know she said that nobody likes me, right? I mean, this is not the kind of rhetoric that we need right now when we are trying to bring the Democratic Party together to defeat the most dangerous president in American history.
This year's fires fit into an established seasonal agricultural pattern, Brink said. It's the best time to burn because the vegetation is dry. [Farmers] wait for the dry season and they start burning and clearing the areas so that their cattle can graze. And that's what we're suspecting is going on down there.
This really seems to be an attempt by Wheeler to permanently let major polluters trample on public health, said Benjamin Levitan, a senior attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund advocacy group. It ties the hands of future administrations in how they can protect the public health.
Today Mayor de Blasio turned his back on millions of first responders, police officers, firefighters and other public employees who depend on their pensions to provide for themselves and their families in retirement, API New York Executive Director Karen Moreau said in a statement. Government pension managers have a responsibility by law to seek the greatest return for their investors and pensions that invest in oil and natural gas companies have historically delivered a higher return than other investments. Deliberately hurting pension holders, like the fine men and women who keep our city safe, is a disgraceful way to score cheap political points.
At the very best, the ecosystem becomes less diverse, Wyneken added. At its worst, it could lead to the collapse of entire fisheries.
When the far-right movement built a ground swell and pushed back on things like Waxman-Markey, there was no countervailing movement force to challenge that, said Mitchell. We plan on having a 50-state strategy that is rooted outside, in order to shore up Congress because we know that every single member is going to need to be held accountable.
At the same time, the Alberta oil industry is facing increasing pressure from other provinces and environmentalists to cut carbon emissions and transition to green energy.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So, Nate, it's not fire season for most of the country right now.
The argument over climate change has been raging for decades, and yet only in the past few years has it really gained momentum. The 2016 Democratic platform was ambitious; it called for getting 50 percent of our electricity from clean sources within a decade, and for reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 80 percent by 2050.
Senator Hatch has some of the most tech-literate staff on Capitol Hill and has authored more tech legislation than anyone, Whitlock wrote to The Washington Post.

Oldenborgh was one of a team of 17 climate scientists from a collaborative group called World Weather Attribution (WWA), which conducted the study. The WWA was founded in 2015 to perform forensic analyses on extreme weather events like heat waves, droughts and floods.
Biden's fading position in Iowa is contrasted by the central role he and his youngest son, Hunter, continue to play in the impeachment proceedings. This week, Trump's legal team laid out its case for why the president had good reason to suggest Ukraine look into Hunter Biden's role with the Ukrainian natural gas giant, Burisma Holdings. Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a member of the legal team, specifically noted that Hunter was paid $83,000 per month for a role he had little qualification to hold. She further argued the arrangement was rife with potential conflicts of interest, especially because Joe Biden led U.S. policy with Ukraine for most of the Obama administration.

Experts say the divisive political climate in the U.S. likely hasn't helped. The United States can and should raise happiness by addressing America's multi-faceted social crisis — rising inequality, corruption, isolation, and distrust — rather than focusing exclusively or even mainly on economic growth, especially since the concrete proposals along these lines would exacerbate rather than ameliorate the deepening social crisis, the report added.
We're continuing to build in areas in the urban-wildfire interface, and it's going to lead to damages to the larger economy, Nik Steinberg, head of analytics for Four Twenty Seven, a climate-change research group, recently told CBS MoneyWatch.

Following the results in Iowa and New Hampshire, which showed Sanders in a strong position, the Bloomberg campaign saw an opportunity to capitalize on moderate candidates splitting the rest of the field, calling on others to drop out and rally behind him as the only viable alternative to Sanders. A campaign memo suggested the race for the nomination was between two candidates, Bloomberg and Sanders, and also warned that if Sanders were the nominee, he would eventually lose to Mr. Trump in the fall.
Light, shadow and dangling materials make the work of Shana Kohnstamm, Sarah Stefana Smith and Steve Wanna the show's most mercurial. Made of wool, wire and resin, Kohnstamm's Gravitas suspends three organic-looking sacs from metallic discs in exquisite tension. Smith's Flag to the Abyss is a banner of black fabric and plastic, evoking death but also infinity. Wanna's Christo-like Within Without encloses the stairway entrance to the second-floor gallery in gossamer fabric, outlined by floor-level light strips. The installation, accompanied by its own discreet soundtrack, retains the right angles of the space it defines, yet its hard lines are gently blurred with every ripple of air.
President Trump's latest remarks about immigrants follows criticisms last month made by Professor Philip Alston, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, about growing inequality in the U.S. He released a report heaping scorn on what he described as the Trump administration's dramatic change of direction in U.S. policies relating to inequality and extreme poverty. He cited the administration's current tax proposals and dramatic cuts in welfare.
His son has more modest expectations though Irv Sr. said, He definitely wants to ... have a great game.

The transportation sector was the largest source of carbon emissions last year, with a slight drop in gasoline demand more than offset by increased trucking and air travel. Transport-sector emissions grew 1 percent last year, the same as 2017, according to Rhodium. In this sector, increases in efficiency—doing more with less power—and a move toward electric transport is beginning to make a dent, although a small one.
Bonier said the runoff has also seen a surge of new Black voters. Of the over 102,000 people who cast ballots in the runoff after not doing so in the general election, 40% were Black. (A typical Georgia electorate is roughly one-third Black.)

Biden delivered a special address Tuesday in New York on the situation with Iran. Standing in front of American flags, Biden said the airstrike proved Trump to be dangerously incompetent. He accused the president of a haphazard decision process and a reckless disregard of the consequences that would surely follow. He added that Trump has failed to provide a sober-minded explanation for the airstrike, which he said has put the U.S. and Iran on a collision course.
Presidential candidates from neighboring Massachusetts have a history of winning the first-in-the-nation primary. Think Michael Dukakis in 1988, Paul Tsongas in 1992, John Kerry in 2004, and Mitt Romney in 2012.

The report referred to the CRU as being in the eye of the storm in generating data necessary to address the issue of climate change. It said times had changed since the unit started 30 years ago and scientists needed to be wary of the new arena of comment on the internet.
Marcelo Gleiser is a theoretical physicist and writer — and a professor of natural philosophy, physics and astronomy at Dartmouth College. He is the director of the Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Engagement at Dartmouth, co-founder of 13.7 and an active promoter of science to the general public.

He opened with a list of people victimized by the three-week shutdown of the federal government, including the disabled, their children and the elderly on food stamps, small businesses and farmers owed financial assistance, and would-be homeowners or sellers awaiting the processing of mortgage applications. (He didn't mention, however, that the Trump administration has continued processing oil and gas drilling permits, according to Bloomberg.)
How troubled are you by these allegations and this evidence of alleged sexism and racism?
New York state generates just 5 percent of its electricity from wind or solar. The New York City area consumes roughly 60 percent of all power in the state, but produces just 40 percent.

The authors argue the name is meant to evoke the glory days of Alberta before it starting being taken advantage of by the federal government.
We are clearly not going to build a border wall funded by Mexico but we should negotiate.
A year ago, United Nations scientists issued a dire warning to humanity: To keep global warming within tolerable limits, we need to cut greenhouse gas emissions by an unheard-of 7.6 percent annually. Twelve months later, though, the world just about hit that target — unintentionally, and at the terrible cost of more than 1.5 million lives. The coronavirus shutdowns and resulting economic devastation led to the biggest decline in planet-warming emissions in human history: about 7 percent.
SEN. SANDERS: Well, actually, we have. I mean, that's a very fair question. And my campaign has spoken to public health officials on that issue. And right now, we are planning to do rallies not only in California, but in Utah, Minnesota and other states around the country.
That creates an ongoing strong potential role for financing and investments into reductions and removals of emissions, he said.
As is so often the case, Trump forces Democrats to reveal themselves and the media. They're so caught up with resisting and hating Trump for everything he does and breeze that over the weekend, they literally sounded more empathetic to the mourners of an Iranian mass murderer than to the families of the soldiers he killed and maimed with attacks carried out inside Iraq.

We should be worried, as Cohen points out, that Trump is not merely incoherent but also choosing decline for America. Perhaps his outbursts are an expression of something deeper and more consequential: a permanent shift, among American leaders, away from the dominant postwar conception of U.S. foreign policy. . . . Trump's foreign policy vision would amount to a doctrine—one in which the United States is merely one great power among others. In this view, Washington should pursue its own interests, stand for freedom chiefly at home and only intermittently abroad, and reject as a matter of principle the international organizations that previous generations of U.S. leaders so carefully built.
On that occasion, the Pope also said that politicians had been distracted in implementing important measures to curb carbon emissions and blamed the sluggish adoption of COP21 protocols on an economy which seek profit above all else.
Yeah, I think that's right. I think Dan tried to get me to a place of accessing my intuitive songwriting because, like you said, Carole King, Curtis Mayfield, those are such finely crafted songs. Each one is like a watch, or something. We both love 45s, these singles that sound raw and from the gut. I think the idea of this record was to find a midpoint between something that feels good in the brain and something that feels good in the gut and in the ear.

KANDER: I don't know exactly how to answer that. I really don't want to sound phony on this. Most of the fun of writing is the fun of writing and rehearsing and hearing people sing it and working with that. What happens later, that includes going through to a complete Broadway production or whatever, is kind of secondary. I don't think I'm - I don't think I'm lying here. It's great when it happens. But the real fun is writing it and - or having Linda sing it. I think it would probably upset Fred more than me. I'm sad about it and a little bitter, but not overwhelmed because you just keep on writing.

Chicago: The state will stop collecting fines against drivers who are ticketed after cameras catch them violating red lights, Comptroller Susana Mendoza said Monday. She said poor and minority motorists appear to be most affected by the $100 tickets, which can double if not timely paid. She also noted a federal investigation of relationships between some communities and a red light vendor. The new policy starts Feb. 6. This system is clearly broken, Mendoza said. I am exercising the moral authority to prevent state resources being used to assist a shady process that victimizes taxpayers. A 2012 state law allows local governments to use the comptroller's office to collect debts. Unpaid traffic tickets, for example, can be deducted from tax refunds. Mendoza said communities can hire private debt collectors instead.
Emission credits are a debated approach among environmental advocates. Critics worry the system doesn't encourage a quick enough shift from fossil-fuel burning NG00, -0.59% toward renewables ICLN, -2.75% , while proponents welcome market-based approaches for balancing the globe's energy needs against science-backed warming concerns. Taxing pollution is a penalty-based approach that is also gaining traction in some countries.

In past decisions, the U.S. Supreme Court has cautioned the executive branch that its prosecutorial discretion, while broad, is not unfettered. It is subject to restrictions. The doctrine may not be used to adopt a sweeping policy of non-enforcement of the law. It applies only to decisions not to prosecute or expel specific individuals or small groups of people, typically for exigent reasons like war, civil unrest or political persecution.

WALTZ: They're stopped. So, I think that's the dynamic. The President understands the dynamic. And to the Atlantic, we're not looking to build Switzerland. The Trump administration is not looking to create Switzerland or a perfect democracy, but we do still have a counter-terrorism mission.
From there, the one thing animating Cheney is something called the Unitary Executive Theory (UET), which basically says that whatever the president of the United States does is legal because he is the president.
There is one main issue that is central to the rest, and that is the issue of war and peace, Gabbard added. I look forward to being able to get into this and to talk about it in depth when we make our announcement.
Vice is nowhere near as awful as W., Oliver Stone's disastrous George W. Bush biopic, but at the very least, Stone tried to understand and explain his subject.

If you take the oceans out of the equation, on land 2020 was far and away the warmest year on record, having warmed almost 2 °C above pre-industrial levels. This warming dries out vegetation and soil, expands deserts and inflames wildfires like those that tore through the western U.S. in recent months.
This is about so much more than COVID assistance, though. If Democrats hold a Senate majority, Biden should be able to make progress on key issues like the economy, health care, immigration and climate change.
Coral is very sensitive to increases in water temperature. When the water is too warm the corals bleach, turning white. A 2016 study estimates that 98 percent of coral reefs worldwide will experience bleaching-level stress each year by 2050.
Since then, the greens and the Democrats have upped the ante: In 2017, some Congressional Democrats introduced legislation eliminating carbon fuel emissions by 2035. More recently, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has rallied Democrats to the target of ending carbon emissions by 2030.

It's now illegal in the state to sell or distribute over-the-counter sunscreens containing oxybenzone and octinoxate, though wearing them is still allowed.
The ground floors in this stooped and shrinking city have already been abandoned. Life is lived on the first story and above. Artisans like Saverio Pastor, one of the last who patiently crafts oar locks for the city's gondolas, are becoming scarce. While residents weigh moving out, the tourists keep marching in, donning neon booties and learning to walk on water or in single file on the hastily assembled footbridges that lace through what may be a doomed city.
Let's talk in language that is understood across the heartland about faith, Buttigieg said. If you believe that God is watching as poison is being belched into the air of creation, and people are being harmed by it — countries are at risk of vanishing in low-lying areas — what do you suppose God thinks of that? I bet He thinks it's messed up.
BALDWIN: You know, I love these guys. But we have a - different political views.
And they will continue their oversight of the Trump administration and Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Besides the tax-cut gambit, Republicans threw a few barbs across the aisle. Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), one of only 13 women in House GOP ranks, nominated Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) by praising him as a leader who would stand against the fraud of socialism — a reference to the hard-left lawmakers who have pushed Democratic leaders and threatened to oppose them if they resist.

Those who resist change are reminiscent of the ex-Confederates who, in the years following the Civil War, preferred to dream of a South that never was and never could be rather than accept one that was within the reach of all, if they would join together and make it so, historian John Hope Franklin wrote in the foreword for Democracy Betrayed in 1998. But many whites in the post-Civil War South saw change — any change — as unsettling and dangerous, and they wanted no part of it.
WALLACE: Guy, first of all, your reaction to Donna, but also, how do you see this playing out? Do you think this is a real rift between the president and his attorney general?

The group tracked the real-time energy and emissions impact of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout 2020. It estimates that the historic shock to economic activity led to a 10.3% drop in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2020. This finding is based on preliminary economic and energy data.
Philadelphia Inquirer: Nobody ever warns the patients at Pennsylvania Hospital about Pete Schiavo, 'The Groin Crusher.' The first time most people meet Schiavo, they've just come out of a coronary procedure and he's explaining that after the catheters are pulled out of their femoral artery, he's going to apply pressure to their groin for 20 to 40 minutes to aid in clotting. Awkward! Or it would be, if it was anyone else but Schiavo, a gregarious, emotional, wisecracking guy who is all South Philly… He's won awards, had money donated in his name, and gets stopped all the time by former patients who want to buy him drinks or dinner. 'I'm holding someone's groin for 20 minutes, they tend to remember me and nobody else,' Schiavo said. 'I tell them: 'I can promise you two things when I'm done: You'll never forget my name or my face.' And they never do.'

Fed chair Powell predicts economy will not plunge into a recession in 2019 - WaPo
This billionaire who's made his life's wealth in the financial services industry is now saying that and, look, this is not -- it's not that Michael Bloomberg was burning a bra or burning the flag at Woodstock when he was a teenager. He said these several years ago, a few short years ago as mayor of New York and it's the way he said it.
In addition to a traditional four-year college, the money can also be used for vocational schools, two-year colleges and other institutions.
It's been a little over three months since Bloomberg joined the Democratic primary race. Though he had initially declined to run in 2020, the billionaire entered the campaign fray because he had no confidence that anyone in the field could beat President Trump in November.
The report also notes that the decline in emissions came with an enormous toll of significant economic damage and human suffering.
It's going to be a test of democracy, won't it, once White people are no longer in the majority? One of the very informative books I've been reading was Isabel Wilkerson's Caste. One of her points is that [racism] has always kind of been here. The changes during the civil rights movement were not super durable and the backlash with Obama, a lot of that came back or was unmasked, I don't know what the right word is, but it showed itself in these sort of racist forms and it became okay again to have, not [former Alabama] Governor Wallace saying Segregation today, segregation forever, but closer, in terms of really doubling down and defending these Confederate monuments and the like and the protests in Charlottesville and some really naked racism that has been shown.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg, literally. Warm water hastens the rate of glaciers melting, and expands the water column, and together the two phenomena raise sea levels. By 2100 the IPCC estimates sea levels may rise 2 to 3 feet, and some studies say more. The destabilizing effects of this on society are incalculable.

She declared House Democrats would vote Thursday to reopen the government without funding the wall — on Republican-written legislation, a move orchestrated to isolate Trump and split the GOP around him.

Over the past 40 years, damage from major weather and climate disasters has cost the United States nearly $2 trillion dollars. A closer look at the data reveals that recently the cost of such incidents has been escalating quickly, due in part to human-caused climate change.
New Year's resolutions often mean doing more, like working out more or saving more for retirement. But one common thread we found was that if you want to lower your climate footprint, you can find some success in simply consuming less. And it will save you money, too.

And that's something that I think we're seeing with the fires [in Australia and California that have been associated with climate change], with the police shootings, with these crazy conspiracies that are driving decision-makers. So I don't know if callous is the right word to describe what we're becoming, but these things that we're seeing as tragedies are becoming more routine and we're thinking that they're normal. But when you have a 9/11 every single day, that's not normal.

Buttigieg launched his presidential exploratory committee on Jan. 23, 2019, with a video in which he wore a flannel shirt and sweater, his hair not yet as tightly cropped as it would be by the time he announced he would be leaving the race.

Nashville: The latest design plans for the city's most ambitious development project reveal a complex new downtown district anchored by Amazon's office campus and an entertainment district similar to L.A. Live. The 25-story Grand Hyatt hotel will be the first tenant to open in the fall in the 17-acre Nashville Yards development. Two office towers for an Amazon operations hub are also well under construction. But most of the site work is still either in the preliminary stages or has yet to begin. San Diego-based Southwest Value Partners expects to spend $1 billion to create the district in the next few years. The entire project, which includes new street designs with pedestrian plazas, stretches from Broadway to Church Street. It will be fronted by a 1.3-acre park along the railroad tracks running through the Gulch.

But the water is coming. Around the country, from New Jersey to Massachusetts, Virginia to Oregon, education centers and marine laboratories like this one are bracing against rising seas and a changing climate. The assault from climate change is slower but more relentless than any storm, and will ultimately do more damage.

Second, the establishment isn't operating the way it used to. One of the great paradoxes of the last Democratic primary season is that the forces that lost — supporters of Sanders — routed the forces that won. For more than a year, they fought for, and won, changes to the Democratic primary rules that eliminated the voting power of superdelegates on the first ballot at any convention. At the same time, they won commitments from the Democratic National Committee that set up earlier debates and prioritized candidates with grassroots fundraising. The rules that infuriated Sanders supporters in 2016, allowing Clinton to build a huge delegate lead before facing her opponents, have been overturned.

Longer is better for assessing climate forecasts, and so Armstrong has agreed to extend the bet for another ten years, sticking with the original 2007 global mean temperature as the starting point. This time he has reason to be more confident. Validation tests published two years after the original bet compared no-change model forecasts with IPCC dangerous warming forecasts for horizons from one to 100 years, and found that no-change forecasts were considerably more accurate; especially over longer horizons. That study, followed all of the relevant scientific forecasting principles, with only a minor exception. To our knowledge, the study remains the only peer-reviewed paper published in a scientific journal that provides scientific forecasts of long-term global mean temperatures.

Minneapolis:Two prominent leaders have proposed an amendment to the Minnesota Constitution aimed at closing the state's dismal academic achievement gap. The proposal comes from Alan Page, a former Minnesota Supreme Court justice, and Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. They want to change the state's constitution to guarantee all children the fundamental right to a quality public education, the Star Tribune reported Wednesday. Page and Kashkari told the newspaper in an interview that making quality education a civil right for all children is the catalyst that's needed to break the logjam that has blocked effective reform. Even though Minnesota has spent billions of dollars to solve the problem, the state still has some of the worst educational disparities in the nation, as measured by race and socioeconomic status, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Courts have interpreted the Minnesota Constitution as giving students a fundamental right to an adequate education. Page and Kashkari want to raise that standard to a quality education. Page and Kashkari said similar amendments have driven improvements in other states. To amend the Minnesota Constitution, they will need the Legislature's approval to put the question to voters. The two hope to get it on the ballot this fall. But they'll face opposition from the state's powerful teachers' union, Education Minnesota, which said it will resist the proposal.
Most of his opponents' supporters in both states think that Sanders' positions are too progressive to win over swing voters, were he to become the Democratic nominee. But that may not matter much: large majorities of voters in California and Texas think a candidate is more likely to win in November by motivating Democrats to turn out in 2020, rather than by convincing Trump voters to vote Democratic. Over eight in 10 Sanders supporters think he has the best chance to beat President Trump in November.

It is surpassed only by the deaths and injuries that resulted from the Ford Pinto rear-mounted gas tank and a GMC pickup externally mounted gas tank. Unfortunately, many things have not changed since 1978. Firestone, then as now, has found no manufacturing or design defect, but blames the consumer for every single failure. Firestone alleges that consumers drive too fast, under-inflate their tires, drive in hot climates, overload the vehicle, and don't do proper maintenance Then, as now, Firestone Decatur plant showed up as a source of an unusual amount of failing tires. Then, as now, Firestone cannot explain why other brands of tires don't have the same failure rate. Then, as now, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, NHTSA, standards for tire strength were and are grossly inadequate. In fact, they have not changed those standards since 1968, long before there were steel-belted radials and the popular sport utility vehicles. There are a few new wrinkles. This time, the tires are found mainly on one company's vehicle: the Ford Explorer SUV and light trucks. And Firestone has two new factors to blame: hot climates, which stress its tires, and high ozone, which degrades its tires. The other change is that Ford, until recently, had agreed that -- with Firestone, that there was nothing wrong with the tires. Ford made these statements despite receiving more and more complaints from their dealers who were wondering why only Firestone tires failed.

Answering that question begins with knowing what we don't need to build. America already has too much infrastructure that we don't maintain adequately, or which we don't use to its fullest potential. Research indicates that fixing existing roads, for example, delivers greater return on investment than expanding them. We don't need new pipelines to distribute even more dangerous fossil fuels nearly as much as we need to fix existing pipeline leaks.

The Apocalypse has been thrown around Christian circles for millennia, and while there were a few Christian voices that have been loud over the course of 2020 speaking out for justice, fighting for the poor and marginalized, and standing alongside those who have been disproportionately impacted by racism and a justice system that criminalizes their own existence, many Christians failed to speak out, or even speak up, at all during this new apocalypse. The discourse seemed to be coming from a few vocal Christians who chose to not fight for the marginalized, but to uplift an administration that contradicts what Jesus taught us about how to treat others.

Spring Hill:General Motors and United Auto Workers Local 1853 have agreed to convert 157 local temporary workers to permanent status effective Feb. 3. The decision resolves a dispute between GM in Spring Hill and the union over the hiring of new temporary workers, Chairman Mike Herron told The Daily Herald on Thursday. Under the new collective bargaining agreement ratified in October, GM agreed to convert temporary workers with three years of continual service to permanent status. None of the temporary workers in Spring Hill had three consecutive years of service because of layoffs in 2017 and 2018, creating a short-lived problem. The deal between GM and Local 1853 allows the plant to begin bringing in new temporary workers. The company has started taking applications, seeking 154 employees for those positions. On Monday, GM announced it was making 930 temporary workers permanent at 30 of its 52 UAW-represented plants across the country. Ford also moved 592 temps to full-time status. At GM's Flint Assembly in Michigan, 250 were told at a meeting by the local union president of their new status.

This is what students like to call a physics for poets class — a class that explores the history of how humanity has confronted some of the deepest questions we can ask about the material world and our place in it, without the math. It is a class that tries to capture the true spirit of the liberal-arts education, mixing the sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences as different and complementary ways of knowing the world and why we matter. In fancier words, as an intellectual history of physics and astronomy, the class requires that scientific thinking be contextualized culturally, so that students can situate the ways in which some of the most revolutionary ideas in the past 2,000 years emerged when they did.

Kellogg:Shoshone County Sheriff Mike Gunderson told KHQ-TV that a third body buried under an avalanche at a resort was located Thursday by searchers in a helicopter. But that body has not yet been identified and authorities are not sure it is the person who was reported missing on Wednesday, Gunderson said. He said there were no other reports of missing persons on the mountain. The Silver Mountain Resort said it received a telephone call Wednesday morning from a concerned family member of the missing skier who was confirmed to be skiing there at the time of the avalanche. An avalanche happened at about 11 a.m. Tuesday on Wardner Peak, an area of the resort where the ski runs are rated at the highest difficulty level, according to resort officials. The runs had just been opened for a short period after crews performed avalanche control blasting in the area Tuesday morning, using explosives to trigger avalanches in hopes of leaving only the stable snow layers on the runs, officials said. Rescue crews and volunteers searched the avalanche area Tuesday with dogs and probes. The resort previously said five people had been recovered with minor injuries but said Wednesday afternoon that there were four people. Another skier was discovered Tuesday under about 10 feet of snow and did not survive. Yet another was found after dark. He was taken to a local hospital and pronounced dead. Experts said most avalanche survivors are dug out within 30 minutes. Names of the victims have not been released.

Bolsonaro, who took office at the beginning of 2019, has pushed for development over the conservation of the rainforest. Experts have linked the staggering number of fires in the Amazon last year to the rush to exploit the resources in the rainforest.
Yet only some of the high-profile Democrats hoping to challenge Trump in 2020 have made the issue a top priority. Sanders held a town hall on climate change in December and is preparing legislation on a Green New Deal. Merkley was the first senator to back a Green New Deal last year. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) followed soon after, explicitly tying his push for a federal job guarantee to the climate proposal.
While most cases reported outside of China have a direct link to Wuhan, there are indications the virus is beginning to spread within other countries. Three new cases were reported in Germany on Tuesday, including what is believed to be the first human-to-human transmission in Europe.
Sanders, who has long run on an anti-war platform, used the Iran question to remind Democrats about his vote in the Senate against the war in Iraq. That's in contrast to Biden, whose record on the conflict could make him vulnerable among the more liberal wing of the party.
Coleman's stance on climate change was far out of step with mainstream science. In 2014, the Weather Channel distanced itself from its founder on the issue. [H]e hasn't been with us in 31 years, said then-chief executive David Kenny on CNN. So he's not really speaking for the Weather Channel in any way today.
The infrastructure decisions Americans made in the past echo today. Infrastructure investment has connected the people and industries of our vast continent with rails and roads, and it has saved lives in our cities with modern water and sewer systems.
It's harder to back out when someone is waiting. It also makes it easier when you have someone to commiserate with, said Meghan Kennihan, a National Academy of Sports Medicine-certified personal trainer and USA Track & Field running coach. Give yourself something to look forward to at the end of the run; maybe you and your friend run together and finish at a coffee shop.
CARLSON: No, that's -- I mean, I think that's there's not any room for improvement there at all. But the question of speech, do you think the country has become freer or less free in the last year?
Real climate solutions must be built around justice.

Glen Ray, president of the local NAACP, talked about the virus at a Sunday service at Rising Star United Methodist Church on Feb. 23 to try to calm people's worries. But he was also dismayed that one of the county commissioners wore a red Make America Great Again hat to an emergency meeting about the virus.
President-elect Joe Biden vowed to inject $2 trillion into programs to convert the nation's electricity supply to 100% zero-carbon sources by 2035, fund mountains of new research and build a massive network of charging stations for electric vehicles. A fraction of that funding would go to researching negative-emissions technologies like direct air capture.
Next up on FACE THE NATION, we'll have more of our panel of new House members.
Wow. So she got incredibly lucky.
Scenes like we had [Wednesday] are extremely detrimental to the image of the United States and lead to questions internationally about how strong and how safe U.S. democracy really is, but most leaders are reassured that within a couple weeks, you'll see a transition of power that will bring a new president with more traditional values and less of a dangerous ideology, said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.
GONYEA: A lot of people say Bernie can't beat Trump. Some Democrats say that.
VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Well, it's a characteristic of the left that they envision natural and man-made disasters as opportunities to ram down agendas that we otherwise wouldn't vote for, and that's what Rahm Emanuel said, never let a crisis go to waste.
Reefs have entered a distinctive human-dominated era ― the Anthropocene, Mark Eakin, a co-author of the paper and a reef scientist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said in a statement. The climate has warmed rapidly in the past 50 years, first making El Niños dangerous for corals, and now we're seeing the emergence of bleaching in every hot summer.
This is huge, tweeted Squad member Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. These reforms remove 2 structural barriers to our agenda for equity and justice and will allow us to advance bold policies like Medicare for All, a Green New Deal and an equitable COVID recovery.

Congressional leaders, including Pelosi, will meet with Trump on Friday — the 14th day of the shutdown, which some Republicans signaled could last months.
Sanders said that Pruitt's replacement at the EPA, Andrew Wheeler, should be vigorously opposed.
Ninety-two percent of Democrats said supported the concept, including 93 percent of liberal Democrats and 90 percent of moderate to conservative Democrats.
After easily winning a third term in November, Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.) spearheaded a revolt against likely House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), arguing that the California lawmaker's ascent would jeopardize this hard-fought majority that we finally got of moderate women in suburban districts like hers.
MARGARET BRENNAN: The President yesterday when he was speaking referred to this fatality as a woman. It is a man.
Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone – 90 percent of which floods across from our southern border, Trump, who signed a bipartisan opioid bill into law late last year, remarked at the beginning of his address.
Geopolitical competition in global trade agenda-setting among the US, the European Union and emerging powers, such as China and India, and increasingly popular protectionism rhetoric in national trade debates also explain the failure or lack of cooperation in the multilateral trading system.

Ottawa is imposing its tax on provinces that have refused to meet the national standard for pricing carbon emissions: Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario. The national tax was initially imposed in New Brunswick as well but that province came up with its own tax after the election, which has since been approved by the feds.
Pelosi still speaks fondly of Bush and his late father, whose photograph she keeps in her Capitol Hill office alongside those of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama. And she rejects entirely any comparison between her dealings with Bush and with Trump.
Even Susie isn't quite sure how it survived.
I'm strongly positioned to be able to do all of those things and prepare us for what I call 'the fight of our lives.'
To counter a challenge from Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), a former Congressional Black Caucus chairwoman, Pelosi promoted a new diversity-hiring office and offered Fudge a job overseeing a resurrected subcommittee on elections. She appealed to progressives by creating a committee focused on climate change.
Even with more accurate data, the report only offers a glimpse at the devastation caused by the disasters.

A spokeswoman for Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) indicated her support for a Green New Deal last month. Days later, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) announced his support for the policy in a tweet.
Fonda was not arrested this time.
The uncertainty surrounding control of the Senate, where Democrats need to sweep a pair of runoff elections next week to win a majority, had created additional murkiness around Sunrise's plan of action. The details of the stimulus bill will be important, she said, but we can't bank on Congress to legislate and have that be the be-all-end-all for climate policy in 2021 or in the Biden administration.
To deliver these services, the club has coordinated with workers collectives, social welfare corporations and nonprofit organizations. Seikatsu members ― and non-members too ― can pay directly for those particular services when they access them.
And, I will fight to reinstate a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act to clearly separate commercial banking, investment banking and insurance services. Let's be clear: this legislation, introduced by my colleague Senator Elizabeth Warren, aims at the heart of the shadow banking system.
The bill, announced Tuesday and set to be introduced Wednesday, marks a significant step toward weaning the nation's largest and most economically influential city off fossil fuels. Six cities across the United States already generate 100 percent of their electricity with renewables. The city council in Washington, D.C., passed a bill last month requiring the city to offset 100 percent of its electricity purchases with renewable energy credits by 2032. But it would be a historic first for a metropolis like New York to shutter existing gas plants like these, and the city's move would likely ripple far beyond the five boroughs as other big cities sought ways to slash climate-changing emissions.
People have focused on this issue of a carbon tax, but it may not be necessary to finance renewable energy infrastructure, Inslee said. We may find other ways to finance this. You look at the Trump tax cuts that were misbegotten and gave all these tax benefits to the upper-income groups, and people weren't worried about the deficit when they did that.
PERINO: And I think that what he could have done, since apparently America is in a mood to wildly spend on government programs, why not try to ratchet it up and I would -- he could have said something like, I'm going to commit
Netanyahu has said that he will not quit if he is indicted. Under the law, he is not explicitly required to do so unless convicted. And if he makes it to the election and wins a new term, his fifth, he could argue that he has been given a new mandate by the public despite the cases, refuse to step down and perhaps even try to push through a change to the law that prevents the indictment of a sitting prime minister.
Albertans are questioning if confederation is broken. They feel disconnected from, and disrespected by, the rest of Canada, Richards wrote in a Facebook post.
Nearly 40 House Democrats and a handful of senators backed the resolution. More than half the Democrats expected to run for president in 2020 slowly endorsed a Green New Deal in some form or another. One poll pegged the number of registered voters who support a Green New Deal at 81 percent, including 57 percent of conservative Republicans.
In 2018, Streisand released an anti-Trump ballad entitle Don't Lie to Me, in which she accused the president of being incapable of telling the truth.
BAIER: OK. Then why expand the subpoena investigative powers?
Biden thanked Bloomberg for his support and praised the former New York City mayor for his work combatting climate change and ending gun violence. This race is bigger than candidates and bigger than politics. It's about defeating Donald Trump, and with your help, we're gonna do it, Biden said in a tweet.
In response to the results of the study, he told CBS News he agrees that the models are underestimating the trends. Current-generation climate models are simply not up to the task of extreme event attribution. They are not capturing key atmospheric mechanisms behind these extremes that are almost certainly being influenced by climate change.
GROSZ: That's when it got weird.
Now, I have to caution that although seasonal flu peaks during the winter and it peters out in spring, when we have a pandemic influenza outbreak such as what happened in 2009, it can penetrate farther into the summer. The reason for this is there is heightened susceptibility in the human population that allows for transmission even as humidity conditions rise. The pandemic flu doesn't disappear until June, and then resurges again in late August and September as humidity starts to drop. So, if this novel emergent coronavirus were to follow this pattern, then it would probably continue circulating until May or June, then we'd get a break, and then we might get a second wave of it in September. If it doesn't have this characteristic then none of this will happen. Also, this novel coronavirus appears to be more transmissible than influenza, which might preclude any disappearance during summer.
As Breitbart News and other outlets have reported, 30 Democrats traveled to Puerto Rico over the weekend on a chartered plane with over 100 lobbyists. Their itinerary included meetings with local officials — as well as parties, a local premiere of Hamilton, and free time on the beach.

With an average temperature 4 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average, this winter ranks first among the warmest winters on land in the Northern Hemisphere, beating the very mild winter of 2015-2016.
It is unclear whether the trade deal will reverse decades of damage to the U.S. industrial sector. U.S. factory payrolls dropped by close to 6 million after NAFTA took effect in 1994 and China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001. The USMCA is likely to add only 50,000 of these jobs, the International Trade Commission has found.

So if you're looking for outperformance in 2021, it may be worth biasing your portfolio just a bit toward a high-growth sector. It doesn't have to be something as vanilla as technology, as a universe of sophisticated funds allow investors to zero in specific trends without buying individual stocks.
Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, in releasing the report, said it was impossible for him to say whether climate change is causing the worsening disasters hitting Texas.
BUTTIGIEG: Thanks. Good to be with you.
Anderson Cooper: —for misstating some statistics about Pentagon spending?
Part of the problem is that the level of public debt of countries is too high for them to have significant room for manoeuvre. And countries that have the means, such as Germany, refuse to spend more.
In fact, that photogenic deep purple base that you think is all superfruit is really just a puree of other fruits, thickeners and sometimes dairy alternatives for added creaminess, with just enough powdered berry or sometimes juice concentrate to give it that dramatic hue. It's not often that it's even frozen pure açai berry, which carries an even higher cost for an exotic fruit that already requires a lot of preparation and processing for shipment.

RWE is seeking to increase its access to the region's supply of lignite, or brown coal. This type of coal is mined in giant open pits. Brown coal is easier and cheaper to access than other varieties of coal, but it is one of the dirtiest fossil fuels to burn. That means the coal that lies underneath Immerath could end up producing billions of tons of carbon emissions over the next few decades.
We have people that know the power of fear manipulate consciously the psychology of young people in a way that is wrong and should stop, he argues. What people need to understand is that there are extreme scenarios ... and they are not the same thing as predictive science. Indeed, scientists say that while some warming is baked in, action now could avert the worst consequences. Marvel puts it this way: There are so many futures between doomed and fine.
That's because the Arctic's deeply frigid weather escaped its regular atmospheric jail that traps the worst cold. It then meandered south to the central and eastern United States. And this has been happening more often in recent times, scientists say.

JOHNSON: Because of this. The fact that now any future president will have a hard time having a candid conversation with another world leader, because we've exposed these transcripts and of course within two weeks of this President taking office, conversations between world leaders were leaked.

Photojournalist Davide Monteleone recently produced an essay for the New Yorker in which he met with locals where the routes are being developed. It's very complicated to understand how does this actually affect people's lives in the region -- in China, in Khazakstan, Monteleone said in an interview with CBSN. Regular people don't really understand what it is. They aren't very interested in what's going to happen on a global, geopolitical level. They are more concerned about how it's going to affect their everyday life.
Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that if Democrats want to pay for such programs by raising taxes on the rich or on corporations, as some have suggested, PAYGO would help them do that.

I'm not sure I would call it a rift, but between Bill Barr saying what he said on ABC News, and then his Justice Department declining to prosecute Andrew McCabe, an outcome that I think it's very clear the president wants, to Michael's point -- I think it's been about few days for the narrative that Bill Barr is just a hatchet man for President Trump who will do his bidding.
Livia, you're describing a series of good Samaritans who have risked a lot to save these animals, but the problem, I have to imagine, is far greater than any number of good Samaritans could possibly solve.
I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States, which is what it does, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world's leading polluters, Trump said — singling out China and India by name.
The United States recently filed paperwork to officially remove itself from the multilateral agreement. Conservatives, meanwhile, have warned about economic consequences of large-scale reform and pointed to failed, historical climate predictions as reasons for avoiding drastic change.

Speaking to the house parties by livestream, Kat Brezler, a Bronx public school teacher and co-founder of the group People for Bernie, called on the participants to use social media to show Sanders the scale of his support with the hashtag RunBernieRun.
The findings offer something of a thought exercise ― and a warning: Either jump-start the carbon removal industry with generous government support now, or risk playing desperate triage in the hotter, chaotic decades to come. At the moment, the technology is primarily produced by two companies ― Carbon Engineering, based in Canada, and Climeworks, headquartered in Switzerland ― that depend on working with major polluters. Carbon Engineering took money from oil giant Occidental Petroleum. Climeworks struck a deal to supply the Coca-Cola Co., the world's biggest source of plastic pollution, with CO₂ for beverage carbonation.
The Secretary-General remains confident that cities, states and businesses within the United States — along with other countries — will continue to demonstrate vision and leadership by working for the low-carbon, resilient economic growth that will create quality jobs and markets for 21st century prosperity, the spokesman said in a statement.

But regardless of how much progress these proposals might make on the House floor, they're already part of the 2020 conversation. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who has been tipped for a White House bid, said last month that he is excited to support the Green New Deal.
This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 20, 2020.
Human-caused global warming is raising the odds of and severity of extreme-heat events and also adding to the severity of wildfires by speeding the drying of the landscape, among other influences. One of the most robust conclusions of climate studies has been that human-caused warming would increase the frequency and severity of heat waves and also boost the occurrence of days with extreme fire danger.
Berners-Lee sees such budding social consciousness as a silver lining in a year filled with chaos and tragedy.
In 2008, the taxpayers of this country bailed out Wall Street because we were told they were too big to fail. Yet, today, 3 out of the 4 largest financial institutions (JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo) are nearly 80 percent bigger than before we bailed them out. Incredibly, the six largest banks in this country issue more than two-thirds of all credit cards and more than 35 percent of all mortgages. They control more than 95 percent of all financial derivatives and hold more than 40 percent of all bank deposits. Their assets are equivalent to nearly 60 percent of our GDP. Enough is enough.
According to Richard's analysis, the 485 new papers underscore the significant limitations and uncertainties inherent in our understanding of climate and climate changes, which in turn suggests that climate science is not nearly as settled as media reports and some policymakers would have people believe.

OCASIO-CORTEZ: No. (Laughter). I think that a part of where I am right now is that I'm learning. I think that really what I hope we're able to do as a party and as a nation is rediscover the power of public imagination. I think that this is a very special moment. And, frankly, that is something that I think the president did do, in that he was able to take his profile and say, here's this hugely impossible thing that seems ridiculous, but I'm going to seriously push for it. And for him, that's his wall. And obviously, I'm diametrically opposed to it. But I think that the reason he's so attached to this thing, despite the fact that it's not what voters want, despite the fact that it's not what the American people want, is that it's the only vision he has. He has no other picture of America, except an America with a huge wall on the Southern border.
Wolf also cited recent efforts already underway to reduce emissions, such as a proposed rule to cut methane emissions from natural gas well sites and a new law bolstering in-state solar energy.
AAP's loss at the time was largely attributed to public anger at Kejriwal, who, for the first two years after coming to power, was seen locked in squabbles with the Narendra Modi government, which controls the Delhi Police, and the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, who represents the Centre in Delhi. For the first half of his term, Kejriwal demanded full statehood for Delhi, and accused the Modi government for interfering with appointments of bureaucrats, targeting his ministers with baseless allegations, and not letting his government function.

Who's foiling who here? The best news from the 2018 election for Trump, aside from an expanded Senate majority, was that in losing the House he gained a sparring partner. Had the Republicans maintained a narrow majority in the lower chamber governing would have been hard and avoiding blame would have been harder.
Also unpopular among the experts are detox teas, which, as McCoy put it, are having another 'moment' on social media, especially among celebrity influencers. Just as juice cleanses claim to clean out your system, so do these teas, but the body is well equipped with organs that already work to detoxify our systems, said nutritionist Claire Peacock, who oversees the nutrition department for MenuTrinfo in Colorado. No drink can replace what the body naturally does.
Trump has refrained from going that route, which would involve bypassing Congress to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border with unidentified Pentagon funds. The president told reporters on Friday that he wasn't planning to make a declaration right now but that he would if he had to.
But Rice has long wooed Republicans. In the four years leading up to 2013, she accepted donations from Donald Trump totaling $53,000. Her father, a contractor who became the building commissioner of New York's Archdiocese, registered as a Republican after moving to once deep-red Nassau County. Because New York's primaries are closed to nonpartisans, he registered as a Democrat only when his daughter ran in a primary for district attorney, according to a New York Times profile from March 2014.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Cory Booker, D-N.J.; and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. – all considered 2020 Democratic presidential contenders – have openly endorsed marijuana legalization or encouraged states to legalize.

Climate change cannot be tackled if businesses do not play their part, and there does seem to be new momentum to companies' efforts to make changes.

What gives me hope is that this traditional bifurcation is starting to break down. People are starting to recognize that if they care about something, if they care about it enough that they donate money to the cause, they vote around the cause, they donate their time, then they should care about it enough that it factors into their economic decisions — where they work, what they buy, how they save and invest. We're still in the early stages with such investment products, but we're getting there.

While a record number of coal-fired power plants were retired last year, natural gas not only beat out renewables to [replace] most of this lost generation but also fed most of the growth in electricity demand, the report said.
An important finding from this work is that these chemical products have largely been ignored when constructing the models that we use to predict air pollution – which impacts how we respond to and regulate pollutants.
Trans-Atlantic relations have steadily worsened since Trump became president two years ago.
Environmental organizations and researchers say the wildfires blazing in the Brazilian rainforest were set by cattle ranchers and loggers who want to clear and utilize the land, emboldened by the country's pro-business president.

BlackRock had supported just 3% of the shareholder proposals Morningstar reviewed over the past five years. These included social and corporate governance proposals as well as environmental calls for action. On just environment-focused issues, BlackRock supported 8% of the shareholder resolutions it voted on last year, compared to a 42% support rate for all large fund families.
Given that the BJP has only been in power once in Delhi, from 1993 to 1998 (Sushma Swaraj was chief minister in 1998 but only for 52 days), its parliamentary victories were attributed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity, or, as it was called, the Modi wave and the Modi wave 2.0.

Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Commitee, questioned why Zinke has yet to nominate a director and urged him to solicit more outside opinion on how he manages national parks. I call on Secretary Zinke to personally reach out to each member of the National Park Service Advisory Board and tell them their counsel is valued and that this administration respects local voices, she said in a statement late Tuesday.

Ultimately, of course, to the distress of most Federalists, the Supreme Court upheld the law in 2012. Yet to Barnett and others, it was still a victory for future deployments of the commerce clause argument against federal overreach, because a majority of the court agreed with the commerce-based critique. Instead, in his opinion upholding the measure, Chief Justice Roberts found other grounds to support the law.
Pew notes that observed shifts in foreign attitudes toward the U.S. and its leader are sometimes connected to U.S. policy or actions, as in the case of the Iraq War in 2003; sometimes they reflect domestic realities, such as the case of right-wing voters in Europe recently growing more favorable toward the U.S.
Speaking to HuffPost India in November, BJP leader and Rajya Sabha lawmaker Subramanian Swamy said the economic slowdown would eclipse the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid verdict, and hurt the party's chances in the Jharkhand and Delhi Assembly elections.
She moved back to the Bronx after graduating college and spent the next few years working as a community organizer and advocate for children's literacy. In May of 2017, the one-bedroom apartment she shares with her boyfriend became her makeshift campaign headquarters as she launched a seemingly improbable run for Congress. She was working as a waitress and bartender at the time. Like many members of her generation, she says, she had student loans to pay and no health insurance.

Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, a moderate who faces a 2024 election in his red state, said on Wednesday that he hoped the filibuster would remain to encourage bipartisanship.
INGRAHAM: Governor, real quick, I had to get reaction to this latest leftist outrage. When the evangelicals laid hands on and they prayed over the president on Friday, some in the media reacted in total horror, calling it cult-like. But when church members lay hands on Biden to pray, it's an inspirational, moving moment. What does that tell us?
Voters outside of San Antonio and Texas need to be aware that Castro left the city deep in debt, with a bloated bureaucracy…Julian Castro can be described as a Hispanic version of Obama, said George Rodriguez, Bexar County Republican Party spokesman.

She's also gone up against world leaders on frequent occasions: Russian President Vladimir Putin called her a kind and very sincere girl who doesn't understand the complexities of the modern world, and Brazil's far-right president Jair Bolsonaro labeled her a brat.
At a meeting of climate scientists at Oxford in 2012, one participant argued that, given the insufficient observational data and the coarse and mathematically imperfect climate models used to generate attribution claims, they are unjustifiably speculative, basically unverifiable and better not made at all.

Environmental groups urged officials to crack down more aggressively on wasteful water use rather than rely on policies that encourage neighbors to develop good practices.
It's a big legislation because it's a huge [expletive] problem! We're all going to die, said McElwee. Every week it seems like the risks of climate change become more real, and the amount of devastation it is going to wreak upon humanity becomes larger, and that means we have to do bigger things.

It's still unclear how the new administration will address the issue of vaccine hesitancy, the doubts and suspicions that keep many people from getting a shot. Polls show it's particularly a problem among Black Americans. It's important to acknowledge the reasons why it exists and work to earn trust and build vaccine confidence in communities, said Gracia.
I started watching and listening to the candidates, he said on 60 Minutes on Sunday. And they had ideas that made no sense to me whatsoever. Donald Trump is going to eat them for lunch.

And then finally, I think this is really important that California zoning laws have made a lot of places that were really habitable not open to urbanization or suburbanization in the Bay Area, or LA. So people move out to areas that they didn't used to live in to find cheap places to live because everything is so expensive in California.
WALLACE: Chuck, how much trouble is Biden in with the performance in those other states? Even his one-time overwhelming lead in South Carolina is now beginning to slip away.
The policy stormed into mainstream political debate over the past two months after activists staged sit-ins in Pelosi's office and Ocasio-Cortez proposed a resolution to establish a select committee charged with drafting a Green New Deal. Eighty-two percent of Americans said they had heard nothing at all about a Green New Deal, yet 81 percent of registered voters said they supported the policies outlined under early proposals, according to a survey released last month by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and George Mason University.

Bernie Sanders and the other senators running for president are trapped in the president's impeachment trial. But later today, they will zip out back onto the campaign trail using every precious hour to try to make their final pitch to voters. For Mr. Sanders, that's often at sizable rallies, a hallmark of his campaign. NPR's Don Gonyea takes us to New Hampshire to see how the Vermont senator has been rallying his loyal base.

Anton spoke just as Trump was nearing his first 100 days in office — and as the president was discovering some of the limits on what he could achieve.
So you take a look at other countries, Pakistan is there, they should be fighting. But Russia should be fighting, the reason Russia was in Afghanistan was because terrorists were going into Russia, they were right to be there, the problem is it was a tough fight and literally they went bankrupt, they went into being called Russia again as opposed to the Soviet Union.
According to one government official who has seen the proposed regulation but was not authorized to speak about it publicly, the administration will also narrow the range of projects that require environmental review. That could make it likely that more projects will sail through the approval process without having to disclose plans to do things like discharge waste, cut trees or increase air pollution.
Concord: This year's New Hampshire Women's Rally will feature speakers on reproductive health, climate, immigration, and electing women to office from the bottom to the top of the ticket.

SAGAL: Yeah. And did, like, the latex artist lean out and go, thank you - that was mine?
President Bush was very committed to continuing what had been started [in Iraq] and to see it through, and so they clashed on that, said Daniel P. Meyer, who served as Bush's legislative affairs director during Pelosi's speakership. But it was a professional relationship. I don't think there was personal animus in any way, shape or form.
We need to stop payday lenders from ripping off millions of Americans. Post offices exist in almost every community in our country. One important way to provide decent banking opportunities for low income communities is to allow the U.S. postal Service to engage in basic banking services, and that's what I will fight for.

A Liberal government should focus on improving wellbeing instead of growing the economy, like the governments of New Zealand and Iceland have, Graham said.
Saturday, the president retweeted a supporter asking, Why are my own #GA Senators @Kloeffler & @Perduesenate not supporting this effort?with a link to an article about the planned challenge by Senate Republicans.
KANDER: I think internally, it sort of validated us. I don't know if that's true or not. Looking back on it, I think so. Suddenly, there was a song out there that lots and lots of people were singing. And it sort of puts you in a - or at least it did for me - a slightly different place in your head. It's good and bad.
Prakash, a Sanders pick for the climate group, emerged from the weeks of virtual meetings with cautious optimism. That Biden chose heavy-hitters -- two of them, Kerry and McCarthy, are now headed to the White House -- to represent his side had been a good sign.
We've only gone up about one degree in a century in California. That's mostly because of asphalt and cement and our cities, and precipitation hasn't changed. What it is about is that we have a hundred million trees and underbrush that grew out -- that died out of the 2014 to 2016 drought.
That is not the way we should be moving that product, he said, noting that much of the U.S. Midwest has a similar problem. We're cramping our rail capacity — capacity that we need if we're going to be producing and exporting other goods that should be on rail.
So you mentioned that the show that that song was written for, The Skin Of Our Teeth, that you lost the rights to it, that the Thornton Wilder estate withdrew the rights. So what happens to the song when you lose the rights to the show?
How about Washington, the nation's capital? Well in 2012, D.C. had just 88 murders. Even two years ago, there were only 116, but this year, 2019, 166 murders. See a trend? You should because it's everywhere.
GONYEA: And Sanders also said he will press Biden tonight on housing and college affordability, climate change and all of that.
The concern is that base voters may or may not turn up. But while Trump has expressed his disdain over the Nov. 3 election, he has been equally clear to Georgians in two different rallies and a number of other public statements that he needs and wants them to show up and vote for Loeffler and Perdue.
They train themselves to inspect the farms and the businesses in their supply chain, he adds. They don't contract it out to independent parties, nor do they wait for the government to do it. This is huge.

CONWAY: Well, the president recognizes, as many people do, that it feels like there's a two -- two-tiered criminal justice system. If your President Trump or people associated with him, this prosecution would have gone one way.
Indeed, some heterodox observers, such as the late Thomas Gold, argue that the earth is, in fact, making more energy, even now. That is, oil, gas, and coal aren't fossil fuels at all, in the sense that such fuels are supposed to be the decayed remains of dinosaurs and other prehistoric organisms. Instead, Gold argued, the internal heat of the earth is, as it were, constantly cooking up more oil. By this reckoning, so long as the core of the earth is hot, we'll never run out of carbon-based fuel.
And all of these catastrophes were related to climate change.
In November, when scientists at 13 federal agencies, including the EPA, determined in the annual National Climate Assessment that global warming was rapidly worsening, Wheeler responded by threatening to intervene in the next report's drafting.
Masks, social distancing and frequent hand-washing still will be features of the first half of the year. Gathering with loved ones, working together without fear and sending children to school campuses full-time may have to wait until the fall.

Not everyone, however, is on board with Guthrie's agenda. Last spring, Guthrie and a number of S4CA partners — including several students — lobbied the National Association of School Psychologists to adopt a resolution stating that climate change is a children's issue, as the group's California chapter had done. But the organization declined. The group's executive director, Kathleen Minke, responded in an email to Guthrie that her group focuses on issues that have a very direct impact on schools, student learning and children's mental and behavioral health. Climate change, she said, falls outside this professional focus. When I interviewed her later, Minke told me that her organization isn't ignoring climate change and has dedicated resources to help school psychologists deal with kids affected by natural disasters. But when it comes to managing anxiety, their focus is on coping, not causes. You're not going to develop an entire curriculum around anxiety related to 'x,'  she says. There are too many x's for that to be efficient.
The National Emergencies Act of 1976 authorized the president to initiate emergency powers of government, but with the condition that he or she specify the particular provisions in detail. (This is the authority President Trump has reportedly explored as a way of funding his wall.) Intelligence reforms imposed limits on the C.I.A. and F.B.I., whose surveillance and national security operations had greatly enhanced the president's power. Last but not least, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 sought to watch against a replay of Watergate by establishing the Office of the Independent Counsel to ensure that there would be independent investigations into executive branch corruption.
On the first question, all of the impeachment talk hinges on what prosecutors find or don't find. So just cool your jets. On the second question, don't get your hopes up. As your Republican predecessors discovered, contempt of Congress isn't nearly as scary for administration officials as it sounds. They're going to blow you off and voters won't care any more about your howls than they did when Eric Holder stiff-armed the House GOP.
Overall, this is a good news story: VOCs from fuel use have decreased, so the air is cleaner. Since the contribution from fuels has dropped, it is not surprising that chemical products, which have not been as tightly regulated, are now responsible for a larger share of the VOCs.

But with his inauguration address, he pivoted. The most difficult thing I did was the most invisible thing.

SENATOR DICK DURBIN (Minority Whip/@SenatorDurbin/D-Illinois): Well, I can tell you, first, there's no requirement that this government be shut down while we deliberate-- deliberate the future of any barrier whether it's a fence or a wall. This is the first President in history who shut down his own government. Unfortunately, there are going to be people who suffer. Look at those at the airport who were carefully-- going through-- the passengers to make sure that they're safe on airplanes. As of next Friday, they'll miss a payday that may mean some problems for mortgage payments, problems and balancing the budget of their own families and households. This is totally unnecessary. And that's a point we've made over and over to this President, let's have this debate on the future of any barrier wall or border security but not at the expense of critical services for America.

Although Pelosi said in a statement afterward that we welcome the presence of these activists, the episode highlighted a growing rift between establishment Democrats and up-and-coming politicians such as Ocasio-Cortez and Khanna, who each unseated longtime party incumbents.
In this respect, the period between 2012 and 2016 will have been particularly volatile in terms of world trade, resulting from the collapse of oil and commodity prices. The IMF notes that this fall itself resulted in a 10.5% contraction of all international trade in 2015, when looking at all products.
I would hope that is something that will continue in the new administration, Manchin added. I think the Biden administration will be very open to working with USCIRF and all of the groups involved with religious freedom.

Of course, I wouldn't be standing here if they didn't have to put up with that. I can't tell you how much your love means to me.

Secretary Reich is right. Real Wall Street reform means breaking up the big banks and re-establishing firewalls that separates risk taking from traditional banking.
Yes, there's some energy for it on the left — some House Democrats have already said they will support the bill. However, there are indications House leadership isn't prioritizing the idea as much as those more liberal Democrats would like — Speaker Nancy Pelosi frustrated Green New Deal proponents by not giving them the kind of committee they wanted to put the policies together.
Back when world leaders agreed to the $100 billion goal, it wasn't actually clear how much the developed world was currently spending. The only really good data we have is starting in 2014, says Martinez-Diaz. That's from a 2015 analysis by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and Climate Policy Initiative. And it's not very promising: It finds that the public and private sectors combined spent about $62 billion.

REPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Well, I think it's important to see what's in the package. And it's- I think it's hard for any of us to say. I think all of us at this table came to Congress to work in a bipartisan fashion, to get things done. We're trying as hard as we can right now to be bipartisan. We need some bend from the other side as well.
The overall deficit in November in goods and services was the largest since January 2012. Through the first 11 months of 2017, the monthly deficits total $513.6 billion, 11.6% above the deficit total for the same period in 2016. The United States had run up a $737.4 billion deficit in goods trade through November and had a $223.8 billion surplus in trade in services such as tourism and banking.

These concerns were highlighted in a Guardian article in December that reported the RCMP were prepared to use lethal force against Indigenous protesters blocking workers from clearing the Coastal GasLink's natural gas pipeline route a year ago.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: When you see Dick Durbin and others in the room not a bunch of staffers. When you see this rhetoric that those who want to build a wall are racists stop. When you see the idea one dollar is enough for the wall. When that stuff ends, the real negotiations begin. Right now, the people running the show on the left are radical, liberal Democrats who don't see a border security problem. They see their own government being the problem--
The good news is, with the exception of climate change, individuals can do much to reverse insect declines, Tallamy said in an email. This is a global problem with a grassroots solution.
In June 2019, Chennai, India, reached Day Zero — the day on which the city's reservoirs ran almost completely out of water. By the fall, seasonal rains had resupplied the city, at least temporarily. But the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020.

Scientists, by training, have little exposure to the humanities. Given that a major in the sciences requires a lot of technical work, we spend precious little time dealing with what happened culturally and historically around the science we are trying to understand. We don't learn much about Galileo and his bouts with the Roman Inquisition, or about Newton's religious motivation for his work or his research in alchemy, or Kepler's Pythagorean mysticism, or Darwin's struggles with his wife's (and his own) faith, or Einstein's work as a pacifist. In the classroom, at least, we learn about their technical ideas, but not about who they were or why they were thinking what they were at the time.
The bottom line is, normal people don't want criminal justice reform. They want criminal justice enforcement. They've always wanted that. So why aren't they getting it?
It's so sobering that basically we have a 9/11 every day in terms of the number of people killed by this coronavirus. And on the one hand, I think we are learning to be resilient and creative and all those good things. But I think also we're kind of becoming callous. I think people when things become more routine, the stakes or the fear, that sometimes lessens as well. Because it becomes a little bit more routine and you build that into how you see the world and it does become sort of normalized.
Sunrun and Sunnova, two of the nation's biggest home solar companies, lost a combined $500 million in the first nine months of the year, and their operations and purchases of solar systems collectively used up $1.3 billion in cash. The companies and their Wall Street supporters say the losses are occurring because solar installations are growing rapidly and require a lot of upfront investment, and because investors in the companies get to use the losses to offset their tax liabilities. Still, residential solar is a fiercely competitive and expensive business, and Sunrun and Sunnova must contend with hundreds of smaller rivals, many of which have been turning a profit for years.

So Australia has always had this really intimate relationship with coal. We're the world's largest exporter of it. Most of it gets sent to growing economies in Asia. The government is highly supported by the coal industry, and both parties take donations from the coal industry. So there's this intimate connection between coal and government in Australia. It's a part of our identity and has been for a long time. But increasingly, there's this climate war growing in Australia, where, because we're one of the most vulnerable developed nations to the impacts of climate change, people are increasingly growing tired of this connection to coal.
Anderson Cooper: There are Democrats, obviously, who are worried about your affect on the party. Democratic Senator Chris Coons, said about left-leaning Democrats, If the next two years is just a race to offer increasingly unrealistic proposals, it'll be difficult for us to make a credible case we should be allowed to govern again.
Pelosi will face challenges in balancing the liberal wing and moderates from Trump-won districts. She moved quickly to assuage the liberals' concerns with the creation of a special committee on climate change and hearings on a potential Medicare-for-all health-care plan but still faced some grumbles this week.
Celebrities are also getting in on this industry, such as Cameron Diaz and Katherine Power with the Avaline brand. However, the one thing these wine brands have in common is a lack of opacity and a penchant for profit.

Direct payments of $1,400 to most Americans, costing around $320 billion according to a Breitbart News' estimate
But in truth, the stew of alternative facts has been simmering for more than half a century on the right fringe. The GOP had endless opportunities across the decades to banish these theories — about scheming bureaucrats, Jews, the Federal Reserve, the United Nations — and its leaders often saw them as absurd. But they were also useful, helping to rally support from an aggrieved government-hating base. So the party's mandarins allowed them to fester and grow until they spread from the toxic fringe to the mainstream, which they have finally overtaken. It's no wonder someone who embraced those ideas would become successful; Trump validates notions that his voters have long believed, ideas that the party refused to condemn and failed to repudiate.

The socialist senator seemed open to the idea of sharing a private jet with other presidential hopefuls who find themselves in the same predicament, citing the cost but, notably, not the impact on the environment. Are you going to give rides to the other candidates who are in the Senate? Colbert asked. Actually, we have used jets previously, and that was an idea we thought of. Those are expensive so we thought we'd all chip in and ride together, Sanders said, ultimately conceding that he does not know if the idea will come to fruition. That's greener. That's greener, sir, Colbert noted. Maybe we can all chip in, get one plane, and come back, Sanders said.

Barr looks to assuage Senate Dems' Mueller worries - WaPo: Attorney general nominee William P. Barr tried Thursday to assuage Senate Democrats' concerns he might be too biased to oversee the special counsel's Russia probe, but lawmakers said they would need to hear his answers under oath before they could consider backing his nomination. … Barr has been facing questions from Democrats and Republicans about his previous statements regarding Mueller's probe, particularly a 2018 memo blasting Mueller for examining whether Trump attempted to obstruct justice in his decision to fire James B. Comey from his post as FBI director. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), another committee member, said that during his meeting with Barr, he asked the nominee to prepare before Tuesday 'a complete, thorough and accurate description of what led to his Mueller memo.'

Given that no formal opposition was raised by environmentalists during the approval process for Sites, he said, he did not anticipate significant opposition from them — though they were skeptical the reservoir would provide the water promised. Watson said the project was consulting with environmental interests to allay those concerns, and to explore their thoughts about how the water should be managed once it had been stored, in the reservoir. He said the management process the project had developed would include local communities and Native American groups. And he added that the Sites Reservoir will have statewide reach by helping recharge depleted aquifers throughout California — an urgent necessity once the state's new groundwater management requirements go into effect in 2020.

By the end of election week in November, Democrats' hopes of winning a sizable majority in the U.S. Senate had fallen apart. But the party's operatives had already started developing their plan to squeeze out enough seats to win control.
That project, spearheaded by Dominion Energy, would carry fracked natural gas through rugged mountain terrain and several national forests from West Virginia through central Virginia and into North Carolina.
This election will decide whether the next president will mobilize Americans behind bold ideas or polarize them around the same Washington fights that have held us back for decades.

Anything to advance the leftist agenda. Now, the leftist agenda includes getting rid of Trump. They would love for the coronavirus to be this deadly strain that wipes everybody out so they could blame Trump for it. Don't doubt me on that.

WALLACE: Coming up, Bernie Sanders' win in New Hampshire put new pressure on Democrats fighting to be the moderate candidate in the race for the White House.
But figuring out how to actually pay for something like this - and as you talked to Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, she didn't have a lot of ideas on how this would actually be paid for aside from taxes and deficit spending. And deficit spending - obviously something that Democrats, like you pointed out, have been critical of Republicans on in some of their tax cuts.
It looked like Dresden after World War II, Inslee said. In my final days, when I look back and ask what I did to deal with climate change, I want to be able to say I did everything I could, including possibly running for president.

Biden said a win by both Democrats would make it easier for the incoming administration's priorities to get done around health care, climate change and other issues.
It's not clear what kind of consequences these endorsements will have in the early states — especially in Iowa, where Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg have invested so much of their resources. People's Action has an Iowa affiliate, the Iowa Center for Community Improvement, but most of the other groups do not.
And yet the seemingly best approach — making young people feel enfranchised to deal with climate change — comes with both upsides and potential downsides. On the one hand, what better way for young people to process climate change worries than to pressure adults to actually do something about the crisis? Campaigns like the youth-led Sunrise Movement, founded in 2017, have pursued this strategy, placing young people on the front lines of the fight over the Green New Deal; the group gained Internet notoriety in February 2019 with a video of students, some as young as 11, confronting Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California over her lack of support for the plan.

Georgia's Senate races ended in runoffs after no candidate topped 50% of the vote in multicandidate races held in November. Signifying what was at stake, the Georgia Senate campaigns shattered spending records as the two most expensive races in U.S. history ― combined, more than $830 million was spent on them. Overall, 9 out of the 10 most expensive Senate races in the nation's history took place this election cycle.
I do note that after my letter of August 11, Firestone agreed to speed up its recall by reimbursing consumers who had replaced their tires with those of a competitor. More is riding on this hearing, however, than the reputations of Firestone and Ford. Countless Americans are on the road today picking up their kids, driving to work, and the last thing that should worry them is the quality and the soundness of their tires. It is unconscionable that so many have been placed in this kind of situation. Today, almost one full month after the recall was announced, neither Firestone nor NHTSA, the government agency responsible for tire safety, has been able to identify why these tires are failing and why serious accidents are occurring. Consumers, therefore, have justifiably expressed a great deal of concern for their safety and for that of their loved ones, as well as a lot of frustration about the way this story has unfolded. Every day there seems to be some new disclosure, fostering apprehension that Firestone may not yet have control of the problem. The concern was compounded by a recent full-page ad placed by Firestone in major countries -- in major papers around the country assuring consumers that it acted appropriately but acknowledging it does not know what's causing the tires to fail. In order to restore public confidence, Firestone must identify the root cause of its failure problem, and quickly and fully disclose their findings.
1. Creating a committee to address climate change.

A concerning parallel between COVID-19 and climate change is how unprepared our governments are to respond to disaster, and how those with the most resources are much better able to weather the storm and recover while BIPOC and low-income communities are left defenseless. The failure in our response to the pandemic reflects the gaps in disaster response we have witnessed in moments of climate emergencies like hurricanes, wildfires and heat waves, and foreshadows how we will respond to disaster in the future unless we address systemic inequality.

The new thinking focused on preservation, of both the land and the native people. Some of this new thinking was guilt about past ill-treatment of indigenous folk, leading to the present-day idea that they should remain in their environment, living as they always had.

Steyer's decision not to run in 2020 only slightly shrinks the pool of Democrats who are likely to attempt to unseat Trump. Elizabeth Warren has already declared her candidacy, while former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are all rumored to be announcing runs, too.
But it guarantees that an otherwise perfunctory session on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to ratify the results of the presidential election will instead become a partisan brawl, in which Republicans amplify specious claims of widespread election rigging that have been debunked for weeks even as Mr. Trump has stoked them. The spectacle promises to set a caustic backdrop for Mr. Biden's inauguration and reflects the polarized politics on Capitol Hill that will be among his greatest challenges. It will also pose a political dilemma for Republicans, forcing them to choose between accepting the results of a democratic election — even if it means angering supporters who dislike the outcome and could punish them at the polls — and joining their colleagues in displaying unflinching loyalty to Mr. Trump, who has demanded that they back his bid to cling to the presidency.

The emphasis, doctors say, should be on personal responsibility and empowerment. For an overwhelming problem like climate change, being able to take some action — whether eating less meat or switching to an electric vehicle — can help fight paralysis and get patients to recognize that the worst of climate change is not a fait accompli and that some progress can be made. Haase says patients can often end up at one of two poles: one focused on catastrophe, the other essentially ignoring the problem. Recognizing the middle space can open up your thoughts. By going back and forth, it creates a larger space for you to think in and feel in, she explains, and out of that come innovative solutions.

Demographic anxieties will almost certainly take up greater space in Western politics: On both sides of the Atlantic, far-right movements increasingly see anti-feminism as a rallying cry at a time of declining birthrates.
On average during the winter there is a typical jet stream pattern across Europe and Asia with a ridge to the west and a trough to the east. But because of Arctic Amplification from climate change this jet stream can be magnified (made more extreme) which has implications for weather around the Northern Hemisphere. CBS News
As Morales pointed out in his TV broadcast Thursday, even though much of North America experienced below-average temperatures last week, most of the rest of the world is warmer than usual right now.
Navigating that dilemma has affected the limited talks to end the partial government shutdown, now in its second week, over the president's demand for money for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, and it is certain to define Pelosi's dealings with Trump in the new era of divided government.
Gritzo says the one natural hazard they can't always protect against is an F-5 tornado, the strongest kind. One of the company's clients is a Missouri hospital destroyed by an F-5 tornado in 2011. FM Global says it paid that claim, and now the hospital has been rebuilt, with some lessons learned.
And while the theory behind the connection makes meteorological sense and some studies do support the connection, Dr. Zack Labe, an Arctic climate scientist at Colorado State University, says you can find an equal number of scientific papers finding a connection versus no connection. Due to all of the chaos and noise in our atmosphere, it still remains challenging to understand connections between Arctic climate change and the polar vortex, explains Labe. This topic remains an active area of scientific research and debate.
But the Sierra snowpack has shown an overall declining trend for decades —most dramatically during the great California drought of 2012-2016 — and will dwindle further over the next several decades, a growing body of research suggests. In the latest, published in the peer-reviewed Geophysical Research Letters journal, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory researchers lay out what they call a future of consistent low-to-no snowpack. In other words, a new normal in which the robust snowpack developing this year would be an almost unthinkable anomaly.
GRAHAM: Less damage than if we don't fix a broken immigration system. You've got to bad choices here. Continue to stalemate and see parts of the government shutdown, it will be inconvenient and it can create problems. Into the federal workforce, I'm sorry you caught up in this mess. But the real damage is people coming across the border, selling drugs, killing Americans, that needs to come to an end. So, the real damage is a broken border compared to a partial shutdown.
Rendon and Newsom haven't always seen eye to eye. Asked about Newsom's ambitious agenda, Rendon says that compared to Brown — who focused on climate change, fiscal stability and criminal justice reform — the new governor has a wider range of policy interests.

Historic wildfires in California, buttressed by back-to-back United Nations and federal reports on the extent of human-caused global warming, generated an unusual amount of attention on the climate crisis. Then Democratic leaders made clear that climate change would be, at best, a midlevel priority after retaking the House of Representatives, with Nancy Pelosi, not yet the next House speaker, making the restoration of a decade-old select committee on global warming the cornerstone of the party's strategy. In response, the Sunrise Movement staged sit-in protests in Pelosi's office demanding Democrats instead champion a Green New Deal.
Perhaps, then, the decision of 2021 will come from the center rather than the periphery of U.S. politics. In his book on 1846, DeVoto discussed one additional decision of that year that shaped the future United States. One hundred seventy-five years ago this coming August, a Democratic congressman from Pennsylvania named David Wilmot took the floor in the House of Representatives, where he proposed a bill, the Wilmot Proviso, that would prohibit slavery in any land acquired from Mexico.

How does Ocasio-Cortez plan to pay for these massive programs? In a 60 Minutes interview with Anderson Cooper that will air on Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez suggested that some of her plans could be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy to rates as high as 70 percent. But even that huge tax increase wouldn't be nearly enough to pay for her numerous policy proposals, which is why Ocasio-Cortez has suggested the United States create a system of new publicly-owned banks that the government could use to run up the national debt. She has also called for printing money to pay for her socialist reforms.

They learned something from the Great Recession of 2008-09. They fought and reduced Democratic stimulus plans—which were not big enough to begin with—as much as possible. The end result was unemployment in October 2010 was still at 9.4%; and millions more jobs were lacking if we look at the decline in employment since the recession, rather than the unemployment stats only.

Instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development, Konyndyk says there's a growing mentality in the U.S. that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line. Examples include Trump's freezing and reinstatement of aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies; his threats to cut off countries that don't vote with the U.S. at the United Nations; and his withdrawal of aid to Palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan.

Nevertheless, 1830s expatriates and modern secessionists share a common goal: to be left alone, which will allow them to continue American practices they like, and discard those they do not. Indeed, like the Americans of the 1830s and 1840s, modern secessionists argue they are more American than the anti-American U.S. government. In their logic, it is not they who have betrayed American ideals, but the modern United States.

We need to act on climate change and a Green New Deal, which is broadly defined as combining policies that reduce emissions and help people economically, is a smart approach. I am less interested in slogans and branding than I am in real policies, which is what I'm running on. The details really matter., Delaney said in a statement to Fox News. The best start is the bipartisan one I introduced in Congress with the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (EICD) - a carbon tax with revenues going back to the American people through a dividend. This plan can result in a 90% reduction in GHG by 2050 by changing behavior, encouraging innovation in new technologies and using market forces to reduce emissions.

Since the 1980s, income inequality has been on the rise, says Lucas Chancel, co-director of the World Inequality Lab at the Paris School of Economics. In the U.S., for example, Chancel says the richest 1% owned about 40% of the nation's wealth in 2016 — up from 20% in the 1980s — and Trump's 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality, with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of American households.

Mr. Nunes and Mr. Jordan enthusiastically answered the call, working in public and in private to dig up unflattering information about those investigating the president, including his own Justice Department, which they would then publicize, often with the help of the White House. The two took a similar approach when Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump based on his attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joseph R. Biden Jr. Mr. Jordan, a pugnacious force in congressional hearings, became the face of Mr. Trump's defense on Capitol Hill, ultimately helping to win his acquittal in the Republican-controlled Senate. The work infuriated Democrats, but it made Mr. Nunes and Mr. Jordan heroes on the right and persuaded many in their party to follow suit. In 2018, Mr. Trump said that Mr. Nunes, then the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, ought to be awarded the Medal of Freedom or the Medal of Honor, which is reserved for military valor, based on his attempts to discredit the Russia investigation. That Mr. Trump is doing so now, even as he refuses to concede his election defeat, suggests that he recognizes his time in office is limited. Mr. Nunes will receive the honor in a ceremony on Monday, and Mr. Trump is likely to bestow it upon Mr. Jordan next week. The Washington Post first reported the awards. Nicholas Fandos and

The relationship between population growth and housing demand is clear.

Every state in the country has certified the election results after verifying their accuracy, and judges across the country have rejected nearly 60 attempts by Mr. Trump and his allies to challenge the results. Attorney General William P. Barr acknowledged that the Justice Department had not uncovered any voting fraud that would have changed the results of the election. The senators involved in the plot have acknowledged that their effort was unlikely to succeed. Any such challenge must be sustained by both the House, where Democrats hold the majority, and the Senate, where top Republicans, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, have tried to shut it down. None of the senators supporting the effort have made a specific allegation of fraud, instead offering vague suggestions that some wrongdoing might have occurred and asserting that many of their supporters believe that it has. In a heated interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin and one of those supporting the effort, maintained that tens of millions of Americans did not view the election's result as legitimate. While he acknowledged that Mr. Biden won his state by 20,000 votes, he also asserted that there were issues in Wisconsin. The show's host, Chuck Todd, compared Republicans' claims of widespread voter fraud to an arsonist starting a fire, and told Mr. Johnson that he didn't have the guts to tell the truth that this election was fair.

As in the case of COVID-19 and climate change, the most vulnerable populations generally suffer the earliest and most damaging setbacks because of where they live, their limited income and economic means, and their lack of access to health care. Government response to climate-induced disasters — hurricanes, floods, droughts, heat waves, wildfires, and related events — inherently benefit whites and more affluent households, and leave behind the most vulnerable. Long before Hurricane Katrina devastated the U.S. Gulf Coast, people of color learned the hard way that waiting for the government to respond can be hazardous to their health.

The scientific community has made it very clear in telling us that climate change is real and is causing devastating harm to our country and the entire planet, Sanders said. They have told us in no uncertain terms that if we do not transform our energy system away from fossil fuel, our nation and our planet and the planet we will be leaving our kids and grandchildren may well become unhealthy and even uninhabitable in the not-so-distant future.

Asian-Americans can tip elections, but for which party? Supporters at an Asian-American and Pacific Islander meet and greet with Jon Ossoff, a Democratic candidate for the Senate, in Suwanee, Ga., last week. Credit... Nicole Craine for The New York Times The message Asian-American voters sent in 2020 was clear: Seek us out, listen to what we tell you, and we can help you win. They turned out in record numbers. In Georgia, the increase in Asian-American voters was so significant in the general election that they could play a decisive role in the two Senate runoff races this week. And on the ballot itself, Asian-American candidates were more visible in national politics than ever, most notably with Kamala Harris, a woman of South Asian descent, becoming the vice president-elect. But the election also offered some caution for Democrats who have long assumed that increasing racial diversity in the United States will benefit them at the ballot box: Demographics alone are not destiny. Asian-American voters and Latino voters made clear that while they generally support Democrats, they do not do so at the same rate as Black voters, and remain very much up for grabs by either party. At the presidential level, Asian-Americans cast a record number of ballots in battleground states where Joseph R. Biden Jr. notched narrow victories. But a New York Times analysis showed that in immigrant neighborhoods across the country, Asian-American and Latino voters shifted to the right.

In response, the deputy White House press secretary said, Cong. Ocasio-Cortez's sheer ignorance on the matter can't cover the fact that President Trump supported and passed historic criminal justice reform… and ... has repeatedly condemned racism and bigotry in all forms.
Conspiracy theories are functional. I mean, there is a role for them in societies, and it's usually when people are feeling out of control, they need to have some sense, some semblance of control and understanding, and conspiracy theories sometimes allow people that. And I think we're seeing that in particularly among people that are White working class that have not been making it over the last decade. And I think, Trump actually fueled that in people with that particular mind-set.

In addition, two co-founders of the Sunrise Movement, Sara Blazevic and Varshini Prakash, left the Fossil Fuel Divestment Student Network to create the Sunrise Movement.

In early February last year, The Intercept reported that Wheeler held fundraisers for Sens. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) and Inhofe in May, five months before his formal nomination to be deputy administrator came before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, on which the senators serve. That same month, HuffPost reported that two nonpartisan groups of regional air pollution regulators accused Wheeler of abusing his power as a Senate aide in the early 2000s to bully and intimidate the organizations when they opposed a bill Inhofe, Wheeler's boss at the time, introduced. In a statement Wednesday, Barrasso, the Environment and Public Works Committee chairman, vowed to push to confirm Wheeler as administrator. Acting Administrator Wheeler has done an outstanding job leading EPA and is well qualified to run the agency on a permanent basis, he said. I will work with committee members to get him confirmed. This story has been updated with statements from Barrasso and Wheeler.

If the challenges of climate change are not met today, huge burdens will be imposed on the next generation. It is just wrong for this generation to pass these costs on to the next.

Although you might have noticed, Lou, I don't think that I heard the word Ford or Ford Motor Company... WATERS: You did not, no, you did not. GARSTEN: ... in his entire statement. And he has said all along, and he said flatly to us, that he puts the blame squarely on the part of Bridgestone/Firestone and on the NHTSA for the problem here with the tires. WATERS: And he mentioned NHTSA and their regulatory power and maybe might have to be enhanced by legislative action of some sort. Do you expect that that might be the case? GARSTEN: Well, that may be the major outcropping of this whole investigation aside, of course, from finding out, perhaps, why this all happened. But they certainly -- the agency certainly either didn't feel that it wanted to act or that it should act, or just didn't do anything, got the data and either didn't analyze it or act on it properly in this. So you may very well find that this becomes an agency with a lot more power. Now, you also have to remember, Lou, that this is an agency that got its new administrator only a couple of weeks ago, so it's in a period of transition at this point still. WATERS: And there'll be a lot of answers: I don't know or we didn't have to know and there was no regulation suggesting that a report had to be made about this, that or the other thing? GARSTEN: Sure.

Greenbelt: Residents, civic associations and local governments in counties that would be crossed by a proposed high-speed, magnetic levitation train linking Baltimore and Washington say they are weighing options to fight the plan. The Washington Post reports the city of Greenbelt is among those opposing the so-called maglev project. Last month, the city issued a request for services to attorneys and law firms willing to take on the fight. Other options being weighed to oppose the $10 billion plan include lobbying lawmakers and organizing protests, the newspaper reports. Critics say the train would offer little benefit to communities it will pass through because it would only stop in Washington, Baltimore and the Baltimore/Washington International Airport. Opponents are worried about construction impacts. But supporters say it will ease traffic congestion, create jobs and boost economic development.

Bismarck: Officials say high winds caused a power outage that led to a produced water and oil spill in Dunn County. The state Department of Environmental Quality was notified Monday of Sunday's spill at a salt water disposal facility operated by Hunt Oil Co., about 8 miles northwest of Halliday. Officials said the equipment failure caused by the power outage led to multiple tanks overflowing. Initial estimates indicated about 27,720 gallons of produced water and 15,540 gallons of crude oil overflowed the tanks. Most of the spill was contained on site, but winds blew some of the material onto pastureland. Produced water is a byproduct of oil and gas development. It is a mixture of saltwater and oil that can contain drilling chemicals.

But far more American voters are either Jacksonians or Jeffersonians. The Jeffersonian impulse, more common on the left than on the right, is toward a come home, America retreat from empire that regards global hegemony as a corrupting folly and America's wars as mostly unwise and unjust. (No blood for oil is the defining Jeffersonian attitude toward all our Middle Eastern misadventures.) The Jacksonian tendency, more common on the right than on the left, is toward a pugilistic nationalism that's wary of all international entanglements but ready for war whenever threats arise.

Simply put, this is a terrific choice, McPherson said in a statement issued after the nomination.
Jackson: As the 2020 Legislature prepares to convene Tuesday, the future of hemp in the Magnolia State is hazy. There were a few attempts to legalize hemp production in the 2019 session, but all failed. Now, as farmers in surrounding states are already cultivating and selling hemp, Mississippi remains one of only three states where production is illegal. A task force on hemp production met three times last year and weighed pros and cons of the issue. Farmers crowded into a room in the Capitol to hear about a new crop they might soon plant. Agricultural experts explained the benefits and hardships of growing hemp without taking a hard stance on the issue, but law enforcement officials on the task force were deeply critical of hemp legalization. The task force ultimately produced a report that included these findings, though it doesn't include a recommendation on whether to legalize hemp. Last year, the House passed a bill legalizing hemp production. That bill stalled in the Senate.

Australia is burning. An area about as large as West Virginia has been blackened by the fires and according to a University of Sydney scientist it's estimated a billion animals have died. The blazes are bigger than the ones that torched California and the Amazon, events that took place on different continents, but are part of the same story: global climate change. It's a story not just of fire but water. Before climate scientists worried about Australia burning, they warned that Venice, Italy, is drowning. Man's most beautiful artifact, built on millions of pylons in the middle of a lagoon, may be vanishing before our eyes. The periodic floods of Venice have become more threatening and more frequent. This past November, a sudden storm surge overwhelmed nearly 90% of the city. Climate scientists say what happened that night exactly two months ago in Venice is a warning to the world of what's to come – and not just in Venice.

One of the interesting suggestions we find in the Laws is that even the hypermasculine men of Crete and Sparta were ruled by their women to a far greater extent than they realized, which is why it was a mistake for the legislators in those polities to neglect the education of women. Although Rousseau was obviously aware that women are also affected by what men want them to be, he did not believe that the effects are symmetrical. Men are always much more likely than women to believe they are ruling precisely when they are being ruled, which is why the education of women is especially important and especially likely to be given too little serious attention.

For example, in Queens, the city's largest borough, the Ravenswood Generating Station has another two years under city law to keep burning 3,264,000 gallons of fuel oil each year, producing annual emissions equivalent to about 500,000 cars. The city is also of the world's top garbage producers, and its recycling services lag behind other major metropoles.
OSSOFF: But see, now Georgia has the opportunity to define the next
As bitter cold continues to grip much of North America and helps spawn the fierce storm along the East Coast, the question arises: What's the influence of climate change? Some scientists studying the connection between climate change and cold spells, which occur when cold Arctic air dips south, say that they may be related. But the importance of the relationship is not fully clear yet. The Arctic is not as cold as it used to be — the region is warming faster than any other — and studies suggest that this warming is weakening the jet stream, which ordinarily acts like a giant lasso, corralling cold air around the pole.

Denver: Wildlife officials have discovered evidence of wolves living in northwestern Colorado after hunters reported a suspected pack and residents found a scavenged elk carcass. The Colorado Parks and Wildlife Department announced the discoveries Wednesday, suggesting a pack of gray wolves might be residing in the state, The Denver Post reported. The news was first reported Tuesday by the Craig Press. The hunters provided a video shot in October of two wolves shown near the Wyoming and Utah borders, officials said. It was the first time in a few years multiple wolves were seen traveling together in Colorado, officials said. The announcement comes days after state election officials placed a measure to reintroduce wolves on this year's ballot, officials said. The ballot will ask voters whether to require state wildlife commissioners to reintroduce gray wolves by the end of 2023 on public land in western Colorado, officials said. State wildlife officials have studied the possibility of reintroducing wolves in Colorado and decided to oppose such efforts, officials said. Local leaders in 23 counties have also opposed reintroduction.
BRITISH COLUMBIA, Canada -- Only on CBS This Morning, National Geographic Adventure is revealing its eight most inspiring Adventures of the Year. They're chosen for embodying the spirit of adventure in groundbreaking ways.
Amy Sisk Bio Recent Stories Amy Sisk reports for StateImpact Pennsylvania and WESA, Pittsburgh's NPR member station. She comes to Pennsylvania from another energy-rich state, North Dakota, where she told stories from coal mines, wind farms and the Bakken oil patch for Inside Energy and Prairie Public Broadcasting. Amy's stories often air on NPR, including those from the eight months she spent following the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. A reporting trip to the Bakken during its boom years sparked her interest in energy. Ever since, she's covered the industry -- from the way it is regulated to its influence on policy to its impact on people and the environment.
Obviously, a lot depends on Mother Nature, on the magnitude of the rainfall, the magnitude of the mudslides and so forth, the sheriff told reporters on Tuesday.
The most effective way to compare the accuracy of forecasts from different forecasting methods is the relative cumulative absolute error. By that measure (measure 1 in the table), the no-change forecast errors were 12 percent smaller than those of the IPCC dangerous warming projection. Seven other measures are provided to help readers draw their own conclusions as to whether, with the benefit of hindsight, it would have been better in 2007 to plan for a tipping point, or no change, over the next decade.
Davenport was devastated by 2019 floods in the Upper Mississippi. How are local business preparing for future floods, and what role does climate change play in their voting?
McCauley has brought me out to Platform A on a boat, which circles the rig as he talks.
It's a big deal because the projected sea level rise is a conservative estimate and it is likely to be higher, said lead author Steve Nerem of the University of Colorado.
It's failing 98 percent of the time, being miserable most of the time, and being patient. Believing in yourself, believing in the process and chasing that story, Nicklen said. And that makes it rewarding.
The persistent anti-Pelosi campaign devised by the Republicans over the years had been successful in adversely affecting public perception of her. Not only did she become the personification of everything Republicans were supposed to fear, but she became a third rail for some within her own party. Over time, Democratic candidates distanced themselves from her. Asking a candidate whether they would support her for speaker became an ultimate gotcha question.
Last month Rendon called the Trump administration a major existential threat. Days later, Brown delivered a full-throated warning that California has no intention of reversing its climate change policies.
Based on a CBS News analysis, only three candidates are currently qualified to participate: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. All candidates have until February 18 to qualify.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to also ask you about some of the things you campaigned on. Congresswoman, as we said, you're from Connecticut. In your home state that was the site of the Sandy Hook shooting. I know you've talked a bit, given your time in the classroom, and you've thought a lot about this. What is it that you think can actually get done? What are you going to try to do about gun control?
There were all sorts of changes made to reduce the amount of coverage that people have with a promise of reduced premiums that didn't materialize, Hollingsworth said. That has had very serious repercussions for lots of Ontarians.
Trump's decision not to provide the remaining $2 billion effectively cuts the GCF's total expected funding by about 20 percent — hardly peanuts. And various analysts say the loss of U.S. engagement in the day-to-day running of the fund could have less tangible but no less impactful downsides because the U.S. government has particular expertise when it comes to keeping multinational organizations accountable and effective.
The baffling mystery is how Ehrlich—despite his utterly failed forecasts—can continue to be hailed today as a serious scientist with something important to say to the world.
A day later, Pelosi tweaked her tone, saying she hasn't seen the proposal but knows there's enthusiasm for the Green New Deal, adding it was welcome.
When Buttigieg took the microphone, he was forced to yell, doing his best to deliver his message without showing frustration that no one in a room full of black dignitaries seemed to want to hear it. When former vice president Joe Biden took the same stage later that afternoon, the room was raucous at his arrival, then rapt for his remarks.
The problem, sometimes called the insect apocalypse, is like a jigsaw puzzle. And scientists say they still don't have all the pieces, so they have trouble grasping its enormity and complexity and getting the world to notice and do something.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. They're being held hostage. They're being held hostage by people who say you need one dollar to secure the border. They're being held hostage by people--
GARCIA-NAVARRO: OK. So, Mara, last night, the president called into Judge Jeanine Pirro's show on Fox News. And we'll talk Russia elsewhere in the show. But he said about the shutdown that he was still thinking about declaring a national emergency. Is that still a plan?
She sees women's unpaid labour as a part of the equation, as well. An Oxfam report from earlier this year found that women's unpaid labour — mainly caring for children or elderly people, but also domestic work like cooking and cleaning — is valued at about $1.8 trillion.
Then-candidate Donald Trump pledged to help coal miners in 2016.
Peach State voters will decide whether Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler return to Washington or if Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock take their place. All four ran Nov. 3, but none got enough votes under state law to win the Senate seats outright, forcing Tuesday's runoffs.
So before the coronation in Thailand, the only time that I was with them previously, was in March of 2018. So that Christmas and New Year break was only one of the two times in the whole year that I was able to be with them and spend time with them.
The morning after the Georgia runoffs, Trump's Labor Department announced a new federal rule regarding the use of independent contractors by companies like Uber and Doordash. The new industry-friendly regulation would make it difficult for workers to prove through lawsuits that they are actually employees entitled to basic labor protections. It's slated to go into effect in March. Democrats could undo it through the CRA if they choose to, though not without provoking a fight from the gig companies and other businesses that use contractors.
I know amazing athletes who were awarded medals long after they retired. Sure, the delay cost them money, fame and a special moment on the medal stand, but more importantly, they lost the chance to share their experiences and the lessons they've learned with their communities. They lost the chance to prove that hard work and perseverance are all it takes to succeed.
Warren, who also called the airstrike an assassination, said the United States needs a president who is calm and steady-handed and who understands the importance of de-escalating and getting out of conflict – not someone who moves us closer and closer to the brink.
Indeed, the entire past four years are going to be viewed as an aberration, said Gbenga Ajilore, a senior economist at the Center for American Progress. Long-term, he said, our economic reputation will hold.
I was tired of feeling caged, of talking through lawyers and other intermediaries in endless obfuscation, Harris writes of her decision to call Dimon directly. I took off my earrings (the Oakland in me) and picked up the receiver.
The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active on record, and many of the storms that slammed into the Gulf Coast, Central America and the Caribbean last year showed signs that they were supercharged by global warming.
Mayor Luigi Brugnaro (Translation): The frequency, it's like an earthquake. When there are too many, then it means something is happening. I see it as an opportunity to wake up the world.
Ericksen's comments come just days after Trump's team ordered agencies to limit their external communications to the public. Employees at the EPA, the Department of Agriculture and the Interior Department, among others, have been instructed not to post on social media accounts. At the EPA, the staff was told not to speak to the news media.
Not even catastrophes like these seem to bring any political action. How is this possible?
Whereas the national carbon tax is structured to escalate over time, Pallister indicated that he believes any tax should be flat and low like the Prairie horizon.
In response, protesters blockaded the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. It's basically where we were when the show started tonight.
The consequences of poor planning, and political infighting, have become clear — from a distance, at least for now. Across the ocean, the South African city of Cape Town, Africa's most advanced and cosmopolitan city, provides a new warning. Its population has doubled over the past two decades, but it has not built much new water storage capacity — thanks, in part, to the fact that the national government has authority over water and the local government is controlled by the opposition. As a result, the city nearly ran out of water in 2018, forcing severe restrictions on residents.
Thanks for tuning in the last few days! Arlene will be back in action tomorrow. 'Till next time!
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Marine biologist Peter Edmunds of California State University, Northridge, thank you so much.
BAIER: Let's talk about this race, specifically our opponent. On the
But that crossroads moment was about more than climate policy. Young voters were the foundation of the Sunrise-Biden relationship during the campaign. Biden wanted their support. Sunrise understood what it took to unlock it. The desire of Democrats to keep them energized now is what could, potentially, sustain the coalition going forward.
On the one hand, Kejriwal was chastised by liberal commentators for not speaking against the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's constitutional status, the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid verdict, the CAA, and the recent violence in Jawaharlal Nehru University.
A plane carrying approximately 210 US citizens -- mostly diplomats and their families -- has also left Wuhan, according to a State Department spokesperson, bound for Riverside, California via Alaska. More Americans remain in the city, hoping to be evacuated at a later date.
I believe the intellectual life of the whole of modern Western society is increasingly being split into two polar groups...at one pole we have the literary intellectuals, who incidentally while no one was looking took to referring to themselves as 'intellectuals' as though there were no others...at the other scientists, and as the most representative, the physical scientists. Between the two a gulf of mutual incomprehension — sometimes (particularly among the young) hostility and dislike, but most of all lack of understanding.
O'Rourke's embrace of a Green New Deal is likely to face skepticism among progressives advocating the policy. He won early endorsements from environmental groups when he challenged Cruz, a climate change denier and fossil fuel ideologue. But O'Rourke, who declined donations from corporate political action committees during his Senate campaign, generated controversy last month over fossil fuel donations he received.
The strongest margin of support are older suburban women, said Evan Roth Smith, co-founder of the polling firm Slingshot Strategies, which conducted the poll. That is the constituency for a Green New Deal in her district.
MONTANARO: She's going to have to figure out a political strategy because real change - for example, when President Obama was in office, when LBJ was in office to enact the Great Society measures or Obamacare - came from having numbers and assembling coalitions. And that's something she's going to have to learn how to do.
Also in 2019, Time magazine named her as its 2019 Person of the Year for sounding the alarm about humanity's predatory relationship with the only home we have, for bringing to a fragmented world a voice that transcends background and borders and for showing us all what it might look like when a new generation leads.
But like the Ontario Liberal Party, Del Duca's name carries some baggage.

Disaster experts say people have to think about the big disaster that happens only a few times a lifetime at most, but is devastating when it hits — Hurricane Katrina, Superstorm Sandy, the 2011 super outbreak of tornadoes, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake or a pandemic.
The industry has attracted thousands of young people in recent years with the promise of secure careers as shale drilling took off and made the United States the world's largest producer of oil. But many students and recent graduates say they are no longer sure that there is a place for them in the industry, according to the New York Times. Even after the pandemic ends, some of them fear that growing concerns about climate change will lead to the inevitable decline of oil and gas.
ALDA: I think to a great extent our lives depend on whether or not we
More broadly, the shooting raised a crucial question: Was Buttigieg, a young, white, Harvard-educated man from Indiana, the right candidate to lead a diverse party? More to the point: Could he really empathize with the black experience?
In order to calculate which portion of the flood damage between 1988 and 2017 was due to increases in extreme events on a warmer planet, the team started with higher resolution climate and socioeconomic data and then applied advanced methods from economics and statistics. Using these tools they constructed an economic model to analyze the relationship between observed precipitation and flood damage month by month and state by state.

Democrats may be more readily willing to spike a new rule from the Trump administration that allows religious institutions that take federal contracts to make hiring decisions based on faith. The Labor Department finalized that regulation in December. While the administration claimed the rule encourages the full and equal participation of religious organizations as federal contractors, groups like the American Civil Liberties Union said it amounts to a license for employers to discriminate.

This halo circles around gluten-free foods, too. Many people assume they are sensitive or allergic to gluten and will thus opt for gluten-free items. However, as Ramirez said, Gluten-free foods can be void of certain vitamins and minerals, and some gluten-free foods can have even higher sugar, fat, or sodium contents than the with-gluten items!

The new rule would no longer require agencies to consider the cumulative consequences of new infrastructure. In recent years courts have interpreted that requirement as a mandate to study the effects of allowing more planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. It also has meant understanding the impacts of rising sea levels and other results of climate change on a given project.
The Shell plant is licensed to produce up to 1.6 million tons of polyethylene annually, a process that could involve emitting up to 522 tons of volatile organic compounds and 348 tons of nitrogen oxides annually. Peduto said those emissions are equal to adding 450,000 vehicles to ­Pittsburgh-area highways, severely undercutting the city's goal of being carbon neutral by 2030.
Forty-eight percent of women and 44 percent of men supported a pro-Green New Deal candidate. Yet 30 percent of men said they'd back a candidate who opposed a Green New Deal, compared to just 10 percent of women who said the same.
But for the past few years, Immerath has slowly become a ghost town. German energy company RWE has taken over the land, constructing a new version of the village seven miles away. The village hospital was relocated, and its houses torn down and moved. Even Immerath's cemetery wasn't immune to the move ― its centuries-old bodies were dug up and relocated with the village.
With such a thin hold on power, that means Democrats will still have to overcome major opposition from their Republican colleagues in order to fully enact their agenda.
Pelosi faced public challenges to her re-election as speaker among Democrats, including 16 representatives who had pledged to vote against her if they won.

Likewise, S4CA's efforts to get national school board groups to lobby on climate change have come up short. Chris Ungar has been a school board member for 20 years in California's San Luis Coastal Unified School District. Last spring, he proposed language to the National School Boards Association recognizing climate change as a threat and asking Congress for funding to help schools affected by natural disasters. It easily passed a policy committee, but before the full association the resolution was, in Ungar's words, gutted — the climate change language stripped because delegates from some states worried that it could obscure the natural-disaster funding request.

Far from a realist, Martin combines graffiti's childlike directness with abstract expressionism's spontaneity. The paintings' backgrounds feature hard-edge, bright-colored patterning, punctuated by looser gestures and occasional text. When Martin does depict a full human body, such as the manacled one in the potent Enslaved, it's in the form of a black or brown stick figure with a circular head.

Proof of this, they argue, is that it's investment products, and secondarily, durable household goods, such as cars, whose trade has slowed down the most.

Sanders's stump speech is a liberal wish list — passing a Green New Deal to combat climate change; wiping out student debt and paying for it by taxing Wall Street; raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour; reforming immigration laws to protect the undocumented; nominating liberals to the Supreme Court and protecting abortion rights; and, of course, his signature health-care idea, Medicare-for-all, which has become a rallying cry on the left.
After all of these years of people talking about the steel mills closing and crying about that, there are now 'help wanted' signs everywhere, said Ed Becker, owner of Bowser's Restaurant, where customers can get a pound of spaghetti and two meatballs for $6 on Thursdays. Actually, they have to put 'help wanted' banners up — it's not even a sign anymore.
In addition to the lawsuit, New York City intends to divest the approximately $5 billion the city's pension funds have invested in over 190 fossil fuel companies. The move comes more than two years after de Blasio announced plans to divest $33 million from coal, one of the dirtiest fossil fuels.
The stakes in the current infrastructure debate are high. But what matters most is not the size of any federal infrastructure package, nor how it is financed, nor even how many jobs it creates in the coming years. What matters most is building the infrastructure that will enable America to respond to the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.

Wells: A historic hotel damaged in a 2008 earthquake is getting restored. The El Rancho Hotel and Casino in Wells is expected to see a new life after the small Elko County town received grants to fix it up. The city has secured funding from the federal Community Development Block Grant program and the Nevada Commission for Cultural Centers and Historic Preservation to help restore the property. Restoration is estimated to cost about $500,000 to the city as well. City manager Jolene Supp says the payoff will be worth it. The city plans to reopen the building as a community center, restaurant and small-business incubator. Originally a hotel-casino and later a community center and banquet hall, the El Rancho served the town of 1,200 since it was built in 1949. A 6.0 magnitude earthquake hit Wells in February 2008, damaging hundreds of structures in town, including the hotel.
WALLACE: And hello again from Fox News in Washington.
Amazon's stock, on the other hand, has risen around 70 percent this year, a figure that is modest only in comparison to Tesla's gains.

Amazon Web Services, a big profit generator for the company, has also experienced increased demand during the pandemic.

Island Beach State Park: Officials hoped they would collect 200 discarded Christmas trees to bolster dunes at the park but have received 10 times that amount. State Department of Environmental Protection officials, who operate the park, said they collected some 2,000 Christmas trees Saturday during a drop-off event. DEP officials say the trees help catch sand and support the dunes, which provide protection to the island during storms. The dunes also provide habitat for about 400 plant species and numerous types of birds. The island is made up of nearly 1,900 acres of dunes and beaches and remains one of the few remaining undeveloped barrier island beaches in the northeastern United States, according to state officials. Now, state officials are looking for volunteers to help move and place the Christmas trees into specific dune areas. Volunteers and state workers will meet at 8 a.m. Saturday. Volunteers must pre-register online.

But instead of pursuing these allegations — which normally it would have done, especially in the post #MeToo witch hunt climate — our virtue-signalling parliamentarians have proved oddly reluctant to boot out this charmless bruiser. Why? Because Bercow has made it his business to sabotage Brexit and most MPs, whatever they may think of him personally, are Remainers.
The Federal Reserve can extend credit to power these projects and investments, new public banks can be created (as in WWII) to extend credit and a combination of various taxation tools (including taxes on carbon and other emissions and progressive wealth taxes) can be employed, it says.
The senseless and prolonged shutdown is inflicting chaos across the country, she said, adding that mayors could feel the impact of the shutdown in their cities.

Last year BP announced an ambition to be a net-zero company by 2050 and to help the world get to net zero. It also set out a new strategy for the 111-year-old company -- with aims to increase low-carbon investment 10-fold, cut oil and gas production by 40% and reduce emissions by 35% to 40% -- all by 2030. It's a bold step in the right direction.
Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall said in an email: This lawsuit is factually and legally meritless, and will do nothing to address the serious issue of climate change. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue that requires global engagement.

On the y-axis, we've got time. The whole cartoon, which starts at the end of the last ice age, represents about 22,000 years. People have been around for about 200,000 years.

Rumors have swirled for decades about the identity of the man killed in Chicago and buried in Crown Hill Cemetery. Efforts allegedly made by Dillinger to alter his appearance – including plastic surgery and burning off his fingerprints with acid – have led some historians and Dillinger enthusiasts to believe the body belonged to a doppelganger. Earlier this year, the FBI took the rare step of issuing a statement regarding the case, acknowledging the common myth that there was a Dillinger lookalike killed that night, but such claims have been advanced with only circumstantial evidence.

The Laws shows how a philosopher who wanted to influence practical politics might go about it.

The paper helped to launch into public perception a little bit more. It mainly served to raise the awareness of scientists, which was most important since they are the stakeholders, so to speak. That spawned a lot of important research. At the time, forecasting for these systems was poor. The Presidents' Day storm in '79 dropped record-shattering snow on D.C., for instance, and it was really poorly forecast. Thanks to the work that's been done since, prediction has improved phenomenally. And I think the term has helped contribute to the visibility of the phenomenon as well. … It's become popularized in recent years.

And the chair now yields to the designated minority representative of the Oversight and Investigations Committee, the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Stupak. REP. BART STUPAK (D), MICHIGAN: Thank you. Mr. Chairman, and thank you for holding this very important hearing. I hope it is the first of several to look into the tire safety issue. Twenty-two years ago, this committee held four days of hearing on the first incident of tread belt separation in radial tires. The tire was the Firestone 500, a radial developed for passenger vehicles. Although the 500 had a very high rate of failure at the time of the hearings -- there were 15 deaths and 16 injuries, ultimately 41 deaths resulted -- in contrast, there are already 88 fatalities attributed to the tread belt separation in the Firestone ATX series of tires we are looking at today, and the number continues to grow. The reason: This tire's placed on a sport utility vehicle, a vehicle which has a tendency to roll over when a tire fails. The tire failure is one of the top three most serious vehicle safety defects we've ever seen in this country.

The Obamacare accommodation Biden referred to, however, was never viewed as such by many Catholic schools and organizations. Instead, they recognized it as an accounting trick whereby completion of a certified form would merely transfer their mandate to directly provide abortion-inducing drugs to an insurance provider, who would take care of the administration of these services for the faith-based groups. In short, the accommodation simply ensured the abortion-inducing drugs were paid for, as the Obama-Biden administration desired, while the conscience issues of the faith-based groups remained ignored.

By the time the midterm elections began, the Sunrise Movement had started carving out a place for itself, helping to elevate candidates who took climate change more seriously than just declaring a belief in the basic science.

A bold plan to transition to a green economy will both put Americans to work and reduce pollution that keeps millions of the working poor sick and trapped in poverty. Kids will miss fewer days of school due to respiratory illness, parents will miss fewer days of work, and working a full-time job will pay a livable wage. And action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is the only way to lower the probability that devastating fires, hurricanes and floods will become even more frequent occurrences. For the kinds of climate-related impacts that we have already endured ― and will continue to ― we need coordinated infrastructure and systems in place to ensure that Americans are prepared and protected.

Still reeling from defeat of the Confederacy, Southern Democrats often retaliated against this new power structure.

Sherburn: A rural veterinarian who has taken in dozens of miniature horses since they were seized because of maltreatment says she wants to be paid for caring for them for a year and a half. Shirley Kittleson says the bill for their care has topped $325,000. Kittleson filed a lawsuit last month against the Humane Society and Watonwan County for nonpayment. Kittleson was asked to care for the herd of 72 after the Animal Humane Society and Watonwan County sheriff seized the horses from a farm in Odin in June 2018. The farm's owner, Michael Johnson, was convicted of two counts of animal neglect. Watonwan County told Kittleson soon after she sent them a couple of monthly bills that the horses were the responsibility of the Humane Society. Kittleson said she could find new homes for the horses, but the Humane Society won't release the herd, according to the Star Tribune.

So that lane remains clogged up. I think it's -- it's amazing to me that a -- a mayor of a town of 100,000 is actually in the top two in the Democratic nomination. Keep in mind that no mayor of New York City, population 8 million, the capital of the world, has gone on to higher office, of any higher office, since 1840. Not 1940, but 1840. So that sort of tells against Mike Bloomberg, but it shows that there is still a hunger from at least -- I don't think amongst the voters necessarily so much, but for part of the party to just -- we just need some kind of moderate voice in there. And even if it's the mayor of a small town, you know, we'll take it because they think Bernie's a disaster.

St. George: More than 16,000 public comments have been submitted for a proposal on whether to allow a highway to be built through a protected Mojave desert tortoise habitat in southern Utah, federal officials said. The proposed four-lane road has drawn criticism from conservationists because the corridor would run through land set aside to protect the tortoise. The Bureau of Land Management opened the public comment period last month and will now go through all of the comments before releasing the draft environmental impact statement, The Spectrum newspaper reported Wednesday. BLM is not permitted to say where the people submitting comments were from, but there was a mix of people who submitted comments locally and nationally, Venhuizen said. Details on the nature of the comments were not disclosed. The draft is the first step in the year-long National Environmental Policy Act, officials said. The Utah Division of Transportation and Washington County proposed building the Northern Corridor that would pass through the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, officials said. A definite route for the road has not yet been determined, but the draft statement would take alternatives into consideration, officials said. After the department releases the draft environmental impact statement, a new 90-day public comment period will open, officials said. A decision is expected by 2021.

It's got to the point that there's so many spills that for animals there's a highly organized system in place, Barnes says.
A recent study found that the vast majority of Americans, regardless of region or political ideology, support the landmark environmental law. The legal back-and-forth on grizzly bear delisting seemed to have no discernible impact, the study found.
Last year, the association co-signed a letter opposing the new rule, along with more than 50 medical, environmental and scientific groups including the American Medical Association, the American Heart Association and the American Public Health Association.
And on Wednesday, it seemed as though Sanders was at least in part responding to that call, essentially laying down for Biden a challenge and a road map to secure his support and extend a winning coalition to the left.
Still, the fact that the world managed to agree on a target was celebrated as a diplomatic achievement, one that multiple world leaders have emphasized as crucial to support. After the recent G-7 meetings of leading industrial nations, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and vocally supported her commitment to action on climate change.

SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --accomplished for us to successfully leave Syria. And the President's slowing down and he's re-evaluating his policies in light of those three objectives. Don't let Iran get the oil fields, don't let the Turks-- Turks slaughter the Kurds, and don't let ISIS come back. I think I share the goal of the President to withdraw our forces. Let's just do it smartly.
Sanders' consistency on Medicare for All ― he would introduce it right away rather than three years into his presidency ― as well as his support for a moratorium on the deportation of undocumented immigrants were key to getting CPD Action's blessing, according to Salgado.
A bipartisan measure, proposed by Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., and Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, was attached to a budget rider that stripped endangered species protections from grey wolves in their home states.
What happened here over the past week illustrates how poor planning by federal health officials and a rumor mill fueled by social media, polarized politics and a lack of clear communication can undermine public confidence in the response to the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease named covid-19. The rapidly spreading virus has rattled economies worldwide in recent weeks and caused the deaths of more than 2,900 people, mostly in China.

This means, for now, climate change can lead to bigger snowfalls for areas where there's more moisture and it is still cold enough to snow, like the Midwest and Northeast. But in areas where temperatures are warming above thresholds for snow more often, like the nation's midsection, the trend in snowfall is downward. The below image makes this trend clear.
The halcyon days after Harry and Meghan's May 2018 wedding, when the two were said to be the future faces of a modern monarchy, have disappeared in a miasma of criticism and mockery over such issues as their insistence on privacy, their opinions on climate change while using private planes, their fury at racist comments posted on royal social media accounts, and their on-going battles with the media over their coverage.

Epidemiological studies that examine the relationship between pollution and health sometimes rely on massive amounts of medical data that is anonymized or kept confidential in order to protect the privacy of study participants. However, rigorous scientific studies are reviewed by multiple experts in the field before publication and that peer-review process includes an examination of how the underlying data was analyzed.
Virtually every Labour MP in the Commons, formerly proud advocates of women's and workers' rights to workplaces free from bullying, chose to suspend that particular principle last year when serious accusations against the Speaker, from more than one reliable source, emerged. Normally – and especially if such allegations had involved a Conservative minister – Labour would have demanded immediate action. But in Bercow's case – as lucidly explained by Dame Margaret Beckett MP – the cause of opposing Brexit trumps any less important issue such as the rights of Commons members of staff.
It's important to note the struggles that have plagued Alberta separatists for decades, including an unsavoury connection to alt-right and white nationalist movements in the province. Parties have struggled to gain footholds campaigning on these alienation-inspired ideas
80% of Georgia's Nov. vote happened before Election day. Based on run-off early voting, if that holds, it would mean 773,343 votes likely in-person today.

For instance, Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., offered a motion to recommit on the House floor in December to landmark legislation that was about to pass to legalize marijuana. Lesko wanted to add language that private sector employers retain the right to test employees for marijuana use. She was able to pick off 11 Democrats for her motion, but it still failed. The overall legislation passed the House.

Emails to Gore were unproductive: after several attempts at engagement, his staff informed Armstrong that Gore did not take bets. The important question of whether public policies should be based on the alarming projections remained, so Armstrong commissioned theclimatebet.com site to track how the bet would have turned out had Gore accepted.
2017 was the third warmest year since records began in 1910, with a national mean temperature of 22.76 degrees Celsius (about 73 Fahrenheit), or 0.95 degree Celsius hotter than the nation's long-term average, the Bureau of Meteorology said in its annual climate statement.

Before the Senate confirmed Droegemeier by voice vote, the vacancy at OSTP under Trump had set a record: Never before had a modern president waited so long to install an administrator in that office. The delay had drawn sharp criticism from lawmakers and academics, who said the president had erred by forging ahead with his policy agenda — including his 2017 decision to leave a key international carbon-reduction pact — without a top science adviser in place.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), an Iraq War veteran who made history in 2012 as the first Hindu elected to Congress, said Friday she will run for president in 2020.

ROTT: Yeah. You know, and look, President Trump is not wrong there. Bad or misguided forest management, let's say, is one of the big reasons that we do have these big fires, you know, as well as climate change. The irony here though is that in a place like California, where I am now, the president keeps berating our forest management, threatening to withhold emergency funds. But more than 50 percent of California's forests are managed by the federal government. And right now, due to the shutdown, federal management isn't happening on those lands.
DeKalb election day turnout approaching 46k, if these figures are accurate, putting it on track to surpass the general.

Macon: Terry Patterson plans to run a dozen marathons in 2020 as he keep logging road race miles at the age of 65. Patterson, of Macon, ran his first marathon, the local Cherry Blossom Road Race, in 2002. He began entering more races and hasn't stopped. In fewer than two decades, Patterson says, he's completed 83 marathons in all 50 states. He estimates the total distance he's run during road races exceeds 10,000 miles. I do get a lot of accolades for how old I am, Patterson told WMAZ-TV. And I do brag about how fast I can run. He's showing no signs of slowing down. Patterson ran a 3-hour, 52-minute marathon in Seattle last fall. In April, he qualified for the Boston Marathon. He's signed up for 12 marathons this year and hopes to add his first race overseas in China. His first marathon of the new year will be closer to home, at nearby Robins Air Force Base on Jan. 18.
Trump's usual critics condemned his request that state election officials find enough votes to win Georgia's electors, but it also drew winces from some of his allies.
The two Republican Hill leaders were supportive of the blueprint but both signaled a long process lay ahead. I welcome the president's blueprint for next year's budget, which turns the page from the last eight years, House Speaker Paul Ryan, of Wisconsin, said in a statement, adding that he looked forward to reviewing this with the Appropriations Committee and our entire conference. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, said he pleased to see an increased focus on our national security and veterans budgets, calling them positive steps in the right direction, according to the Washington Examiner. But McConnell added he looked forward to reviewing this and the full budget when it is released later this spring.

That scenario, which implies the potential for a final, euphoric surge to what's often been described as the most hated bull market in stock-market history, has been regularly predicted ever since the 2013 taper tantrum that drove a temporary spike in Treasury and other bond yields. Indeed, such predictions are now usually met with derision, acknowledged Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, in a Wednesday note.
But other attendees simply believed that Sanders is the politician most authentically committed to enacting Medicare for all, free college and the dramatic measures needed to combat climate change.

Running those models into the future — to the point when global temperatures rise to an average of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times (a mark we may hit by 2050-60) — the chance of fire weather like this season's would be 4 times more likely than it is today.
A draft text circulated around Congress calls for a select committee to be formed to create a plan, and lays out a framework that includes eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and agriculture and dramatically expanding energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable sources.
Lawmakers pass nonbinding resolutions for things as simple as congratulating Super Bowl winners, as well as to send political messages — for example, telling the president they disapprove of his trade policies, as the Senate did in summer 2018.
Steyer has never held office but is one of the Democratic Party's biggest donors and fundraisers.

While accounts earning 3% are hard to come by, consumers should investigate ways to earn more in interest. For instance, many online banks offer above 2% interest on their accounts. Another option is to take out a certificate of deposit — many banks offer 1-year CDs with annual percentage yields above 2.5%.

They are also applying pressure at the federal level. The Green New Deal Network has already written a letter to President-elect Biden and his transition team, arguing that there is a dire need for action beyond legislation.
At the ceremony Wednesday, Trump hailed the momentous, historic and joyous occasion and said the deal would prevent outsourcing and keep jobs in the United States. Vice President Pence and senior adviser Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, were among those in attendance. Dozens of Republican lawmakers also attended.
Netanyahu, who is widely thought to have called early elections to in a bid to avoid indictment before the vote, has much riding on a delay in the legal process. If he is reelected, he could argue that he has the public's support despite the allegations. And if he survives until July, he will become Israel's longest-serving prime minister, overtaking the country's founder, David Ben-Gurion.

The increase in eco-friendly gadgets at the largest consumer electronics event in the U.S. continues an improbable trend begun during the coronavirus pandemic. Despite a broad economic decline, many green industries — from rooftop solar to bicycling — have thrived. Once the pandemic is curbed, environmentalists say keeping these green habits going will be key if humans are to stave off another existential crisis: climate change.

No matter how persuasive the pro-climate argument, no matter how great a majority of the public can be convinced to support climate change action, that action will not happen so long as government officials depend for their political livelihood on the fossil fuel industry.

To finally be seeing it all start to catch on is powerful, but he knows they're going to throw the kitchen sink at him. He's a realist, said Sanders's friend Ben Cohen, the co-founder of Ben & Jerry's ice cream and a Vermont-based liberal activist.
There is one main issue that is central to the rest, and that is the issue of war and peace, she continued. I look forward to being able to get into this and to talk about it in depth when we make our announcement.
Yes, not everything Trump has done fits Mead's paradigm — but a great deal of what makes him different from previous presidents is plainly Jacksonian. A Hamiltonian wouldn't have saber-rattled so wildly against North Korea; a Wilsonian wouldn't be so subsequently eager for a deal with such an odious regime. A Hamiltonian wouldn't be as eager for an extended trade war with China; a Wilsonian would speak out more clearly against Beijing's human rights abuses instead of just treating them as one more bargaining chip. Trump's bureaucracy-impeded attempts to pull out of Syria and Afghanistan are patently Jacksonian; likewise his disdain for his predecessor's negotiations on climate change. His eagerness to pardon war criminals and threaten war crimes, meanwhile, are Jacksonianism at its worst.
Pelosi will say Democrats must be pioneers of the future and accelerate a future that advances America's preeminence in the world by improving public education and workforce development. She also sounds a warning on climate change, calling it a crisis manifested in natural disasters of epic proportions.

Well, maybe, but first, I would still maintain that he was the only hope of breaking that three-year post-referendum deadlock which nearly saw Brexit being cancelled; and second, I had rather hoped — especially under the guidance of an advisor like Dominic Cummings — that his pragmatism would come to the fore and he would have realised that the ONLY way of delivering on his promises for a revitalised post-Brexit Britain, for the working classes especially, was to ditch the green crap.

Dana Point: A baby gray whale heading south with its mother was spotted swimming alongside dolphins and sea lions off the Southern California coast. Crew members on a whale-watching boat recorded video of the pair in about 100 feet of water near Salt Creek Beach in Dana Point on Tuesday. Capt. Frank Brennan aboard Dana Wharf's Ocean Adventure estimated that the calf was just a day or so old. You could still see the fetal folds on it behind the blowhole, he said of the young whale. Brennan told the Orange County Register he followed the pair as white-sided dolphins stopped feeding to check the whales out. The dolphins and whales were then joined by a group of sea lions. The whales are migrating to the lagoons of Baja, Mexico.

Rep. Tom McClintock (R-CA), an ally of the president, criticized his tweet and urged him to reconsider. In his own statement, McClintock said that the principal blame for California's wildfires lies with federal agencies and laws which govern most of our state's forests and brushlands, not with state laws. He added that cutting FEMA's funding to CalFire would damage the one governmental agency that actually works in the state of California.

Similar assumptions exist around organic foods. Organic foods are sometimes deemed healthier than their conventional counterparts, but that's not necessarily the case, Peacock said.

In the op-ed, the former secretaries — who served under Mr. Trump and Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George Bush and Gerald R. Ford — said unequivocally that the military had no role to play in settling election-related controversies. Efforts to involve the U.S. armed forces in resolving election disputes would take us into dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory, they wrote. Civilian and military officials who direct or carry out such measures would be accountable, including potentially facing criminal penalties, for the grave consequences of their actions on our republic. Retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser whom Mr. Trump recently pardoned, suggested on the conservative television network Newsmax last month that Mr. Trump could use the military to rerun the election in swing states, and later attended a meeting with the president at the White House. The former defense secretaries also called for cooperation at the Pentagon during the transition between administrations, an issue that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his team have complained about. Last week, Mr. Biden said his transition team had faced obstruction from the Defense Department. In the op-ed, the former defense secretaries noted that transitions can be a moment when the nation is vulnerable to actions by adversaries seeking to take advantage of the situation, and they said it was critical that the transition at the Pentagon be carried out fully, cooperatively and transparently.

We will not stop until our nation's gleaming new infrastructure has made America the envy of the world again, Trump said. It used to be the envy of the world, and now we're like a third-world country. It's really sad.
GROSS: Yeah. The song is all about denial. Sally Bowles is in denial that she's pregnant and is probably going to have an abortion. This means the end of her relationship with her lover, who is also bisexual. That was not necessarily going to go well anyways. And she's in denial that the Nazis are taking over Germany. And it's not going be a fun time. Things are on the verge of not only collapse, but destruction. So, you know, you get that in the show, but, yes, when people sing it out of context, it's like, yeah, isn't life fun?
You know, in summer we're almost on the verge of running out of fuel in some of these islands, because bad weather sometimes prohibits the ships from actually getting to some of these locations, Heastie said.

The future condition of reefs, and the ecosystem services they provide to people, will depend critically on the trajectory of global emissions, the study concludes.
Balazs highlighted how politicians even in her conservative state have promoted clean energy, and she encouraged her students to take political action. Sarah Niles, who took Balazs's class as a senior, says it was inspiring to learn about solutions to climate change, especially since, so often, the subject felt like devastation with no hope. She recalls days after class where we would go to the common room and just sit because we didn't know what to do. Now, she's taking a gap year before college and volunteering in Rockport, Tex., to help rebuild the community, which was devastated by Hurricane Harvey in 2017. It's a way, she says, to put a face and a name to things you learn about in class, and feel as if she's making a small difference.

Despite the earlier absence of an administrator, OSTP over the past two years has forged ahead with a full agenda. It has sought to advance private-sector research in areas such as artificial intelligence, in part by convening tech giants and other industry experts for a new, policy-focused task force in 2018. It has helped guide the White House's early work to put more self-flying drones in U.S. skies and expand Internet access to rural areas. During that time, the office's most senior official was Michael Kratsios, a former aide to venture capitalist Peter Thiel. Kratsios joined the administration in its early days to serve as deputy chief technology officer.

Rather than attending the annual dinner — where the president traditionally is the opening act for a well-known Hollywood comedian and is also the butt of many of the event's jokes — Trump opted to take a short trip from Washington to Pennsylvania where he visited a tool manufacturing company in Harrisburg and signed two executive orders focused on trade. One of the orders directed the Commerce Department and the U.S. trade representative to conduct a review of existing U.S. international trade and investment agreements and another created a new White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing to be led by Trump adviser Peter Navarro. Then Trump held a rally in in the Pennsylvania city and gave a nearly hourlong stump speech.

Wilmington:A record number of vehicles crossed the Delaware Memorial Bridge from New Jersey into the First State last year. In 2019, 18,288,314 vehicles drove through the southbound toll plaza, cruising past the 2016 record of 17.8 million, according to the Delaware River and Bay Authority. Put another way – if you lined up every one of those cars (assuming each is an average of 14.75 feet) it would stretch more than 51,000 miles. That is twice the Earth's circumference, with a road trip from Delaware to Myrtle Beach, S.C. to spare. The bridge also had a record for a month in August, handling more than 1.8 million vehicles, surpassing the August 2003 record by 27,000. Officials said the record traffic volume could be associated with an improving economy and stable gasoline prices in addition to favorable beach weather. All those vehicles means a good chunk of change in toll revenue. Last year, the net total was an estimated $132.8 million, up roughly $27 million from the previous year. For passenger vehicles, the one-way fare is $5. Tolls are paid by vehicles traveling from New Jersey into Delaware.

In its September forecast, the World Trade Organization (WTO) warned that it was worried world trade would only grow by 1.7% (in volume) in 2016. This is its lowest growth since 2009, the year of the global financial crisis, when international trade started retreating.

Confidence in President Donald Trump to do the right thing when it comes to world affairs remains broadly negative, according to a Pew Research Center survey.
In November 2016, the Pope called climate change skeptics to an ecological conversion, while denouncing what he believed to be a weak reaction from governments to the climate crisis. He also criticized the ease with which well-founded scientific opinion about the state of our planet is disregarded.
The opposite is also true: U.S. greenhouse gas emissions could continue to go down, at least in the short term, even as Trump withdraws from the accord.
But there's one problem with the graphic that makes it a bit misleading.
North Kingstown: The annual Rhode Island National Guard Open House Air Show in Quonset Point will resume in 2020 after having been canceled last year because of troop deployments. This year's show is scheduled for June 27-28 at the Quonset Air National Guard Base in North Kingstown, the National Guard announced Friday. The air show debuted in 1992 and has been canceled twice – once in 2013 because of federal budget cuts and last year due to a large number of deployments within the Rhode Island National Guard. Officials said they expected more than 500 troops to be deployed last year during the traditional time frame of the air show. Officials say this year's show will include an F-22 Raptor demonstration, the U.S. Air Force Academy Jump Team, a World War II heritage flight and the Geico Skytypers.

More to the point, why is Trump handing off chunks of the world — Syria, Afghanistan, the Sea of Azov — to America's greatest international foe? (Some think it's a payoff for 2016 election help; others attribute his moves to protection of personal finances.) And where does this giveaway stop — at the Baltics? At Berlin? (It's stunning that hawks such as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who'd melt down if President Barack Obama had said any of this, remain dependable sycophants for a president aiming to destroy the world order they too used to defend.)
But don't forget; this whole shutdown started when McConnell passed - unanimously - a compromise bill through the Senate for - to open the government not fund the wall. Trump originally said he would sign it. Then Trump changed his mind, and the shutdown happened. And now McConnell says he's not going to put anything on the floor of the Senate if the president won't sign it.

COONS: Well, that was a concerning, even alarming report and it suggests to me that the Mueller investigation needs to continue to its logical conclusion. I'm grateful for the partnership of Senator Graham, now the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in reintroducing our bipartisan bill with Senators Tillis and Booker to protect the Mueller investigation, and I think that report by The New York Times may well suggest what it was that helped start this investigation in the first place.

But we also have to maintain our leadership on the global stage, which means that when we make a commitment, we stand by it, and we don't just try to exercise politics on the global stage.

In an interview with Anderson Cooper to air Sunday on CBS's 60 Minutes, Ocasio-Cortez said the huge government expansion could be paid for in part by taxpayers contributing their fair share. She said that, like in the 1960s, tax rates for those with incomes up to $75,000 could be as low as 10 or 15 percent, but much higher for those earning millions.

Sanders continues to say that he likes Biden and that defeating Trump is the most important thing this year. Sanders has pledged unequivocally to support his opponent if he himself loses the nomination, something he has done more vigorously and more often than he did in 2016. Despite disparaging the party, and though some of his supporters often get into vitriolic arguments, particularly online, Sanders is clear that he does not want to hand the election to Republicans.
President Donald Trump and his assault on our ability to mount a response to the coronavirus pandemic were soundly defeated Nov. 3. But his enablers, and the people who stand in the way of soundly defeating this virus — the Republican majority in the U.S. Senate — are still at large. A dynamic and successful response to COVID-19 requires as many oars rowing in the same direction as possible. Congress so far is failing to step up to its vital role supporting the public, states, small businesses and the distribution of vaccines, and giving Americans what they need to support their families and safely isolate.
What Shell is purchasing in getting his time is a lawyer who is known to be a Democrat who had some good clients, and that provides a positive sheen to their cause, Jeff Hauser, director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research's Revolving Door Project, previously told HuffPost.
In 2015, when countries came together in Paris, the vital lesson we all learned was that we can only move forward when we hold everyone's ability to play their part in equal regard. The agreement creates a common framework for action -- for richer and poorer countries alike -- while recognizing their different circumstances and needs. Achieving the Paris goals will take action from everyone -- not just countries, but companies, local governments and even individuals. On the road to the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference, COP26, in Glasgow in November, this lesson is paramount.
The COVID-19 pandemic ... provides us with an opportunity to reimagine and recreate public health.

As the authors note, these dire projections are roughly consistent with recent research from other scientists using different models and assumptions: see here, here, here, and here. And they also dovetail with the findings of California's Fourth Climate Change Assessment, released in August. As a result of projected warming, Sierra Nevada snowpacks will very likely be eradicated below about 6,000 feet elevation and will be much reduced by more than 60% across nearly all of the range, the report found. The Fourth National Climate Assessment, released without fanfare by the Trump administration the day after Thanksgiving, offered similar warnings about fast-vanishing snowpacks in the West.
Bernie Sanders is staying in the race for president, but he made it obvious on Wednesday that he sees Joe Biden's clear path to the nomination.
Virtually every World Heritage site has some level of threat from climate change, said Adam Markham, deputy director of the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a science advocacy NGO based in the United States.
He promised to block all new fossil fuel infrastructure, including a controversial pipeline currently under construction in Brooklyn, and vowed to ban all gas hookups in newly built and renovated construction. He called the city's network of roughly a dozen gas- and oil-burning power plants relics of the past, and that's where I'll put them, and promised a fleet of electric buses and subway improvements. He said he'd implement a standing proposal to shutter the infamous prison on Rikers Island and convert the facility to a solar farm and target aid to communities that suffered the worst excesses of both polluters and policing.
(Also, I'm sorry, but using insults like Nazi is just moronic. Apart from being inaccurate — there are plenty of more damning epithets you could reasonably use on Soubry — they're just a gift to the enemy.

Yes, we know guys that you're doing it sarcastically, in response to endless provocation from leftists doing Nazi salutes at you.

Ultimately Biden may be on the path to the nomination, but he still needs a really strong performance. His performance on the trail has not always been really solid. At times, it's been uneven. He has to start demonstrating that he's steady, that he's in command, that he's ready to be the nominee.
We've never seen any administration, which could match its record, so Catholics will have to weigh all of these decisions along with many other issues, he explained, emphasizing that not all issues are weighed equally by the Church.
The study revealed that during the course of the year 2017, at least 485 scientific papers were published that in some way questioned the supposed consensus regarding the perils of human CO2 emissions or the efficacy of climate models to predict the future.
Since the end of the Little Ice Age in the 1880s, the planet has warmed by about 0.8 degrees C. You might think that was not a particularly drastic rate of warming to worry about. You might also note that such a rate of warming is well precedented in periods throughout history, such as during the Minoan, Roman and Medieval warming periods. Nonetheless this 0.8 degrees C rise – 0.9 degrees C, at a push – is the terrible climatic event the alarmist establishment has been assuring these last few decades is the worst thing ever and something that should worry us awfully.

Our overarching goal is to ensure that everyone at NPR is safe and treated with respect.
Fayetteville: The Washington County jail has temporarily suspended its work-release program to free up more bed space in the facility, which has been hindered by overcrowding. Washington County Sheriff Tim Helder said the move will open up 24 beds, with some detainees being released if eligible and others moved into the jail's general population. The sheriff told the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that a recent increase in the number of sex offenders housed at the county jail prompted the decision because sex offenders must be housed separately from other detainees. The county jail has 710 beds, but because of legal requirements to separate certain detainees, it's considered full when the facility is 80% full, or at 568 detainees, the sheriff's office said. On Monday, the number of detainees reached 792, authorities said.
Accused Of Selling 'His Progressive Bona Fides'
ANTHONY SALVANTO: It remains a multicandidate race. There's no question about it. And I think part of that is you look at Bernie Sanders and you look at, despite that enthusiasm that he has, can he grow it? Can he draw people to him? And when we ask folks, most of the people supporting Sanders say they've already liked him. They've liked him for a long time. But far fewer say they've taken-- taken a second or third look at him as he's won these early states. So can he translate any success he's had into momentum going forward and build on that twenty-five, that thirty percent that he's already got? That, I think, remains a key question.

Sanders is not conceding. He'll be at the next debate and in the next contests. His allies say a good debate and a Biden gaffe could turn the tide, and Biden doesn't yet have even half the delegates he needs to secure the Democratic nomination.

An Army brat who lived as a high schooler in Berlin, Guthrie recalls going to East Berlin to watch a tribute to the Berlin Wall, a Communist display of propaganda. Back then, it made him believe that the wall would never come down, but today he realizes how much that fictional exercise reinforced the wall's symbolic power. Now, he fears that by not speaking up forcefully about climate change as a generational issue, institutions are propping up this fictional story that you can care for kids in our country while neglecting or ignoring the climate. As a teacher, Guthrie is a mandated reporter, someone legally required to speak up about signs of child abuse and neglect. If climate change will harm his students and is causing them anguish, isn't silence on the issue a violation of that duty?

The Sunrise Movement is working with electoral groups such as Justice Democrats and Climate Hawks Vote to identify progressive primary challengers to moderate incumbents who oppose a Green New Deal.

Given the severity of the challenge we now face, it would be easy to see 2018 as an irreversible step backward, the sealing of our already grim fate. Yet despite all this, 2018's midterm elections showed that politicians do have a path forward with American voters when it comes to comprehensive action on climate. The message, as it turns out, isn't any sort of brilliant political calculus either. It's a return to kitchen-table issues: jobs and economic opportunity.

For Biden, the tension in the Middle East provides a chance to play up his foreign policy experience, both as vice president and as a longtime member and former chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Indeed, with a bit of whimsy, one might even ask: If Mother Nature is giving us a gift, should we not feel an obligation to accept it? Surely we wouldn't want to offend her by refusing such a gift. After all, as the classic TV commercial from the 70s, warned us, It's not nice to fool Mother Nature.

But that is a fight about allocation. McClintock focused on storage, noting that the cheapest and best way to solve the state's water problems — measured in cost per acre-foot — is to build more reservoirs rather than letting much of the state's rainfall run out to sea. McClintock reminded me that it has been 40 years since California's last dam, the New Melones Dam, was completed in 1978.

Even though, in so many ways, the events this week were not surprising or out of step with the political violence the U.S. has seen before — white rage has frequently turned violent in this country — they'll be seen as exceptional, and therefore not damaging to the national business climate.
Another is the havoc the green ideology has wreaked on honest science and on once-trustworthy government institutions such as National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Let me read you a few headlines and you tell me how it makes sense that not one executive was prosecuted for fraud.
The Trump administration couldn't get any safety net cuts through Congress, so it used regulations to push changes to food, health and disability benefits.

She managed to keep defections to just a handful, winning over several Democrats who had opposed her two years ago when the party had a more comfortable majority. The nearly party-line vote punctuated an opening day marked more by precaution than pomp, as the 117th Congress convened for the first time under the threat of a deadly coronavirus pandemic that has rattled its ranks and the country. Several House members sick with Covid-19 missed the session altogether and others cast their vote from behind a plexiglass enclosure specially constructed in a gallery overlooking the chamber. After two years as President Trump's most outspoken Democratic antagonist, Ms. Pelosi will now be responsible for trying to shepherd through Congress as much of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s agenda as possible, while maintaining her party's majority ahead of next year's midterm elections. It will be no easy task. With her party in control of just 222 of 435 seats, Ms. Pelosi can afford to lose only a handful of Democrats on any given vote and faces a Republican opposition empowered by a better than expected showing in November's election. She will also have to contend with a health crisis that can sideline lawmakers at any moment. Scripture tells us that to everything, there is a season: a time for every purpose under the heavens; a time to build, a time to sow, a time to heal, Ms. Pelosi said after accepting the gavel. Now is certainly a time for our nation to heal.
Working to Sanders's advantage is the persistence of several more moderate candidates — Biden, Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg — who appear to be competing for many of the same voters and jockeying to survive as the lone alternative to Sanders.

Some of the efforts were innovative. Ossoff's team hired 2,000 mostly young, mostly Black community organizers to reach out to their personal social networks and encourage people to vote.

Dr. Shaman: Without a doubt. You see evidence of this when you put people in isolation or quarantine you can slow the spread of virus because the virus thrives on contact. And if people are running into each other because they are on subways, buses, in stores and banks — in the urban environment you have hundreds of contacts per day — then the virus will spread faster. In the winter people tend to be in closer quarters.

The climate movement underwent an unprecedented surge since 2018, when United Nations scientists warned that governments had a decade to cut planet-heating emissions in half or doom the world to catastrophic, irreversible warming. The findings made clear that politically unpopular schemes to put a price on carbon emissions and incrementally transition from fossil fuels, which had until then dominated the climate policy mainstream, could not alone deliver the economic changes needed.

At other times, understanding that they had to court the conspiracy-minded activists of the base, the party's leaders went out of their way to confer legitimacy on extremists. Take the GOP's relationship with Christian Coalition leader Pat Robertson, who won four states in the 1988 Republican presidential primary contest. In 1991, Robertson published The New World Order, holding that scheming government pooh-bahs were working to set up world government, a world police force, world courts, world banking and currency, and a world elite in charge of it all. He even suggested that President George H.W. Bush was complicit in establishing this new world order. Still, Republicans wanted votes and donations from Robertson's acolytes, so Newt Gingrich, Oliver North, William Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jesse Helms and Dinesh D'Souza all happily spoke at his Road to Victory conferences. Sen. Bob Dole, a pillar of the Republican establishment and at the time a presidential candidate, told Robertson's followers in 1995 that I am proud to stand up here and say that I've been awarded a 100 percent voting record in '93 and 100 percent in 1994 and 100 percent in 1995 from the Christian Coalition.

I am glad Trump brought up the end of the Soviet Union, however. The U.S.S.R. didn't magically change its name; the West won the Cold War (until this president) through a combination of a sustained military buildup, strategic alliances, coercive diplomacy and moral clarity — all things Trump has abandoned with the exception of military funding (although it is far from clear this reflects any coherent national security strategy). Putin views the fall of the Soviet Union as a great calamity and seeks a low-cost means of reestablishing Russia as a great power, which Trump unfortunately has aided and abetted, most recently by handing Syria to Russia and its ally Iran.

At least four people reportedly died Wednesday in the chaos, and dozens more were injured. Nooses, unambiguous symbols of mob mentality and racial terror against Black Americans, were strung up on the Capitol grounds to remind everyone exactly what the rioters stood for — and who they stood against. It was an apt end to a presidency fueled by white backlash to racial progress, as Georgia turned blue for the first time in 28 years, as the state voted to send its first Black senator to Washington, as Kamala Harris prepared to take her place as vice president.

Big Sky: Gallatin National Forest officials are warning backcountry enthusiasts to take extra care after three snowmobilers escaped injury in a weekend avalanche near Big Sky. Forest forecaster Alex Marienthal said in a Sunday advisory that the snowmobilers were caught Saturday in a 1,500-foot-wide, 4-to-6-foot-deep slide on Buck Ridge. Marienthal says similar avalanches have broken naturally on sugary and weak layers hidden deep inside snowpack in recent days. More can be expected. Backcountry visitors are urged to avoid slopes that are wind-loaded with snow and to avoid steep slopes that may hide persistent weak layers of snow. Two snowmobilers were killed in a Jan. 1 avalanche near Lake Dinah, northwest of Seeley Lake. The West Central Montana Avalanche Center had issued an avalanche warning for the area after more than a foot of heavy, wet snow had fallen overnight.

And seeing the kind of platform that it had the potential to be, that's what really drew me to pageantry. Because I was already working as a volunteer in some of my charities, and I realized what a bigger reach I could have if I went into pageantry with it. So actually, that was the main reason I pursued pageantry.

Other rule changes eliminate the supermajority requirement to pass federal income tax changes, and potentially avoid future showdowns over raising the debt ceiling by suspending the debt limit through September 30 of the budget year once the House adopts a budget.

Trump went after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in August after the failure of the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. For a thing like that to happen is a disgrace, and frankly it shouldn't have happened, Trump said, adding that he was very disappointed in Mitch. The criticism drew sharp responses from many prominent Republicans, including Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) and former House speaker Newt Gingrich, an informal Trump adviser.

Third, the two parties' voters are different. The most interesting aspect of Warren's launch video was how it diverged from the messaging of every recent Democratic nominee for president. In 2016, Republicans got behind a candidate who argued that there was no compromise with the political class and that a strong leader was needed to dismantle it. Democrats have generally argued that good people can differ and unite against the minority of special interests keeping the government from answering voters' needs.

Charleston: The state has announced its initial slate of events for the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote. The yearlong commemoration will start Wednesday with a reception ahead of the governor's state of the state address, Secretary of State Mac Warner's office said. Women will wear early 1900s-style clothing at the event. Other events throughout the year include a documentary showing, a lecture series, a gala, a women's suffrage march at Marshall University and more. Events are being posted online on Warner's website and through a social media account. Warner is leading a coordinating committee to plan events for the 100th anniversary of women's suffrage.

The Heritage Foundation attempted to use the Energy Information Administration's National Energy Model to forecast the impact of steep carbon taxes aimed at reaching the net-zero greenhouse gas emissions goal. Not only did the model crash, it failed to approach anywhere near the goal outlined in the Green New Deal. The closest Heritage was able to get was a 58 percent reduction in emissions, achieved through a $300 carbon tax -- taxes above $300 crashed the EIA's model.

Now, there's reasonable evidence with the flu that it's not actually linked to temperature, but rather linked to humidity levels and that these viruses thrive in conditions that are very dry, which is what we get in the wintertime. Why that is for flu, we don't know, and if that is the mechanism that extends to coronavirus, we don't know either. Either way it leads to the enticing possibility that maybe this novel coronavirus will also be affected by ambient conditions which lead to it dissipating during summertime.
Thus far though, congressional Democrats have shown the most interest in removing the federal income tax deduction for state and local taxes, which mainly affects upper-middle-class homeowners in blue states. Biden has already promised not to raise taxes on households earning less than $400,000, and wants to restore the corporate tax rate to 28%, not its pre-Trump level of 35%.

Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and a measure of how much the Federalist Society had already shifted frames of reference was the liberal response. ACS was very explicitly founded to do the same kind of work that the Federalist Society has done, Fredrickson says. We, too, have chapters across the country. … We also organize events. We have a group of scholars and experts who work with us on efforts to explain the Constitution and our laws to the broader public. But the ACS still lacks the reach of the Federalist Society, as measured in chapters and budgets. Fredrickson attributes the gap to legal institutions and opportunities on the left being more diffuse than on the right.

I think there's probably a great deal of confusion at the Pentagon and I think it's not an accident that we have not seen a single four-star general come out and speak publicly about what the strategy is in Syria. There's been a great lack of-- of-- of synchronicity between the White House and the Pentagon all along. The question I have now is, how in sync is the National Security advisor--
If such dependency on a potential foe doesn't seem to be a good idea, that's because it isn't. The Trump administration has emphasized the need for domestic rare-earth production, but with distinctly limited success, at least so far. And so in the meantime, it would be enormously helpful if we could import rare earths from Brazil.

The floodwaters will threaten nearby Old North Church, where Paul Revere's ride kicked off, and lap at the edges of Bunker Hill.

The Citizens' Climate Lobby built a network of roughly 400 local groups in part by pushing an avowedly bipartisan message on climate change and appealing to a small cadre of Republicans who back a moderate carbon fee-and-dividend policy. Despite its ideological malleability, many say such a policy amounts to a half-measure in dealing with greenhouse gases.
But I think the legislative path is just about shut off because Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the House, said, even if you open up the government, I will give you $1 for the wall. As long as that's the case, we are never going to get a legislative package no matter what the Senate does.

Oklahoma City: The Oklahoma Corporation Commission said it has approved a plan for an additional area code for 19 central Oklahoma counties in the 405 area, including Oklahoma County and Oklahoma City. The commission said the North American Numbering Plan Administrator will announce the new area code later this month and it will be available in July. Starting in January 2021, callers will have to dial 10 digits that include the area code plus the seven-digit number. Commission spokesman Matt Skinner said existing phone numbers will not be affected or changed, but callers will have to dial all 10 digits to make a phone call. The area code overlay is similar to one adopted in 2011, when the 539 code was added in the 918 area code region that includes Tulsa. The commission said the additional area code is needed because the administrator has determined that the 405 area code will run out of available numbers in December 2021.

And I think President Trump understands he doesn't-- he wants the markets to bounce back. The markets want to see that kind of expertise in Trump-- expertise and-- and-- and credibility. And at least yesterday, there was a step in that direction.

New York City: Nearly 300 of the city's new subway cars were removed over concerns that the doors could open while the trains were in motion, The New York Times reported Wednesday. The 298 cars on the A, C, J and Z lines were supposed to replace subways that date to the 1960s. They were removed after two recent incidents signaled trouble, the Times reported, citing people who were told about the malfunctions. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority did not say what specific incidents led to removing the cars, but said no riders were injured, the newspaper reported. The new cars, known as R-179s, were purchased for $600 million under a contract between the authority and the Canadian manufacturing giant Bombardier. A Bombardier spokeswoman told the Times that the company's investigation of the cars showed that the doors had not been properly calibrated by a supplier, Nanjing Kangni Mechanical & Electrical of China. Transit workers complained that the new cars speedometer was hard to see, that the master controller used to drive the train was uncomfortable and the space between cars was too narrow for some workers to operate in. Riders also complained that new cars broke down much more often than older subway cars, the Times reported. An outside firm has been hired by the MTA to inspect the troubled cars.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington and this week on FACE THE NATION, the coronavirus has now claimed the life of an American within the U.S. and the number of infected has increased and now includes cases of unknown origin. Meanwhile, the Trump administration scrambles to calm fears of Americans concerned with the spread of coronavirus and its impact on the economy as the stock market has its worst week since the 2008 financial crisis.

Your tax rate, you know, let's say, from zero to $75,000 may be ten percent or 15 percent, et cetera. But once you get to, like, the tippy tops— on your 10 millionth dollar— sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 or 70 percent. That doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that as you climb up this ladder you should be contributing more.

There's been a lot of talk about how the election of Donald Trump has sparked a new energy and engagement in politics on both the right and the left. We're going to hear now the story of a mobilization of scientists concerned that the Trump administration could upend years of work on climate change. Some scientists are worried about President Trump's Environmental Protection Agency administrator who's criticized EPA rules on climate change, clean air and water, and those concerns are prompting some scientists to move beyond just advocating for science to organizing and even running for office.

SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think this is the reality setting in that you got to plan this out. President Obama ended the operations in Iraq against sound military advice. The President's getting sound military advice about the status of the Kurds--what will happen with Iran if we leave too soon. And the-- bottom line here is we want to make sure we get this right, that ISIS doesn't come back. And I applaud the President for re-evaluating what he's doing. He hasn't changed his mind but he's listening to a lot of good advice. And President Obama never would do that. And you saw what happened when a President shuts people out. This President's not shutting people out. He has a goal in mind of reducing our presence. I share that goal. Let's just do it smartly.

You know, he is not that strong among Latino voters. It's Bernie Sanders who seems to be polling among Latino voters in Nevada, which only heightens the importance of South Carolina.

Chicago: O'Hare and Midway international airports have added boxes where travelers can dispose of recreational marijuana before they board their flights. The cannabis amnesty boxes, as they're called, were installed at each airport last week, just as legal marijuana sales began in Illinois. The boxes are located just past the airports' Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, the Chicago Tribune reported. Although police aren't targeting travelers with cannabis, and it's not illegal to have it at the airport, possessing is still illegal under federal law, and air space is regulated by the federal government, Chicago Police Department spokeswoman Maggie Huynh said. The boxes give people an opportunity to ensure that they're not breaking federal law and won't run into an issue when they land at their destination, she said. The boxes are owned by the Department of Aviation and serviced by the police. Police officers will regularly empty the boxes, file a report for the items inside and dispose of any surrendered marijuana like they would narcotics, Huynh said. Illinois residents can legally possess up to 30 grams of marijuana, or about an ounce, in Illinois and out-of-state residents can have half that.

The government appoints the bishops. The government controls everything. The Catholic church always condemned that as a communist front group. The Vatican just made a deal with the communist front group that they are going to be regarded as the real church, and the underground church has to resign and just go join the communist church.

But the often apocalyptic nature of the news about climate change is perhaps uniquely paralyzing.

Overcome by a sense of powerlessness, they simply feel stuck in a situation, with no way out.

Dear Sir, As an ever-increasingly frustrated member of the sane middle, your commentary regarding the president's ability to declare an emergency and Congress's sudden abhorrence of the power they gave him hit all my sweet spots.

Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie. And they enlisted politicians to cut them a bigger slice.

In an interview set to air Sunday on CBS News' 60 Minutes, Ocasio-Cortez — who has begun referring to herself by the nickname, AOC — told Anderson Cooper that the Green New Deal would require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive as possible right now, including raising taxes to a marginal rate of 70%, as in the 1960s.

Although the 1970 law is not well known outside certain legal and policy circles, NEPA compels agencies to analyze thousands of projects across the country each year.

MONTANARO: Right. There aren't a whole lot of specifics of how to get there, and it's certainly not something that Democratic leadership is going to want to try to put on the floor to try to put moderates in a potentially precarious position because, remember, Democrats did win the House on the backs of moderates because of a lot of those suburban districts that were held by Republicans previously.

HOLMES: Yes, I think it's obvious, right? I mean if you're talking about a $4 billion discrepancy, there's got to be a way to get -- come to the middle of it. Certainly if you were in the Democratic Party right now, there are concessions that you're interested in accomplishing, right?

With the delivery of the first doses of vaccine to hospitals in mid-December, the light at the end of the pandemic tunnel grew a bit brighter. The initial shipment of 2.9 million doses was enough only to start inoculating health-care workers and nursing-home residents. But it portended the beginning of the end — the hope that by the middle of 2021, perhaps, anyone who wanted to be vaccinated against the coronavirus could be.
Presidential Transition Highlights: Nancy Pelosi Is Re-elected as House Speaker The nearly party-line vote gave Ms. Pelosi control of a slim majority for what may be her final term.

To return to the refrain: sequencing and pacing matter. It would have made more sense to begin with creating new jobs before the old jobs were destroyed, to ensure that the profits of the oil and coal companies were taxed, and the hidden subsidies they receive eliminated, before asking those who are barely getting by to pony up more.

Whatever the case, if you know what to look for, the pathogen problem comes into terrifying focus. For example, the next time a friend has a sudden flu -- what folks sometimes misdescribe as the stomach flu -- ask a few questions. Was your friend's illness one of those 24-hour flus that come and go quickly: retch or crap, then relief? The diagnosis isn't quite so simple, but if the answer to this question is yes, your friend probably didn't have the flu at all.

The pledge, even more than the Green New Deal, represents a true litmus test for serious climate action in 2020 and beyond, R.L.

A true believer in manmade climate change, Mr. Sander's expressed his delight last July at the resignation of EPA director Scott Pruitt.
It certainly appears, more than ever, that the truth itself is on trial, as Peter Baker recently wrote in the New York Times. Some conservatives say Trump, and Trumpism, represent a new frontier of conspiratorial politics — that the theories are unique to Trump's sensibility and peculiar to his paranoid White House. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication, former president George W. Bush said in a 2017 speech. The main problem behind the proliferation of political conspiracy theories is a president who is also a self-invented fabulist, argued Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson.

New York state is looking at massive spending cuts due to the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has been especially devastating for New York. And even this latest relief package does not include more assistance for state and local governments.
The cold air that's normally confined to the Arctic, it's kind of dammed in by the polar vortex itself -- because winds normally blow from west to east inside the polar vortex, so it acts as barrier, keeps the cold air to the north and the mild air to the south, Cohen said. When it breaks down, the cold air that's penned up in the Arctic spills to lower latitudes, and that's when you get those episodes of severe winter weather.
In 1900, journalist and anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells wrote of the mass lynching that took place in New Orleans that July, during which a white mob ran a relentless four-day campaign of racial terror against Black residents. The incident, as Wells described it, began with the inexcusable and unprovoked assault upon two colored men by police officers of New Orleans. Robert Charles, one of the Black men who was arrested, was attacked by one of the officers; he shot and killed the cop, and evaded arrest. White residents, long fueled by mob mentality as a course of retaliation, were given legal sanction to kill Charles. Reports say at least seven were killed as whites scoured the city preying on Black residents.

It's not clear yet, the researcher wrote, how exactly the wild female swing will impact the sea turtles' future.

You can restructure markets so everyone benefits, or you can break down the market system, either eliminating the profit motive or giving everybody a public option, Dayen wrote. The impulse is the same: The game is rigged and must be fixed. But there's a long gap between re-writing the rules of the game, as Warren wants, and turning over all the chess pieces, as Sanders does.
That interpretation of the law could make it much easier to build some pipelines, which have become controversial as activists have sought to block projects that extract, transport or burn fossil fuels linked to climate change.
In style and substance, Wallace and Sanford represented opposite ends of the Democratic spectrum in the one-party South of that era. Wallace once said of Sanford: Hell, you ever heard him speak? He'll bore yo' ass off.
We need to have the same level of rigor and accountability that is used to report a company's finances for measuring the other impacts that companies have on society. For instance, we can debate what's the right social cost of carbon, but we shouldn't have to debate whether societies deserve to know the amount of emissions companies are having. This is a core impact companies are having on the world, so we have some right to know who is responsible, who is accountable for those emissions.
This strikes me as a typical Trumpian word salad that reveals his sketchy and inadequate grasp of the geopolitics of Afghanistan, says former ambassador to Turkey, Eric S. Edelman. The Soviet Union went into Afghanistan to prop up one faction of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) against another. Their invasion catalyzed the existing Islamist opposition to the PDPA but I digress. (In other words, Trump's claim Russia went into Afghanistan to stop terrorist attacks is flat-out wrong.) Edelman adds, Simply put he has no idea what he is talking about.
The Thomas Fire last year burned almost 300,000 acres, including areas important for monarch breeding and migration, Pelton said.

Two feet of sea level rise by the end of the century would have big effects on places like Miami and New Orleans, but I don't still view that as catastrophic because those cities can survive -- at great expense -- that amount of rising seas under normal situations, Nerem said.

Using biblical language like that might sound like histrionics or exaggeration, but it is actually pretty accurate.

The ambitious proposals addressing climate change and health care and other domestic priorities touted by Biden and Harris will be difficult, if impossible, to advance with more moderate Democrats — especially those facing competitive 2022 midterm reelection campaigns — reluctant to sign onto partisan proposals.

Town: A man from Illinois drove through Wisconsin last week with a snowmobile strapped to the roof of his car, creating a bit of a stir. Tommy Mecher, an electrician apprentice from Chicago, said he could not afford to get a trailer and pay for the extra gas to tow his snowmobile up north. I only burned $10 more in gas on a 430-mile trip, Mecher said. I put it on the roof in Lemont, Illinois, where the snowmobile was and drove it up to Bessemer, Michigan. Snowmobiling can be an expensive pastime. There's the expensive machine, helmet and cold-weather clothing, the cost to travel to a spot with enough snow and the expenses of a weekend of roaring across groomed trails. But Mecher purchased the 1990 Polaris Indy 500 snowmobile a few weeks ago, made a few minor repairs to get it running and left for his father's house in Bessemer last Friday. Mecher said It took about an hour to load the snowmobile on the roof of his 2005 Chevy Malibu, using an old blue Ford tractor with a bucket. He modified the end of the snowmobile to keep the machine's track from caving in the roof or breaking the rear window. Mecher made a support rack of boards to shift the snowmobile's weight to the sides of the roof, away from the middle. He secured his sled with several straps that he looped through the open rear doors before tightening them and closing the doors.

Two weeks ago, the Vatican insisted that a focus on the coronavirus pandemic must not draw people's attention away from migrants.
In hallways and during panels, networking continued to mix with intellectual ferment. I ran into Josh Blackman, the Texas professor and blogger; he was scheduled to be on a panel where he would urge judges to tweet more and make decisions easier to search online. All the action does go on in the hallway, he told me. At dinner last night I met with friends old and new who had things they wanted to tell me, things they wanted me to think about, things I want to write about. As long as you have your eyes and ears open, you always are able to connect in new ways.
2016 marks the 400th anniversary of the death of William Shakespeare. It's perhaps somewhat macabre to pay such close attention to a death (birthdays are more joyous), but in the case of Shakespeare, it's worth it. His plays, and their themes, continue to influence us.
It isn't nothing, but once again, it is inadequate given the scope of the crisis.

The Trump administration did surprise some development experts last year when it supported a $13 billion capital increase for the World Bank, the first such boost since 2010. The increase, which the White House had initially resisted, was conditional on the bank putting cost controls in place and came with the understanding that lending to China would be expected to decline. The bank lent $64 billion to developing countries last year, a figure that included China.
DONNA BRAZILE, FORMER DNC CHAIR: Has President Trump learned in any lesson over the last couple of months? He's on a retribution tour. He's on a revenge tour.
The bad news is piling up at a time when Central Valley farmers (egged on by the Trump administration) are already fighting with state managers for larger annual allocations of snowmelt, at least some of which has to flow into the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta and to the Pacific. According to the Water Education Foundation, 80 percent of the state's commercial fishery species live in or migrate through the Delta, and at least half of its Pacific Flyway migratory water birds rely on the region's wetlands. Its ecosystem already teeters near collapse, driven in part by relentless shunting of water to farm interests in the Central Valley.
The remainder of the rally was ripped from Trump's familiar political playbook and was like traveling back in time to his best moments on the 2016 campaign trail. He faulted his predecessor, former President Barack Obama: the previous administration gave us a mess.

He added there is a need to re-imagine the way nations cooperate, before warning We need a networked multilateralism, bringing together the U.N. system, regional organisations, international financial institutions and others. And we need an inclusive multilateralism, drawing on the indispensable contributions of civil society, business, cities, regions and, in particular, with greater weight given to the voices of youth.
Warmer, more acidic ocean water is the cause of the bleaching, Pieter Tans, chief greenhouse gas scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said last year. The bleaching occurs when algae that live inside and nourish coral, which provides their brilliant colors, wither from the warming waters and die, leaving behind white coral skeletons.
BERNARD KERIK, FORMER NEW YORK CITY POLICE COMMISSIONER: Well listen, I've been, you know, talking about this for the last year where I think the city, the State of New York is irresponsible in creating these laws where they're not holding people accountable.
WALTZ: No, I don't think we are. I think this was a response to stop the series of escalations. The President's made it clear that if they escalate again, our response will be overwhelming. The last thing the Iranian regime wants is a war with the United States because the thing they value the most is their own survival and they know they would be destroyed in such a conflict. They have in a whole history of escalating right up to the edge and when faced with strength, they backed down.
SAGAL: You can go with A again.
I had a little situation with somebody that took place in front of my child. He [my son] was asking me what was happening and I didn't want to explain to my child why this guy upset me. I didn't want to explain to him at three and a half years old because he doesn't see that, Clark said about discrimination. It just made me so angry. So we got 'This Land' after that.
Ramirez also weighed in: While a great alternative for vegetarians and vegans, it's not always healthier. Fake meats can often be high in sodium and also are considered a processed food.
HEMINGWAY: And people really should be skeptical when they are told things. The previous two presidents had problems trusting intelligence that they shouldn't have trusted. You can never get mad at people for asking to the goods on intelligence or being skeptical that another president will embroil us in a war in the Middle East. But yes, you need to check your facts, and you need to not fall for conspiracy theories and whatnot. And that's not happening.

There's a cardinal, Cardinal Zen, I believe, who spent a lot of time in a communist prison, and he feels completely betrayed by the fact that they're making a deal with his persecutors, said Zmirak. Vatican officials are saying, 'Oh, [Joseph Zen is] out of touch. He doesn't know what he's talking about.' They're dismissing the guy who lives in the country and has been in its prisons while they sit in their little Italian hideaways eating gnocchi, drinking wine, and imagining that they're great realpolitik practitioners.

The next most important segment of the judiciary — the federal appeals courts — is also filling up with Federalist Society members: Twenty-five of the 30 appeals court judges Trump has appointed are or were members of the society. Our opponents of judicial nominees frequently claim the president has outsourced his selection of judges, McGahn quipped to a Federalist Society gathering in 2017. That is completely false. I've been a member of the Federalist Society since law school. Still am. So, frankly, it seems like it's been in-sourced.

The people pushing it are claiming it's in the interest of science, but the entire independent science world says it's not, said Chris Zarba, a former director of the EPA's Science Advisory Board who retired in 2018 after nearly four decades at the agency. It sounds good on the surface. But this is a bold attempt to get science out of the way so special interests can do what they want.

That follows general male attitudes towards health care. A U.S. study found that men were much less likely than women to regularly see doctors, and much more likely to skip suggested appointments. In general, men who have the most traditional, macho views about masculinity are the least likely to get routine check-ups and necessary medical care, according to Harvard Men's Health Watch.

Bremmer added: In other words, this is the first time we've ever seen as U.S. leadership erodes, no one else has been standing up. Now the leader of China is saying we're prepared to stand up whether it's on climate or the global economy, you know, regional security, you name it -- that's a big change for the world.

I jumped into a hot shower to warm up and quickly discovered that one of the worst things you can do for frostbite ― which, as it turned out, was what I had ― is add hot water to the mix. The patch of skin on the end of my nose was scratchy and hard for a solid year.
Given that so many artists who have come before me, especially artists of color, have given me so much, I feel like I have a platform and I want to use it. I think I can bring people joy and light while also bringing them some place to feel mourning or anger, outrage, sadness. All those things. That's what my heroes did: They made time to, on their records and in their lives, express all the dimensions of themselves in that way.
The CDU will have to choose a leader with a clear view of what they want to do and whom they want to govern with. The top two contenders seem to be Friedrich Merz, the former BlackRock executive who was the runner-up in the leadership contest two years ago, and Jens Spahn, the 39-year old health minister.

WALLACE: And your committee is going to begin holding confirmation hearings this week on the president's nomination of William Barr to be the new attorney general.

The U.S. economy is expected to come roaring back in 2021 as coronavirus vaccines become more widely available and Americans begin to venture out again to restaurants, workplaces and entertainment venues. Yet just as the recession hurt low-wage workers more than people in white-collar industries, the recovery will benefit some people much more quickly than others.
Though smaller than nature's own reservoir, California's system of man-made reservoirs is vast — and complex. The Public Policy Institute of California notes that state and federal agencies manage 240 large reservoirs that account for 60% of the state's storage capacity, with the rest of the state's reservoirs owned and operated by local water agencies, or by private entities for use on private lands.
I just want to remind you, Laura, when Usama bin Laden was killed and Obama ordered it, I celebrated that publicly and on television, and I praised him and said I am glad the president made the decision. I think every Republican did. Why can't Democrats accept this? And I heard one of them the other day say it was the right thing to do but the wrong person did it.
ALEX AZAR: That's not one of the highest priority areas that we're looking at right now, because Mexico only has a couple of cases. Canada's epidemiology is similar to the United States right now. What the President's making clear, though, is we'll always be looking at travel restrictions, border protections. We will take whatever measures are appropriate and necessary to protect the American people. But we don't forecast doing that anytime soon.

Chefs and restaurateurs will continue to blow up their concepts in 2021. No one knows for sure when diners will feel comfortable sitting inside restaurants again, which means operators at all levels will continue to devote resources to takeout, ghost kitchens and other solutions. But the pandemic has also forced countless owners to go into debt, including back rent, and restaurateurs who survive this mess will need to diversify their revenue streams to help settle those accounts.

PROGRESSIVES PRESSURE AOC, OTHER DEMS TO FORCE PELOSI'S HAND ON MEDICARE-FOR-ALL VOTE
The senators are facing an unprecedented challenge in the final days before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses.

It was also revealed earlier this month that much of Thunbergs social media posts on Facebook are not actually written by her personally, but rather by her father, Svante Thunberg, or Adarsh Prathap, an Indian climate change activist.
James Weldon Johnson, the president of the NAACP, wrote to President Calvin Coolidge in 1925, warning that Black voters planned to vote against candidates supported by the Ku Klux Klan. The NAACP and its leaders were demanding that the Republican Party denounce the racist organization, to no avail. (Trump infamously refused to condemn the KKK on television in 2016.)

The relationship between President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions has deteriorated in recent months. Here's a look at how they got to this point. (Taylor Turner/The Washington Post)
Robert Malley, the president of the International Crisis Group, said Trump's decision to order the drone strike was in part motivated by his desire to project a stance on Iran that was anti-Obama at all costs, while projecting that the U.S. is not fearful of any consequences.
But other Republicans on the Hill privately would be thankful for the president to take this whole issue off their laps because if he does declare a state of emergency, he would, presumably, have to open the government.

The warmth caused difficulties for reindeer herding in northern Sweden, the failure of the ice-wine harvest in Germany, and forced organizers to import snow for sporting events in Sweden and Russia. Parts of Russia near Moscow experienced a winter of 10 degrees Fahrenheit above normal.
For people that are used to the luxury that Cape Town promises, this has come across as a rather drastic measure, she says. People are reusing some of the water that they've used in other areas and finding other uses for it around the household.

Aquaman is the surprise hit of the winter, racking up more than $800 million worldwide so far. And while Jason Momoa's bro-tastic turn as Arthur Curry is earning deserved plaudits from male and female audiences alike, it's Patrick Wilson's King Orm who caught my eye.

Nationwide, preliminary data suggests that about one in three Asian-Americans supported President Trump — a slight uptick from his support in 2016. For many Democrats who still hope that greater Asian-American political involvement will benefit them, the election illustrated that the party must go after nonwhite voters with the same nuanced approach and level of urgency that has generally been reserved for white voters in swing states. There is a small but still significant bloc of voters that needs to be courted — and that courting needs to be maintained because we're going to have close elections, said Varun Nikore, the president of the AAPI Victory Fund, a super PAC focused on mobilizing Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders to vote for Democratic candidates. But he added: Things can go backward. You can't take the Asian vote for granted.

Biden has already nominated movement favorite Deb Haaland , a Democratic congresswoman from New Mexico, to lead the Interior Department and created a high-level White House climate shop, with former Environmental Protection Agency head Gina McCarthy and former Secretary of State John Kerry in top roles. Together, with willing partners in Biden's inner circle, Sunrise and allied organizations have helped craft the structures -- at least on paper -- that could position the administration to pursue audacious goals to meaningfully combat climate change in the coming years.

I know, Bolton is a bugbear for you. But in some ways, Bolton because he is so flamboyant, and so infamous and notorious. He actually was a bit of a problem for the Iran Hawk Crusade, more middleweight, more circumspect managers like Robert C.

On the Iranian backed-programme, Iglesias praised Chinese dictator Mao Zedong as astute, declining to mention the 60 million deaths that occurred under Mao's brutal reign.

At a news conference Wednesday afternoon, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio focused on the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, calling it a tragedy wrought by the actions of the fossil fuel companies. He detailed the 44 people who died in New York as a result of Sandy, as well as the estimated $19 billion in damage it caused. That is the face of climate change, de Blasio said. That is what it means in human and real terms.
BAIER: Senator, as a senator, you deal with a lot of different things.
While a tiny elite seems to have done very well, large swaths of the population have fallen out of the middle class and plunged into a new world of vulnerability and insecurity. Even leaders in countries with low but increasing inequality have felt their public's wrath.
There are also societal attitudes that actively discourage men from seeking help or appearing vulnerable. Sarosi links it to research that's found many men don't fight against climate change, or even adjust behaviour like eating plant-based diets, recycling, or using reusable bags, because they're worried that will come across as feminine.

The main culprit in the spread of these fictional worldviews has been social media.
REPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: It's a first step.
Since the Interior secretary cannot establish new historical and natural landmarks without the board's approval, none has been declared since Jan. 11, 2016, when then-Secretary Sally Jewell designated 24 such landmarks.
BRUSSELS (AP) – A key European Union (EU) legislative group has lambasted U.S. President Donald Trump's harmful approach to trans-Atlantic relations, warning that the divisions it creates will only embolden global rivals.
On top of that, the EU legislators complained that Trump and top administration officials lambast the EU as bureaucratic … and have praised populist and nationalist movements in the face of sitting EU governments. The legislators feel all of this crystallized in the diplomatic snub.
Our special series debuts next Monday, and it continues all week. Here's a short preview of what we found.
When a new Congress convenes every two years, the majority party must approve a resolution outlining House rules, the intricate parliamentary procedures that govern the chamber. Two notable changes in the Democrats' package are aimed at avoiding certain confrontations that became commonplace during the Republican majority from 2011 through 2019, after the rout of the party in the 2018 midterms.
I was behind him so obviously I was cool with seeing that. I feel like it's my turn now.
In other words, this time isn't different.
With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. TAUZIN: I thank the gentleman. The chair is pleased now to welcome the vice chairman of the Telecommunications, Trade and Consumer Protection Subcommittee, the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Oxley, for an opening statement. REP. MICHAEL G. OXLEY (R), OHIO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We are here for a hearing on the most serious of issues: highway safety. Every day, drivers rely on their vehicles and tires to carry them to destinations a mile or hundreds of miles away. They want to get where they're going and back safely. And the encouraging fact is that fatality rates have fallen in relation to vehicle miles traveled. Today we confront something out of the ordinary: a proportionally high number of accidents, some of them tragically fatal, principally involving Ford Explorers and Firestone tires. So the job of the two subcommittees here today to make sure that drivers and their families feel secure. My hope is that the Commerce Committee will be able to look at the Firestone recall situation in the detail it deserves. What caused these accidents? Was there a trend that could have been identified much earlier? What needs to be done in response? There will be questions about engineering, product quality and data review today. A full review of highway safety should eventually take driving behavior into account as well.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb will both be here.
The speech, which was followed moments later by a rebuttal from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, drew seemingly deep lines in the sand while also emphasizing the importance of compromise. Republicans and Democrats plan to meet Wednesday to continue negotiations to end the ongoing partial federal government shutdown over border wall funding, now in its third week. (Trump has said the shutdown could last for years if no deal is reached.)
Then there's the matter of Trump's decision-making — a style that seems free of any methodical or consistent process of weighing options in a deliberative manner and thinking through the implications and consequences before actions are undertaken. Instead, the decisions seem tied to Trump's likes, dislikes, moods, personal views and what he watches on cable news.
Like Del Duca, Coteau is a former cabinet minister. As minister of social services, he oversaw the Liberals' program for children with autism and helped implement the basic income pilot project that Ford's government quickly cancelled.
The UN committee has concerns about the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, as well.
TRUMP: We are here today to address the humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border. This is a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul.
The president, during his address Tuesday, vowed that the wall would very quickly pay for itself in part because the cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion dollars a year – vastly more than the $5.7 billion dollars we have requested from Congress. Trump added that the wall will also be paid for, indirectly, by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico and suggested that his offer to make the wall out of steel, instead of concrete, was a concession to Democrats.
That's why every Friday we will answer the alarm sounded by young people like Greta Thunberg and bring the climate emergency to the axis of power, the website states.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start on what we haven't mentioned thus far in the show, that the President has made a choice to run the intelligence community. He's going to renominate a congressman, John Ratcliffe. Is he actually going to go through and get nominated and-- and confirmed?
The mechanism behind why climate change is causing more extreme floods is very straightforward: a warmer ocean and atmosphere provides more energy to fuel more extreme weather systems.
To reduce its population, China instituting a draconian one-child policy, which has now left the country (through sex-selective abortions) with a horrific gender imbalance, with yearly births of some 120 boys born for every 100 girls. As a result, 30 million more men than women will reach adulthood and enter China's mating market by 2020.

When Wall Street was on the verge of collapse, the Federal Reserve acted with a fierce sense of urgency to save the financial system. We need the Fed to act with the same boldness to combat unemployment and low wages.
17) The decriminalization of marijuana and the production of higher quality plants in the U.S. versus Mexico had a series of unspoken consequences. After marijuana from Mexico was not able to compete with U.S.-grown plants, some cartels shifted their model more toward human smuggling–becoming a factor in the 2014 migrant crisis and the current one at the U.S. border.
Also spend more time searching through your cupboard this year. January is a great time to use up the contents of your fridge and cabinets before food spoils and you have to throw it out.
Pelosi can have difficulty masking her disdain. Often that is by implication — speaking effusively about George W. Bush's personal character or quoting from Ronald Reagan's 1989 farewell address, in which he said the nation should be open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here.
These two features are the special sauce that GCF can offer, says Brown.
St. Louis: A memorial to soldiers downtown has been damaged by vandalism, including a spray-painted message of No war. The vandalism was discovered Sunday morning. It wasn't immediately clear if it was in response to the airstrike that killed a top Iranian official, Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an attack that's drastically raised tensions between Tehran and Washington. About 150 people marched through downtown St. Louis on Saturday in opposition to further military action against Iran. The Missouri Historical Society's director of marketing and communications, Leigh Walters, said it is sad that anyone would deface a memorial to those who have made the supreme sacrifice for their country. The memorial opened in 1938 to honor World War I soldiers and reopened in 2018 after a two-year, $30 million renovation.
The World Health Organization (WHO) realized if people think Covid-19 is a hoax they will not only go outside and flout rules, said Anna-Sophie Harling, the Europe managing director of internet trust tool NewsGuard, which flags anti-vaccination misinformation for the UN agency, among other projects. But it's hard to convince people to take a vaccine for something they don't think exists or don't think is a problem, she told CNN.
After almost 11 years of equity market rally off the 2009 low, it is futile not to call this a 'great bull market.' It is, Emanuel wrote. And the public will 'fall in love' with stocks once more — potentially sending prices materially higher from these already 'commanding heights' — before the bull market ends.
Ocasio-Cortez went on to headline Sanders' comeback rally in Queens at the end of October ― the largest of any campaign during the entire primary, per campaign estimates ― and a host of packed rallies in Iowa the following month.

If Trump weren't such an admirer of Britain he would probably find it very funny. As it is, he more likely thinks it's very sad.
Cover all exposed skin when running in super cold temperatures, but choose smart fabrics that help prevent you from overheating as they wick moisture away from the skin. Brad Lupton, a USA Triathlon team member, suggested dressing as though it's 10 to 15 degrees warmer than it really is.

The reality, however, is that almost no state meets the minimum student-to-mental-health expert ratio recommended by the U.S. Department of Education. Instead, Black students with mental health disorders are suspended, expelled and otherwise punished at twice the rate of White students in schools. A study in the journal Emotion found that teachers incorrectly judge the emotions of Black students as angry more often than White students. The criminalization of mental illness in Black children combined with teacher biases push Black children who need help and mental health care into the criminal justice system through school referrals instead.

Democrats plan to tweak the rules so that a motion to vacate can only be offered on the House floor if a majority of either the House Republican Conference or the House Democratic Caucus agrees to do so. The change limits the ability of any one member to wreak havoc on the floor and ultimately bolsters incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., against potential agitators in either party.
In 1981, Simon published The Ultimate Resource, underscoring man's ability to adapt to new circumstances and overcome obstacles through ingenuity and creativity. It is the human mind, rather than coal, trees, or iron, that is the ultimate resource—one that suffers no risk of depletion.
The new president also sought to explain his decision in the past 100 days not to label China a currency manipulator by pointing to the tense situation on the Korean Peninsula and China's critical role in dealing with the North Korean regime. Trump called Chinese President Xi Jinping a good man, adding let's see what happens.

Late last year, Germany called on France to give up its seat to the EU so the bloc could speak with one voice — a request France rejected. Germany began her two-year stint in the Security Council as one of ten non-permanent members in January, with Mrs Merkel telling her country in her New Year's address that she would keep pushing for global solutions to the world's problems, including mass migration and climate change.

EDMUNDS: Most folks who visit the Virgin Islands and snorkel around the Virgin Islands will snorkel in water that is five, 10 to 20 feet deep. And those are the areas that are most prone to the damage. And sure enough, when we swam over those areas, we saw the damage, the toppling and the scarring. But once we got below about 20, 25 feet, it was a different story. And certainly, you can find broken corals and toppled sea fans and the damage. But I think what was remarkable was the amount of coral and soft coral that survived.
Sarmento's job is to try and reduce those conflicts and deal with the ones that occur. He speaks at town meetings and teaches bear safety at public schools, preaching tolerance and listening to complaints. He removes livestock carcasses from ranches.

In his view, the bill should include all the resources necessary so that both our public health response and our economic response can be seen through to the end, he said.
The problem with that argument is that if you go back and look at when Adam Smith was writing [in the latter half of the 18th century], nearly all economic activity globally was happening in small, local farms and workshops with the exception of a few large trading companies. When it happens at the local level, there is a lot of local accountability. So if you own a local small business and you hire workers, those are your neighbors you are hiring. If you fire workers, those are your neighbors you are firing. If you pollute a river, it's your stream; if you are donating money, it's your community that's benefiting.
Can they nominate -- will they perhaps nominate someone who's got Bloomberg's record? And we should point out, it's a mixed record because there's a lot of things he did in New York, crime did go down. He's given tremendous amounts of money on a lot of issues that Democrats like, climate change, a lot of women's groups. Can, in the Me Too era, the Democratic Party nominate somebody, though, with this downside?

Sioux Falls: A company has awarded holiday bonuses its 120 employees likely won't forget. Myrl & Roy's Paving gave its workers $10 million in bonuses ranging from $5,000 to $400,000 depending on length of employment and job duties. One of the owners, Sue Unzelman, says they wanted to thank the employees for their hard work and loyalty. It's something we really wanted to do, reward their loyalty, their stick-to-it-ness, she says. I can't tell you how happy I was to see the reactions, the tears in the room. Unzelman and her siblings are selling the second-generation company to L.G. Everist, a rock mining company with pits and quarries in the region. Myrl & Roy's Paving began over five decades ago after Myrl Unzelman and Roy Schultz left their jobs in a road construction business and bought a $500 dump truck, a rake and a shovel.

A few years ago I might have said, 'No, no [to Ramshaw], things are gradually changing and getting better, and we'll get there,'  Murdoch said. But the rejection of a female candidate in the 2016 election was a wake-up call: It was a turning point to realize that things don't just naturally get better over time, you have to actively participate and make them get better, and there's always a risk of backsliding.

Now, two more Democratic Socialists will join Sanders in Congress on Thursday -- Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. Ocasio-Cortez has embraced the mantle, while Tlaib is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). And while Ocasio-Cortez and Tlaib represent only a sliver of the Democratic Party's new majority in the House, they have attracted outsized media attention and are pushing policies with dozens of supporters.
Thanks for your comments on the current 'emergency,' but I think that your analysis is a bit off. While it may seem true that '[d]emocracies tend toward kingship in almost every case since charismatic leaders and demagogues are so successful at deceiving voters by appealing to emotion rather than reason,' in fact, as the end of the Roman Republic shows, such a tendency occurs when the legislative body (e.g., the Senate) abdicates its power—which it need not do. Today, we see our legislative branch interested in everything except legislating—which activity the executive and judicial branches are happy to take up. Puzzling and heartbreaking. – Jim Voelz, Fort Wayne, Ind.
The reality is that fraud is the business model on Wall Street. It is not the exception to the rule. It is the rule. And in a weak regulatory climate the likelihood is that Wall Street gets away with a lot more illegal behavior than we know of.
But advocates say the things Stringer could do unilaterally as mayor are some of the most promising pledges in his proposal. Ramping up enforcement of laws against lead paint in low-income housing, creating new regulations on indoor air pollution, and implementing a new fast-track process for green permitting all fall under the mayoral purview, and could dramatically improve life for New Yorkers suffering the worst exposure to toxic pollution.
Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), the largest socialist organization in the United States.

On its website, DSA blames, in part, the globalization of capital for racism, sexism, homophobia, and environmental degradation.

Detroit: A statue of the robot featured in the 1987, Detroit-set film RoboCop is nearing completion ahead of its debut at a science museum. Organizers of the Kickstarter campaign website who crowdfunded Robocop for the city posted some photos last week with an update of the statue with a note that its final form is coming later this winter at the Michigan Science Center, The Detroit News reports. Organizers wrote in the update that the statue is 11 feet tall with his head on and that his stainless steel base weighs half a ton. He is big, he is clean, he is bronze, he is perfect, they wrote. It has been almost a decade since the idea came about. A Twitter user, who tagged then-Mayor Dave Bing in a tweet, noted that Philadelphia has a statue of another movie icon, Rocky Balboa, and that RoboCop would be a GREAT ambassador for Detroit. The campaign that launched in 2012 raised $67,436 from more than 2,700 backers worldwide. Since then, Giorgio Gikas, one of Detroit's premier sculptor conservators, has been creating the work.

The intellectual life of the American right since Sen. Joe McCarthy's rise to prominence in 1950 can be seen partially as a series of flirtations with conspiracists and a dedicated reluctance to read fringe crackpots out of its ranks. Yes, William F.

But it's even worse than just being slandered with lame sex jokes. Millions of Americans united in a belief that government is out of control and needs to scale back the spending, the corruption, the special interests and who are publicly demonstrating their frustration at health care town halls, on tax day and on 9/12, they aren't being mocked anymore. They are being completely ignored. You don't even exist.
The move — to hold a rally in a battleground state and miss the annual dinner known for glitzy elbow-rubbing between Washington journalists and Hollywood celebrities — seemed designed to thumb the presidential nose at the Washington press corps, with whom Trump continues to have a tense relationship, while also highlighting Trump's accomplishments on his 100th day in the Oval Office.

On Monday, more than 50 environmental and faith-based groups sent a letter to Christopher Schroeder, the Biden transition team leader for the Department of Justice, urging the incoming administration against naming David Frederick as federal government's chief attorney responsible for arguing cases before the Supreme Court.
In 2016, the Supreme Court ruled against Exxon Mobil in a case that Frederick argued on behalf of the state of New Hampshire, forcing the oil giant to pay a $236 million fine for contaminating groundwater.

Jackson: An operation to kill the mountain goats that have invaded Grand Teton National Park and threaten the existence of the park's struggling bighorn sheep herd began Sunday, officials say. A large swath of the high Tetons, including the north and west slopes of the iconic Cathedral Group, will be closed to the public as aerial gunners contracted by the park spend up to a week locating and shooting at the approximately 100 goats, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. We're trying to be efficient and effective – so doing this as fast as possible in the most efficient way – and we believe that the aerial operations does that, park spokeswoman Denise Germann said. She had no prediction about how many animals would be targeted but said it's possible that at least one more week of aerial shooting will occur, depending on how this operation goes.

Lawmakers would be banned from serving as an officer or director at a public company.

No other members serve on the boards of public companies, Holman said, but about 190 House members hold other positions involving public or private firms.

As with issues like immigration and trade, on the Iran situation, President Trump has been forced to clean up the messes created by previous two administrations. Now post 9/11, George W. Bush thought that once we invaded Iraq, WMD or no WMD, once we kill Saddam Hussein and then disbanded the Iraqi military. Well, democratic institutions would eventually take flower. Well, that was a colossal and cruel joke.
More than from any policy though, Sanders has benefited from the warmth he exhibits in the small audiences where he has had to court his would-be endorsers, according to Salgado.
The plan comes as a divided nation is in the grip of the pandemic's most dangerous wave yet. So far, more than 385,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the U.S. And government numbers out Thursday reported a jump in weekly unemployment claims, to 965,000, a sign that rising infections are forcing businesses to cut back and lay off workers.

I think every mayor in the country would say it's their responsibility to do something, said James Brainard, the longtime mayor of Carmel, Indiana. Our mayors are not sitting back. The mayors are the closest elected officials to the people and the mayors can make this happen regardless of what the federal government does.

Another speaker was future solicitor general Ted Olson, who was then an assistant attorney general in the office of legal counsel. I didn't have any idea how far it would go or what it would become, Olson told me, but I did feel at the time … this is something interesting happening here. In his address to that first symposium, he said: I sense that we are at one of those points in history where the pendulum may be beginning to swing in another direction. Of course, we do not know now, and no one will really know until many years from now, whether the 1980 elections have wrought a significant and long-lasting change. But I think that there is an opportunity here; and the organization of this society and this symposium is a cause for optimism and a sign that perhaps something is happening.

Other news outfits explained Warnock's endorsement of Jeremiah Wright and other disturbing messages, which the Democrat senator-elect calls truth-telling. An admiring piece in the New York Times, for instance, notes that Loeffler's campaign used his sermons to try and paint him as a 'radical' — and their claims have often been labeled by fact checkers as misleading. That, even as the Times acknowledges that Warnock has written that white churches had been active and complicit participants in slavery, segregation and other manifestations of white supremacy.

The estimate, by the research firm Rhodium Group, pointed to a stark reversal.

In November, voters in New Jersey, Arizona, Montana and South Dakota legalized recreational marijuana in their states.

That includes the new race over research and the use of technologies such as artificial intelligence, which is predicted to add some $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030. China has poured vast resources into its tech sector and is arguably the global pacesetter in the development and implementation of AI technologies, an advantage that has huge political implications. Whoever leads in artificial intelligence in 2030 will rule the world till 2100, declared a recent policy briefing from the Brookings Institution.

What will the left do? There has been a clamor for Elizabeth Warren to run for president since the day she arrived in the Senate. Now that she's in, some of the first notes of skepticism came from people who had pined for her to do this four years ago.

But it wasn't just one flood. For days in November, Venetians woke to the sound of tones warning of more record breaking tides. Venice has always been vulnerable.

This is becoming the new normal. And water-logged Venetians wonder how much more this ancient city can take.

So that leaves open the question, if Trump is telling his supporters to vote, who is telling his supporters not to vote? Well, in addition to the actual Democrat candidates—as evidenced by the new Warnock ad—it's Democrats, as Breitbart News has previously reported earlier in the campaign, and it's also Never Trumpers at the Lincoln Project who are basically Democrats at this stage.

HuffPost Canada spoke to an oil worker who said the sticker was being handed out to workers at oil fields across central Alberta as promotional material to be worn on hard hats.
Bowen might also have been referring to California, where drought, heat, high winds and untamed brush caused the state's deadliest and most destructive fire on record, according to Aon. The Camp Fire destroyed nearly 19,000 homes and other structures in Paradise, California, killing 88 people and resulting in $15 billion in losses. That and other California conflagrations charred 1.8 million acres in the state, a record.
FOLDS: As an artist, what I do is I capture the thing that I see, the thing that interests me. My job is putting that idea in a bottle, which I've taken my whole life to do, and to share that with other people.
Today, Happer is back in the White House, still fighting against what he considers unfounded claims that our globe is in danger. But this time, his cause is backed by the man in the Oval Office.
He said the Georgia GOP is nervous about weaker turnout in certain strongholds, where figures show voting trails the rest of the state. One such area: Dalton, where Trump held the rally Monday night. In November, he beat Biden by 40% in that area.
But he was caught in a tight squeeze: Internal polling showed that a no'' vote could destroy his chances of winning the Democratic nomination. And some Democratic leaders, like Suleiman, made it clear that he would not tolerate Van Drew's no vote.
In his inaugural address, Bolsonaro made it clear that his views haven't changed. For instance, pledging his strong support for the police and the military, he recalled the words Ordem e Progresso, emblazoned on his country's flag: The national motto is order and progress.

I have decided to run and will be making a formal announcement within the next week, Gabbard told CNN's Van Jones during an interview to air Saturday. There are a lot of reasons for me to make this decision. There are a lot of challenges that are facing the American people that I'm concerned about and that I want to help solve.
Our best chance to accelerate out of the crises ripping through our country is with a narrow but unified Democratic Senate majority, able and willing to work together to meet America's urgent needs. That is what's on the ballot Tuesday in Georgia.

That reputation was cemented by Happer's confrontation with Gore's staff over risks posed by the ozone hole. The incident was widely covered in scientific publications — Physics Today ran an article headlined Happer Leaves DOE Under Ozone Cloud For Violating Political Correctness.
Most of the reporting increase occurred at the US Military Academy following a change in reporting policy and the relocation of its victim assistance office, according to the DOD.
Inslee is even less well known but does have an angle: If he runs it will be as the climate change candidate in the race. That would speak to a considerable portion of the Democratic electorate.
Analysts and consumer advocates worry that lawmakers may expand that protection for this year and beyond, putting taxpayers and ratepayers on the hook.

Finally, above all it suggests drift in U.S. policy and an administration that doesn't know its own mind or the region. Like some modern day Gulliver, Trump is wandering around in the Middle East tied up by small and larger powers whose interests are not his own, and by his own illusions sliding toward a confrontation with Iran. His is an administration inhabited by regime changers, sanctions imposers, chicken hawks and real ones who are looking for a fight with Iran.
A brutal winter storm dumped snow, sleet and freezing rain from normally balmy Florida up the Southeast seaboard Wednesday, delivering a white coating that some cities hadn't seen in decades. Cars spun out of control on icy overpasses from Texas to Georgia. Forecasters warned that conditions could worsen, especially in the Northeast.
The fires have been devastating for Australia's wildlife and wild places, as massive areas of native bushland, forests and parks have been scorched, Stuart Blanch, an environmental scientist with the World Wildlife Fund in Australia, told USA TODAY.

Noyer was once head of the Banque de France and vice president of the European Central Bank. Right after the U.K.'s 2016 Brexit vote to leave the European Union, the French government under then-President Francois Hollande put Noyer in charge of convincing multinationals that were planning to leave London to relocate their operations to Paris. The competition includes cities like Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg.
The coronavirus pandemic has revealed the lack of support we provide for our health care infrastructure — including health care workers — on a local, national, and global scale. Furthermore, the uprisings for racial justice after the killing of so many Americans such as Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd have revealed how systemic racism has only continued to grow in this country, not abate. The aftermath of the 2020 presidential election has revealed just how divided this nation truly is — with nearly half of the United States believing that facts and published reports are merely fake or just a hoax.
Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. It was a knockout win for former Vice President Joe Biden last night in the South Carolina primary. He got nearly half the vote coming in close to thirty points ahead over his closest competitor, Senator Bernie Sanders. CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto is here to tell us more. So, Anthony, how did Joe Biden do this?
We have to give people the right to vote for the leaders they want directly, Tedjo said. It's an antiquated system.
One example is how over the past 30 or 40 years, many bird species, especially songbirds, have expanded their ranges northward.
ExxonMobil welcomes any well-meaning and good faith attempt to address the risks of climate change, wrote Suzanne McCarron, Exxon's vice president of public and government affairs. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue and requires global participation and actions. Lawsuits of this kind — filed by trial attorneys against an industry that provides products we all rely upon to power the economy and enable our domestic life — simply do not do that.
The third reason for the brake on trade is the decline in the growth of global value chains, which is the idea that the process of production consists of many stages and occurs across borders. But this phenomenon, which developed at a very high rate after China's accession to the WTO in 2001 as the country emerged as a global supplier, has now reached cruising pace.
For all of us, a successful response to the pandemic and best opportunity for financial recovery are very much on the Georgia ballot Tuesday.
Biden, who has long been known for his gaffes and lapses on the campaign trail, told an audience on Wednesday that ongoing impeachment trial was proof that President Donald Trump and Republicans were worried about him becoming the Democrat nominee.
Royal Dutch Shell's giant petrochemical facility, which will crack natural gas molecules to produce a component for plastics, is also exposing a crack in Pennsylvania's Democratic Party. For some, like Peduto, the project is an environmental menace that undercuts the party's climate change agenda.
SIMON: A Bernie Sanders rally has kind of a loose, homemade feel to it. Often, they start with a local band to warm up the crowd, like last weekend on a freezing cold Saturday night inside a middle-school gym in Manchester.
I understand there are people in his Cabinet that are selling him that Iran is not Iraq? But the fact of the matter, Iran is quite similar to Iraq.

It's an exciting time, but it's also a time in which — at least members of the freshman class I've spoken to — are eager to get to work, said Rep. Joseph Neguse (D-Colo.), the son of refugees from Eritrea. No time better than the present to reopen the government and get back to the people's business.
The Democrat-controlled House plans to vote on a pair of bills to reopen the government, which includes a plan to fund the Department of Homeland Security at current levels through Feb. 8, with $1.3 billion allotted for border security. Other departments affected by the partial shutdown would be funded for the remainder of the fiscal year until the end of September.

Meanwhile, members of the Oiled Wildlife Care Network sprang into action, rescuing and caring for oiled animals. And those animals were more likely to survive than the ones oiled in 1969.
WaPo: President Trump on Friday threw cold water on the idea of immediately declaring a national emergency to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, reversing days of signals that he might soon declare the emergency amid a protracted standoff with Democrats over a partial shutdown of the federal government. 'What we're not looking to do right now is national emergency,' he said Friday afternoon, surrounded by law enforcement officials at a White House roundtable. 'I'm not going to do it so fast.' The president has defiantly said for days he might declare a national emergency to expedite construction of the wall — and his administration has asked agencies to begin preparations. But he has gotten sharp pushback, even from Republicans, at the notion of declaring such an emergency. His lawyers have privately warned that he could be on shaky footing with such a move, according to people familiar with the discussions.
During the 2019 election, Trudeau aligned himself with Thunberg on the campaign trail by positioning the environment as a key issue. When the Liberals released their climate plan, they were called out by the NDP for buying the Trans Mountain Pipeline.

Ahead of the Georgia Senate runoffs, Justice Democrats and Sunrise teamed up once again in December to argue that Biden and Democrats should turn the Jan. 5 Senate contests into a referendum on the inclusion of $1,200 checks in a COVID-19 relief bill. Around the same time, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) mounted a public push for a second round of $1,200 payments ― Americans received $1,200 checks from the CARES Act in March ― along with an additional $500 for every child. Their pressure campaign, backed by the Congressional Progressive Caucus, helped ensure the addition of a $600 stimulus in the bill that Congress passed shortly before Christmas.

A record 26 million Americans are expected to bet $6.8 billion on Super Bowl LIV, as more states legalize online gambling and the public becomes comfortable with it, according to newly released data from the American Gaming Association. Much of that will be spent on prop bets, which have become increasingly bizarre in recent years.
New Congress less Christian, but still more Christian than the nation - Pew: While the number of self-identified Christians in Congress has ticked down … the religious makeup of the new, 116th Congress is very different from that of the United States population. Within Protestantism, certain groups are particularly numerous in the new Congress, including Methodists, Anglicans/Episcopalians, Presbyterians and Lutherans. Additionally, Protestants in the 'unspecified/other' category make up just 5% of the U.S. public, but 15% of Congress. By contrast, some other Protestant groups are underrepresented, including Pentecostals (5% of the U.S. public vs. 0.4% of Congress). But by far the largest difference between the U.S. public and Congress is in the share who are unaffiliated with a religious group. In the general public, 23% say they are atheist, agnostic or 'nothing in particular.' In Congress, just one person – Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., who was recently elected to the Senate after three terms in the House – says she is religiously unaffiliated, making the share of 'nones' in Congress 0.2%.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: It's absolutely risky. it requires risk to try something new, but also we— we know so much of— of what we've tried in the past hasn't worked, either.
It's a vital conversation at this transformative moment in our political and social order, here and around the world. Depending on where you stand, we're experiencing either a long-needed course correction or a feeling that the world has lost its way. Whatever your view, the rate of change has been dizzying.
Single-family zoning was one of the many ways white homeowners and politicians kept African-Americans out of suburbs. … I don't feel so bad. Our attached townhouse, on a piece of land a small fraction of the size of a single-family home, is less of a burden on the environment, and it is just the right size for the four of us. It's also just as loving and pleasant a place for my kids to grow up in as my own suburban manse was for me.

It's certainly the case that every administration tries to control information, but I think that what we're seeing here is much more sweeping than has ever been done before, said Andrew Light, the distinguished senior fellow in the Global Climate Program at the nonpartisan World Resources Institute. And in particular, it's noteworthy that it seems to be aimed at a cluster of science-driven agencies that primarily work on the environment and climate change.
The debate seemed vicious, Arce said. I'm hoping Tom just stays on message, which he seems very consistent on that and so I think things will go his way.

The much further in question seems to be demanding things that would require a rewriting of the constitution, such as shifting resource projects to be under the control of the provinces and rewriting equalization payments. As well, the document calls for repealing policies such as the carbon tax and enforcing rule of law on energy project protests.
Charlotte Observer: The Republican in the nation's last undecided congressional race asked a North Carolina court Thursday to require that he be declared the winner because the now-defunct state elections board didn't act. A lawsuit by GOP candidate Mark Harris claims the disbanded elections board had been declared unconstitutional, so its investigation into alleged ballot fraud by an operative hired by the Republican's campaign was invalid. The elections board was dissolved Friday by state judges who in October declared its makeup unconstitutional but had allowed investigations to continue. A revamped board doesn't officially come into existence until Jan. 31. … The investigation is continuing, however, with Harris being interviewed Thursday as all other U.S. House winners were sworn into office in Washington. Democratic leaders in the U.S. House have said they won't allow Harris to take office because of the ongoing investigation. The U.S. Constitution makes the House the judge and final arbiter of its members' election contests.

If Kasich does challenge Trump for the nomination in 2020, it will be a total vanity project because his campaign is a non-starter.
We have to be able to recognize that there is a new industry that has been built out in southwestern Pennsylvania, and it is contingent upon clean air and clean water, Peduto said, citing Uber's and Microsoft's recent investments in the region. And that industry is much more important than the legacy and industry of fossil fuel.
You'd be hard-pressed today to find a CEO or a major investor who did not at least pay lip service to the idea of social responsibility beyond earning a profit, to the idea that corporations owe something to their workers and their customers and that they need to be good stewards of the environment.
Overall, as of 2005, nearly 860,000 refugees have been resettled across America—a large proportion going to areas that have lagged behind the rest of the country in economic growth since the Great Recession. The incoming refugees have stressed the already depleted resources of state and local governments. The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) estimates that it costs taxpayers more than $64,000 over five years to resettle one Syrian refugee. To resettle an entire family, the cost estimate rises to more than $257,000 over five years.
During the campaign, Biden repeatedly vowed to strategically support ongoing plaintiff-driven climate litigation against polluters as part of his pledge to wage a whole-of-government fight to curb planet-heating emissions.

Five years older, to be precise. The GCF was formally created at the 2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Cancun, Mexico. That said, setting up an international organization of the GCF's scope and size takes time. So it wasn't until 2013 that the GCF was in a position to hold its first round of fundraising.
Even before the locust outbreak, over 20 million people in East Africa faced high levels of food insecurity due in part to harsh climate conditions, such as drought and flooding.

On May 1, 2017, Atlanta became the 27th city in the United States to commit to transitioning to 100 percent clean energy, thanks to a resolution passed unanimously by the Atlanta City Council and approved by my predecessor, Mayor Kasim Reed. Atlanta is the biggest southern city to set such an ambitious goal, and we are proud of our bold leadership at the regional, state and global level in confronting the threat of climate change.
SENATOR DICK DURBIN: They did not cross the border. The solution to that is not a concrete wall it's a computer program that needs to track these people who have received the visas. And this wall, incidentally, when you have people coming to the border looking for a border official to present themselves and they make their claim for asylum or refugee status, this wall is no deterrent.
The name derives from the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, which in practice granted white women the right to vote, and whose 100th anniversary is this summer. Given that the goal of the site is to elevate the voices of women who are underrepresented in the American media, be it women of color, women living off the coasts, and poor women, Ramshaw said, they added an asterisk to their logo.

Is it Meghan's fault? It's hard to escape the conclusion that having grown up in a country that considers the Kennedys to be aristocracy, Meghan didn't understand that being a Windsor is not like being a celebrity, commented Virginia Blackburn in the tabloid Express.
She said that while Democrats support border security, they will not support building a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico -- which she called a campaign applause line. Mr. Trump is refusing to sign any government funding bill which does not include money for a wall.
The proposal already has garnered support from dozens of House Democrats, though it's unclear how far Democratic leadership in the chamber is willing to take the idea. But at least as a political talking point, it's beginning to take off in the field of hopefuls eyeing a challenge to President Trump.

This transition is really a passing of the torch, not just of one governor to another but from one generation to another, says former California Gov. Gray Davis. It's great that they have different styles. It's almost by necessity you have to govern for the times.
Pelton suggested that concerned residents can help with monarch monitoring efforts such as the Western Monarch Milkweed Mapper (monarchmilkweedmapper.org), and pressure their local representatives to take action to save the monarchs by committing to the National Wildlife Federation's Mayors' Monarch Pledge (visit www.nwf.org). The Xerces Society also offers ideas and information on how to help monarch butterflies at xerces.org.

Sanford wasn't an entertaining speaker. But the moral courage and decency of his inaugural address stands out 60 years later and was repeated throughout his four years as governor. Later in his term, Sanford would talk more forcefully, and in more depth, about civil rights.
Nancy Pelosi says, even if you open up the government, I wouldn't fund a wall. So, that's why I'm depressed. You know, there's not much talk about what she said. She's telling the president, even if you open up the government, I'm not going to do a deal on the wall. And that's a nonstarter for the president.

A survey of 300 likely Democratic primary voters in New York's 4th Congressional District described a Green New Deal as a plan to invest trillions of dollars into the development and distribution of green energy, creating millions of new high-wage jobs while preventing catastrophic climate change.

The term surged into mainstream political discourse just two months ago when activists staged a protest in now–House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office, demanding that the incoming Democratic majority in the House champion a sweeping climate policy to zero out greenhouse gas emissions and combat worsening income inequality.

SENATOR DICK DURBIN: Well, I can't say that we're close because President's made it clear he doesn't care. He's prepared to see a shutdown for months and he even said years, and reaffirmed that before the cameras. It was stunning to hear a President of the United States say that about his own government, the government we elected him to lead. But that is his position. Think about the hundreds of thousands of people who will be entitled to income tax refund checks who won't receive them because the Treasury Department has been shut down, the Internal Revenue Service is shut down, the unfortunate end and unfair results here are just across the board.
SENATOR DICK DURBIN: --those fences and barriers. Well, he's changed-- he's changed his demand from time to time and he's changed the amount of money he is asking for dramatically from two billion to five billion to eleven billion to twenty-five billion, even to seventy billion dollars. And when we ask for specifics, how are you going to spend this money, what are you going to do with it? He basically says, well, shut down the government until you agree on it. That is not an approach that comes up with the safe border which Democrats certainly want.

Food system failures tend to highlight the lack of control that everyday citizens around the world have over the products they consume ― beyond the fairly passive act of selecting one item at a shop over another. As food supply businesses grow in size and spread across national borders, consumers can begin to feel increasingly distant from the farmers and workers who actually grow and make the things they eat.
She will launch a media blitz Tuesday with appearances on ABC's Good Morning America and The View, followed by a late night interview later this week with CBS' Stephen Colbert and a series of talks about her book in Washington D.C., New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Her announcement about a presidential run is expected toward the end of this month.

Despite organizers insisting Saturday's rally would feature neither speakers nor a stage, the march kicked off with both.
Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), who oversaw the committee that questioned Droegemeier in the previous Congress, praised him on Thursday for his ability to communicate effectively with both ends of the political spectrum, adding: He'll need to continue doing that to be successful, and I'm confident he will.
Mandelblit is in a bind that recalls the lose-lose decision then-FBI Director James B. Comey faced over the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails before the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The number of illegal border crossings is down from 1.6 million in 2000 to less than 400,000 last year. But, the number of families coming over the border has risen sharply, putting a strain on health care and immigration services that came into sharp focus with the deaths of two migrant children in December.
You can think of attribution as a sort of CSI — Climate Scene Investigation — in which scientists attempt to separate what's natural from what's human-caused in these extreme events. So far the collaboration has investigated 230 extreme events around the world, including 2019's Tropical Storm Imelda in Texas which dumped 43 inches of rain.
Arpaia adds that the unnamed variety makes wonderful guacamole, and I found with a non-replicated test in my refrigerator the fruit doesn't brown.
Sanders: No, of course, I won't. Not on that one, I won't. For many, many years as a United States senator, Joe Biden has been on the floor and elsewhere, talking about the need to freeze or cut Social Security benefits. He voted for the Balanced Budget amendment.
We shouldn't hinder ourselves from the start, she added.
That's the way we do it in this country. We have these types of debates and
Hope Town is on one of several small islands ravaged by Dorian, which then moved across 7 miles of open water to Marsh Harbour, the largest town in the Abacos. At least 60 people died in Marsh Harbour, and destruction is still everywhere. Total damage and loss from Dorian is estimated at $3.4 billion.
While Biden was in overwhelmingly white New Hampshire on Saturday, billionaire Michael Bloomberg was courting black voters in Alabama, which is among the states that vote on Super Tuesday in early March. Bloomberg toured the late Martin Luther King Jr.'s church, spoke at a Democratic party luncheon and held a rally at Alabama State University, a historically black college and university.
So after my first international pageant, I didn't really want to join again. I felt like once was enough for my life. And the thing is, there is such high expectations on you, placed, being a Philippine representative. Because our girls do so well, and year after year, we do send such amazing women to represent the country. So I was afraid to put myself out there again. Because it is such a public arena. We are exposed to so many different people, negative and positive, through social media. It really did take overcoming some of my fears. But looking back now, I'm so glad that I decided to do it again, to pursue it again. Because if not, I wouldn't be Miss Universe today.
Kathleen Rice has fatally misjudged Democrats in her district, said Evan Roth Smith of Slingshot Strategies, which conducted the poll. Sixty-five percent of primary voters want to see unity among Democrats, and less than half say they're likely to vote for Rice again after her opposition to Pelosi. Rice may think she's taking a principled stand, but primary voters see it as craven political grandstanding and are punishing her accordingly.
elections that will determine whether Republicans maintain their majority.
Senator Bernie Sanders: Look, I am functioning as a jurist. I want to hear all sides. But I will tell you right now what has upset me the most and upset the American people is: How do you have a fair trial when you don't have witnesses when you can't get documents? What is the President, what are the Republicans hiding?
Most of all, have fun and remember ... all's well that ends well.

In December, he hosted a televised town hall talk on global warming and repeatedly tried to push the policy debate beyond whether or not climate science is real and toward a political revolution that takes on the fossil fuel billionaires, accelerates our transition to clean energy, and finally puts people before the profits of polluters.
GRAHAM: One last thing. We don't need -- we don't need one Democrat to replace a liberal justice. And the reason that's the case is because of what Harry Reid did. What he set in motion. Thank you.
MONIZ: Well, let me first preface my response by saying that a Green New Deal, which to me means both pursuing very low carbon and social equity, is exactly what we have to do. Now, when we come to the Green New Deal, I'm afraid I just cannot see how we could possibly go to zero carbon in the 10-year timeframe. It's just impractical. And if we start putting out impractical targets, we may lose a lot of key constituencies who we need to bring along to have a real low-carbon solution on the most rapid timeframe that we can achieve.
Democrats took exceedingly narrow control of the Senate on Wednesday after winning both runoff elections in Georgia, granting them control of Congress and the White House for the first time since 2011.
GONYEA: People will certainly be listening to what he and both candidates say about the coronavirus. But when you look at the debates so far, Biden has mostly gotten by with kind of disappearing in the crowd. That will not be an option tonight. And he'll need to answer Sanders' challenge on young voters and on progressive priorities.

This has been the hottest and driest year on record in Australia.
MIKE POMPEO: We want women to be involved. They-- there will be lots of people say things. There will be lots of noise. Everyone is competing for attention and time in the media. What matters is the actions that we take, the discussions that we had. We have come a long ways and we have worked not only yesterday. While I was in Doha, Secretary of Defense was in Kabul, along with NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg. They made a declaration. There was a commitment from the Afghan government, too. We've made a lot of progress. No one is under any illusion that this will be straightforward. We've built an important base where we can begin to bring American soldiers home, reduce the risk of the loss of life of any American in Afghanistan, and, hopefully, set the conditions so the Afghan people can build out a peaceful resolution to their, now what for them is a forty-year struggle.
The notice says the focus of Friday's protest will be major banks and investors that finance fossil fuel exploration.
The disasters also rocked global insurers. Munich Re and Hannover Re both issued profit warnings.
The town didn't think it was. Residents already were unnerved by strange stories posted on Facebook and shared via text messages about helicopters secretly flying in sick patients, that the virus was grown in a Chinese lab, that someone — either the media or the government — was lying to them about what was really going on.
I've got mayors who are struggling to fund essential services. I've got teachers who were contractually promised annual pay raises.
The good news, if you want to call it that, is that older restaurants (the ones whose owners complain about never getting media coverage) can reinvent and reinvigorate themselves, and no one will call them desperate. Diversification is now just baked into the business plan.
The concept of hibernation is normally attributed to warm-blooded mammals such as bears, bats, and other rodents--a time when their metabolism slows during winter months and they live off body fat as an energy source. The behavior is primarily an adaptation to reduced food supplies during cold and snowy periods.
Top Democrats announced late Sunday a series of changes to House rules that could eliminate causes of major instability during the previous eight years of Republican rule in Congress.
ALEX AZAR: That is absolutely not the case. So, first, we take the protection of our employees very seriously. Second, we want to make sure isolation and quarantine procedures are followed as appropriate. Third, we appreciate the whistleblower bringing forward any concerns. We are aggressively looking into any-- if-- to see whether there's validity to the concerns. But what the American people should need to know is that we now have passed well over fourteen days since any HHS employee had contact with the individuals involved. They are not-- nobody is symptomatic. Nobody has a disease. Even if these allegations prove to be true, there was no spreading of the disease from this.

Unfortunately, in our own times, millions of families can identify with this sad reality. Almost every day the television and papers carry news of refugees fleeing from hunger, war and other grave dangers, in search of security and a dignified life for themselves and for their families, Francis said.
And she really shouldn't be underestimated. She has youth on her side: imagine the damage she's capable of doing between now and the time she's Nancy Pelosi's age! And, as Laura Perrins notes here, she knows how to exploit her beautiful woman privilege to the max:
She's been accused of being dishonest about the true cost of her proposals and the tax burden they would impose on the middle class. She's also been criticized for making factual mistakes.
Although the actual stickers weren't distributed at their workplace, they said the graphic image was circulating among their colleagues on Wednesday. The worker said the company was asked if it would be interested in a similar sticker.
And, if that's not bad enough, here's another one.
New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and allied progressive groups are ramping up their push for a Green New Deal.
REPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: I think-- I think there is a hunger out there for people who are willing to speak honestly, who aren't, you know, just so poll tested and-- and holding back on what they're really thinking. I think there's also a hunger out there for people who are trying to solve problems instead of just carrying a partisan banner. I think the country needs to heal, the divisions are growing and I think that we need a uniter to be our nominee.
In 2007, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service declared success, removing endangered species protections for Yellowstone-area grizzlies. Lawsuits from wildlife groups and tribal governments quickly followed and two years later federal protections were put back in place, after a federal judge decided that the agency hadn't adequately considered the impacts of climate change on the bears' food sources.
Collins: I think Obamacare ruling will be overturned
Eliot A. Cohen, perhaps the most insightful and tenacious Trump critic on foreign policy, wrote recently for Foreign Affairs, The president has outlined a deeply misguided foreign policy vision that is distrustful of U.S. allies, scornful of international institutions, and indifferent, if not downright hostile, to the liberal international order that the United States has sustained for nearly eight decades. He explains, The real tragedy, however, is not that the president has brought this flawed vision to the fore; it is that his is merely one mangled interpretation of what is rapidly emerging as a new consensus on the left and the right: that the United States should accept a more modest role in world affairs.
In a planting project organized by Arizona's Game & Fish Department, volunteers stepped up to help the dwindling population of monarch butterflies, a species that migrates over 3,000 miles each year and relies on milkweed to lay their eggs.

Buttigieg was serious about trying — that much was clear. From the start, he pitched himself as a unique messenger for a new message: The rise of President Trump had exposed the old ways of operating as flawed and unsustainable. A young mayor from the Midwest might just be the person to handle what lies ahead — and in a field that included senators, former mayors and a former vice president, Buttigieg wanted a chance.
So we know what's at stake here in Georgia. If we lose this election, we
Açai has been touted as a superfood with miraculous health benefits, bursting onto the wellness scene like a ripe, popped berry. However, what most folks don't know is that most açai bowls have only small amounts of this valuable fruit.
The House late Thursday ultimately passed a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security until Feb.8, by a 239 to 192 vote. But the bill does not include any new wall money, and Senate Republicans and the White House have both described it as a non-starter that will never become law. Five Republicans voted for the bill.
Additionally, no family with children under 5 and income less than 1.5 times the state average would pay more than 7% of their earnings for child care. That amounts to $45 a week at most for the average household according to Biden's campaign site. Biden is proposing free preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds.
Companies have been falling over themselves to make impressive-sounding climate pledges. Last year saw some particularly bold targets, with Facebook, Apple, Walmart and even oil and gas giant BP promising to reach net zero emissions within a few decades.
No Wall After All? The Partial Government Shutdown Is Over, For Now
In the last two decades, 13 percent of the state has burned. In 2018 alone, more than 7,500 fires scorched a total 1.67 million acres, killing dozens of people and causing billions of dollars in damage. Records set in 2017 fell just one year later.
Let me help shatter that myth today.
As Paul Homewood notes, the story falls down for a number of reasons.
That would be compelling if not for two small details: Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Both entered their primaries as underdogs seen by the other party's front-runners as beatable. In Trump's case, Democrats were literally rooting for him to succeed; a memo published after the hack of Clinton campaign emails revealed that the Democratic front-runner wanted far-right candidates such as Trump to serve as Pied Pipers, serenading the rest of their party off a cliff.
Smith said that the 16 billion-dollar disasters that occurred in the United States in the first nine months of 2020 matched previous annual records set in 2011 and 2017.
Regulators and lawmakers may argue that a deal should be structured to solely benefit wildfire victims and that any deal should come with protections for ratepayers.
New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, recently sat down with Anderson Cooper for an interview airing Sunday on 60 Minutes. See the full interview at 7 p.m. ET/PT on CBS.
This is a crisis totally of Donald Trump's making, Biden said.
JOHNSON: You tailored the news stories came out after the missile attack against General Soleimani.
While the image leaves room for interpretation, the explicit character or sexual purpose of the image is questionable, from a legal standpoint. For example, it would be hard to prove to a judge that the image depicts someone under 18 years old.
The United Nations is predicting that 168 million people, a record, will need humanitarian assistance in 2020 because of extreme weather, large infectious-disease outbreaks and intensifying, protracted conflicts across more than 50 countries. That's around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019, and the number is expected to continue to rise, up to 200 million people by 2022. The U.N. expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to $29 billion.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: She absolutely is. And—
In a statement to CNN, Kenny said she is not a Covid-19 denier or anti-vaccination. In fact, for those wanting the vaccine then if that makes them feel secure, then that will be a good thing. I at this point just want to be allowed an informed choice and I would think in the US and the UK this would not be a contentious point. I will always stand for people to have autonomy over their bodies, she added.

Bolsonaro, who has previously said he is not Captain Chainsaw in reference to Amazon deforestation, has dismissed accusations of responsibility for the fires. On Wednesday, he speculated that the Amazon fires could have been caused by nonprofit organizations who are suffering from lack of funding, to generate negative attention against me and against the Brazilian government.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is drawing attention for suggesting that the wealthiest Americans ought to pay a marginal tax rate of as high as 70% in order to fund a Green New Deal.
It's easier to fake good works than good returns. To make companies more responsible and sustainable, we need two key things. First, investors need to lead the charge. They need to recognize that companies that invest in their workers, communities and the environment are better, stronger companies.
The White House is underscoring the national-security aspects of the debate by holding the meeting not in the Cabinet Room or the Roosevelt Room but in the basement Situation Room.
The plan would basically ease environmental rules for construction projects that do not have significant federal funding. It would set time limits on the length of federal reviews of these projects and would not allow regulators to assess a project's cumulative effects on climate change.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., think they have a start to a solution. Thursday they are introducing a framework defining what they call a Green New Deal — what they foresee as a massive policy package that would remake the U.S. economy and, they hope, eliminate all U.S. carbon emissions.
Generally, first-time offenders would get warnings, while repeat offenders risk fines.
In expert testimony for the plaintiffs from 2018 in Juliana v. United States — a lawsuit filed by a number of young people seeking to force the U.S. government to adopt policies to fight climate change and end fossil fuel subsidies — psychiatrist Lise van Susteren wrote that children will be at the center of the storm as climate change worsens and that they may already be feeling mental health impacts. Day in and day out worrying about the unprecedented scale of the risk posed by climate change ... takes a heavy toll on an individual's well-being, wearing them down, sending some to the 'breaking point,'  she wrote. Children are especially vulnerable. Those words, she told me, were really painful to write. Interviewing children about their fears for nature and their worries about their future families, she says, left her with a sense of shame.
REPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: I think if we're going to win as Democrats, we need to run the kind of races that form broad coalitions. The way we took back the majority of the House is through districts like mine. The eleventh district of New Jersey, where I ran on a-- with a broad coalition of people on issues that everyone in my district, from progressives to conservatives agree on. Things like infrastructure reform, things like bringing down health care costs, things like really, you know, focusing on our environment and how we move forward now, not in fifty years. Making sure we have universal background checks for gun purchases. These are things that the majority of Americans agree on and the Democrats are always at their strongest when they're focused on families and they're focused on issues that are going to move people forward.
Now, I think it's a futile attempt. I don't think it's going to pass, but I
Georgians turn out and vote on January 5th because none of this will matter
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, also a 2020 contender, used the word assassination to refer to Soleimani's killing in a statement. But another 2020 Democrat, former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, called that characterization outrageous.
To many activists, Black Friday is the epitome of this shift, a purely commercial event designed to boost U.S. retailers ahead of the Christmas holidays, the symbol of capitalism run amok.

In a speech last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the administration was pushing the World Bank and IMF to halt lending to nations that can already access global capital markets — countries like China.
Democrats appealed to the 32% of the electorate that is Black in Georgia, running on righting the purported racism that has in their view held back progress for that segment of the nation. Exit polls show 92% of Blacks voted for Warnock, pastor of the storied Atlanta church once co-pastored alongside his father by Martin Luther King, Jr.
The first cases of the coronavirus were detected in Wuhan in mid-December. Since then, the number of confirmed cases has increased exponentially, and infections have been reported worldwide.
Senate Republican operatives have pointed to Trump's refusal to accept the election results as a major reason for Warnock's and Ossoff's victories, saying it limited conservative faith in the election and deprived them of arguing Loeffler and Perdue's victories were necessary to prevent unified Democratic control of Washington.
Leaving Zweisimmen, the train rolls through varied landscapes, starting in the German-speaking region before entering French Switzerland. With the change in language comes a change in culture and architecture. French-style stone houses start to replace half-timbered, woodsy, German-style chalets.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Four freshman Democrats joined us earlier this week to talk about their new jobs in Congress. We spoke with Representative Jahana Hayes, a former National Teacher of the Year from my home state of Connecticut and that state's first African-American woman to serve in Congress. Congressman Max Rose, an Army captain from New York who earned a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart in Afghanistan, he then went on to work in the Brooklyn district attorney's office. Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill represents New Jersey. She flew helicopter missions in the Navy then went to law school and became a federal prosecutor. And Representative Colin Allred, who's from Texas. He's a former NFL player who later worked for President Obama's Department of Housing and Urban Development. We started the conversation talking about the vote they took to reopen the government.
People are more likely to listen to a message when it comes from someone they trust, Alexander Maki has argued in The Washington Post, and messages about climate change are no different. For example, he writes, experimental research discovered that when free-market enthusiasts who are concerned about government regulation hear from experts who emphasize how companies are developing climate responses, they are more likely to accept climate science.
He won his first bid for elective office just over two years ago; she won her 17th term in the U.S. House in November. She is a liberal Democrat; he is a populist Republican. She is crisp, precise and disciplined; he is none of those things.
Unrelenting cold since late December has caused energy demand to spike, pushing up prices and straining supplies. New England power companies are struggling to keep up with demand. New England's current energy woes are the result of years of state and federal policies aimed at closing coal and oil-fired power plants, largely as part of the region's effort to fight global warming.
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y., MINORITY LEADER: This is ridiculous and it's cruel and it needs to end now.
In California last year, Marin County, San Mateo County and the city of Imperial Beach similarly sued a group of fossil fuel companies over damage related to climate change — citing a theory called public nuisance, which basically argues that companies are causing an injury to the localities under common law. The cities of San Francisco and Oakland and the city and county of Santa Cruz have also filed suit.

GONYEA: It could be. There won't be many more opportunities like a debate. But Biden's lead and his momentum will be extremely tough for Sanders to overcome, even with a lot of primaries to go. Sanders himself is admitting that his broad movement of especially young voters has not been showing up at the polls quite as he expected. Last week, he gave a speech that really made it clear, A, he is not dropping out. But there was also a shift in tone. He's not pushing for Biden and the Democratic Party to address the issues he's been running on and those issues that are so important to young voters. And he says to the future of the party. On Wednesday, he even gave Biden a heads up of how that would go.

The budget also proposes eliminating the Appalachian Regional Commission, which promotes economic development in the region stretching from northern Mississippi to western New York. Many counties in that swath heavily supported Trump in November.
Known as direct air capture, such technology could eventually extract roughly half the atmospheric CO₂ that United Nations forecasts show needs to be removed to keep the planet's temperatures from surging to catastrophic levels. The machines essentially function like giant vacuum fans that pull carbon from the air and magnetically attach it to calcium or potassium molecules, transforming the emissions into a substance that can be injected underground for permanent storage, to prevent its return to the atmosphere.
Newsom, who won the governorship by a landslide, takes office amid a soaring state economy that has a projected $16 billion in reserves and an additional $14.8 billion unrestricted surplus. He campaigned heavily on issues relating to housing, health care and education that could raise state spending and, during his speech, Newsom promised fiscal responsibility to prepare for uncertain times ahead.

In the United States, the costs in lives and damage is fast rising, said Adam Smith, a climate scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
Using extrapolation, Dr, Robert Rohde, the author of the Berkeley Earth report, estimates that at the current rate we will surpass 1.5 °C of warming in just 15 years and exceed 2 °C of warming by 2065. But that pace can be slowed to some degree depending on how fast we reduce heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions.

He also has promised to quickly launch a national plan to distribute personal protective equipment to health care workers and first responders, and to ask for clear, national guidance from the CDC on containment, school openings, travel and gatherings. Biden has vowed to restore the type of daily, expert-led briefings that were typical for previous epidemics, such as H1N1 and Zika virus.
Their conversations emphasized the need to find ways to dial down tensions in the region.
Jefferson City: Republican Gov. Mike Parson's campaign said it raised about $540,000 in recent months, outpacing the $445,000 brought in by Democratic challenger Nicole Galloway. Those numbers are dwarfed by fundraising by independent political action committees, which rose in power after voters put limits on political donations directly to candidates in 2016. There are no limits on donations to PACs, which can work to bolster a candidate but cannot coordinate with the official campaign. A PAC backing Parson raised close to $1 million in the latest reporting period, which covers October through December. Uniting Missouri PAC Chairman John Hancock said the committee has more than $5 million on hand to spend helping Parson in the gubernatorial race. A pro-Galloway PAC has not yet reported recent fundraising. The general election is Nov. 3.

In her fieldwork across India over the last few years, activist Latha Sankarnarayan says she's often seen scarcity or quality [of water] as a core issue.
In 2015, she crusaded against plans to build a liquefied natural gas terminal off the coast of Jones Beach. In 2017, she co-sponsored legislation to mandate 100 percent renewable energy by 2035. Rice proposed legislation last year to prohibit members of Congress from serving on public companies' boards, and fought for more aid to victims still struggling to recover from 2012′s Hurricane Sandy.

However, Newsom has been harshly critical of Mr. Trump since taking office this week. He signed two executive orders related to wildfire management, and joined a partnership with the governors of Oregon and Washington asking for double the current federal funding to manage forestlands in their states.
We can begin with supporting our care workforce ― if we invest in making home care and child care jobs good jobs ― raising wages, offering benefits and real opportunity, we not only improve life for the care workforce, we help enable the rest of America to get back to work, knowing that our loved ones are safe and in good hands. The president-elect has already named this as a priority for economic recovery, as part of his 21st Century Caregiving Plan. Now we must make it a reality.
A few weeks ago, she starts hearing that this bushfire is approaching her house. It's getting closer and closer. But it's not so close that the authorities are telling her to evacuate.
I'm sure you've run across your fair share of ads that sing the praises of one wireless provider's 5G network over the others. As an investor, you should worry more about who's upgrading all these networks rather than which provider is truly faster.
By no means am I complaining – I've dreamt of hosting my own radio show since I was 5 years old. Although I will admit I never once pictured doing so out of a spare bedroom in my house because of a government lockdown.
The 78-year-old Sanders suggests that Greta make a statement in his support and that they do an event together when she next comes to the U.S. I would be really appreciative, he says.
One of the few things Ocasio-Cortez has in common with the president is an active and often combative presence on social media. When a conservative writer tweeted this photo of her, saying, That jacket and coat don't look like a girl who struggles, she called him out for what she said was misogyny.
U.S. District Court Judge Josephine L. Staton wrote a scathing dissent, rebuking the notion that the courts can play no role.
GRAHAM: This is wrong, it's a responsible and will do damage to our efforts to fix a broken immigration system. This is a tremendous presidential overreach.

California water managers said Thursday the Sierra snowpack is only 67 percent of normal in this winter's first manual measurement.

As former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has said and I quote: Giant Wall Street banks continue to threaten the wellbeing of millions of Americans, but what to do? Bernie Sanders says break them up and resurrect the Glass-Steagall Act that once separated investment from commercial banking. Hillary Clinton says charge them a bit more and oversee them more carefully … Hillary Clinton's proposals would only invite more dilution and finagle. The only way to contain the Street's excesses is with reforms so big, bold, and public they can't be watered down – busting up the biggest banks and resurrecting Glass-Steagall.
The drive to explora Valle Sagrado takes about 90 minutes. Surrounded by mountains, cornfields and Inca ruins, the property pays tribute to its surroundings, by blending in, instead of trying to stand out.

The idea is to keep carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, Bliss said.
WALLACE: So, Juan, why doesn't Speaker Pelosi, why don't the Democrats, make a deal?
During the Clinton years, the crackpot theorizing became harder and harder to distinguish from the Republican Party itself. Conservative billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife sent investigators to Arkansas to dig up dirt on the president's past, and when they failed, they settled for salacious fabrications that Bill Clinton was part of a drug-smuggling ring. Scaife became what The Washington Post called a guiding force behind Gingrich's Contract With America and a later generation of tea party activists. The Rev. Jerry Falwell, a leader of the religious right (his son is a big Trump supporter), started selling a $43 videotape that, among other charges, said Clinton was responsible for the deaths of countless people.
HUCKABEE: It's just the absurdity of what we are dealing with. Some people eat their soup louder than others. It doesn't mean their soup tastes better. Some people are very expressive in their faith, others are very reserved. But the point is, if Donald Trump is a part of anything that is spiritual or the evangelicals are around him, it's cult-like. But if it happens with Biden, it's just a wonderful expression of an affirmation of a faith that he doesn't practice very well because he is supposedly to be a Catholic, but he's yet pro-abortion. That's a hard one to reconcile.
The plane had originally been destined for California's Ontario International Airport, but officials said late Tuesday that it would instead land at a military base near Riverside. No reason was immediately given for the change in itinerary.
That's a perfectly legitimate conversation to have, Ashe says. But having that discussion around the delisting process feeds this dialogue that the Endangered Species Act is broken, and that once a species goes on the list it is difficult to impossible to get it off. And, in the long run, that doesn't help the bear, or the prospect of conservation of threatened and endangered species.
Wichita: An animal rescue group said an emaciated dog is recovering after he was found in a locked kennel that was thrown in a dumpster. The Wichita Animal Action League said in a Facebook post that the pit bull was found Wednesday at an apartment complex and taken to a veterinarian, where he is eating food as fast as it's put in front of him. He is around 2 years old and weighs just over 20 pounds, less than half the amount a dog of his size should weigh.The post described the dog as very sweet and loving. The group is asking for donations for his medical care. The post said the dog is dehydrated and will need slow, small meals over a long period of time because feeding him too quickly could be dangerous. It will likely be months before he is eligible for adoption. Wichita Officer Charley Davidson said an investigation is underway.
Checks and Balances, as Conway explains it to me, is not an attack on the Federalist Society but a reminder of the core principles the society has stood for ever since that band of students gathered at Yale. And now, here in a corner of the vast, tingling network, another connection is being made.
Frederick's arguments put him at odds with some of the top officials in the incoming Biden administration. Among those who signed legal briefs in favor of allowing Oakland's case against five oil giants, including Shell, to move forward in the California courts were Vice President-elect Kamala Harris; Biden's secretary of state pick, Antony Blinken; his future climate diplomat, John Kerry; his choice for climate czar, Gina McCarthy; and Xavier Becerra, the likely next secretary of health and human services.
LNG has been transported by sea for about 60 years, with few safety issues, but under certain conditions a cloud of escaped gas could ignite, with potentially devastating consequences. A failure of the thermal systems that keep stored LNG at minus-260 degrees Fahrenheit could also lead to what is called a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion, or BLEVE.
I emphasize that violence has and most likely will occur, she wrote. The prevailing climate is such that a state of riot could occur at any second, without warning.
Scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international NGOs that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict-affected areas such as Syria and Yemen.
It's unusual for a senator to be seated for nine hours
I'm learning. I think that really what I hope we're able to do as a party and as a nation is rediscover the power of public imagination. I think that this is a very special moment and frankly that is something that that I think the President did do. In that he was able to take his profile and say here's this hugely impossible thing that seems ridiculous but I'm going to seriously push for it. And for him that's his wall. And obviously I'm diametrically opposed to it but I think that the reason he's so attached to this thing despite the fact that it's not what voters want, despite the fact that it's not what the American people want, is that it's the only vision he has. He has no other picture of America except an America with a huge wall on the southern border. And I think that what we have a responsibility to do is show what is another America looks like.
Right. But even now, they're not completely in the clear.

So you have this initial big outlay to build these panels, Whitaker said to Heastie. But over time, the cost of generating power actually goes down?
Because researchers are particularly reluctant to release individual medical records used in human studies, Rosenberg said, the rule disproportionately affects epidemiological studies, which is ironic in the midst of a pandemic. Because these data can't be made public, EPA will ignore epidemiological evidence of population-level effects of contaminants, pollution and other environmental threats.
MILLS: Right. So I think the President of the United States' convictions on this matter are sincere, but I think it's relevant, particularly extremely relevant matters of war and peace and life and death, who he staffs his administration with.

Specifically, its mandate is to help developing countries reduce their emissions — so as to prevent further climate change — and adapt to the effects of climate change already occurring as a result of worldwide emissions. This includes supporting projects to build sea walls on the island nation of Tuvalu, create an early warning network to alert farmers in Malawi to floods and other disasters, launch energy companies that will provide rural people in East Africa with solar power, and encourage investment in renewal energy companies in Argentina.

Shasta Dam was built under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt during World War Two, reaching 602 feet, though it was designed to be even bigger. (An even bigger dam was envisioned for the Klamath River, but was canceled in the 1970s; today dams along the Klamath are set to be torn down.)

Teck Resources Ltd. says it's withdrawing its application for a massive oilsands mining project just days ahead of an expected government decision, citing the political discourse over climate change.
Fairfield: The state and AT&T have signed a deal designed to improve cellular service on the Metro-North commuter rail line. The agreement, announced Friday, gives the telecommunications company access to the right-of-way along the rail line, where the company plans to install a series of small cell nodes. Gov. Ned Lamont says that will provide better cellular coverage and higher data speeds for train passengers. The Democratic governor also announced that 132 recently purchased rail cars will be designed in partnership with industry experts and equipped with rooftop antennas that amplify 4G and 5G signals in the train.

Strikingly, the sharp uptick in emissions occurred even as a near-record number of coal plants around the United States retired last year, illustrating how difficult it could be for the country to make further progress on climate change in the years to come, particularly as the Trump administration pushes to roll back federal regulations that limit greenhouse gas emissions.
Andrew Rosenberg, who directs the Union of Concerned Scientists' Center for Science and Democracy and regularly reviews scientific studies before they are published in academic journals, said that the agency's emphasis on the need for raw data is misplaced.

If you're trying to convince someone who leans left, you can stick with the polar bear and keep tugging at their heart strings with talk of how unfair it will be to our children if the world is poisoned, but if you're with a conservative, it's wise to change up your approach — science has found that personalized climate-related messages work better.
Part of this energy abundance is the simple working of the law of supply and demand. As every free-marketeer knows, if there's a market for something, some entrepreneur will find a way produce more of it. And if that requires exploration everywhere, well, that's exactly what's happened; around the world, proven oil reserves have nearly tripled since 1981.
Iran is not Iraq, it's twice as big. It'd be twice as bad. We're weaker than we were 16 years ago. If President George W. Bush struggled to win reelection in 2004, if Trump does, he is cooked.
But once you get to the tippie tops, on your ten millionth, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 percent or 70 percent. That doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate. But it means that as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more.

The city of Paris does not exactly have a business-friendly reputation. Strikes, red tape and a rigid labor market have seen to that. But things are changing. France now has a young, pro-business president. And across the city there's a growing climate of capitalist optimism.
The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report published in October estimated that the world has at most 12 years to make the drastic changes needed to stop temperatures from rising beyond the Paris agreement's 1.5 degrees Celsius target. That report was followed in November by the Fourth National Climate Assessment conducted by the U.S. government, which warned that average global temperatures could rise as much as 5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Such a rise would make parts of earth uninhabitable and would make the entire world uninsurable, creating billions of dollars in economic losses.
Most Democrats today believe that we as Americans are safer with that murderous thug alive and boldly spreading his influence in the country where we lost thousands of our servicemen? Really? These are the same people by the way who called themselves anti-war when Obama was president. But they never gave Trump credit for his policy of military restraint.
GRAHAM: Well, I think it just plays out. What bothers me so much is that your next guests, Chris Coons, a great guy. We could sit down to make a deal with him wall, plus DACA, wall plus TPS. Every Democrat that I've worked with for about ten years now has agreed to funding for barriers/walls on Obama's watch, on Bush's watch, and all of a sudden, it's a bad thing on Trump's watch.
The New Deal infrastructure programs of the 1930s are famous for putting unemployed Americans back to work, but that isn't all they achieved. Back then, economic opportunity was constrained by lack of access to good roads and electricity across much of the country. The iconic infrastructure of the New Deal – from the Merritt Parkway in Connecticut to the power systems of the Tennessee Valley Authority – addressed those needs, helping to position the nation for 20th century success.
In the Democratic primary, Castro will likely face off against Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who recently announced that she had launched her own exploratory committee. The primary is expected to be packed with contenders, including several other senators and former Vice President Joe Biden.

And from then on, we've been one of those marriages in which you're pretty faithful to each other.

Climate change advocates have recently insisted, however, that record cold temperatures in North America cannot be used as an argument against anthropogenic climate change, since no direct causality can be established between singular weather phenomena and climate change.
Carbon: From Pollutant to Product | Moving Upstream
Experts agree that a changing climate has made wildfires more frequent and more damaging. Longer, drier summers have extended the typical wildfire season and made trees more susceptible to burning, according to a recent U.S. government report on climate change. But wildfires aren't just a seasonal event anymore. Now they're a year-round threat -- and not just in the West. The Southeastern U.S., which has historically not seen wildfires, is increasingly at risk, as the 2016 fires in Tennessee demonstrate.
The truth is, that the great principles of the Constitution proposed by the convention may be considered less as absolutely new, than as the expansion of principles which are found in the articles of Confederation. – James Madison, Federalist No. 40
That's what he stated in the White House on March 23rd.

The need to present as a strong Black woman initially kept Henson from facing her own traumas. Then, instead of simply continuing to just cope, she found strength in saying, I'm not okay. Now, she's a believer in the power of therapy to start the cycle of healing for the sake of Black children.
Environmentalists make a useful villain because their malevolence can be obscured by a patina of reasonableness. Global warming and other manmade problems are going to end the world if we don't do something — so just about anything is justified! But their villainy resonates with the masses because they actually do want to make life worse for people, for the most part.
It does mean that, at a time when the national debt is approaching $22 trillion, Democrats should steer clear of unaffordable government solutions to problems such as education and health care.

Right now, the Chinese communist government is blowing up the churches of evangelical Protestants, and now, what are we doing? asked Zmirak. We're siding with the government that's blowing up these people's churches and putting them in prison. I guarantee you, if this continues, in thirty or forty years, when Christianity is continuing to spread through China, Pope Francis is guaranteeing that it will be Protestant rather than Catholic. So, my Protestant friends, you should thank Pope Francis for guaranteeing that, eventually, China will be largest Protestant country on earth, not Catholic.

Nearly one in five financial service professionals believe they must engage in illegal or unethical activity to be successful.
The board is required to meet twice a year but has not convened since Trump took office last January, Knowles said Tuesday. Members, most of whom have worked together for seven years, were surprised to not be consulted on Interior's recent decisions to increase visitor fees and reverse a ban on plastic water bottles in the park system. The decision to reverse climate change directives and other policies drove the decision to resign, he said.
Outside the European Union, Ukraine (73%) rates the United States highly, although views about Trump are less favorable (46%). Pew notes the survey in Ukraine was conducted before revelations last year about Trump's phone call with the country's new president in July. In Russia, 29% of those polled view America positively.
Pretrial detention and cash bail have now been eliminated for almost all misdemeanor and nonviolent felony cases, even some violent felonies are included. What does it mean? It means the crimes like burglary, stalking, petty assault, many drug offenses, even some types of arson and robbery are no longer bail crimes.
The president has since backed off that statement, saying Tuesday, I like to obey the law.
We haven't quite dealt with all of the repercussions of tech's domination of the past decade — there will be regulations, a lot of tech is still addictive, and digital hate will continue to travel halfway around the world before the truth gets out of bed — but there are some big, positive ideas that I think you will hear a lot more about in the coming years. While I have been a strong critic of tech, and it is easy to chew over what's gone wrong — it makes for a large meal — I think it is more helpful, as 2020 dawns, to put forth five predictions that I hope will allow us to live more peacefully with the tech that we love and hate.
Yeah, I want a refund,'' Pirone said of the event, which netted a modest haul of $2,500 to $3,000 in small donations.
In the southern U.S., a wind chill advisory was in effect Wednesday from Orlando down to Boca Raton as a bomb cyclone storm was expected to swirl up the East Coast, said CBS News weather producer David Parkinson. He said when a storm system loses 24 millibars of pressure, which is to say it gets that much stronger, in under 24 hours, you have what's called a 'weather bomb,' and so that's where you get the term 'bombogenesis' – that's where we talk about storms 'bombing out.'
It was also yet another demonstration of how China pays little or no diplomatic cost for abuses that violate European values. The Europeans finalized the investment agreement, for example, a day after the European Union publicly criticized the harsh prison sentence handed down to a Chinese lawyer who reported on the initial coronavirus outbreak in the city of Wuhan. China had to make only modest concessions to overcome increasingly vocal concerns about China's harshest policies, including the crackdown on Hong Kong and the mass detentions and forced labor of Uighurs in Xinjiang, the western Chinese region. China's vast economic and diplomatic influence, especially at this time of global crisis, means that countries feel they have little choice but to engage with it, regardless of their unease over the character of Mr. Xi's hard-line rule. The investment agreement must be ratified by the European Parliament before it can take effect, and it faces signification opposition that could derail it. Claire Fu contributed research.

[Ed. note: I tend to disagree, Mr. Greek. I think there are lots of Republicans in Congress who would come hard against the president for such a broad overreach of executive power. And I think that goes for Democrats in the future. Whatever one thinks of our current political moment, there is no doubt that we are awake and alive to the possibility of darker, weirder things that could lay ahead.]
Alabama Gov. George Wallace, in his first inauguration address in 1963, with his head cocked to the side on that cold January day outside the state capitol in Montgomery, said passionately: In the name of the greatest people that have ever trod this earth, I draw a line in the dust and toss the gauntlet before the feet of tyranny, and I say, segregation now, segregation tomorrow, and segregation forever!
The irony, though, is that Julian Castro actually can't speak Spanish. He is just totally fraudulent. Now, there's nothing wrong with not being able to speak Spanish. Actually, that's not a crime.
The president certainly didn't invent racism. But he's certainly given a voice to it and expanded it and created a platform for those things.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, what is the impact of the shutdown? I mean there is some calculation here that this could go on for weeks, if not months, because it's not really being felt. Are you seeing that in your district?
Again, this is Ehrlichian in its madness: The author of The Population Bomb argued for years that the planet is overpopulated and that famines will wipe out a significant portion of humanity. It could still happen, I suppose — global warming could inspire an Interstellar-style blight; the skies could go dry — but, frustratingly for the doomsayers, life on Earth keeps getting better despite the overpopulation our precious blue orb continues to shoulder.
The pope's message for 2020 declared that the tragedy of internally displaced people is one of the challenges of our contemporary world, especially because of situations of conflict and humanitarian emergencies, aggravated by climate change.

Other campaigns including Sanders' and Steyers' have slammed the decision to remove a donor qualification, calling it wrong.
Even with those relatively permissive standards, 35 people is a huge field. It is a result of not only a pretty considerable amount of talent on the Democratic bench but also the fact that the Democrats believe President Trump is eminently beatable in 2020.

There were the agonizing video clips from April's Facebook hearing, in which 68-year-old Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) attempted to ask Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg a question about data privacy, and revealed a conception of social media resembling a wad of tangled Christmas lights: Do you track devices that an individual who uses Facebook has that is connected to the device that they use for their Facebook connection, but not necessarily connected to Facebook?
Local officials released numerous warnings in the early days of January as heavy rainfall was forecast, but they chose not to send out emergency alerts to cellphones until after the flooding had begun. They worried that the disaster-fatigued residents might not take an alert seriously, and didn't want to be seen as crying wolf.

In the short term, the sweep means another round of economic stimulus to offset the effects of the coronavirus is likely to come sooner and be bigger than otherwise. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said they would expect about $600 billion more in stimulus under a Democratic Congress, for example.
It's long been clear Republicans would need to replicate their Election Day turnout margins from the general election in order to win the runoff, but Democrats' surprising strength has made it a more difficult mountain to climb.

But critics say the new rule could force disclosure of the identities and details of individuals in public-health studies, jeopardizing medical confidentiality and future studies. Academics, scientists, universities, public health and medical officials, environmental groups and others have spoken out at public hearings and written to oppose the change.
You go to a payday lender who could charge an interest rate of over 300 percent and trap you into a vicious cycle of debt. That is unacceptable.
But critics say these dams would achieve little for storage, while hurting fish populations and destroying Native American heritage sites. They call such projects vampire dams — because they so often rise from the dead after being rejected by state leaders, one wrote recently.
The most recent salvo between BlackRock and its environmental critics started in January when co-founder Larry Fink published a letter to CEOs calling climate change a bigger structural, long-term crisis than any he has seen in his 40-year financial career. He said BlackRock would immediately begin pushing sustainability as a core goal at all of the companies it invests in.
The effects of what WHO called vaccine hesitancy are already significant. For example, cases of measles have surged 30 percent worldwide in recent years, despite an effective vaccine that can prevent it. WHO noted that some countries that were close to eliminating the disease have seen a resurgence.
Most will survive. Some will crumble. The way sports operate won't fundamentally change; executives will view this as a once-a-century predicament.

Certainly there are advantages to holding the Senate majority —Democrats would chair Senate committees, set the agenda, and a Democratic Majority Leader could help confirm Biden administration nominees, wrote Brian Gardner, chief Washington policy strategist for Stifel Nicolaus & Co., in a note.
We shouldn't be impeaching for a political reason, and we shouldn't avoid impeachment for a political reason, she said.
On Monday, Newsom took the oath of office and then delivered a fiery speech promising to offer an alternative to the corruption and incompetence in the White House. It was a gratuitous swipe at Trump that made headlines and seemed to backtrack on the progress the two made during Trump's visit to wildfire-stricken regions in November.
In fact, Vice assures and reassures us that Cheney believes in nothing (literally nothing) other than the UET, but McKay cannot explain why. For example, after an hour or so of presenting Cheney as power hungry, when the opportunity finally arises to run for president, Mr. Power Hungry chickens out based on one bad poll. And his wife Lynne (Amy Adams), who is supposed to be the true power behind the snarl, agrees, and they happily retire from politics.

BENSON: No, he'll tweet. There's a chance that he'll tweet a little bit less.

Trump says he won't accept a budget deal that doesn't include funding for the wall.
In 2016, a coalition of attorneys general — called AGs United for Clean Power and led by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman — formed to combat the climate crisis. Its formation came after bombshell reports by InsideClimate News and The Los Angeles Times detailing how ExxonMobil executives were aware of the climate risks associated with carbon dioxide emissions but funded research to cover up those risks and block solutions.

The Trump administration's rollback of environmental laws and decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accords play a role in the increase. But the main culprit is last year's spike in economic growth. Between 2007 and 2015, U.S. emissions came down 12 percent as utilities brought on clean-energy technology and the Great Recession dampened demand for power. In 2016 and 2017, emissions still decreased, but more slowly. Last year, as the economy expanded at the fastest pace in 15 years, boosted by tax cuts and other measures, emissions also grew at a record-setting pace.
Though they don't commit organizations to any specific action, the resolutions send a signal that there are support networks for students struggling with climate change. They also bolster the idea that students can at least make a difference by raising awareness: Jordyn Bauer, a 20-year-old sophomore at California's Sonoma State University who worked to pass a resolution in her California school district in 2018, said it helped validate her ability to do something. Too many people are just standing by, she says. I felt like it was my responsibility to take charge.

But what Biden can accomplish depends a great deal on what happens in Georgia's two Senate races. Were he in the minority, McConnell's obstructionist politics would take a back seat to urgent action on potential solutions to our national challenges. With a single vote margin, the Senate would be anything but a rubber stamp for Biden. Any single senator could derail any piece of legislation, and the many Senate rules provide a safeguard, for better and for worse, against a highly activist agenda.

These CBS News surveys were conducted by YouGov between February 27-29, 2020. A representative sample of 2,200 registered voters in California was selected, including 1,411 self-identified Democrats, as well as independents who plan to vote in the Democratic primary this year. A representative sample of 1,600 registered voters in Texas was selected, including 635 self-identified Democrats, as well as independents who plan to vote in the Democratic primary this year. Both samples were weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based upon voter registration lists and the U.S. Census Current Population Survey, as well as 2016 presidential vote. Likely voters were determined using a model that takes into account self-reported likelihood of voting, along with other individual- and aggregate-level factors. The margins of error are 4.0 points in California and 6.2 points in Texas.

Portland: The state with the largest fishing industry for lobster likely experienced a drop in catch last year, but the dip in harvest was probably not as dramatic as initially feared. Patrick Keliher, commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources, told Maine Public that initial reports showed a harvest of about 100 million pounds of lobster. That would be a drop of nearly 20 million pounds from last year, but still a much higher number than the industry was used to in the 1990s and 2000. The season initially looked like it could produce a substantial drop in catch, but Maine's lobstermen finished strong, Keliher said. The price for Maine lobster was also strong, he said. It's possible for the state's lobster catch to be slowed by lobsters shedding their shells late in the year. The biggest surge in catch happens after many lobsters lose their old shells and reach legal harvesting size.

[Ed. note: It is said that pain is the touchstone of all spiritual growth, and I think that applies to political reform as well. Perhaps we have not yet hurt badly, deeply or long enough to be ready to embrace substantive changes to our system.

There is a time coming, I believe, when people across the political spectrum will embrace the concept of systemic reform rather than narrow ideological combat.]

Of course, before you can bring up solutions, you have to be able to bring up climate change at all. Schools, however, have sometimes been slow to bring climate change into the classroom, especially in conservative areas. Lawmakers in states such as Florida and Texas have pushed bills that would strip climate change from curriculums entirely.

But in this new analysis, the authors of the study say, Although climate model results have been criticized during debates about a 'hiatus' or 'slowdown' of global mean surface temperature, it is increasingly clear that the pause in surface warming was at least in part due to the redistribution of heat within the climate system.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much for this conversation. I wish you all luck as lawmakers. Welcome to Washington.
Whether either or both of these governors can mount a viable campaign remains to be seen, but their presence in the race would provide a much-needed emphasis on practicality and competence. Trump, who cannot keep the government open with Republican majorities in both houses, could enter 2020 with a faltering economy, a massive debt, a health-care system hobbled by his own machinations and a ridiculous energy policy based on fantasies like clean coal. A competent governor from the center-left might be a welcome alternative to President Chaos.

Because that's what we hear The make energy unaffordable budget will lose you support nationwide The Brexit vote was a big issue When people realise the cost & impact of Net Carbon Zero policies on everyday life, the reaction will be far bigger When people realise that you hadn't even looked into it properly, but plowed ahead regardless, hello Euro election result once more. Do you think British people are going to somehow react differently to the French people & their reaction to crippling environmental taxes? It's a crazy agenda & you're on a hiding to Party oblivion. No Rishi ! Please, DO NOT DO THIS. If you proceed with this madness you will alienate people like me who voted for you. STOP, speak to people like Matt Ridley who will explain what a catastrophic error you are making. why?
In an effort to be inclusive to those who don't identify as a specific gender, the rules package strips all mention of gender-specific pronouns and terms such as man, woman, mother and son.
By declaring war against Mexico and signing a treaty with Britain, the United States essentially made Texas, California and Oregon much safer for American settlement (and, tragically, much less safe for Native and Mexican residents already living in these regions). White Americans in these regions knew this, and they celebrated. As the governor of Oregon proclaimed, We can … congratulate one another that we are again citizens of the United States. They were happy for their experiment in self-government to end.

The pandemic should remind us that physical reality is real ― I've been trying to make this point about carbon for years, that chemistry and physics don't negotiate. The microbe makes the same point for biology. And as a corollary, fast action in the face of a crisis helps: South Korea had its first case the same day as the U.S. ― and one of those countries then acted swiftly to bend the curve and one didn't. The same, obviously, goes for global warming.

The challenge is how to scale it and make it sustainable, Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, said of the upcoming Sunrise Movement tour. One-off rallies in a few cities, for example, might generate a little press and get some temporary action, but the effects are unlikely to last or build sustained support for the policy or, I would argue, build the deeper political power of the climate movement.

Her broad range of policy proposals has resonated with voters around the state, even if they don't agree with all of her views.
He has moved us close to the edge of war. He's put our country on the edge of going to war. We know that the Iranians are going to respond, Warren said. The job of the president of the United States is to keep America safe, to have a coherent, long-term strategy, not to make compulsive decisions.
As a well-experienced peer reviewer, I very rarely scrutinize raw data, he said. Rather, I look at data collection and analysis methods, summary and other statistics and graphics and results and conclusions to determine the validity of a study and the strength of its scientific evidence.

Shahid of the Justice Democrats envisions the possibility of winning Manchin over with giveaways directed to West Virginia, where 16% of people live in poverty.
The unusually warm and dry year in Australia is also due, in part, to a weather pattern that has set up across the Indian Ocean. It's known as the Indian Ocean Dipole, or IOD, which is an air circulation pattern in the Indian Ocean. When the IOD is in its positive phase, the water is cooler than average off the coast of Sumatra, leading to reduced atmospheric lift there and reduced rainfall over Australia, and there are warmer-than-average waters off the coast of Africa.
I'm really not sure that this was quite the post-Brexit vision Trump had in mind when he promised Britain a 'fantastic' and 'very big' trade deal once it managed to extricate itself from the European Union.

archived recording (scott morrison) So we must take action on climate change. And we'll do it without economy-wrecking or job-destroying reckless targets. We'll do it with sensible targets that gets the balance right.
Of course, not everything has to be a fight. This author has argued for years that the overlooked middle ground in the climate change debate is carbon capture: that is, sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide, preferably as a solid, so that it can't contribute to the greenhouse effect. One would bet that if the Green New Deal were ever to really get going, carbon capture would loom large, offering a win-win for both sides. That is, we put less CO2 in the atmosphere—or even start removing it—but we still get the energy benefit of our natural resources.
In 2016 the extreme heat was partly attributed to the end of an El Niño event, a huge ocean-atmosphere climate interaction which results in warming in sea surface temperatures across swathes of the Pacific Ocean.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi agreed to create it, but it's not nearly what Ocasio-Cortez had in mind. Pelosi granted the committee limited powers and did not ban members who take money from the fossil fuel industry.
REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: I think that there's the potential that it could happen. We've only been governing now for twenty-four hours. There's the potential that we could say, man, there's all this opportunity for consensus, think about draining the swamp, right? Everybody is running on anti-corruption now. But in order for us to do something we have to be bipartisan, which means everyone is going to win. If all we're thinking about is 2020, that's going to be a big, big problem and the American people are going to suffer.

That distrust is rotting away at the core of our economy, and a lot of these responsible business practices [and] sustainable investing are meant to deal with that distrust.
But I think that it's more than just having sets that are multicultural. I think that we have to really do the hard work to truly understand systemic racism. I think that it is the obligation of the people that have created and perpetuate and benefit from a system of oppression to be the ones that dismantle it. So that's on us, he said.
During his campaign, Trump vowed to cancel U.S. participation in the deal. World leaders and business figures had recently urged him to reconsider, but by Wednesday morning, reports began to surface that Trump had decided to leave the pact.

This is what people have been saying for years. They hate the politics at these award shows. And maybe these celebs should have heeded Gervais advice, Laura, but they didn't.

A common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make.
The seats that Democrats picked up across the country this fall were largely won by reassuring voters that they are willing to fight for workers young and old, and ensuring that they will have affordable health care and gainful employment. The Green New Deal, a bold proposal to put Americans to work building green infrastructure, modeled after Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, was a central campaign issue for a progressive faction of the newly elected Democrats. At first, establishment Democrats scoffed at the Green New Deal as some ultraleft policy demand, but the more the idea of job creation through building renewable energy and climate-adapted infrastructure were floated with the American public, the more support they gained. Not to mention, the notion of slowing rampant income inequality and leaving no American behind sits favorably with working people throughout the nation.
Those left-wing voices presenting once-fringe ideas are also growing louder in Washington, particularly among the new intake of members in the House who have been bolder in embracing left-wing policy proposals and terms like Democratic Socialism.

For more than a century, Black Americans have documented and warned us of similar moments where racial terror and white supremacy were the status quo. Several instances — often left out of history books and school curricula — illustrate this narrative. They show a desire to undermine the ideals of our democracy, and demonstrate the hypocrisy in how police respond to Black protest and white lawlessness.
Its chief rival, the BJP, ran a divisive and mostly joyless campaign focused around the presumption that the integrity of the Indian republic was compromised by a group of peaceful demonstrators camped out on a national highway, near the neighbourhood of Shaheen Bagh along Delhi's south-east border. Much of the BJP's campaign was focused on the controversial new Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), that critics say violates the secular tenets of India's Constitution by making religion a basis for citizenship and the BJP claims is in national interest.

In the past, I have assailed you with modest proposals to which you have responded that you are far more optimistic than I about America's public institutions and future. However, in your latest missive, I sense a growing cynicism or perhaps a new assessment regarding where America is heading: 'Like many great civilizations before us, America is slouching toward authoritarianism. Democracies tend toward kingship in almost every case since charismatic leaders and demagogues are so successful at deceiving voters by appealing to emotion rather than reason.' I think you are correct as far as you have gone. What you seem unaware of or unwilling to recognize is that, even though the sample of democracies is perhaps too small to draw a conclusion, 'voters' appear to get what they collectively want, have worked hard to get, and/or deserve in some inexplicable way from their leaders. – Eric Hutchins, Santa Barbara, Calif.

Even though the group says its carbon fee plan would return money to Americans' pockets, it may still be seen as a tax. In reply, Costello says, I learned in Congress that no major policy solution comes without simplified rebuttals, which often aren't accurate.

A lot, of course, and there is plenty of blame to go around, according to Bacevich. He refers to leaders of both political parties who pursued this brave new world as intoxicated elites. Of the Bush Doctrine of preventive war, he writes: The United States thereby arrogated to itself the authority to designate certain regimes as 'evil' and to wage preventive war to destroy them. International Law had hitherto condemned preventive war, the Nuremberg tribunal calling it the 'supreme crime.'

MICHAEL ANTON, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESMAN: Well, the fundamental problem the Democrats have is they have a big gap between enthusiasm and electability. So it seems like all the energy on the basis is for Bernie or for somebody on the left side of the party, but then you have an establishment and a leadership in the party who really worries that going that far to the left just guarantees a Trump re-election and we need some more moderate person to play nationwide, but they can't settle on who that more moderate person is.
LIASSON: Well, like everything else about Trump and the shutdown, it's unclear. He's been ping-ponging around this issue. Sometimes, he says he definitely would declare a state of emergency. Other times, he's said he's not in any rush. But that endgame of declaring a national emergency has been described to me by Trump's advisers as the only plausible way out of this for him politically, a way for him to keep faith with his base, show him - show them he's fighting, even if he's stymied in the courts.

From February 2016 to February 2018 (the latest month available) global average temperatures dropped 0.56°C. You have to go back to 1982-84 for the next biggest two-year drop, 0.47°C—also during the global warming era. All the data in this essay come from GISTEMP Team, 2018: GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP). NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (dataset accessed 2018-04-11 at https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/). This is the standard source used in most journalistic reporting of global average temperatures. The 2016-18 Big Chill was composed of two Little Chills, the biggest five month drop ever (February to June 2016) and the fourth biggest (February to June 2017). A similar event from February to June 2018 would bring global average temperatures below the 1980s average. February 2018 was colder than February 1998.

KANDER: This was very early in our collaboration. And Fred had an idea for writing a comic song about a coloring book. And my memory of it was that I think when he suggested it, for some reason I had some sort of mild annoyance. And I think I said to him, why does everything have to be funny? And we started talking about how you could take a song about a coloring book and make it real, poignant, somehow or other truthfully emotional. And so we went in that direction. I have to preface this by saying Freddy I wrote a lot. We were pregnant all the time. So the idea of writing a song...

The poll finds a plurality of Democrats, Republicans and Independents likely to vote in the state's March 3, 2020 primary election in agreement that homelessness is the most important issue for Gov. Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers to work on in 2020. Twenty-one percent of Democrats and Independents called it the top issue, compared to 29 percent of Republicans. Housing affordability and the environment were the next highest priorities for likely Democratic primary voters, while Republicans were more concerned about immigration and taxes.
And the 1999 production never made it to Broadway. You were revamping the production when Fred Ebb died in 2004.

It's unclear when and if any of them will make it to the floor, let alone pass the House. But their growing support marks an astonishing rise for socialist-leaning policies in just a few years, and reflects a shift in the party itself. A stunning Gallup poll last summer showed Democrats view socialism more positively than capitalism. The term Democratic Socialist was only broadly popularized with the 2016 presidential run of Bernie Sanders, who identifies as one. The enthusiasm behind his bid underscored how ideas that once marinated on the party's fringe were increasingly becoming mainstream.

Thanks to years of GOP tolerance for surreal thinking on the right, conspiracy theories have moved from the fringe to the center. One poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University found that 63 percent of registered voters subscribe to at least one such theory. Some social science research suggests that people who feel alienated from politics are more prone to thinking conspiratorially. Trump capitalized on that climate of suspicion.

Breitburg concedes that addressing global warming can seem daunting, but she says focused local efforts to protect areas can be effective.

That would be perfectly fine with many environmental groups, for whom opposition to dams has become something of an article of faith over the past several decades. Dams were once thought to provide an environmentally-friendly source of renewable energy, through hydroelectric power. But they destroy whatever habitat finds itself submerged by reservoirs; impede fish migration; and — if managed poorly — create new hazards, such as mechanical failure.
Trump dismayed any number of congressional Republicans by backing out of a deal that would have funded the government until Feb. 8, choosing to shut down parts of it instead. But almost all of them have kept their mouths shut.
Samantha McCulloch, an analyst at the International Energy Agency, said finding ways to commercialize the technology could offer an important backstop or hedge. But markets have been slow to develop. The biggest commercial use of capture carbon dioxide at present is for enhanced oil recovery ― shooting captured CO₂ at high pressures into nearly exhausted oil wells to extract what remains. Houston-based Occidental has invested heavily in direct air capture in a bid to ultimately reposition itself as a carbon management company that difficult-to-decarbonize industries, such as airlines or cement makers, may someday pay to remove CO₂ emissions from the atmosphere.

I am not in-- anti-Israel. I will do everything I can to protect the independence and the security and the freedom of the Israeli people. But what we need in this country is a foreign policy that not only protects Israel but deals with the suffering of the Palestinian people as well. You got seventy percent youth unemployment in Gaza. People can't even leave that district, that area, major, major crises. It is not sustainable that we-- continued conflict in the Middle East until the United States develops an even-handed policy.

How do you bring this back? Whitaker asked.
But we must be honest and tell you there was another factor at play and that was ideology. Thomas was only on the street in the first place because politicians long ago decided to side with criminals over normal people in New York.
California has positioned itself as the center of the Trump resistance, Jessica Levinson, a clinical law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, told Fox News. It's bloody combat.
Blanch told USA TODAY that the loss includes thousands of precious koalas, along with other iconic species such as kangaroos, wallabies, gliders, potoroos, cockatoos and honeyeaters.
And I might add here, remember that on the southern border eight congressional districts, including one Republican, none of them, including the Republican, voted for this wall, Chris. So the politics of this are very clear, its Trump, not the Republicans.
On this broader issue of Barr and the Democratic reaction, I think your question was good. Have the Democrats learned their lesson? We have people talking about impeachment of Bill Barr, which I think is ludicrous.

Democrats' apparent sweep in the Georgia Senate runoffs means they can dust off some of the lofty legislative plans for 2021 they made before the November election, but experts say they should temper their expectations.
COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Joe Biden is facing increasingly formidable competition in South Carolina, a state his campaign has long assumed was safely in his column and one he's repeatedly described as a firewall in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.
For people of my generation, especially in Europe, life's just always carried on, he said. And the pandemic has really shaken that. The lovely stable world that we've known, for all its problems that we go on about, is fragile and precious, Berners-Lee said.
The support for the USMCA now aligns Warren with moderate 2020 candidates such as Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former vice president Joe Biden, who have shown support for the trade deal.
Yet the recovery will continue to be K-shaped, as economists say, with already-well-off professionals heading steadily up as others struggle. Indeed, the split could get worse if additional government aid doesn't materialize or if even more jobs and small businesses don't return because consumer habits shift. Analysts at Goldman Sachs, for instance, think that economic growth will probably recover fully in 2021 but that employment won't return to precrisis levels until 2024.

It is also a system replete with ironies. The state that gave Ronald Reagan to America, and with him a new brand of unapologetic conservatism, is one in which the survival of the population depends on massive investments in infrastructure — albeit paid for, ultimately, by water users themselves.

These days, transportation accounts for the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions. Green New Deal backers say they want more high-speed trains to make airline travel less necessary, and more electric cars and charging stations. But experts warn that changing the existing fleet of cars in the U.S. would be an extraordinary effort.
WALLACE: So, let's -- you're exactly right. I -- you have voted for a border barrier in the past and I've been looking at your records, so let's put it up on the screen. In 2013, as part of comprehensive immigration reform, you supported $46 billion for border security, including 350 miles of new fencing. In 2018, last year, you and most Senate Democrats approved $25 billion for border security, including physical barriers.
In overcoming #COVID19, we can also avert climate catastrophe and restore our planet. We have a chance to not simply reset the world economy but to transform it.

MIKE POMPEO: Don't trust anything. We're going to deliver. It's about actions. The agreements that set out, the conditions that set out the space. But, no, this deal doesn't depend upon trusting anyone. It has a deep, complex, well-thought out, multi-month negotiated verification complex and mechanism by which we can observe and hold every member of the agreement accountable. We'll do that. It's not about trust. It's about what happens on the ground to not only yesterday, which was an important day, but in the days that follow.
Among the most prominent, the deal calls for meeting 100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources. The ultimate goal is to stop using fossil fuels entirely, Ocasio-Cortez's office told NPR, as well as to transition away from nuclear energy.
And oh yes, it's good news, as well, for the United States, since energy security is a big part of national security. As any Baby Boomer remembers, all through the 60s, 70s, and 80s, we were told by the experts that the U.S. faced an energy crisis. Thus we needed to take dramatic steps to deal with this supposed shortfall—everything from cutting back on consumption to invading other countries to seize their oil.
Catriona Gray: I don't think anything was going through my mind. Like you could just see from the expression on my face, I was just ... I don't know. I guess the word would be incredulous. I feel like I entered into a dream state when I look back on the memory. It feels like such a blur.
Democrats accuse the President of acting precipitously though and destabilizing the region, which isn't surprising. If Trump says the sky is up, they're going to say, it's down. But think about this for a moment.
On November 4, 2015, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) introduced the Keep It in the Ground Act which, according to The Weekly Standard, would enact [350.org founder Bill] McKibben's vision in toto. Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) introduced a companion bill in the House a few months later. But soon after, the #NoDAPL protests at Standing Rock—which were supposed to galvanize public support behind the Keep It in the Ground movement and usher in the dawn of the post-fossil fuel era—turned violent. Recognizing that extreme activism was not generating the public support they needed to upend U.S. energy policy, the leaders of the KIITG movement made a deliberate decision to change their tactics. Almost overnight, orchestrated militant actions were replaced with promises of guaranteed green jobs for all. Since then, Sanders and Rep. Huffman have abandoned the Keep It in the Ground campaign entirely and instead now publicly and enthusiastically endorse the Green New Deal.
While she's been in Washington for the impeachment trial, her family members and local legislative endorsers have held events on her behalf. Klobuchar has also urged supporters to help push her into the top tier while she's busy with the impeachment trial by volunteering for her campaign. And she's told undecided Iowans to call friends and family in Minnesota for a performance review.
Georgia Democrats attribute their success so far to the party's decision to abandon its reluctance to knock on doors and engage in full-scale canvassing during the coronavirus pandemic, a position many operatives blamed for the party's failure to meet electoral expectations in November.

Republicans concede that the only way they lose these races is if the president's base does not show up. The Washington Post's Jacqueline Alemany quotes anonymous GOP officials on Tuesday in her Power Up newsletter to express that concern. The anonymous Republicans claim that Trump's nonstop voter fraud allegations in Georgia have hurt Loeffler's and Perdue's chances by causing Trump base voters to question the legitimacy of elections and consider not voting. Trump's been generally unhelpful throughout this whole process, the anonymous GOP senate aide said, warning that Republicans should be prepared for a bad night.

Pelosi says she won't accept a budget deal that includes funding for the wall.

But I think this controversy is still overblown in a sense that if the president were really intervening, we know what the president thinks. The president thinks Andrew McCabe probably should have been charged and he thinks Roger Stone is getting railroaded. If he were really intervening, the charges against Roger Stone would have been dropped and Andrew McCabe would be facing charges or maybe have already been tried by now.

According to this study, 51 percent of Wall Street executives making more than $500,000 a year found it likely that their competitors have engaged in unethical or illegal activity in order to gain an edge in the market.
DAN BALZ: That-- that is such an interesting question because I think we are going to go through a period in which there is great hunger among Democratic activists to figure out who the best person is to take on President Trump in 2020, and I think there is such a range of opinions on who that will be. We saw in Iowa this weekend tremendous crowds that turned out for Elizabeth Warren. I think that is emblematic of the interest that people have and a desire to hear from the candidates. I think that people are approaching this with an open mind, we know this is going to be a very wide open race, there are a few people like Elizabeth Warren or Vice President Biden, Bernie Sanders who have standing and networks and-- and certain amount of name identification. But there are all kinds of other people who are going to be in this with different kinds of messages. And my sense is that people are going to be reluctant to jump too quickly to one candidate and get behind that candidate and they are going to say as-- as they all talk about in Iowa, they're-- they're going to kick those tires for some months as they watch and wait and listen to what people are doing.
The city has already installed an approximately $100,000, 7-foot-high barrier in order to block floodwaters from the homes of 4,300 residents and at least 70 businesses in the East Boston neighborhood. The barrier across the East Boston Greenway normally lays flat across the path but can be raised during storms. Boston used to be more protected from storms and high tides by the tidal flats that surrounded the city, but those areas have either been developed on or dredged away to deepen the harbor.
WALLACE: And then, despite -- if you're able to winnow your way through all of those folks, that on Super Tuesday you face another centrist candidate in Mayor Mike Bloomberg. And over really the last week, week and a half, there have been a series of stories about his comments on stop and frisk and redlining and, as I discussed with Kellyanne Conway, a big story in The Washington Post today about a long history of him king sexist, profane comments to women who work for his company and some of whom said that it created a hostile workplace.
Is there a business in depolarization? I get that the forces of cynicism, manipulation and hate are forever on the digital march, but I am convinced that there is money to be made in appealing to our weariness with how our tech lives have been shaped. There are ways to foster digital interaction that do not have to incite rage. The reason much of social media feels so toxic is it has been built for speed, virality and attention grabbing rather than for context and accuracy. While it seems impossible to imagine a new kind of social-network product in the shadow of Facebook, TikTok, for all its controversy as a Chinese-owned company, has been a runaway success (the first big social success since Snapchat arrived in 2011), and there is room for more. There are opportunities to create new forms of communication that give the advantage to users — by strictly enforcing behavior standards and eliminating anonymity, and most of all, with advertising-based business plans that are not predicated on taking advantage of our personal data.

And the pig is the Green New Deal itself which isn't remotely new, or particularly green, and which is far too expensive and damaging to merit the flattering term 'deal'.
Highlighting the potential ideological difficulties, Donovan said reconciliation would allow Democrats to within the strictures of the process, move anything that Bernie Sanders and Joe Manchin can agree on.
The vow, administered by a coalition of 16 left-leaning environmental groups, commits candidates to adopt a policy to not knowingly accept any contributions over $200 from the PACs, executives, or front groups of fossil fuel companies — companies whose primary business is the extraction, processing, distribution, or sale of oil, gas, or coal.

Bacevich's overarching thesis is that after the Cold War ended, America's leaders, both Democrats and Republicans, decided that the world was their oyster, that they would crack it open through the continuing spread of unfettered capitalism and hegemonic military might. American-led globalization would make one world order a reality. What could go wrong?

Germany is undergoing an economic and political crisis calling for new leadership both in style and substance. The latest manufacturing data have confirmed that the country's problems are not just due to slowing world trade, but that they partly stem from ingrained problems that have caught both businesses and the government by surprise. Industrial production fell 3.5% in December compared with the previous month, and nearly 7% over the past year. The car industry's struggles to deal with the challenges of climate change and the dearth of investment in recent years are taking their toll at last.

One unfortunate side effect is that the trend of celebrities preferring to interview each other rather than face questions from journalists will endure. There's no doubt that this new model will remain popular — especially because fans feel even more connected to their favorite stars in such casual settings. Of course, some stars will feel so at home, they will basically forget that they're speaking to millions, leading to controversies. Just look at actress Vanessa Hudgens, who went live to shrug off the pandemic in March, noting that people are going to die, which is terrible — but inevitable? (She later apologized.)
Here's what Guterres demanded the nations of the world do:
Biden's candidacy for president was about one simple idea more than any other: to heal and unify a nation paying the price after years of neglect, hundreds of thousands of needless deaths, and record jobs and small business losses. His agenda — to bring an end to the pandemic as quickly as possible, reinvest in the economy, promote racial justice and take steps to preserve the climate — is supported by the vast majority of Americans.

To get a picture of what water planners can expect in the coming decades, the team focused on the headwaters feeding 10 major reservoirs designed to capture snowmelt from the Sierra each year. Using averages from 1985 to 2005 as a baseline, they applied nine different climate models. They assumed global greenhouse gas emissions would continue rising at present rates—that is, a business as usual scenario with no effective global deal to cut greenhouse emissions and no major technological breakthroughs.

Some of the congressional offices reported the incidents to the FBI and the Capitol Police, the official said. The person was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.

Importantly, it's a nonbinding resolution, meaning that even if it were to pass (more on the challenges to that below), it wouldn't itself create any new programs. Instead, it would potentially affirm the sense of the House that these things should be done in the coming years.
A win by one of the Republicans would keep the Senate in the hands of Republicans and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,R-Ky. Though it would be a narrow Republican majority, Biden and Democrats would face an uphill battle on any legislation they hoped to pass.

So, we have found, in the past, presidents declared emergencies for different things. I am going to support him. Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we are almost there, I would urge them to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal. If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off, see if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation.

INSKEEP: As you know, Congresswoman, one reason that people who are politically conservative are skeptical of efforts to combat climate change is that it sounds to them like it requires massive government intervention, which they just don't like. Are you prepared to put on the table that, yes, actually, they're right, what this requires is massive government intervention?
A coalition of progressive groups say they are organizing a sweeping network to mobilize around climate change, racial and environmental justice, making a new unified push as President-elect Joe Biden is days away from taking office with Democrats set to control both the House and the Senate.
But a McConnell Senate that is pledged to a Biden failure, or even the protracted give-and-take of a one-for-you, two-for-me negotiation, would slow us down when what we need are urgency and unity to pull ourselves out of a ditch. Pandemics don't come under control easily — and a competent and capable Biden administration is just the start.
Pelosi noted that the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed legislation to fully reopen the government last week, including a measure to fund the Department of Homeland Security that provides $1.3 billion for border security with no funding for the wall. Trump, who has repeatedly requested $5.7 billion for the wall, has said he will sign no such bill and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has repeatedly said he will not bring that legislation up for a vote in the upper chamber.

The nexus between climate change and the mental health of children is rarely at the forefront of the discussion around environmental politics, but it's very real: In a Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll of American teenagers released in September, 57 percent said that climate change made them feel scared and 52 percent said it made them feel angry, both higher rates than among adults. Just 29 percent of teens said they were optimistic. Reports like the U.S. government's National Climate Assessment have cited mental health concerns as a side effect of climate change. The American Academy of Pediatrics issued a policy statement in 2015 warning that climate change poses threats to children's mental and physical health, and that failure to take prompt, substantive action would be an act of injustice to all children.

I personally don't think that a border wall is in and of itself immoral. What I think the speaker may have been referring to is some of the immoral immigration policies of the Trump administration, forcibly separating children from parents at the border and detaining children in cage-like facilities. The humanitarian crisis I think may have been what she was referring to.

Bender says he wouldn't do it now, though. It's partly because of the scientific dispute, because he thinks Happer is misreading the evidence. But it's also because of Happer's style — he's labeled climate science a cult and accused other scientists of whipping up climate fears to boost their own careers. Most offensive for Bender: Happer once said the demonization of carbon dioxide is just like the demonization of the Jews under Hitler.
Speakers at that first symposium included future justice Antonin Scalia, who was then a law professor at the University of Chicago and a mentor to the campus Federalist Society chapter. Choosing as his topic The Two Faces of Federalism, Scalia presumed that his audience was on a mission to influence national policy, and so he told the gathering: I urge you, then — as Hamilton would have urged you — to keep in mind that the federal government is not bad but good. The trick is to use it wisely.

The report warns that even if all the commitments made by countries for the Paris Agreement are met, the world is still on a course to warm by more than 3°C this century. Even half that amount of warming would be more than enough to cause widespread risks to health, livelihoods, and food security, according to U.N. climate experts.
What this pandemic has done, so poignantly, is shown how race and class and gender in some respects are working in society, because there are a few of us that with the stock market, we made more money this year than any other year in our lives. But other people lost their jobs and here in North Carolina, they evicted people on Christmas Eve; it was embarrassing. And so people are losing their houses, losing their jobs, holding on to whatever little stimulus check they have, while other people are just making money hand over fist or can work from home and keep getting paid exactly the same every month, or teaching from home, but others have just lost everything. And so it's showing, quite literally, the class structure in the United States, the racist, classist society that we have.
He said he didn't vote when the party considered a new system because he'd already announced his run for leader. But he watched carefully when a majority of members voted to change the system.

High school sophomore Sophie Kaplan is marching in a bright yellow flowered sundress, but the sentiment on her poster is hardly so sunny: Why Should I Study For a Future I Won't Have? She thinks about climate change every day, she tells me. She reads about how we're on the brink and hears her teachers and parents tell her that it's up to her generation to fix things. I don't understand why I should be in school if the world is burning, she says. What's the point of working on my education if we don't deal with this first?
IMF experts estimate that the slowdown in economic growth since 2012, after the temporary catch up in 2010 and 2011, explains by itself about three-quarters of the dramatic slowdown trade.

While bush fires are a regular occurrence during the Australian dry season, a combination of long-term climate change and natural variability is making the situation far worse.
Some legal and political analysts were less enthusiastic. As expected, [Trump's address] was laden with emotional appeals, with the president presenting a parade of horribles, John Cerone, Professor of International Law at The Fletcher School, told Fox News.

Inslee boasts a lengthy record on climate.
Teachers of a second grade class in Taunton, Massachusetts gave an assignment to their class: Make a Christmas drawing, something that reminds you of the holidays. One of the 8-year-old students knew exactly what he'd draw. He and his family had just visited nearby National Shrine of Our Lady of La Salette where they have crucifixion statues. So, the little boy drew a stick figure Jesus hanging on the cross. Makes sense: Christmas is, after all, Jesus' birthday and the crucifix was fresh in his mind.

THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES' CLOSING IOWA ARGUMENTS
The president and the presumptive speaker of the House are close in age (he is 72; she is 78), at the pinnacle of power in their political parties and eager to demonstrate that they are tough negotiators who can deliver. But in almost every other way, from ideology to resume to rhetorical style, the two could hardly be more different.

A Congress narrowly in Democratic hands would not be promising for a legislative onslaught of long-term and controversial changes. But that's not what's most important right now. A Democratic Senate and House would allow President-elect Joe Biden to tell the public, We have your backs. We will protect you during this chaos. As countries around the world have shown, when that compact is made and kept, the public is much more able and willing to follow basic public health recommendations.
The fairly steady rise in OHC [ocean heat content] shows that the planet is clearly warming, the report stated, adding that rising sea levels and temperatures should be concerning, given the abundant evidence of effects on storms, hurricanes and the hydrological cycle, including extreme precipitation events.

The House Republicans' experiment with continuously nationalized politics didn't work out. Politics operates as two interlocking systems, sort of like your left and right brain hemispheres: One system is local, parochial, individualized, pragmatic, while the other involves big national choices and ideas. Successful politicians and parties operate at both levels. Politics of local interests alone can lead to the kind of logrolling bargains — you support my farm subsidy and I'll support your oil-drilling tax break — that create a functioning Congress but risk losing sight of big national obligations such as addressing climate change. But nationalized politics alone strips away the many little points of common ground that cut across polarizing lines of ideology and help make bargains and compromise possible. When the two systems are both healthy, when politicians are engaged both with big ideas and with their own constituents and their concerns, it brings a kind of fluidity to politics that we've seen in more productive periods, such as the 1980s.
2020 saw massive protests over police brutality, economic insecurity brought on by the coronavirus pandemic and extreme weather events that again signaled the gravity of the climate crisis.

Since he was first elected governor in 2012, Inslee repeatedly championed incentives for electric vehicles, with the goal of getting 50,000 on Washington state roads by 2020.

In the most painful way, pandemics show us what we need to fix in our world. The stress they cause reveals all those parts that most need repair. With COVID, we have seen how festering economic, health and social disparities can blow up in our face. These injustices are the fissures through which pandemics, climate change and other threats to our health course through. At the same time, we can now see that the very actions we need to address the climate crisis, namely lesser reliance on fossil fuels and preventing deforestation, can forestall the next pandemic and promote a healthier, more just and sustainable world.

Combined with other environmental restrictions on land use, Amazonia has become something of a giant national park, and that fencing off of resources has helped to impoverish the nation. And, of course, nobody is poorer than the indigenous tribes; one wonders if people living in huts are really happy living that way—and many do, in fact, flee.

One way that Bloomberg hopes to grow and enrich the economy is by increasing the number of refugees allowed into the country annually. If elected, Bloomberg hopes to accept 125,000 refugees if elected—nearly doubling the intake accepted under former President Barack Obama.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and environmentalist billionaire Tom Steyer.

I am far from thinking that this ascendancy of women is a harm in itself. It is a gift bestowed upon them by nature for the happiness of the human race: better directed, it might produce as much good as today it does harm. We are not sufficiently aware of what advantages would arise from giving a better education to that half of the human race that governs the other. Men will always be what is pleasing to women: if then you want them to become great and virtuous, teach women what greatness of soul and virtue is. The reflections this subject provokes, and which Plato made in bygone times, greatly deserve to be better developed by a pen worthy of following such a master and of defending a cause so great.

So far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short-term needs — like giving their families enough food each day — rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way. But these families were also able to give their children more schooling. And now that the kids are aging into the workforce, it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty. If so, says Evans, that will be an exciting thing to find. — Nurith Aizenman
And in a statement, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy applauded the move, calling it the right call:

Do not forget Abe Lincoln. He confiscated funds designated for another expenditure to use for war preparations without Congress' consent. He suspended habeas corpus without the consent of Congress. He signed an arrest warrant for Chief Justice Roger Taney because Justice Taney told him he could not suspend habeas corpus without the consent of Congress. The U. S. Marshall refused to serve it. Lincoln ordered the arrest of members of the Maryland legislature suspected of being southern sympathizers. He sent troops to arrest Missouri's legislators. He summoned the state militias without consent of Congress that resulted in the secession of Virginia, Tennessee and North Carolina. He arrested 13,000 without ever charging them. He sent federal troops fresh off the battlefield at Gettysburg to quell the riots of the Irish in New York City shooting them down in the streets. Before we talk of Wilson, Roosevelt, Nixon or Trump, discuss the originator of the empirical presidency. Of course, you can say that was a real emergency. It was, but he could have called a special session of Congress like Roosevelt did after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, but he did not. – Bill Billips, Palm Harbor, Fla.

KANDER: That's part of the reason. The story of how the other one got written is Fred and I were writing songs for a film called New York, New York. Martin Scorsese was directing it. And it starred Liza Minnelli and Robert De Niro. We wrote five or six songs and went down to Marty's (ph) office to play them. And Liza and Marty were there. and then in the background - I don't know if we got introduced or not - was Robert De Niro sitting on a couch. I'm not sure I even knew that at the time. Anyway, we played the songs for them. and everything was all set until suddenly we saw this arm waving from the couch. And Marty went over and said excuse me, De Niro wants to speak to me. And then we watched what was a very animated conversation. and we couldn't hear anything. And Scorsese came back and in a very embarrassed way said that De Niro had felt that the title song, which was very much attached to him in the film, was just too lightweight compared to the song that was attached to Liza, which was The World Goes Round. And would we consider taking another crack at it? And of course we left and thought, some actor is going to tell us how to write a song? And we could not have been more internally pompous, I think. Anyway, we went back to Fred's apartment.

Gina Raimondo sued, arguing the new law violates the state constitution's separation of powers clause because it gives lawmakers unchecked control over executive rulemaking authority. Democratic House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio said Wednesday they're filing legislation to repeal the language that required lawmakers to approve rules and regulations relating to the expansion of licenses for medical marijuana dispensaries. However, they still took issue with how the Department of Business Regulation proposed regulations for dispensaries, with Mattiello calling it blatant overreach by the executive branch. The legislation not only removes the controversial provision, but also imposes limits on regulators. Among them, regulators would be barred from limiting dispensaries based on geographical zones and from preventing any center from growing its own supply of medical marijuana or limiting the number of plants. Lawmakers authorized six new medical marijuana dispensaries last year, for a total of nine.

MARK LANDLER: --with his own President. President Trump just a few minutes ago on his way to Camp David repeated what he has said over and over again, the troops are going to come out of Syria soon. That's a very different message than what John Bolton had in Israel a few hours earlier. Some of the caveats that he put in place, namely the one that we would not pull out our troops if there was any threat that the Turks would go after our Kurdish allies, that is by all accounts a standard that cannot be met at all in the short term, I think a lot of people in the Pentagon are skeptical the Turks can ever be relied on not to go after the Kurds. So I think that we're-- we're really in a very-- a-- a moment of-- of deep confusion about where this policy goes. But I have to say, it is in keeping with what we've seen from President Trump on troop deployment and withdrawal issues almost from the beginning of his presidency. He will say something dramatic, indicate a desire to termination to pull out and then as the machinery of the national security--

Are these states, and their elected officials, ever going to submit meekly to some green dictate that says leave it in the ground? That doesn't seem likely. And will lawmakers from, say, Louisiana—seeking to defend the new $59 billion worth of newly discovered oil, on top of the previously discovered $2.61 trillion, still waiting to be tapped—find a way to make constructive political alliances with those from states that don't produce energy, but merely consume it? That does seem likely.

According to McKay, Cheney's decades-long obsession to fulfill his destiny through the UET was all about being able to drop bombs and water board a handful of terrorists. To what end? It's like watching the kid in Christmas Story deliberately destroy his Red Ryder BB gun after scheming for months to get his hands on it.
As the recent drought showed, farmers respond to lower allotments of snowmelt by reverting to the pump—dropping wells to tap in to the Central Valley's underground aquifers. But that practice quickly led to a host of problems, from dry wells serving poor communities to rapid land subsidence, which snarls up roads, bridges, and aqueducts. Farmers were grabbing groundwater so fast that in 2014, the California Legislature passed a law requiring that groundwater basins achieve balance—the rate at which water is taken out can't exceed the rate at which water goes in—by 2040. By then, if climate change proceeds apace, farmers will be caught between tough groundwater rules and a vanishing snowpack.
The rules package also establishes a climate-change committee. The Select Committee on the Climate Crisis lacks some of the same legislative teeth that its predecessor committee wielded when Democrats last controlled the House. But, the House rules give the panel until March 31, 2020 to make recommendations to other committees for actual policy changes and legislation.

But if the pandemic has proved anything, it's that restaurant business plans are meant to be scrapped, or at least adapted. White-tablecloth restaurateurs have simplified menus to pivot into carryout and third-party delivery. Chefs have carved out spaces in the back of the house for ghost kitchens selling comfort foods far removed from their original concepts, available just for takeaway or delivery. Operators have opened small retail markets, subleased spaces for pop-ups or developed branded products to sell in retail stores. Flexibility and adaptability have become keys to survival, and no one bats an eye when, say, a refined seafood restaurant now sells chicken parm, meatloaf, and mac and cheese.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You-- you called them terrorists in the past. Do you still consider the Taliban terrorists?

But that doesn't mean we have a million American troops; we can do that with a very small footprint forward.

The difficulty of this undertaking can be glimpsed by considering a few of the novel laws that the Stranger recommends. Girls are to be given the same education as boys.

Meanwhile, infrastructure hasn't kept up. A 2015 review of U.S. infrastructure found that the biggest threat to it, by far, was climate change. And that's complicated by the reality of more people living in wooded and fire-prone areas, in houses that are increasingly more expensive and may not be fireproof.
But the GCF has a lot more flexibility in how it can spend its money, notes Jessica Brown of the Climate Policy Initiative, a research center that advises policymakers on green strategies. The World Bank, for example, mainly gives out loans, which, by definition, must be paid back by recipient countries. The bank can only give outright grants to a small subset of extremely poor nations. And it can't generally be a direct co-investor in a for-profit enterprise. The GCF faces no such constraints.
The review found, crucially, the e-mails cannot always be relied upon as evidence of what actually occurred, nor indicative of actual behavior that is extreme, exceptional or unprofessional.

The National Republican Senatorial Committee has more than 1,000 of its own field organizers on the ground in the state, trying to insure a massive Election Day turnout to swamp the Democratic advantage in earlier voting. One major Republican outside group's internal polling indicates the split between the parties on Election Day voting could be even greater than it was during the general election ― an encouraging sign for the GOP.
For his part, Biden has announced his own climate change agenda that stops short of endorsing the Green New Deal. It includes trillions of dollars in spending on green initiatives and calls for the elimination of greenhouse gas pollution by 2050. Late last year, he named key members of his climate change team, including former Obama-era EPA director Gina McCarthy to lead a new White House Office of Climate policy and New Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland to lead the Department of the Interior. Haaland is a congressional co-sponsor of the Green New Deal.

Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute noted that the U.S. only emits a fraction of the global carbon dioxide emissions – meaning proposals included in the Green New Deal would only go so far in helping the climate without changes in other places, such as China or India.

One person who seems particularly worried about the outcome, at least privately, is President-elect Joe Biden. According to a report Tuesday morning from Politico, the Democrat presidential candidate who became the first since Bill Clinton in the early 1990s to flip Georgia—Biden finished barely ahead of Trump on Nov. 3, and Trump contends he still won the state and that fraud led to Biden's victory—believes that both Warnock and Jon Ossoff will lose their races on Tuesday.

These lessons served me well. I implicitly knew that cultural appropriation should be avoided at all costs, and I was also aware that it could happen by accident.

This is not to say that winters are getting colder in the mid-latitudes. To the contrary, overall winters are warming due to climate change, although some pockets are indeed warming more slowly because of this effect. That's because these types of mid-latitude cold air episodes are made more likely by Arctic amplification, and research has found an increasing frequency in weak polar vortex states over the past four decades, linked to human-caused climate change.
Prison today remains a Lifetime Achievement Award for persistence in criminal offending. You have to work very hard to get yourself sentenced to prison, and yet, the elites are convinced and they're trying to persuade the rest of the world that America's endemic racism is willy-nilly throwing black people in prison and throwing away the keys. That is simply not the case.
Trump has fared no better with the Iraqi government by threatening sanctions if it moves to force U.S. troops out of Iraq. U.S.-Iraqi relations are at an all-time low, with additional confusion over the leak of a Defense Department letter that appears to set the stage for repositioning American forces in anticipation of withdrawal. That's even though many Iraqis, primarily among Sunnis and Kurdish constituencies, want them to stay.

This lull in hurricanes, which occurred during the 18th and 19th centuries, may have been partly caused by a drop in sunspot activity, which reduced the solar radiation reaching the Earth, the researchers found.
All in all, the various reports lead to the same conclusion: Earth's temperature continues to march upwards due to continued greenhouse gas emissions. The good news, scientists say, is that if society chooses to reduce emissions to near zero in the coming decades, the global warming trend could be stopped rather quickly, lessening the most severe impacts of climate change.

That was a deal that was tentatively made over a year ago, but Trump walked away from that.

Ocasio-Cortez, 29, was sworn in to Congress on Thursday, after being the youngest woman elected to the chamber. She campaigned on a fiercely anti-Trump agenda and has promised to be a leading voice on a slew of left-leaning issues, including climate change, immigration and health care.
That sort of denial is especially true with frequent and costly flooding, he said, and is the reason only 4% of the population has federal flood insurance when about one-third may need it.
Pete Buttigieg's argument is that he has the ability to unite the country and appeal to moderate voters, including future former Republicans. Buttgieg, the other top candidate who has been free to roam Iowa during impeachment, has made final trips to some of the counties that voted twice for President Obama before switching to Mr. Trump, and the campaign has emphasized their organizing strength in Iowa's pivot counties.

Williston: A proposed gas plant could help reduce wasteful flaring in the northern region of the Bakken oil patch. Outrigger Energy of Denver wants to build a plant in Williams County west of Williston capable of processing up to 450 million cubic feet of gas per day. Crude oil prices surpassing $50 per barrel have attracted the company to oil drilling in the Bakken, according to CEO Dave Keanini. The company also plans to build a 70-mile gathering pipeline that starts in eastern Williams County and ends at the processing plant, according to the Bismarck Tribune. It has entered into an agreement with XTO Energy to transport gas from the producer's wells. The Outrigger processing plant is the sixth facility of its kind in the works in North Dakota. Officials hope the investments will significantly curb the amount of excess gas that is flared in the state.
Environmentalists said the pipeline could jeopardize the drinking water supply of about 6 million people, many of them in the Washington area, even though the proposed Maryland route is about 100 miles from the District.

The proposal falls short of expectations for $2,000 direct stimulus payments. Instead, it provides for what Breitbart News estimates would be around $320 billion in direct payments of $1,400 for most Americans. Biden's aides say this amounts to the promised $2,000 when coupled with the $600 included in the aid bill President Donald Trump signed last year.

The administration has aggressively rolled back environmental and climate regulations, including President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan, a policy limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. At Interior, Zinke overturned an Obama-era moratorium on new coal leases on federal land, scrapped a hydraulic fracturing rule meant to better protect public health and curtailed a rule limiting the amount of methane that can be released from oil and gas operations on federal and Native American lands.

If that wasn't ambitious enough, the proposal describes this as a historic opportunity to virtually eliminate poverty in the United States and to make prosperity, wealth and economic security available to everyone participating in the transformation. Its proposals on the economic front include a job guarantee program that offers a living wage job to every person who wants one, a just transition for workers affected by climate change, basic income programs, universal health care and any others as the select committee may deem appropriate to promote economic security, labor market flexibility and entrepreneurism.
SANDERS, BUTTIGIEG REVEAL MASSIVE FUNDRAISING HAULS IN FOURTH QUARTER
His nomination to serve as Pruitt's No. 2 faced little opposition. Democrats largely overlooked him during the initial confirmation hearing in November 2017. He couched blatant climate change denial in smooth legalese. He appeared moderate next to Kathleen Hartnett White, the right-wing ideologue nominated to serve as the head of the Council on Environmental Quality, whose humiliating performance captured Democrats' attention at the confirmation hearing she shared with Wheeler.
But the Congressional Budget Office has been much more conservative about the efficacy of government spending during the pandemic, assuming that only a fraction of every federal dollar will actually result in economic output.

Alvanei Xirizana, 15, died on Thursday in a hospital in the state of Roraima, Reuters reported, citing local health authorities. He belonged to the relatively isolated Yanomami tribe, whose more than 38,000 members occupy rainforests and mountains in northern Brazil and southern Venezuela, according to human rights group Survival International.

Medicare-for-all in particular is quickly picking up support. A New York Times analysis found that one-third of Senate Democrats and more than half of House Democrats have endorsed Medicare-for-all proposals -- including a number of possible 2020 presidential hopefuls. Such proposals would lead to more government involvement in health care, and bring the U.S. a step closer to mostly socialized systems such as the British National Health Service. Their popularity is driven by frustration with the current private insurance system, which remains costly on the individual market despite ObamaCare's goals. And while Medicare-for-all is estimated to cost tens of trillions of dollars over a decade, advocates argue some of this would replace out-of-pocket expenses already being shouldered by millions of Americans.

The level of processing is high and the list of ingredients is long. A lot of additives are required to enhance the meat-like qualities of alternatives like those made by Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods (because plants can't naturally bleed, per se) and although they may not be overtly harmful, they're not helpful to the nutritional profile, either. In fact, Beyond and Impossible burgers have comparable saturated fat levels to beef: Beyond has 6 grams, Impossible 8 grams and beef 7.6 grams. Meanwhile, studies have shown a link between eating more processed foods and a higher risk of mortality for middle-aged folks, as well as higher risks for obesity and high cholesterol.

Sanders has also apologized for the mistreatment of some women and promised that his campaign team has already taken steps to improve.
What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics — the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems, Obama said in the first speech of his 2008 campaign.

President Trump used the phrase global warming in his Thursday tweet, a term that's fallen out of style among scientists and environmentalists because it doesn't reflect the many changes expected as carbon pollution alters the climate: more intense rainfall, increasing drought, rising sea levels, and other changes that vary from region to region.

The most familiar challenge stems from the fact that in the midst of national security crises, much of the nation remains willing to allow presidents to respond to its perceived enemies. Despite the War Powers Act and the larger lessons of Vietnam, Congress has continued to allow presidents to send troops into combat without a formal declaration of war. In response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, Congress passed legislation authorizing a vast expansion of the national security system that gave President George W. Bush and his successors access to new organizations, programs and institutions through which to pursue national security goals without congressional support.
A huge part of Vladimir Putin's power base on the world stage is the fact that so much of Europe depends on oil and gas from Russia, Hoeven said. And [ISIS] is relying on oil and gas dollars to fund its brutal terrorist activities in the Middle East and beyond.
I have to say that the scale of that is hard to fathom. So how is that possible?

Renee Belisle, a curriculum specialist for Denver Public Schools, says that the standards, which passed narrowly in Colorado, have played a hugely significant role in a rewrite of the district's high school science curriculum, which now integrates climate change into biology, physics and chemistry classes. Each climate change unit contains an action item; as early as middle school, students are taught that steps such as changing your diet or turning off the lights can have an effect. That arc of ending with the empowerment is a way to help mitigate that pessimism that could develop, Belisle says, particularly with kids, who might feel disenfranchised.
Now we begin the second year of the most decisive decade in history, where concrete action is crucial to meeting the goals of the landmark agreement.

Williamson County Sheriff Robert Chody tweeted a video showing one of the cutouts, which he said depicts one of the department's real-life deputies, giving the appearance of a police presence next to a road in the Fern Bluff neighborhood of Brushy Creek.

Chody said the cutouts, which depict the deputy pointing a speed-measuring radar device at the road, look like a real deputy at first glance. … He said the department tested out the cardboard deputies by placing them near school zones, with real deputies waiting nearby to observe the results. 'We didn't get one speeder…' Chody said.

When Crazy Rich Asians hit theaters several months ago, I was similarly disgruntled. I gasped at the outdated, Confucian, misogynistic stereotype the film perpetuated by suggesting that powerful Asian women must sacrifice their careers, and frowned at the cherry-picked dumpling parties and mahjong games that threatened to reduce Asian culture to a means of entertainment. Under the false guise of economic profitability, the film homogenized the term Asian, supplanting sub-Asian diversity with a myopically fair-skinned, wealthy, British-accented version.

During a news conference Thursday in the Rose Garden at the White House, Trump said the withdrawal is aimed at keeping his campaign promise to put American workers first. But he added that the U.S. would begin negotiations to possibly re-enter the Paris accord or a similar deal that, he said, would result in a better deal for American workers.
We don't yet have comprehensive age data for the next Congress, but it convenes this week after an election that added a historic number of minorities, women and young people to government.

In ancient Greece, that required a more masculine education for women and a moderation of the domineering masculinity of their men. In Geneva, it meant defending bourgeois manliness and educating women to seek their happiness primarily in the role of wife and mother. The differences in the prescriptions, which are striking enough, reflect different applications in different circumstances of insights the two philosophers shared.

But I have no doubt that if I become the nominee, we're gonna be able to unite the party because, number one, every Democrat and a majority of independents know how dangerous Donald Trump is. How he's trying to undermine democracy. How he's running a corrupt administration. How he is a racist and a sexist, and so forth. We're gonna unite the Democratic Party. And the issues that we are talking about, raising the minimum wage to a living wage, health care for all, dealing with the global crisis of climate change, that is an agenda that will bring the American people together to defeat Trump.

Those on the left calling for higher taxes have frequently pointed to tax rates in place before President Ronald Reagan took office, to argue they are not unprecedented. But free-market conservatives have argued there were more loopholes in the '60s and '70s, meaning most high earners didn't actually pay those ultra-high rates.

Gillibrand looks for upstate cred with campaign headquarters - [Albany] Times Union: Campaign representatives for Democratic U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand signed a lease for a 5,000 square foot space in downtown Troy, according to a local Democratic operative — a sign the recently re-elected Albany native could be basing a presidential campaign in the Capital Region. It was unclear which building the space is located in, and Gillibrand, who lives in the Troy suburb of Brunswick, has not officially announced she would run in the 2020 presidential race. But a Troy-based headquarters would be a nod to Gillibrand's familial roots in the area, which she represented in Congress before winning a Senate seat in 2010.

It's not as if Pelosi has been easy on Trump. At a private meeting after their now-infamous Oval Office meeting last month, she allegedly commented that the border wall must be a manhood thing for Trump.

Many lined up for hours outside overstretched private food banks.

Trump recently mused in an interview on Sirius XM that had Andrew Jackson been a little later, you wouldn't have had the Civil War. The president was returning to one the most studied eras of American history: the Antebellum Period, the decades leading up to the Civil War. The causes of the conflict can be traced back to the beginnings of the country. It is poignant and instructive to read the accounts of people who lived in the 80 years before the calamity. Many knew that something was going grievously wrong, that the political system was beginning to seize up, caught in its own contradictions. Some desperately warned against disaster. Yet no one truly foresaw what history had in store for them.
But with Trump dug in over the $5 billion he wants to build the wall, the shutdown could drag on. Senate Republicans are reluctant to consider the House bills unless they know the president is on board.

DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: That's the challenge here. You don't. You know there isn't-- the spectrum of disease here is very wide. A lot of people are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, but they shed virus and they're still infective. They can still transfer the virus and a small percentage get very sick. And so, it's probably the eighty percent that are mildly symptomatic or even asymptomatic that are the ones that are spreading it. The other thing is that people who get very sick, don't get very sick right away. The time to hospitalization in-- in different studies was nine to twelve days. So they start off with cold-like symptoms and then they progressively get more ill. And it's in that phase that people are spreading it. There was a very interesting analysis in the New England Journal of Medicine about two weeks ago that looked at viral load and viral shedding--

And a year ago-- a year ago, we presented to the President on January, the eleventh, 2018, I do remember the day, a bipartisan proposal to deal with DACA and many other aspects of the reform and the President rejected it. He said, I'll go with my approach. His approach ended up with thirty-nine votes in the United States Senate. It wasn't even accepted by his own party anonymously. So we're in a position now where when the President makes these claims and promises a lot of us, I hope I could speak for Senator Graham, are a little bit skeptical.

Special Event Joint Committees Deliver Opening Statements at Congressional Hearing on Firestone Recall Aired September 6, 2000 - 1:41 p.m. ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. LOU WATERS, CNN ANCHOR: We are covering the testimony about to be heard up on Capitol Hill before two House subcommittees. Opening statements are now being heard in the committee room. John Dingell from Michigan has the floor. Let's listen. (JOINED IN PROGRESS) REP. JOHN DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN: ... Bridgestone/Firestone announced August 9 as the second largest tire recall ever. It is surpassed only by Firestone's recall of 14.5 million tires in 1978. The recall in 1978 lead to hearings where this committee disclosed many of the same problems that are involved with the recall today. Then, like now, tread belt separations on Firestone tires were involved in accidents causing serious injury and death. Then, like now, many of Firestone's problems related to its client in Decatur, Illinois. The recent recall came about only after Ford Motor Company, whose vehicles were equipped with many of the recall tires, was given access to Firestone's claims data in late July, and was able to link 46 deaths and a large number of claims to accidents involving three 15- inch models of Firestone tires: ATX, ATXII and Wilderness AT. Since August 9, the number of fatalities attributed to these tires has grown to 88, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Time, then, is of the essence.
Working toward a solution, in fact, is the consensus approach to calming young people's fears about the future. The key to addressing eco-anxiety at any age, says psychiatrist Haase, is getting unstuck, losing that feeling of paralysis in the face of the problem's magnitude. Haase is a founding member of the Climate Psychiatry Alliance, an ad hoc group that has sprung up to offer patients and doctors advice on discussing climate anxiety. It's one of a number of such groups that are tackling the growing rate of patients panicked about the state of the world: The Good Grief Network was launched in 2016 to offer group counseling sessions to the climate-anxious.

The Camp Fire, which destroyed nearly 19,000 homes and took at least 86 lives, was the most destructive in California's history.

Immigrants from poor countries come to America for a better life as, numerous studies show, social inequality in the U.S. has worsened in recent years.

Sanders: You don't know. Nobody knows. This is impossible to predict.
Scientists have found warm water beneath Antarctica's doomsday glacier, a nickname used because it is one of Antarctica's fastest melting glaciers. While researchers have observed the recession of the Thwaites Glacier for a decade, this marks the first time they detected the presence of warm water – found at a vital point beneath the glacier.
Actress and leftist advocate Jane Fonda is headlining a climate change protest on Friday in Washington, DC, as part of the ongoing Fire Drill Fridays rallies inspired by Swedish teen Greta Thunberg's climate strike movement.
On a less dramatic scale, If Beale Street Could Talk (which opened last month) and Miss Bala (opening Feb. 1) constantly question the cinematic portrayal of culture. We can either swallow our qualms about cultural appropriation and accept it as a necessary evil, or we can negate the potential of film to redefine cultural norms in the same way Crazy Rich Asians has.
But the party is not behaving the way it did in 2016. By this point in the previous cycle, 63 Democratic members of Congress had already endorsed Clinton, who was months away from announcing her campaign. As of right now, no Democratic member of Congress has endorsed a potential presidential candidate. The idea of candidates jumping in to prevent a rallying effect for someone else is, for now, defunct, and the results in 2016 (such as Sanders's landslide win in New Hampshire) cut against the idea that endorsements from prominent Democrats can move votes.

These kind of enterprise-oriented services always had a place, but amid social distancing and remote working, they proved their true potential to businesses — and those customers could likely double down on them in 2021.
An anonymous website called Cons4DelDuca was created in December to highlight the fact that some of Del Duca's donors also gave to Ford's campaign for PC leader. And the popular Facebook page National Meme Board of Canada has endorsed Coteau and candidate Kate Graham and written that Ford would probably choose Del Duca, because they do have the same rich donors backing them.

There's no question that climate change is real. There's work we need to do on that front, he said. I think too often, even in the places where there is agreement, at least among ordinary people that we need movement, we get no movement. And that's quite frankly because someone other than the people own our democracy. And so one of the things that I'll be very focused on is the outsized influence of well-connected corporate interests in our politics.

But there already are signs that Barrett's replacement of liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg could diminish Roberts's pivotal role. Barrett provided the fifth and decisive vote to do away with the court's general deference to local officials regarding pandemic restrictions — the position Roberts had championed. She joined fellow conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to strike a blow for religious organizations that had chafed at what they said were unconstitutional boundaries on their right to worship.
Berman: You mentioned the hamilton premier in Puerto Rico over the weekend. Some Democratic officials were at that event — I think we have some pictures of it which we can show here. Do you think that the Democrats should have been down there watching a play, instead of working with the president to try to end the shutdown? Rosselló: Well, they were here also listening for over four hours. They had a hearing. This is the largest congressional delegation in the history of Puerto Rico, and I thank them for coming over here. I had an opportunity to explain to them the root cause of the problems in Puerto Rico. We had a discussion about the [Hurricane Maria] recovery, how some of the recovery's being stalled because of bureaucratic processes that are imposed in Puerto Rico that are not imposed elsewhere. How we need to start the rebuilding phase to be very effective, and how Puerto Rico can become a model, and how we're going to implement some of these core concepts that we value, such as tackling inequality, and battling climate change. But it is important underneath all of that, it's the reality that Puerto Rico, we are treated as second-class U.S. citizens. Because we're not a state, we — you know, we get a third of the federal funding for healthcare, for example.
But those supporting a departure won out. More than 20 Republican senators had called for Trump to leave the deal. Influential Trump advisers, reportedly Steve Bannon and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, also urged him to withdraw.
On only day two of the 117th Congress, House Democrats are already attempting to strip Americans of the transparency they deserve in order to push through an expensive progressive wish-list, Smith said, adding:
Every winter, we ask Washington Post beat reporters and columnists to think about the big ideas, arguments, questions and problems that the new year will bring.

Limbaugh noted how the media have reported other serious situations in the past and remarked they were treating the coronavirus as something they hoped would become more severe than it currently is.
First, the party in power is not great at guessing whom it should run against. It's an open secret that Republicans consider Warren to be the weakest top-tier Democratic candidate. The arguments for that run from the sensible (President Trump has defined her effectively as Pocahontas) to the fanciful (she's a female baby boomer and Trump already beat one of those). Early polling backs some of this up; Quinnipiac's pre-Christmas survey found that 37 percent of voters already viewed Warren negatively, more than any other Democrat.
Some industry and conservative groups have long pushed for what they called the transparency rule. Opponents say the aim was to handicap future regulation.
Bloomberg: President Donald Trump's trade war with China will force many U.S. companies to join Apple Inc. in announcing lower than expected earnings, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers said. 'It's not going to be just Apple,' CEA chairman Kevin Hassett said in an interview on CNN. 'There are a heck of a lot of U.S. companies that have sales in China that are going to be watching their earnings being downgraded next year until we get a deal with China.' Hassett argued that a softer economy in China is cutting into U.S. companies' sales there and that the economic pain gives Trump leverage in ongoing trade negotiations. 'That puts a lot of pressure on China to make a deal,' he said.
It's Amy Coney Barrett's court now
Fear that the HHS plan was flawed gave new energy to already circulating rumors and wild theories about the virus.
From the start, Bloomberg bucked the political norms of presidential campaigning. Opting to skip the first four early voting states entirely, Bloomberg flooded television, radio and digital markets nationwide and in the Super Tuesday states, outspending every other candidate in the field, to the tune of tens of millions of dollars in some states.

BUTTIGIEG INVOKES GOD WHILE DISCUSSING CLIMATE CHANGE: HE'D THINK POLLUTION IS 'MESSED UP'
The Associated Press contributed to this story.
It's a tight and fluid race heading into the final week in Iowa for a lot of reasons. Bernie Sanders is attracting 26% support, with Joe Biden at 25%, as the top preferences of likely caucus goers. Pete Buttigieg is right there within striking distance at 22%. Elizabeth Warren has 15% support and Amy Klobuchar has 7%, but because of the way caucuses work, these are critical numbers with implications for the race.
While government funding remains vital, Espinosa said, this kind of support is crucial for the work of the Secretariat to assist nations in their efforts to implement their commitments under the Paris Climate Change Agreement.

Sanders' uncompromising policy stances played a role in other endorsements. Hector Bajaras, a founder of the Deported Veterans Support House, cited Sanders' pledge to roll back a rule requiring the deportation of any undocumented immigrant, including veterans, who commit an aggravated felony, in an endorsement announcement on Wednesday.
A pro-Trump political action committee is also planning to run $200,000 worth of television ads for Van Drew and $50,000 in digital ads. And then, of course, there is Trump, whose blessing will likely give Van Drew an edge against challengers in the June Republican primary. The Trump campaign announced Monday that the president will hold a Jan. 28 rally in Wildwood, at the southern end of Van Drew's district.

The Indian subcontinent is a prime candidate, he says. But on the plus side, climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for El Niño and La Niña, the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others.

Up until now the 2015-2016 winter was the clear winner for warmth, but now it must split that distinction with this season. When you factor in the ocean surface in addition to land temperatures, 2015-2016 still holds the record. That's because that winter, the Earth experienced a super El Niño, overheating the surface waters of the equatorial Pacific and radiating heat into the atmosphere. It's years like that where record warmth is expected. But there was no El Niño to be found this winter, and yet, at least over land, it impressively still managed to exceed a super El Niño year.

Trump has pledged to renegotiate what he sees as bad trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, and go after countries he believes have rigged the global trade system to their advantage. But many private economists argue that trade deficits are largely caused not by flawed trade agreements or cheating by particular countries but by a bigger economic force — Americans spend more than they produce, and imports have to fill in the gap.

The museum had just over 1.3 million visitors last year, topping its 2009 record by about 8,300 people, officials said. Ten years ago, the museum's attendance was boosted by a King Tut exhibit and the opening of an Egypt exhibit. In 2019, special exhibits included Star Trek: Exploring New Worlds and PAW Patrol Adventure Play. The new mark also comes after the museum, north of downtown Indianapolis, opened its $24.5 million outdoor Sports Legends Experience in 2018. Museum CEO Jeffrey Patchen says it strives to provide fun and imaginative exhibits that appeal to all, from children to grandparents.

But an analysis from UNITE HERE argues it was high Democratic turnout ― not low GOP turnout ― that determined the election.

With control of the U.S. Senate hanging in the balance, The Ingraham Angle host warned would-be Georgia GOP voters that this is no time to sit on the sidelines or to stay home and complain and moan about how unfair everything is or how lame Republican state officials are.
Of course, all that could change after 2020, if the Democrats do well in the next election. If so, then the Democrats' green agenda, which is coming to be known as the Green New Deal, has a chance of becoming law. (This author has already written about the prospect of a Green New Deal, here, and here.)
Biden leads on perceived ability to protect the U.S. from terrorism, and 84% of Democrats say he's prepared to be commander-in-chief – though this measure doesn't really explain the caucus vote, since even those who are not backing him overwhelmingly think he's prepared. About two-thirds of Democrats say Warren and Sanders each are prepared. Buttigieg lags all the other top-tier candidates on this preparedness measure.

The Green New Deal is premised on three observations: First, there are unutilized and underutilized resources — especially human talent — that can be used effectively. Second, if there were more demand for those with low and medium skills, their wages and standards of living would rise. Third, a good environment is an essential part of human wellbeing, today and in the future.
Regardless of exactly how much needs to be spent, there is simply no economic indicator that suggests the United States government is anywhere close to overspending or over-indebtedness.

Now a new study from Stanford University puts a number value on the portion of the increasing costs caused specifically by the rise in floods linked to climate change. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, examines flooding related to rain and snow events and finds that of the $199 billion in U.S. flood damage from 1988 to 2017, more than one-third is directly related to trends in intensifying precipitation.

Waterloo: A business lobbying group is trying to halt the city's new ordinance that is supposed to help convicted felons find work. The Iowa Association of Business and Industry filed a petition for injunctive relief against the city in Black Hawk District Court on Friday, arguing cities don't have the authority to pass laws like Waterloo's. The ban the box ordinance prevents companies from including a question on applications about whether prospective employees have been convicted of crimes. But in its petition, the ABI points to a 2017 Iowa law that bans cities and counties from passing some business-related ordinances. The local governments can't preempt federal or state rules about business practices like benefits and hiring practices. The Legislature passed the law because some county officials – including those in Polk County – wanted to raise the minimum wage.
Health insurance is an obvious choice, though it brings obvious tensions about methodology. But as Obama-era Republicans demonstrated solutions are more politically difficult than just good-old fashioned complaining.

Mayor de Blasio has drawn comparisons between oil companies and the tobacco industry, which knowingly profited from behavior they knew to be harmful. The difference, of course, is that numerous deaths were convincingly attributed to cigarette smoking. Whereas people have died from severe weather events since the beginning of recorded history, no death has yet been ascribed to manmade global warming.

Boston: A group of families in the state is fighting a recent court ruling that found au pairs should be treated as employees entitled to minimum wage. An organization called Au Pair Families of Massachusetts is planning to lobby for legislation in the Statehouse on Wednesday, the Boston Globe reports. A federal court ruled Dec. 2 that au pairs in Massachusetts were entitled to earn state minimum wage and overtime, which could raise host families' costs by as much as $333 per week. Many host parents agree au pairs should have additional protections but argue the new changes will make the program less accessible in a state that has some of the nation's highest child care costs. The au pair program, overseen by the U.S. State Department, was launched as a cultural exchange program in which young people live with families in other countries while helping with child care and some housework. Host families paid at least $197 a week for a maximum of 45 hours of work before the ruling.

That's where companies often fall down, argues impact investor Michael O'Leary, who together with Warren Valdmanis co-authored the book Accountable: The Rise of Citizen Capitalism. The book argues that wooly definitions of corporate social responsibility and the voluntary nature of much corporate climate reporting have allowed companies to escape scrutiny and give the impression of acting responsibly, while in reality doing very little.
Transportation emissions overall make up the largest share of U.S. climate-damaging emissions, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Globally, air travel pumps out about 3% of overall emissions of climate-destroying carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. Surging growth of air travel in Asia and around the world means those emissions will triple by 2050, the United Nations says, and recent studies say even that figure underestimates the explosive growth of air travel and its emissions.
To critics of dams, especially among environmentalists, the events at Oroville Dam were further proof of the dangers of dams and reservoirs — which, they argued, stored water only at great cost to nature and great risk to human life.
Indeed, the author skewers pols and their policies left, right and center with potent laser-guided prose.

On globalization, he opines, (It) was supposed to lift all boats. Instead, it was leaving millions stranded.
The Trump administration continues to dismiss and downplay the crisis. I don't believe it, President Donald Trump, who has a long history of climate change denial, said of his own administration's report. He added that we're the cleanest we've ever been.

After no Georgia US Senate candidate received 50% of the vote in November, the races turned to two runoffs with control of the Senate at stake. While Ossoff and Warnock ran on a unity ticket, Trump refused to concede his own loss, sparking a fight within the Republican Party and disenchanting some of his supporters, who believed his false claims that the vote was rigged.
Two billionaires who donated heavily to charity last year — MacKenzie Scott, Bezos' former wife, and Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter — did not make the Chronicle's list because no single donation of theirs was large enough to qualify. Rather than give billions to just one charity, both billionaires opted to make large donations to numerous causes.
The power plant bill will be the second major piece of energy legislation from Constantinides in a little over five weeks. In November, he introduced legislation to cut emissions from buildings of more than 25,000 square feet by 80 percent by 2050. That would set what could be a new standard for cities around the world and form the backbone of what proponents have dubbed the Green New Deal for New York City.

And I think if you compare that to the way Beijing reacted, there are some parallels in that communist party officials, Chinese officials really covered up the start of the virus, and there's a lot of information coming out these days that perhaps it started earlier, and that they kept the public from learning about it. We know that one of the key whistleblowers, Dr. Li--

But Biden also ran on confronting climate change, reforming the immigration system, strengthening labor unions, addressing income inequality and overhauling the criminal justice system — all ideas that will be met with significant Republican resistance.

Other contenders for mayor have signaled concern about the issue.

But what people forget is during the 2016 campaign, he signed something called the Contract with the American Voter, where he pledged that he would obtain reimbursement from Mexico for the full cost of the wall. So he's actually breaking a campaign promise.

Many critics of the manifesto immediately pointed to the irony of using Buffalo in its name.
All of this is true, but the verdict of success is misplaced. Congress badly misjudged the nature and scope of the coronavirus crisis with the CARES Act, and then took six months to assemble a fiscal Band-Aid for its mistakes. By the time Congress finally passed an eleventh-hour re-up on some of the law's provisions, 1 out of every 6 American families with children were going hungry. And what they passed was a paltry influx of cash ― far short of the $2,000 per person that Democrats, and even Trump, called for.

Montgomery: A judge on Tuesday set a final hearing in a lawsuit over control of the Alabama Democratic Party. Montgomery Circuit Judge Greg Griffin scheduled the hearing for Jan. 30. The hearing could signal that a resolution is on the way in the legal dispute over who is party chair. Longtime state party leader Nancy Worley had filed the lawsuit to block state Rep. Chris England from taking control as party chair. A revamped governing board of the party elected England as chair this fall, but Worley and her supporters maintained his election was illegitimate. The ongoing feud has pitted longtime party leaders, such as Worley and Joe Reed, against an upstart faction. The Democratic National Committee supports England and recognizes him as state chair. Barry Ragsdale, an attorney representing the defendants in Worley's suit, said last month that England is functioning as party chair.

TRUMP BACKS AWAY FROM EMERGENCY DECLARATION
Cincinnati: The future of the city's only abortion clinic is in question after the state health director said the facility doesn't have enough backup doctors lined up. Because the clinic doesn't have an agreement with a nearby, private hospital to transfer patients in case of an emergency – an agreement required by state law –Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region has operated the clinic under an exception known as a variance. Ohio Health Director Amy Acton recently rescinded that variance. To receive a variance, a clinic must provide a list of doctors willing to treat patients in case of emergencies. The clinic in Cincinnati informed the state in December it no longer had four backup doctors listed and requested 30 days to find a replacement physician. Acton then rescinded the clinic's variance and notified the clinic its license was in jeopardy of being revoked. The clinic, which remains open, is expected to request a hearing on the issue. It indicated it was seeking another physician. Kersha Deibel, president and chief executive officer of the Planned Parenthood region, told The Columbus Dispatch that we follow the law and are actively working to identify a new provider.

What I've heard is not so much because he capitulated, not so much because they won't get the wall - because, after all, immigration restrictionists don't put the wall as their No. 1 priority. But they're angry because he seemed weak and feckless and in over his head. And what we learned this week, also, is Democrats, at least for now, do not have an Herbal Tea Party problem. In other words, Pelosi was able to control her left flank a lot better than John Boehner or Paul Ryan ever did with the Freedom Caucus. So far, the Democrats are hanging together more than the White House thought they would.

Policies that protect traditional rights and freedoms versus those that allow a censorious mob to decide what Americans can or cannot say. Policies that aim to make all neighborhoods safe, including those populated largely by minorities, versus attempts to defund the police and let criminals out of jail.

The new study suggests that climate change and the rising of ocean and air temperatures are having a dramatic effect on one of the largest populations of green sea turtles in the world, in the northern Great Barrier Reef.
What (the camels) are doing is, they're looking for moisture in the air wherever they can get it, King said. You've got traditional people living out there. Some of them have got air conditioners. Some of them have evaporative coolers. When the camels smell that, they push and push until they get to the source.
A study released in July by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University said Ocasio-Cortez's proposed 'Medicare for all' solution would increase government health care spending by $32.6 trillion over 10 years, and require historic tax increases. The study's author has said both Ocasio-Cortez and Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, a frequent ally of the incoming congresswoman, had misinterpreted his study when they argued that Medicare for all would actually save money.
Many sectors of the economy should come on like a light switch once you have a vaccine, says Tim Duy, an economics professor at the University of Oregon. On top of the boom caused by businesses reopening, wealthier Americans will be looking to spend some of the substantial savings — more than $1 trillion — that they accumulated in 2020 as they worked from home and spent less on commuting, travel and nights out. That should also boost the economy.
Ingraham acknowledged that while many Republicans in Georgia are feeling frustrated with the outcome of the November presidential election, we can't allow the frustration of this moment and the fury that so many of us have with what all went down in November to rip apart the movement that the president said [Monday] ... will come roaring back in 2022 if we play our cards right.
I do know how it got started — the shooting and the town hall meeting, said Gladys Muhammad, a black South Bend native who stumped on Buttigieg's behalf. Those of us who were not involved and just in the community, we decided not to speak. We decided to let the grass-roots people voice their concerns because they needed to be heard. We wanted that to happen. As angry as they were, they needed to say what they needed to say. We stepped back and didn't say anything.
So, I take Bill Barr's word when he says that the president has never intervened, but that, you know, he finds the comments unhelpful.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: There's an element where— yeah. There— people are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes.

The wine hitched a ride to the space station in November 2019 aboard a Northrop Grumman supply ship. The 320 Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon vine snippets, called canes in the grape-growing business, were launched by SpaceX last March.
Surveys show millennials remain under-invested in stocks relative to other generations, but that's likely to change, he argued, as millennials begin to receive their inheritances from the boomers and realize that, in a time where both interest rates and likely inflation/inflation expectations are troughing, equities, as has been the case for the last 100 years, continue to represent the best alternative for wealth preservation and accumulation in a diversified investment portfolio.
is an example of that. How would you respond to that?
2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world, and according to some experts, the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020.
Del Duca says he would start implementing the plan within 100 days of winning office. Three of its measures — funding for electric vehicle infrastructure, rebates for electric vehicles and discounts for public transit — would be introduced no later than the government's spring budget in 2023.
The Desert Locust upsurge represents an unprecedented threat to food security and livelihoods and has the potential to become a regional plague that could lead to further suffering and displacement, reads the organization's appeal for aid.
Trump also has sought to relax Obama-era federal mileage standards nationwide, weakening a key effort by his Democratic predecessor to slow climate change.
Distaste for Trump is led by Europe, where approximately three in four people – 75% – in Germany, Sweden, France, Spain and the Netherlands lack confidence in Trump. Mexico, too, does not like him: 89% do not have confidence in Trump.

Grizzly bears used to live from Alaska to central Mexico, ranging from the Pacific Coast to Missouri. Today, they only inhabit 2 percent of that historic range, living in isolated pockets.
Or maybe he genuinely likes her. (He did tell her, way back in 2011, that she was the best.)
It's really women who are on the front lines of this crisis, Sarosi said. They're in the hospitals, in the health-care centres, providing home care and so on. I think it's a lot more close to home for them than it is for many of the men.
TULSI GABBARD, HAWAII DEMOCRAT, SAYS SHE WILL RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020
Just about an hour and twenty minutes before the Senate voted not to call witnesses, including Bolton, Biden told the crowd that he was in the race in May, and according to the transcript, the president instructed Bolton to go to the Ukrainians and try to dig up dirt on Joe Biden. (h/t CBS News Political Unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro). The former vice president was likely referring to the fact that it's Giuliani who has been alleging and investigating, on Mr. Trump's behalf, corruption allegations of Joe and Hunter Biden related to Ukraine. No evidence of criminal wrongdoing on the part of either Biden has surfaced.
Then, The New York Times reports the FBI investigated whether President Trump was working for the Russians. We'll ask our Sunday panel what the bombshell revelation means for the Mueller investigation.
New York (CNN) -- Like most people, I'd given some thought to what meat actually is, but until I became a father and faced the prospect of having to make food choices on someone else's behalf, there was no urgency to get to the bottom of things.
There's a lot of incredible things happening in this world with speaking up and positivity, Lovato told CBS News in an interview Thursday. And as hard as this world can be to live in sometimes, there's a lot of people that are doing activism work. And I think that it's important that change happens. And change can only happen when you learn to love yourself, then you realize your worth and your value. I hope people learn that as they listen to my music.
DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think we need to look at the companies that-- that can develop antibody-based prophylaxis as well. We did that against Ebola. That is actually what we could potentially have for the fall-- fall or a small molecule drug that's currently on the shelf, trying to repurpose it for this.
It's important for the data to get the right kind of attention, proponents say. Ensuring universal access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 requires serving the unreached and underserved in remote and difficult areas, says Allakulov. Walking the last mile and extending safe drinking water to those at the base of the pyramid may be just the avenue that will benefit greatly from citizen-led water quality monitoring
Will Brazilian nationalists be pleased to discover that the Greens are actively using international financial levers against their country? And how will ordinary Brazilians respond to these threats to their standard of living? It will be interesting to see what happens in this looming standoff.
Indeed, it's quickly apparent: No matter what happens in the 2020 elections, the U.S. is not going to shut itself down for the sake of climate change. And neither, of course, is any other country in the world.
This brings projected global warming from being potentially dangerous to being easily manageable. Which is why, of course, it is unlikely to get much attention from a scientific establishment and a complicit media that much prefers to ramp up the global warming scare – even when the evidence doesn't support it.

We are thrilled that voters could soon have the chance to see Mike Bloomberg on the debate stage, hear his vision for the country, and see why he is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump and bring our country together, Bloomberg's campaign manager Kevin Sheekey said in a statement. Mike has run for office three times and never taken a dime from special interests, allowing him to act independently, on the merits, without having to do what donors expect. He is proud to be doing the same with this campaign.
Satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the Sahel look for water and assisting regulators in West Africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining. It can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters. In some cases, it might help us peer into the future: In December, the World Resources Institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery, in conjunction with other data, to predict water shortages and conflicts.
It's one of my, probably, my favorite things on this planet to do, is to swim with leopard seals, Nicklen said.

Nigel Farage: Trump Supports Brexit Because It Will Upend 'Global Bureaucracy' https://t.co/J8fsnTrJlU — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 21, 2018
His answer – what he believes Americans' next crusade should be – is as surprising coming from a conservative as the sudden fall of the Berlin Wall. In the face of accelerating climate change, he urges an alternative to capitalism as usual: an economy based on stewardship rather than satisfying an ever-growing appetite for consumption.
In 1993, a panel of federal, state, tribal and local biologists and stakeholders, called the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee, put out a recovery plan for grizzly bears in the lower 48 states. It set population targets for each of the five populations of grizzlies still living south of Canada.
CONWAY: -- and we work very well with them.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --who you know well, wasn't very happy with you this week, though, because she released a public letter saying that there are problems with this, that you-- you-- you are pretending that the Taliban can be counterterrorism partners and saying, you know, the Taliban is still allied with al Qaeda and pointed out you personally when you were a member of Congress--
There was also Solyndra, a solar-panel maker that received $535 million in Energy Department loan guarantees during the Obama administration before it went bankrupt. It repaid only a projected $143 million of that money.
As you may have noticed, things are very different this time around. In the original, you were wingmen and wingwomen for a still-popular new president of your own party. The tension was whether or not you could fulfill all of your wildest dreams. You did not, but we're sure it was fun to think you might.
How did we get here? Didn't the president say, even last year, that he couldn't, and wouldn't take executive action on immigration?
Crowe has donated to NSW Rural Fire Service and encouraged others to do the same.
INGRAHAM: Back to the point I was making earlier about the time I was there in 2006 and what I was hearing. And General Qasem Soleimani, he wasn't some bit player in all of this.He was the orchestrator of these terrorist assaults. The attack on the U.S.
Harris describes her focus on immigration as a senator – including her efforts to drill Trump officials like former Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly on protections for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and children crossing the border – as being shaped by watching her mother's experience of being a target as an immigrant in America.
But Warnock and Ossoff countered that they would demilitarize rather than defund the police, create a legal pathway for undocumented immigrants and support a public option to decrease the number of uninsured. Neither Democratic candidate has advocated adding justices to the court.

This theory of the non-biological origins—abiogenesis–of oil goes back to the 19th century. And yet even today, among geologists, it's still a decidedly minority viewpoint. Still, every time we discover additional carbon-based fuel reserves, that's an indicator that we might be dealing with a lot more than just the remains of the Jurassic Period. (As an aside, we might observe that the debate over the origins of oil puts useful perspective on the question of whether or not there is truly such a thing as settled science.)
Thunberg made an impassioned call for action, chiding what she saw as a lack of action.
Even so, there will be at least four serious contenders in the Senate that will make life much harder for Sen. Chuck Schumer as he tries to overcome his members' personal ambition for the good of the party overall.
Louisville:A billboard calling on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to vote to remove President Donald Trump from office is making its rounds in Louisville this week. Trump broke the law, according to the billboard, which includes McConnell's face. Senator McConnell, don't help him cover it up. Vote to convict & remove. The mobile billboard appears on a white van sponsored by four progressive organizations: Need to Impeach, Daily Kos, MoveOn and Public Citizen. Organizers said it will be parked along West Broadway through Saturday. It will make stops in front of McConnell's office and also go to Bishop Lane in front of Jefferson County Republican Headquarters. The four organizations are spending more than $400,000 on the billboard and ad campaign, according to a press release. McConnell has said he wants a quick trial that would have the Senate first hear arguments from the prosecution and defense before deciding if witnesses should be called – conditions Democrats oppose.
The EPA's new administrator, Scott Pruitt, is a longtime critic of what he sees as the agency's activist agenda. He and the president have both promised to scale back environmental regulation, including efforts to curb carbon pollution and promote alternative energy. Last week, Pruitt reiterated his doubts that carbon emissions are a primary contributor to climate change. That puts him at odds with the overwhelming scientific consensus.
They are the errors of yesterday's fortune tellers and we have them and I have them and they want to see us do badly, but we don't let that happen, he added.
Many enfeebled minds are being lost today about Meghan and Harry, when perhaps the comings and goings of someone a distant sixth in line to the throne ought not really to cause them to entirely wet their pants, she wrote.
The external signs of crisis mismanagement are already apparent. The president's threats against Iran have inflamed an Iranian public already at fever pitch against the United States. His promise — twice — to attack Iran's cultural sites should it respond violently against the United States was not only a provocation, it was also a potential war crime. Trump belatedly recognized that, but no statement did as much to undermine the American narrative that it's at war with the Iranian regime, not the Iranian people.
Alexander Gauland, leader of the populist, anti-mass migration Alternative for Germany (AfD), has condemned the union as a further erosion of our national sovereignty.
Cooper asked Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described Democratic Socialist, how she would pay for the trillions of dollars in government programs she supports. But instead of laying out a plan for how she would pay for the programs, Ocasio-Cortez deflected Cooper's question.
What's being done in this paper is looking at the upper extreme for what we think would be possible, even if it's a stretch, Hanna said. It truly is an upper bound, because upper bounds are instructive for showing what a crisis response could plausibly produce.
It is incredibly important in President Trump's administration to make the clarion call for religious freedom all around the world. There are many countries in which religious freedom is not available and we believe that by gathering citizens from around the world … we will highlight the central nature of religious freedom and its importance to individuals in countries. We believe religious freedom is important for every citizen around the world and we want to bring everyone together to discuss how individuals of all faiths have the right to worship as they choose, or if they choose not to. Every country ought to honor that.
Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig called President Donald Trump a national emergency following the president's statement that he was considering declaring a state of emergency regarding the border crisis.
Moments later, Pelosi urged him to kick out the media and proceed with private talks more befitting, in her view, the stakes and the setting.
I don't see prepping as something that's all about bullets and bunkers. It's more about, you know, beans and Band-Aids and proper products that can fill you in, in these funny times and these less secure times, he said.
to avert it. How should the women of both parties approach this challenge as they take their seats in the House? Obviously, each has her own past and personality. But for starters, just be women. Break bread together -- regularly. Former Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulksi famously began a dinner tradition for her colleagues in the 1990s -- and friendships bloomed. Fast forward some 20 plus years. Senator Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, describe how when Gillibrand and her family vacationed in Alaska, Murkowski hosted a dinner party in her friend's honor and Murkowski's husband taught her sons to salmon fish. No wonder that when a government shutdown loomed in 2013, several of the women around that famous dining table came together
Stop us if you've heard this one before: After years of bond- and money-market-fund inflows and equity-fund outflows, investors grow fearful of a rebound in yields and the potential for capital losses in fixed-income, sparking a great rotation out of bonds and into equities.
Inside the facility's fire lab, one of the world's largest flames tears through two shelves stacked high with boxes. It looks like a catastrophe, but this is only a demonstration.
JUAN WILLIAMS, POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think it's pretty clear right now, if you look at the polls this morning, that the president and Republicans are being blamed overwhelmingly for shutting down the government. And as Chris Coons pointed out to you this morning, Chris, Mitch McConnell and the Republicans had a unanimous support, Republicans and Democrats, for a bill that would have opened the government, kept the government open and then allowed for negotiations going forward. It's the president who has made it a point to say, I'm shutting down this government over the wall.
Campus officials say the students in the photo could face judicial sanctions.
The president, though, claimed there would be very little difference in emissions between the federal and California's standard, but said cars will be far safer and much less expensive. He also predicted that a new national standard for fuel economy will result in more cars being produced by the U.S. and more jobs.
Trump is more negatively viewed than all the leaders asked about in the survey.
But a large share of New York City's locally produced electricity is generated by two power plants in the densely populated northwestern corner of Queens that Constantinides represents. The plants, located in the councilman's native Astoria and neighboring Long Island City, each burn a mix of gas and fuel oil. The stations annually burn a combined 6.3 million gallons of No. 6 fuel oil ― a thick, viscous blend considered one of the most polluting energy sources in the world. The Long Island City plant, called Ravenswood Generating Station, was ranked the state's largest carbon polluter in 2014.
Instead, Biden will need to consider which domestic priorities can get bipartisan support since Senate rules now require anything to get 60 votes to advance. The president-elect has already indicated that additional coronavirus relief will be his first priority, but he has also said he plans to unveil an infrastructure plan that could get support from Republicans.
Thank you, Bill. So it really was a great year - really, at least in one-hour weekly increments or, to be strictly accurate, in certain parts of one-hour weekly increments - usually when we got to talk to somebody cool.

Although there are more than 10,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Canada, and over 100 deaths, one in eight Canadians still think the threat is overblown, according to an Angus Reid poll released Tuesday.
They are high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, Ramirez said, but the large portions make them high in calories and carbohydrates and sugars in general.
To start with, a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture and dump more precipitation. A simple equation called the Clausius-Clapeyron rate calculates that for every 2 degree Fahrenheit increase in air temperature, the atmosphere can hold 8% more moisture, and thus produce more rain or snow.

WALLACE: But, Kellyanne, candidate Donald Trump supported what Bloomberg did with stop-and-frisk. Here he is in the first debate in 2016 with Hillary Clinton.
Fox News: Former presidential candidate Martin O'Malley is urging Beto O'Rourke to launch a 2020 White House bid, while making clear he's taking himself out of the running. The former governor of Maryland who abandoned his 2016 Democratic primary campaign against Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., after a third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses penned an op-ed in the Des Moines Register Thursday encouraging outgoing Texas Rep. O'Rourke to run. 'I will not be running for president in 2020, but I hope Beto O'Rourke does. And this is why,' O'Malley wrote. 'People are looking for a new leader who can bring us together. They are looking for a unifier and a healer. They are looking for a leader of principle, and they are now looking for a fearless vision.' … O'Malley added: 'Like so many other Americans, I believe we need new leadership to make that future a reality.'
2020 has officially become the joint-hottest year on record, the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service has confirmed.
Castor came under fire from climate activists and some progressive Democrats after telling E&E News in December that she would not deny seats on the panel to members who had accepted donations from the fossil fuel industry, calling it a First Amendment issue. She has since backed off that position and pledged, in a subsequent interview with Sludge, to forswear those contributions herself. But the committee is not expected to have subpoena power, a sticking point with progressives who want the authority to compel energy executives to appear under oath.
And it includes a host of other liberal wish-list items like: a job-guarantee program offering a living wage job to every person who wants one; a just transition for workers affected by climate change; basic income programs; universal health care and more.
FOLDS: That's the Chris Wallace song.
What California urgently needs and wants from its utilities right now is hard thinking about how to better protect communities from fire. And it's hard to see that going on.
As of Saturday evening, the Rural Fire Service of New South Wales still had emergency warnings, the most severe level, in effect. These warnings were communicated using dire language: The fire is spreading quickly. If you are in Tallong, Werai, Exeter, Manchester Square, Avoca, Fitzroy Falls, Barrengary or surrounding areas it is too late to leave. Seek shelter as fire approaches, read one such warning for the Morton Fire.

Noyer credits the election of Macron with much of the change. The French president is quickly following through on his promise to transform the country. He's overhauled notoriously rigid French labor laws, making it easier to hire and fire. And his government is preparing a raft of pro-business measures. Noyer says today France has the highest labor flexibility in continental Europe, and Paris is now an obvious destination.
While many Britons may be pleased with aspects of the new budget, such as the petrol duty freeze and the increase in the income tax threshold, they may be less happy to hear about increased levies in other areas and more spending.
As the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc across the city, other groups authored a 40-page plan for a green recovery, urging the city to spend $16 billion over the next three years retrofitting buildings for energy efficiency, expanding bike lanes, and boosting green manufacturing on Brooklyn's industrial waterfront.

This natural climate cycle is changing over time as ocean and air temperatures rise in response to increased amounts of greenhouse gases from human activities, namely the burning of fossil fuels for energy. This is expected to make back-to-back positive IOD events more common and make Australia even more prone to drought conditions accompanied by extreme heat.

O'Donnell: You're gonna propose a plan to the American people, and you're not gonna tell 'em how much it costs?
Altogether, the Green New Deal is a loose framework. It does not lay out guidance on how to implement these policies.
Concept has always been king for restaurants. The concept, or business plan, informs everything: what food is served and how, the decor and tableware, the marketing and target customers, the selection of employees, the location, even the name of the place. The success of a restaurant, the thinking went, flowed directly from the originality of its concept and its owners' ability to stick to it. Straying from the plan was an indication of weakness, and a sure warning sign to customers and investors that the business was doomed.
Sanders Offers Biden A Path To Win Over His Movement
I think Black voters, and voters all across the state, are frustrated with politicians who are only thinking about themselves, he said. I think Sen. Kelly Loeffler has run the most negative campaign in Georgia history. She's made a decision to attack my faith, and my church. And it's not resonating.
They could do so by nominating someone so far to the left that he or she could lose much of the swing vote and be cast as a liberal version of Trump. If Democrats really want to rid the nation of Trump, assuming he is on the ballot in 2020, they should consider their options carefully.
Guthrie understands how much climate change troubles his students, but he doesn't shy from talking about it. He confronts not only their fears, but also the political reality of denial and decades of inaction, all of which is disturbing to his students. It's like there's a paradigm shift, like when you learn that Santa Claus isn't real, he says. Everything we teach them, that science is a tool for understanding the world, that adults are protecting you, falls apart. There's nothing to prepare them for this enormous problem that we simply haven't solved.
The AAP questioned why it took the ECI so long (almost a day after the polls closed) to calculate the voter turnout.
Biden's team sees their wins in Georgia as a new path forward for Democrats in building a new majority. The party will have several opportunities to expand their hold on the Senate, but they'll have to wait until 2022 for now.
Recent high-profile measles outbreaks in the U.S., Europe, the Philippines and Samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year. To prevent outbreaks, the World Health Organization says that roughly 95% of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles. More than half the countries in the world, including the U.S. at 94%, haven't reached that threshold, according to UNICEF. Where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020? Afghanistan, Angola, Bolivia and Haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40%.
There is a difference. A determination not to act is, by itself, a deliberate act. This is how the framers constructed our system of government. Congress considers and debates a great many bills. Not all of them pass. This is not failure in the conventional sense, but decision by declination. It constitutes a prudent and calculated process.
Sanders has generated enthusiasm from younger black voters in South Carolina. That could help him avoid a repeat of his dismal showing in the 2016 primary, when African Americans overwhelmingly backed Hillary Clinton.
A campaign that started more than two years ago and featured more than 2,200 candidate events is down to its final weekend in Iowa. On Monday night, Iowa will officially kick off the presidential nominating process with its first-in-the-nation caucuses.

With federal protections in place, wildlife officials and conservation groups set out to change attitudes and build tolerance for the bears. They started programs to reimburse ranchers for livestock that bears killed. They closed roads in bear habitats and fenced in landfills.
But whether that co-operation extends to watering down the federal carbon pricing regime for Manitoba seems unlikely.

The city's overall climate resiliency plan has no official price tag, but Boston officials say it would pale in comparison to the damage done by a major hurricane: 2012's Superstorm Sandy did at least $32 billion in damage to New York City's streets, subway tunnels, homes and businesses, and killed at least 43 people. And that was just a single storm.

Yet, for would-be secessionists, the best model for their goals is not what we might think: Southern secession in the winter and spring of 1861, which led to the creation of the Confederacy and ignited the Civil War. Even most radical Trumpian ideologues do not wish for a war that would cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and leave their secessionist dreams in ruins.
The Departments of Homeland Security and Defense, as well as the U.S. Secret Service, are holding an all-senators briefing Tuesday on security for the inauguration, and thousands of National Guard members have been authorized ahead of the inauguration.

REPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: You know, I-- I think that 2020 is going to be about 2020, and it's not going to be about 2018. And there are certainly lessons you can learn, I think, from some of our races. I think there--
From day one, my administration has made fixing this regulatory nightmare a top priority, Trump said during a ceremony at the White House. And we want to build new roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, bigger, better, faster, and we want to build them at less cost.
To fund a Green New Deal, Ocasio-Cortez has suggested slapping a tax as high as 70 percent on the nation's top earners.
Now, despite all of that, the only jail time Thomas ever received was in 2013 on a drug offense, somehow he was able to kill a police animal and never go to jail.
The Liberal Party politician, who replaced colleague Malcolm Turnbull as prime minister last year, made light of the situation Wednesday, tweeting a photo of himself wearing a grubby pair of K Swiss sneakers.
The expansive Green New Deal proposal has floated in Democratic circles for years but was given new life by the Sunrise Movement and liberal lawmakers like Ocasio-Cortez. The package would focus on income inequality and climate change, combining ideas incorporated in former President Franklin D. Roosevelt's signature New Deal, and modern ideas like renewable energy and resource efficiency.
Fleishman says a gas sale and new management on the electric side might allow PG&E leaders to focus solely on improving safety. I think the company is willing do anything structurally if they think it can help with safety, Fleishman says.

The degree of temperature and habitat change that has happened is likely unprecedented due to how quickly these changes are happening now with the rapid warming of the earth, she told HuffPost in an email. We don't know how resilient sea turtle species are when faced with such rapid changes in climate, habitat availability, and developmental pressure.
We're talking about mobilizing an economy which means creating jobs...we're gonna have a lot of wind energy. We're going to have a lot of solar panels. And I think the goal is to really mobilize as much around renewables as possible.
It was a journey of self-discovery for me, and it made sense to go to the Philippines first because that was my heritage. It's my roots. And I wanted to discover that.

My father worked at Shell Oil Company for many years, and while on the Seventh Circuit, in an abundance of caution, I have recused myself from cases involving those Shell entities with which he was involved, she wrote in an answer to a questionnaire during her Senate confirmation hearings in October on her Supreme Court nomination by President Donald Trump.
Equity analysts project that PG&E's damages from the wildfires could exceed PG&E's market value and its insurance coverage. One Citigroup analyst estimates the company could be on the hook for up to $15 billion in damages.
INGRAHAM: Prediction, will Nancy Pelosi send those articles of impeachment this week to the Senate?
The environmental minister, Ricardo Salles, tweeted on Wednesday that the fires were caused by dry weather, wind, and heat. But CNN meteorologist Haley Brink said the fires are definitely human-induced, and can't be attributed to natural causes like lightning strikes.
Well, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is the data you have is wrong, he said, according to the audio recording. During the call, the president offered several false conspiracy theories, including debunked charges that ballots in Fulton County were shredded and that voting machines operated by Dominion Voting Systems were tampered with and replaced. Ryan Germany, the legal counsel in Mr. Raffensperger's office, can be heard telling the president that such charges are untrue. You should want to have an accurate election. And you're a Republican, Mr. Trump told Mr. Raffensperger, who replied that we believe that we do have an accurate election. Mr. Trump responded: No, no, no, you don't, you don't have, you don't have, not even close. You guys, you're off by hundreds of thousands of votes. Then the president suggested that Mr. Raffensperger could be prosecuted criminally. You know what they did and you're not reporting it, the president said. You know, that's a criminal — that's a criminal offense. And you know, you can't let that happen. That's a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer. That's a big risk. The president confirmed the call in a tweet Sunday morning, claiming that Mr. Raffensperger was unwilling, or unable, to answer questions such as the 'ballots under table' scam, ballot destruction, out of state 'voters', dead voters, and more. He has no clue! In a response on Twitter, Mr. Raffensperger wrote: Respectfully, President Trump: What you're saying is not true. The truth will come out.
WALLACE: Let me -- you have a lot of clout in asking the FBI questions because you're the new chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee -- congratulations, Mr. Chairman.
If you want to convince someone about climate change, don't lead with data, writes Katharine Hayhoe in The Times. Dr. Hayhoe is a climate scientist at Texas Tech University, and she's also an evangelical Christian, two identities she realized after moving from Canada were supposed to be entirely incompatible in the United States. Understanding why that's the case is crucial when attempting to convert climate change skeptics, she writes, explaining:
While much of WHO's list focused on infectious disease, it also included the increasing prevalence of noncommunicable diseases like diabetes, cancer and heart disease. These types of conditions, linked to lifestyle factors like obesity, alcohol and tobacco use, are collectively responsible for over 70% of all deaths worldwide, or 41 million people, the report said.
There were over 700 more replies, mostly in this vein:
In other words, this all means it's the Democrats who are trying to suppress the vote in Georgia—at least part of the vote, the part from the pro-Trump areas—as part of their last-ditch effort to win control of the U.S. Senate in races their president-elect does not even think they have a shot at, which the Politico article sums up nicely.
INGRAHAM: Well, as Raymond noted, there are reports tonight out of Australia that it was arson, perhaps not climate change. Well, they have arrested many people who apparently have been found with accelerants and other arson-related material.
Here in the Bahamas there are still huge economic obstacles. Losses from Dorian equal nearly 30% of the country's entire annual GDP.
The IMF suggests three explanations for the decline in trade regimes: the slowdown in global economic growth; the halt in trade and investment liberalisation agreements (which started long before the freezing of the Trans Pacific Partnership or the Trans Atlantic Trade and Partnership agreements); and the maturity of international production chains that would have exhausted their advantages.

He saw the writing on the wall — he wants to be on the right side of history, she said.
Ocasio-Cortez has historically not been shy in criticizing her party's leadership. In November, she blamed Democrat incompetence for the election losses. She told the Times:
INGRAHAM: And John Bolton says, he's now willing to testify in the Senate impeachment trial, if he's subpoenaed. But is that going to happen? And what effect will it have? Senator Ron Johnson is here exclusively with reaction. Plus, was killing Soleimani illegal. That's new thing they're claiming. Congressman Doug Collins, I cannot wait to hear him on that. Stay there.
But Democratic presidential candidates have made it clear that if they take power in Washington this fall, they will make the rest of the country every bit as inviting for criminals. Watch this.

OCASIO-CORTEZ FLOATS 70 PERCENT TAX ON RICH
Scientists from NASA and NOAA held a briefing Thursday afternoon to discuss the latest findings about Earth's escalating fever.
The source of her frustration is a feeling that her opinion doesn't matter and that the landmark law that brought grizzly bears back is being misused.
Pelosi denied trying to openly needle Trump by calling the wall a matter of manhood — something she did publicly in an October appearance at Harvard University before she repeated it privately to Democrats last month.
Having said all that, I'm going to ask the FBI director, was there a counterintelligence investigation opened up regarding the president as being a potential agent of the Russians? I find it astonishing and to me, it tells me a lot about the people running the FBI, McCabe and that crowd. I don't trust them as far as I throw them.
It's not easy to make a new coalition, but that's exactly what your party needs you to do right now. With a mix of suburban moderates and urban left wingers your new majority has new clear mandate other than to be a check on Trump, and even there, as we discussed above, it's a matter of degree.
I intend to represent all Californians, not only those who voted for me, he said. I recognize that many in our rural communities believe that Sacramento doesn't care about them – doesn't even really see them. Well, I see you.
Whether it was outside the box thinking, political courage or just trying to keep his name in the headlines while he was lieutenant governor, Newsom helped lay the groundwork for a statewide ballot measure legalizing the recreational use of marijuana.
This is stupid, McCarthy tweeted Friday adding, Signed – A father, son, and brother.
The fact is: the women and children at the border are not a security threat, they are a humanitarian challenge – a challenge that President Trump's own cruel and counterproductive policies have only deepened, Pelosi said.
Hope Town is a Bahamian landmark. Its candy-striped lighthouse dates to 1863 and is pictured on the country's ten-dollar bill. The lighthouse stood up to Dorian, but as we saw coming into the harbor, not much else did.
GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS RADIO: Well, first, I would just say to Donna, it's a fair point that she makes about the two examples that she gave. I would also note, that President Obama did make public comments about the Hillary Clinton emails investigation, which was a far cry from Rodney King, right? So there has been some precedent for presidents weighing in.

It set the predicate that would hold firm for most of the Congress: Legislation triumphantly shepherded through by House Democrats would rarely be granted a vote on the Senate floor by Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader. An Impeachment, Then an Acquittal Ms. Pelosi would spend months pushing back on the notion of impeachment before changing course after the president was accused of wrongdoing. But in late August, an intelligence whistle-blower revealed that during a half-hour phone call in July, Mr. Trump had pressured Ukraine's leader to investigate Joseph R. Biden Jr., just as the president was withholding millions of dollars in military assistance for the country. Democrats who had resisted impeaching Mr. Trump swung into action, beginning five months of hearings and investigations that would yield additional details about Mr. Trump's pressure campaign on Ukraine and growing calls for his removal. The House voted to charge Mr. Trump with high crimes and misdemeanors, with Republicans unanimously opposed. It was the third impeachment of an American president in history. The outcome in the Senate was never in doubt, as most Republicans quickly concluded that his actions did not warrant his removal. Legislating in a Pandemic As the pandemic spread to the Capitol, lawmakers raced to complete a $2.2 trillion stimulus law. By the end of 2020, nearly 10 percent of Congress had contracted the coronavirus, temporarily hospitalizing at least two lawmakers and forcing a number of lawmakers to quarantine.
This exemption was designed as a mechanism to ram through socialist policies like the Green New Deal and other ideas aimed at hurting American workers, families, and farmers, Smith said.
We don't have a crystal ball, but as journalists covering global health and development, we have a pretty good nose for emerging trends (with some help from our favorite expert sources).
11:05 PM: Numbers not looking good for Republicans in DeKalb.
(CNN) On January 3, when members of the 117th Congress raise their hands and swear their oaths, a significant shift will take place. The number of Republican women in the House will more than double from 13 to at least 28 (two races are pending litigation) . For a party historically known as pale, male and stale, this increase is particularly meaningful.
OCASIO-CORTEZ: It does. It does. Yeah. I have no problem saying that. Why? Because we have tried their approach for 40 years. For 40 years, we tried to let the private sector take care of it. They said, we got this, we can do this, the forces of the market are going to force us to innovate. Except for the fact that there's a little thing in economics called externalities, and what that means is that a corporation can dump pollution in the river and they don't have to pay for it, and taxpayers have to pay for cleaning up our air, cleaning up our water and saving the planet.
He said in a tweet, I believe it was yesterday, that he has a plan. What's the plan?
She made waves recently for saying in a tweet that President Trump is Saudi Arabia's bitch for announcing the U.S. will stand with Saudi Arabia, regardless of any intelligence community assessment on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's involvement in the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.
It helped Democrats that the 2020 Senate map put Republicans on the defensive. The GOP had to defend upward of 10 competitive seats, while Democrats were only in real danger of losing two incumbents. The sheer number of high-profile candidates stretched Republicans' resources thin.
Australia is on fire. And the summer there has only just begun. 2019 was a year of record heat and record drought. Today the temperature outside Sydney was 48.9°C, she wrote.
The Biden administration could remove or rewrite the rule, but it would take months, if not years. Because the rule gives the EPA administrator the power to override the limits on which scientific studies EPA regulators can use, the incoming administration could essentially sidestep the rule while it works to undo it.
At Phillips Station, a water measurement site near Lake Tahoe, officials on Thursday measured 25.5 inches (65 centimeters) of snow and a snow water equivalent of 9 inches (23 centimeters) — about 80 percent of average for the early January survey.
But short-sighted infrastructure decisions have also caused serious harm – from the demolition of urban neighborhoods for freeways in the 1950s and 1960s to the flooding of irreplaceable natural gems such as Arizona's Glen Canyon during the dam-building years of the mid-20th century.
Climate scientist Michael Mann, who was referred to in Jones' email about Mike's Nature trick,' said he hoped Wednesday's report would put the bogus, manufactured scandal behind us.

There's 350 million liquid fuel cars on the road today in the United States and most Americans don't buy a new car except every decade, says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the program on Energy Security and Climate Change at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Drew Caputo, vice president of litigation for lands, wildlife and oceans for the environmental firm Earthjustice, said in an interview that the administration's changes could be legally vulnerable because they would remove so many projects from federal review.

The 3.5-mile pipeline, known as the Potomac Pipeline, would bring natural gas from Pennsylvania to West Virginia, bisecting the narrowest slice of Maryland's panhandle and running beneath the Potomac River and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal in Western Maryland.
People here in San Antonio know him obviously…but, if you get out of Texas, and you ask an ordinary citizen on the street, and you say, Julian Castro, they'll probably say, who? said Johnny Arredondo, a member of the Republican Club of Bexar County.
But the generational chasm became apparent when the 74-year-old ranking Democrat, Rep. Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota, took the mic, rubbed something out of his eyes and announced, Um. I don't know where to start. He explained that he was still uncomfortable with President Franklin D. Roosevelt's decision to abolish the gold standard in 1933, and liked this new idea no better. They're just creating this money out of nowhere! he said.
When taxes on the very wealthy are lowered, but raised for ordinary citizens to meet budgetary demands (whether from far-off Brussels or from well-off financiers), it should come as no surprise that some are angry. The Yellow Vests' refrain speaks to their concerns: The government talks about the end of the world. We are worried about the end of the month.
Shaul Bassi: Absolutely. I think that it was more heartfelt. I think a lot of people this time felt, you know, 'This might not be there forever.' I think this is what has perhaps changed, that a lot of us are feeling, 'Well, we cannot take this for granted.'
While some companies are making strides in reducing the environmental impact associated with producing our favorite mobile devices, hanging onto your phone for longer than two years is one way to make a difference.
In 2014, Dallas had only 116 homicides this year after the far left, John Creuzot promise not to prosecute thefts valued at less than 750 bucks. The murder rate went up to over 200.
So I'm really looking forward to just getting stuff done. And for what it's worth, I think the media has really exaggerated the dissension within the Democratic caucus. Obviously there are ideological differences. But when I speak to the 15 members of the freshman class, we just want to work together to get things done.
If Mitch McConnell and the Republicans hold onto the Senate they will try to do to Joe and Kamala exactly like they tried to do to President (Barack) Obama, Ossoff told the crowd Monday ahead of Biden's appearance. We have too much good work to do for things to be ground to a halt in our nation's capital.
O'Donnell: All right. Senator Bernie Sanders, thank you for being here.
The rally was the capstone of a past week the White House spent holding events, putting out press releases and otherwise seeking headlines intended to highlight what it views as the new administration's successes in the last 100 days. Even before his rally Saturday night, the president himself seemed keenly aware that the day is historically a symbolic moment for the media, pundits, the country and perhaps even much of the world to assess his young presidency.
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: This is up to the scientists and the doctors as to whether there is a problem. They all around the world say that it is in some places and has enormous potential to become one elsewhere. And it is just ignorant and irresponsible to not stand up and be the leader and say, we don't know, but we have to prepare for the fact that if it is, we have the medicines and the structure, and the knowledge to deal with it.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I do want to open up the government but the goal is not to open up the government. The goal is to fix a broken immigration system to bring reality to this table. That ICE is not the problem, it's the solution. The goal is to repair a damaged, broken immigration system. It's to implement policies--
MARGARET BRENNAN: But the President really seemed to shoot that down in the Rose Garden the other day.
The result has been a negative reputation among environmentalists and minuscule investment in a technology that most serious climate models suggest will be necessary in the years to come, said Ryan Hanna, an assistant research scientist at UC San Diego's Center for Energy Research who was the study's lead author.

Several politicos and pundits from both sides of the aisle returned to familiar refrains like this isn't America and that riots don't represent who we are. Yet history tells us another story.
Some of the folks in the corporate media are getting a little bit nervous, Sanders said at a rally Sunday afternoon in Houston before an enthusiastic crowd of more than 6,200 at the University of Houston. And they say Bernie can't beat Trump.
Despite three recounts and no evidence of widespread fraud, Loeffler and Perdue decided to join the President in supporting an objection to Congress' certification of the Electoral College's results on Wednesday in a final, deluded display of devotion to Trump supporters.
And if no one points it out, if no one tells NHTSA that, hey, we've got a big problem here, we need you to act, lots of times they won't. They've got all sorts of cases and you have to remember, too, that NHTSA is also quite dependent on reports from motorists. This is their lifeblood. They can't act on something if they don't know about it. They may say that this problem is underreported by consumers and it just didn't seem like there was a trend here at all that they needed to act on. WATERS: All right, Ed Garsten up there in Detroit. And now in the committee room, the chairman of the subcommittee on oversight investigation, the Republican from Michigan, Fred Upton has the floor. (JOINED IN PROGRESS) REP. FRED UPTON (R), MICHIGAN: ... to ask tough questions of the witnesses to further illuminate what can be gleaned from the information with hopes of what we do here today can help save lives tomorrow. I would like to note that I'm not happy to learn that Secretary Slater apparently has refused to participate in this hearing today despite him being just down the street. As secretary of transportation, it is his responsibility to oversee NHTSA's role in the life and safety for Americans traveling on Americans' highways. This is the people's business, and if he can be with Cokie Roberts on the Sunday talk shows, he certainly ought to be here before Republicans and Democrats searching for the truth on a workday.

I'm not sure exactly what happens to him when he is in a room surrounded by the people he had made a career advocating for, but something does click and there is a certain humanity that comes into play that isn't seen on the broader stages, Salgado said.
The murder of Specialist Vanessa Guillén shocked our conscience and brought attention to deeper problems, stated Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.
Sea level rise is caused by warming of the ocean and melting from glaciers and ice sheets. The research, based on 25 years of satellite data, shows that pace has quickened, mainly from the melting of massive ice sheets. It confirms scientists' computer simulations and is in line with predictions from the United Nations, which releases regular climate change reports.
Along the way, younger, more liberal Democrats progressives often saw him as a compromise. They felt he relied too much on high-dollar fundraisers to be trusted to change the system. They watched him struggle to amass minority support. And they felt his Medicare for all who want it plan, his sliding scale for college tuition relief, and his relatively less expensive plan to combat climate change didn't go far enough.

In 2006, Inslee, then one of Washington's 10 U.S. representatives, spearheaded an effort to set a renewable portfolio standard in the Evergreen State. In 2007, he co-authored a book called Apollo's Fire: Igniting America's Clean Energy Economy, which, as the title implies, laid out a vision for bolstering the renewable-energy and electric-vehicle industries. In 2009, he co-founded the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition in the House of Representatives. Later that year, he sponsored the federal cap-and-trade bill known as Waxman-Markey.

Rice, who has built a strong base of support over the last five years, has not faced a primary challenger since she made her inaugural bid in 2014. The former Nassau County prosecutor's votes in favor of environmental legislation and against deregulatory efforts earned her a 100 percent score on the League of Conservation Voters' 2017 ranking. Her lifetime score is 95 percent.

Two people familiar with talks said that U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer had told lawmakers he wanted to include Democrats at the event but that his efforts to do so were unsuccessful. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private conversations.
But Biden opened the door in his own speech on Tuesday night.
Majorities see the leading five candidates as being consistent in what they stand for. Sanders does best on this (88%), followed by Buttigieg (80%), Klobuchar (75%), Warren (70%) and Biden (66%). The Sanders campaign's questions about Biden's past votes seem to have resonance with Sanders' own backers; Democratic voters who say they have given a lot of consideration to a candidate's past votes in Congress pick Sanders as their first choice. But relatively few Democrats (30%) make past votes a top criterion in deciding who to support.
In a speech to a 2015 conference organized by the Heartland Institute, which has railed against restrictions on emissions from fossil fuels, Happer scoffed at these fears, calling them an Alice-in-Wonderland fantasy. When I got into this area and started learning about it, I learned that when I looked at CO2, I should assume that it caused harmful warming, extreme weather, Noah's flood, you know. I remember thinking, 'Are they mad?' 
When the mercury's rising in your thermometer, it may also be rising in the ocean.
In late November, Letitia James, New York City's public advocate, held a first-of-its-kind public hearing on climate change. Activists, students and voters packed an auditorium at the Borough of Manhattan Community College for hours, recounting stories of asthma exacerbated by air pollution and homes flooded by rising waters.
EDMUNDS: In some of the places where we were, by August of 2017, when we were last there before the hurricane, one-tenth of the sea floor or less was covered by live coral. And now 3 or 4 percent of that has been killed. And the rate of recovery will be slow. Corals grow very slowly. So probably by next summer, we'll start to see baby corals settling on the reef. And some of those will survive and produce the reefs of tomorrow. But whether they do that or not will depend on these progressive changes in the environmental conditions and whether or not there are further Category 5 storms in 2018 or 2019 or 2020.
There's so many smart products out there; you could end up with a dozen or more apps for each of the smart components, Korthauer said. With Wiser… you've got one app that literally will connect your entire electrical system with everything that you plugged into it.
Nashua: Three employees were sickened by a cleaning chemical at an Amazon warehouse, fire officials said Thursday. Firefighters in Nashua responded at about 4 a.m. for a report of a chemical reaction that happened while a crew was mixing chemicals, Deputy Fire Chief Karl Gerhard told WMUR-TV. The major symptoms we saw were respiratory-related, scratchiness, coughing-related issues, Gerhard said. There was possibly an unknown chemical in the bucket already that they were putting the chemicals in, and that caused the reaction. The building was evacuated and the employees were taken to a hospital. Two were treated and released. A fire department report said after the building had been ventilated, crews monitored the building using air and chemical metering devices and found no abnormal readings. OSHA and the state fire marshal's office were notified.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you suggesting that if the president did not abide by a resolution if it were to be passed by the House, by Congress, that you would potentially add that to articles of impeachment against him?

HHS, through its Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, responded to The Post's questions about its Anniston operations with a statement noting the office's staff members have a long-standing relationship with the disaster preparedness center and were familiar with its capabilities. The statement also said the federal agency was considering the facility as a contingency location and decided during discussions with local officials that the site would not actually be needed.
Here's the problem, the War Powers Act is not covered under that. This is a president taking a self-defense action for our country, taking it directly to our enemy, taking it directly to someone who previous administrations said was a terrorist and was committing terrorist acts. He was not even supposed to be out of Iran. Think about this, under the old agreement, he was not even supposed to be traveling around like he was.
He blamed the state and federal environmental laws and regulations that make dams more difficult, and more expensive, to build. Until we change the environmental laws, construction is cost prohibitive, he told me.
We can re-open the government and continue to work through disagreements about policy, Schumer said. We can secure our border without an expensive, ineffective wall. And, we can welcome legal immigrants and refugees without compromising safety and security. The symbol of America should be the Statue of Liberty, not a thirty-foot wall.

In contrast to surface data, these satellite data cover the whole Earth, are fully disclosed, and are not contaminated by poor maintenance and location of weather stations, changes from mercury to electronic measurement, and unexplained adjustments.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Joe Biden is blanketing the airwaves this morning. We know from your campaign that you raised forty six million dollars in February. That's a significant number. What do you think that does for you going into Super Tuesday? What edge?
On Friday, the company announced it would bereviewing structural options to best position the company to meet customer and operational needs. In addition, PG&E said it is searching for new directors for its board to augment its existing expertise in safety.
One reason for this mindset, says Renzo Guinto, a Filipino physician and a member of The Lancet Planetary Health's editorial board, is the colonial roots of tropical medicine. In the colonial era, European researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers — not the people living in those places — from getting sick.
So here we are. This week, the House will have a record number of women -- at least 141 -- and the change isn't cosmetic. A number of the new GOP electeds are already emphasizing bipartisanship. Republican Nancy Mace of South Carolina told CNN's Dana Bash that this year's record turnout is a real referendum on Washington DC and a reminder to politicians on both sides of the aisle to find areas where they can work together. People are struggling. And she added that they need solutions.
The president's plan calls for a 6 percent increase in spending by the Department of Homeland Security, including $2.6 billion to begin work on a planned border wall. The White House is also asking Congress to devote $1.5 billion to the wall in the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.
An ad released in the final hours of the campaign on Monday squarely focused on trying to split Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) from President Donald Trump. Georgia Gov.

Droegemeier is the first meteorologist to hold this position. Many researchers expressed hope Droegemeier might give them a louder voice in Trump's decision-making process. He did not face significant opposition during his Senate confirmation process, though it took lawmakers months to vote.
Leaders must pull together in crisis
Last year, the Senate confirmed Alex Azar, a former executive at the pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. On Jan. 1, former Boeing executive Patrick Shanahan took over as acting secretary at the Department of Defense after Secretary James Mattis' abrupt resignation. The next day, David Bernhardt, a former oil lobbyist and No. 2 at the Department of the Interior, became acting secretary when the agency's boss, Ryan Zinke, stepped down amid mounting ethics probes.
The Green New Deal sends a positive message of what government can do, for this generation of citizens and the next. It can deliver today what those who are suffering today need most — good jobs. And it can deliver the protections from climate change that are needed for the future.
Meanwhile, Democrat Jon Ossoff holds a tight lead against Sen. David Perdue, but the race remains too close to call, according to Fox News' Decision Desk.
Given this reality—that people won't willingly stay poor while wealth sits under their feet—one might think that Western Greens would be well advised to work with Brazil, so that the nation's mineral wealth can be developed responsibly. That is, resources could be mined using best practices, such that environmental damage is minimized and then the land completely reclaimed. After all, mine reclamation has made huge advances; with proper techniques, the wealth can be extracted and the land made as good as ever.
Many of the changes face court challenges and can be reversed by executive action or by lengthier bureaucratic process. But undoing them would take time and effort by the incoming Biden administration, which also has ambitious goals to fight climate-damaging fossil fuel emissions and lessen the impact of pollutants on lower-income and minority communities.
MEREDITH: Democrats don't buy it and are calling for Barr to step down.
There's a commitment to fight against all new fossil fuel infrastructure, including references to revoking existing city permits, Beauchamp said. We've been pretty disappointed with the city's response to this so far. That's been a thing that the current administration says is a nonstarter.
Bad News was written two Novembers ago, but I think it's only gotten more timely as release day was approaching. I wrote it to be heard almost from the perspective of Mother Earth — like, I'm on fire, I can barely keep it turning. But it's also all of us in this moment of relentless, 'Yo, can I catch a break? Please?' But we have to keep marching forward and waking up the next day and going back at it. ... Ride With Me is another climate change song. It's classic gospel sort of imagery — the train is at the station, you can hear the diesel humming and we can't afford to miss it. It's an issue I think a lot about, and stress out a lot about.

Our ultimate end goal isn't a Select Committee, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted as the panel was being formed. Our goal is to treat Climate Change like the serious, existential threat it is by drafting an ambitious solution on the scale necessary - aka a Green New Deal - to get it done. A weak committee misses the point & endangers people.

It is true that President Ronald Reagan utilized executive action in 1987 to grant a limited deportation reprieve to certain spouses and young children of immigrants. But his action was a logical and direct extension of, not a departure from, an existing amnesty law Congress had already passed. His exemption and a subsequent extension by his successor, President George H. W. Bush, were later incorporated into a new law passed by Congress. The point is instructive. The actions by Reagan and Bush are not a supporting precedent for Mr. Obama, but an important limiting principle of presidential authority.

All this is just a glimpse of what one part of one big policy difference—on fiscal policy—between the two parties in power would mean for the most of Americans in the immediate and near future. Over the longer run, it means much more. For it is now well-established that America is structurally set up for minority rule. And that minority is the Republican Party.

Last year Trump ordered Perry to take steps to help struggling coal and nuclear power plants, which have trouble competing against cheaper natural gas and renewable energy. No such plan has been carried out so far.

On its website, DSA blames, in part, the globalization of capital for racism, sexism, homophobia, and environmental degradation.

just the courts that decide this. Congress has a role in this as well.
While Sanders has come under criticism from some opponents because he identifies as a democratic socialist, majorities of Democratic primary voters in California and Texas have at least a somewhat favorable view of socialism, and it is viewed more positively than capitalism. This is related to vote: Sanders' supporters have generally more positive views of socialism than do Biden's.

Scientifically, [six] would be a better description of the strength of 200 mph (320km/h) storms, and it would also better communicate the well-established finding now that climate change is making the strongest storms even stronger, he said.
Our Constitution clearly delineates a separation of powers. Congress is vested with writing laws and the President is charged with executing those laws. This is especially true when it comes to immigration.

We will increase taxes on pollution. Electricity is now a cleaner energy form than gas. Our climate change levy paid for by companies taxes electricity at a higher rate. So as another step towards equalising the rates and encouraging efficiency, from April 2022 I'm freezing the levy on electricity and raising it on gas, he announced.
The BJP did not put up a chief ministerial candidate, and its star campaigners including Home Minister Amit Shah and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Ajay Bisht, who goes by the name Yogi Adityanath, relied almost solely on misinformation and preyed on Hindu insecurities to drum up support for the party.
As the Congress gavels in for the 116th session the early votes will be the usual ones — establishing the House rules and electing the House speaker, presumably California Democrat Nancy Pelosi. But the new majority will quickly pivot Thursday to a pair of bills to fund the parts of the government that have been shuttered in the dispute over money for President Donald Trump's border wall with Mexico.
Whitaker also found an American who'd made the trek from the United States to Austria. Howard Morris, a librarian from Minnesota, dreamt of skating the Elfstedentocht when he began speed skating. A Dutch friend told him he'd have to go to Austria to find ice. It's the reality of the times, says Morris. I know some people fear that the whole tradition of skating will die out because of the change in winters.
These conversations began with the social scientist Francis Fukuyama, who famously proclaimed the end of history just as the Cold War was coming to an end. What Fukuyama meant was that a single form of government — liberal democracy — was on its way to triumph over competing models like communism. A quarter century later, the forms of democracy remain in place around the world. But many are becoming less liberal. Russia has an elected president and parliament but has cracked down on dissent and the press. Turkey has also cracked down on the press, and in a recent democratic vote chose to concentrate power in the hands of one man.
The spokesperson also emphasized that the challenges at Fort Hood forced us to take a critical look at our systems, our policies, and ourselves.

Pelosi, who is the daughter and the sister of two former mayors of Baltimore, began her speech by addressing the government shutdown.
Research backs them up. In a 2016 study by the Center for American Women and Politics, a large majority of 83 Representatives used personal anecdotes to describe how they and their colleagues are more collaborative and results-oriented than men. With notable exceptions, the cross-party women-to-women partnerships have been impressive, especially given the stunning disparity (about four to one) between the Democratic and Republican percentages of women in the two parties. From that point of view, even as an ardent Democrat myself, I see the value of increasing the number of Republican women in the House. What I know is that women at the edge of a political spectrum have told me, in dozens of conversations, that they can often find common cause with women on the opposite edge.

13) The presence of physical barriers in cities like El Paso has led to fewer people coming over the border to commit petty crimes or bring loads of drugs on their backs. The criminal organizations in the area shifted toward corrupting U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials to smuggle harder drugs.
The federal minimum wage rate has remained at $7.25 per hour for the past decade, though 29 states and Washington have set it higher. (At the beginning of January, more than 20 states raised base pay even higher).

Gabriel Sterling, a Republican who works for Raffensperger as the state's voting system implementation manager, told Fox News on Monday that the spurious claims of voter fraud spread by Trump and his allies appear to be depressing Republican voter turnout in Tuesday's election.
The Republicans, not surprisingly, are fighting and will continue to fight against all of the structural reforms that would democratize this country, and that would thereby vastly reduce their chances of holding national power. Together with the policy differences between the parties, this reality will remain the long-run, material basis for an increasing partisan divide, until these structural problems are resolved.
Inslee faces some critics on climate change. In February, 13 young people in Washington, ages seven to 17, sued the state, alleging Inslee and the agencies under his control violated the constitutional rights of a generation by failing to curb greenhouse gas emissions. One plaintiff ― Jamie Margolin, a 17-year-old activist in Seattle who founded the youth climate group Zero Hour ― railed against Inslee in a series of tweets last week accusing the governor of fighting tooth & nail against the lawsuit, which a state judge tossed in August.
Brian Hoskins, director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at London's Imperial College said: It seems to me that we've had a lot of reviews, and yet again the science has come out as remarkably robust. However, it is clear that lessons have to be learnt about the conduct of that science.

The results suggest the overwhelming popularity of Green New Deal-style policies could propel upsets in districts beyond the diverse, left-leaning urban bastions that gave rise to socialist darlings like Ocasio-Cortez and others in her cohort. The findings also indicate potential challenges of selling moderate Democrats from more conservative districts on the populist branding of policies packaged in a Green New Deal.

Our goal must be to create a financial system and an economy that works for all Americans, not just a handful of billionaires
Broad scientific consensus says the Earth's climate is warming, and that humans are accelerating that process though the burning of fossil fuels. Climate change threatens the health and well-being of the American people by causing increasing extreme weather, changes to air quality, the spread of new diseases by insects and pests, and changes to the availability of food and water, the NCA researchers said.
The contrast that is interesting to me is between a kind of fire and brimstone Christianity. 'You are damned unless you change your ways' which is kind of the climate conversation. And then, on the other hand, you have this older Catholic, particularly Franciscan, from St. Francis who was all about, hey, birds. I love the birds. I'm gonna write to the emperor and ask him to put grain out in the fields on Christmas Day to feed my friends the larks, Franzen said. His approach to the world was love, love, love, love, love. And I think for meaningful action of any kind, love is a much better motivator than fear of damnation.
The most established ETF to play this trend is the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF ICLN, -2.75% , which covers companies in every geography and in every segment of alternative energy and boasts almost $5 billion in assets.

The prospect of reducing emissions by up to 28 percent from their 2005 levels—as the U.S. would be required to do under the Paris climate agreement—will require a radical shift. It would mean cutting emissions at nearly double the pace of their 2007-to-2015 decline. That prospect, while not impossible, would require an immediate policy shift or a technological breakthrough, Rhodium found.

And when you look at the way that Latino voters here in Nevada know that they are under siege in this administration, talking to black voters who are sick and tired of the economic disempowerment among the injustices of systemic racism and looking for a president who can actually bring change to Washington and, more than anything, looking for a nominee who can defeat Donald Trump.

Cars, large buildings and well-tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space.
Democratic lawmakers recognized the inadequacy of their efforts back in the spring. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) began referring to phases of the legislative response ― CARES was Phase Three (Congress, it turns out, had actually passed two previous phases of relief so negligible as to have already been forgotten). When the next bill merely topped-up an almost instantly exhausted small business relief program, lawmakers changed Phase Four to Phase Three-and-a-Half. And when no further relief came from Washington for several more months, Pelosi stopped talking about phases.
I will also say this, Chris -- I was very concerned by President Trump's steadfast and public refusal to embrace the conclusion of our own intelligence community that Vladimir Putin's Russia had interfered in our 2016 election. There's been a confusing and at times even alarming tendency on the part of President Trump to complement President Putin and to do things like his abrupt announcement of a withdrawal from Syria that led his own secretary of defense to resign, that has led many of us to question his closeness to and his affinity for President Putin.

In the study, authors Nic Lewis and Judith Curry looked at actual temperature records and compared them with climate change computer models. What they found is that the planet has shown itself to be far less sensitive to increases in CO2 than the climate models say. As a result, they say, the planet will warm less than the models predict, even if we continue pumping CO2 into the atmosphere. As Lewis explains: Our results imply that, for any future emissions scenario, future warming is likely to be substantially lower than the central computer model-simulated level projected by the (United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), and highly unlikely to exceed that level.

Though in his announcement Trump referred to himself as someone who cares deeply about the environment, he has signaled, more broadly, that fighting climate change is not a priority for his administration. He has denied the existence of climate change and appointed as the head of the EPA a man who doesn't accept the overwhelming scientific consensus that humans are causing global warming by releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. And he has already overturned several Obama-era efforts to reduce emissions.
When it comes to the question of $2,000 payments and more comprehensive COVID-19 relief, such as expanded unemployment benefits and aid to state and local governments, progressives stand to serve as allies of Biden against both Republicans and the handful of conservative Democrats who are already indicating that they plan to break with Biden on the urgency of economic action.

Finally, another craze that's been alarming dietitians is going heavier than needed on protein. With keto, paleo and now the carnivore diets flourishing in a world growing more distrustful of carbs, protein has been crowned the new nutritional king. However, not all protein is created equal, which is why the FDA requires the Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Score to be used when declaring protein claims on packaged foods, Peacock said. This can be an easy step for manufacturers to miss, making their claims misleading.

When all the numbers are crunched, 2020 will be one of the warmest if not the warmest year on record in the Arctic. This is especially true in northern Asia near the Barents, Kara, Laptev and Siberian Seas, where parts of the region averaged a remarkable 10 degrees Fahrenheit above normal.
Ever since William Barr became attorney general, critics have complained he acts more like the president's personal lawyer than the nation's top law enforcement officer. But this week, Barr said Mr. Trump's comments and tweets about criminal cases make it impossible for him to do his job.
That means we have got to end, once and for all, the scheme that is nothing more than a free insurance policy for Wall Street, the policy of too big to fail.

The moments that defined the 116th Congress. The most diverse Congress in the nation's history was sworn in two years ago during the longest government shutdown. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times WASHINGTON — On Sunday, the 116th Congress ended much as it began — filled with anticipation yet bitterly divided — having lurched through a cycle of once-in-a-generation moments packed into two years. The shuttering of the government for more than a month. The impeachment and trial of a president. The deadliest pandemic in a century and a multitrillion-dollar federal response. Even with a few legislative accomplishments, partisan gridlock forced lawmakers to punt on their hopes that they could be the ones to do difficult things. Still, Congress made history of a different kind, ushering in a new era of governing through technology during the pandemic. Here are some of the moments that defined the 116th Congress. Swearing In During a Shutdown With one of the largest classes of newly elected lawmakers in congressional history, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California became the first person in more than 60 years to reclaim the speakership after having lost it. Within hours of her election as speaker, Ms. Pelosi began calling votes on legislation to reopen government agencies that had been closed since late December 2018, as Mr. Trump demanded more money for the border wall that had been his signature campaign promise. But Senate Republicans refused to consider the measure, even before it cleared the House.
Different hiking explorations offer the opportunity to see (and even sometimes interact with) a variety of animals. On the half-day Racchi hike, one of the easier explorations offered, guests pass grazing sheep, foraging pigs and pairs of sturdy bulls plowing fields. Donkeys, especially youngsters, are sometimes just as curious about visitors as visitors are about them.
It's concerning that our advisory council has been unable to meet for over a year, said Scott Braden, a member of the Rocky Mountain RAC who is a wilderness and public lands advocate at Conservation Colorado. Secretary Zinke has said that local input is important for BLM to consider, and yet these councils, which provide just such input, have been sidelined.
Consider what worked for them in November. Democrats owe their new House majority less to the celebrity liberals getting so much attention than to enterprising moderates such as Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Colin Allred in Texas.
The African American vote cannot be taken for granted, said Thigpen. Just the idea that we are a firewall, that our vote is already cemented. … I won't go so far as to say it's offensive, but I think it might be misconceived.

Leonard Leo told me he disputes the notion that the Constitution contains either conservative or progressive values, and he denies that originalism is rigged to reach conservative and libertarian results. The Constitution is a structural road map for how to ensure accountability and transparency in government, he said. And there are timeless values in it that are tied to the weaknesses of human nature and the danger of unlimited authority being vested in one person or a group of people. … You're practicing originalism appropriately when you're doing so without looking behind the curtain and trying to predetermine results.

Conventional wisdom holds that Republicans are more likely to nominate governors than are Democrats, but there's not a lot of evidence to support the claim. Yes, George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan both fit the model of big-state executives going national, but out of the 19 Republicans who have held the highest office only six were former governors. Of the 15 Democratic presidents seven, including two of the most consequential, Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, were former governors.
But a Democrat Super PAC has been very publicly behind a billboard campaign in Georgia with essentially the same message, as Breitbart News reported earlier in the campaign.

Quick question for you: How did Nancy Pelosi manage to get herself elected Speaker of the House once again? My understanding is/was that you need to receive a majority to win … 218 votes of the 435 total; but I caught part of a report on the radio wherein a pundit was stating (I think) that she received less than 218 and even had to have some Reps abstain from voting in order to have enough votes to win. Is this true? Can you win with less than 218? And if so, exactly how close was her 'by the skin of her teeth' victory anyway? – Bob Nelson, Norwell, Mass.

The comparison of this view to the United States' long history of anti-Catholic bigotry has been disputed. Actually, it is exactly the same as this history in every important respect. A 19th-century bigot would have regarded Catholicism as fundamentally illiberal — a backward faith characterized by clerical despotism — and thus inconsistent with America's democratic rules. The same attitude seems currently present in the U.S. Senate.
An early test will come Tuesday, when voters in Georgia go to the polls for two runoff elections. Biden carried the state in November, and if Democrats win both races — a difficult feat — his party will control the Senate by the narrowest of margins, giving him far more ability to drive the agenda in Congress than if Republicans hold the chamber.
Their election will put an end to the block in Washington on the $2,000 stimulus check, Biden said at a rally in Atlanta.

The pandemic killed the momentum, understandably. But it's becoming clear that COVID-19 is not a separate problem, but an interconnected one. The same drivers of the novel coronavirus, and other emerging infectious diseases, are also the drivers of biodiversity loss. These include the wildlife trade that allowed COVID-19 to jump to humans, as well as land-use change and climate change that bring people and wild animals into close contact.

Critics argue the administration's single-minded focus on hard power is short-sighted, and could ultimately be detrimental to national security.

I've seen it in the Des Moines mother who wrote me that her medical bills had become so expensive that she and her parents sold their homes to pay for her 24-hour care.

Mr. Chairman, we're going to hear a lot today about Firestone didn't know there was a problem, Ford didn't know there was a problem, NHTSA didn't know there was a problem until a Houston television station told them there was. The documents the committee has received, along with the news reports, indicate that all these parties knew a great deal more in 1998 and 1999 about tire failures than the Houston television station did. They just ignored it. We also are going to hear from a number of witnesses that the number of failures was so small that no one could have been expected to pay attention. Yes, the numbers begin small, but because the propensity of the SUVs to rollover when a tire fails, the cost in deaths and injuries was inordinately high and increasingly at an alarming rate. Both Ford and Firestone should have known and should have watched this particular vehicle more closely. With less than 6,000 vehicles in the entire country of Saudi Arabia, there were 18 accidents in Saudi Arabia, including seven fatalities in 1999. The U.S. had four. And there was another large group in Venezuela. Despite what anyone says about the conditions in all these countries, one fact remains: Other tires under same conditions did not fail. That should have alert everyone. It alerted the State Farm Insurance Company, it alerted the Center for Auto Safety. Unfortunately Ford, Firestone and NHTSA failed to act.
The paper warns that climate change could eventually lead to such events every year.

CARLSON: So you started on the New York City force, at the Police Department when New York was dangerous. You took over running the department when it had become safer, it was still safer after you left and now you're seeing it move in the opposite direction.

If in the past year (or the past decade) the world began to understand how dangerous climate change is, it certainly didn't act like it, Elizabeth Kolbert, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Sixth Extinction, writes in The New Yorker.

Germany's Deutsche Welle reported that the State Department had made the change at the end of last year without notifying Brussels.

It came from a paper we published in 1980. The title was Synoptic-Dynamic Climatology of the 'Bomb.'  I was a graduate student at the time [at MIT], and my adviser, who was the lead author, Frederick Sanders, actually coined the term. He had quite a bit of experience making forecasts for cyclones in the North Atlantic that were developing very rapidly. Oftentimes, we'd even say explosively. Given their explosive development, it was an easy path to take to just call these systems bombs.

The jet stream is a river of fast-flowing air in the upper atmosphere which guides storms from one place to another. Just like waves in the ocean, it undulates up and down, from north to south, as it flows around the Earth. These undulations are known as atmospheric waves. And while most of the energy flows around the globe horizontally, some of the wave energy can move vertically, transferring energy upward or downward, especially when those waves are amplified.

Flagstaff: All students in the Flagstaff school district will be provided with iPads under a loan program that starts this week with middle and high school students and continues with elementary school students at the start of the next school year. Flagstaff Unified School District voters in 2018 approved a bond measure to provide $10.6 million to pay for the tablets, cases and other accessories. The district won't require students to use the iPads, but officials say opting out could affect the potential of classroom learning, the Arizona Daily Sun reports. Students and their parents have been asked to sign a new loan agreement, to review an existing agreement on responsible use of technology and to pay a nonrefundable $25 annual device protection plan fee. Scholarships for the fee are available for families in need.

Pence welcomes lawmakers' push to overturn the election. Eleven Republican senators and senators-elect said they would join Senator Josh Hawley this week in challenging the results of the presidential election. Credit... Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times WASHINGTON — Vice President Mike Pence signaled support on Saturday for a Republican bid to overturn the election in Congress this week, after 11 Republican senators and senators-elect said that they would vote to reject President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory when the House and the Senate meet to formally certify it. The announcement by the senators — and Mr. Pence's move to endorse it — reflected a groundswell among Republicans to defy the results of the election and indulge President Trump's attempts to remain in power with false claims of voting fraud. Every state in the country has certified the election results after verifying their accuracy, many following postelection audits or hand counts. Judges across the country, and a Supreme Court with a conservative majority, have rejected nearly 60 attempts by Mr. Trump and his allies to challenge the results. And neither Mr. Pence nor any of the senators who said they would vote to invalidate the election has made a specific allegation of fraud, instead offering vague suggestions that some wrongdoing might have occurred and asserting that many of their supporters believe that it has. The senators' opposition to certifying Mr. Biden's election will not change the outcome.
That's right: the Rev. Raphael Warnock, the Democrat nominee for one of Georgia's U.S. Senate seats—both of which are up for grabs in Tuesday's runoffs—is running advertisements trying to depress the turnout of his opponent's base. The voter suppression effort seems to be an indication of where everyone knows this race will be decided: by President Trump's supporters. Do they follow his guidance and show up to back Loeffler and Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) on Tuesday? Or do they do as the Democrats want them to and stay home? It's anybody's guess, but a lot rides on whether traditional GOP base voters turn out on election day in Georgia or if they sit this one out.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., that would put the government in charge of the entire health care industry—at a cost of $32 trillion, according to estimates from the Mercatus Center. And she has proposed creating multiple other trillion-dollar government programs, like a federal jobs guarantee that would pay anyone who wants a government job a living wage and other basic income programs, which are designed to pay lower-income and non-working people money, even if they are able-bodied and could work.
Amy Schumer is weighing in on the allegations against friend and fellow comedian Aziz Ansari stemming from a viral story about a woman who says he coerced and pressured her for sex.
In June, the state's fire agency, Cal Fire, determined that PG&E power equipment was responsible for sparking at least a dozen major fires across Northern California in 2017. And now, regulators are investigating whether PG&E equipment sparked November's Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive in state history.

But the cost and death tolls are expected to climb as new data on Puerto Rico's post-hurricane destruction emerge. The official body count after Hurricanes Maria and Irma ransacked the island territory and destroyed its electrical grid sits at 64, but an analysis by The New York Times pegged the figure at 1,052, and climbing.

BECCS at such a scale would lead to millions of square miles of forest loss and large pressures on biodiversity, the study found. Meanwhile, the huge plantations would require tens of millions of tons of nitrogen fertilizer that would alter flow of this chemical around the Earth, and huge amounts of water — over a trillion tons of it each year.

It's rush hour on a November evening in Washington's busiest regional rail hub, but swarming commuters must yield to a much more potent tide. The Federalist Society has taken over the Main Hall of Union Station for its annual black-tie gala. The stone walls of the vast, vaulted concourse are bathed in pale red and blue, while larger-than-life white spotlight cameo silhouettes of James Madison's head — the society's trademark — crown the columns and glow on video screens. Two hundred and twenty sold-out tables, each set for 10, await the throng funneling through a block-long tent, where $200-a-plate tickets are checked; inside, exclamations of celebration and reunion echo and blend into a deafening roar.

Former defense secretaries warn: Using the military to settle the election would be 'unlawful' and 'unconstitutional.' In an op-ed, all 10 living former defense secretaries call for a smooth transition between administrations as President Trump refuses to accept his defeat in the November election. Credit... Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times All 10 living former defense secretaries warned in an op-ed on Sunday against involving the military in election disputes and urged leaders at the Defense Department to facilitate a smooth transition with the incoming administration. The op-ed, published by The Washington Post, was an extraordinary public statement from a group of officials who served presidents from both parties. Its signatories included President Trump's two Senate-confirmed defense secretaries, James N. Mattis and Mark T. Esper, as well as former Vice President Dick Cheney. The former defense secretaries weighed in with one voice as Mr. Trump continues to make baseless claims about the election and refuses to recognize his defeat. Our elections have occurred, they wrote. Recounts and audits have been conducted. Appropriate challenges have been addressed by the courts. Governors have certified the results. And the Electoral College has voted. The time for questioning the results has passed; the time for the formal counting of the Electoral College votes, as prescribed in the Constitution and statute, has arrived.

Another proposal is to build the Sites Reservoir in the foothills west of the small town of Maxwell, just over an hour north of Sacramento. As noted earlier, the Sites Reservoir would store 500,000 acre-feet of off-stream water, meaning that it would not dam an active river, but rather be a site for water from other sites to be stored as available and used as needed. Proponents argue that it would contribute to environmental quality as well as the state's storage capacity.
Rebekah Mercer, the second of Robert and Diana Mercer's three daughters, has arguably become even more powerful, with direct ties to Trump senior strategist Steve Bannon. She ran the pro-Trump super PAC Make America Number 1 and served on the Trump transition team.

What's needed in 2021 is for nations to take aggressive action toward transformative change that addresses the linked needs of people and nature. In September, 64 world leaders signed The Leaders' Pledge for Nature, committing to reverse biodiversity loss by tackling pollution, putting climate and the environment at the heart of pandemic recovery plans and building sustainable economies. All countries need to take all of the actions within this pledge. The world's nations must also commit to an aggressive agenda for systemic change when they meet at the United Nation's biodiversity conference in May.

In 2020, with Trump controlling the party, boorish insults and all, and the polls predicting an enormous gender gap , the GOP had few options. They recruited women to run and funded their campaigns. When women voters left, women candidates ran -- and women won.

He made the announcement during a campaign block party on Sunday while campaigning in South Carolina, according to The Associated Press. Progressive candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have released competing plans to hike the minimum wage to $15 per hour.
It was just one slap in the face after another; it was horrific, she said. I would like to see a complete investigation that isn't only focused on sexual trauma because there are a lot more issues at that base. It needs drastic oversight. We thought we had to be worried about sending our children to foreign soil, but it turns out we have to be more worried about them here.

As police cars blocked traffic, the group said in unison: It's the cops, it's the judges, it's the system, it's the president.
Biden has sidestepped questions about whether he supports doing away with keeping the 60-vote threshold, but several top Senate Democrats have signaled they back changing a rule that many of them once insisted was essential to the institution. There will be intense pressure on Biden and Democratic leaders to show they can pass some bills with GOP support, but if Senate Republicans stay largely unified to thwart the new administration's agenda, calls to eliminate the filibuster will increase.
On the campaign trail in 2019, Joe Biden said that fossil fuel executives should be held liable for climate change and those who refuse to take responsibility should be jailed. We should be able to sue oil and gas companies just like we did the drug companies, just like we did with the tobacco companies, he said in a February debate. And on his campaign website, Biden pledged to strategically support ongoing plaintiff-driven climate litigation against polluters.
We need a better way to talk about eating animals, a way that doesn't ignore or even just shruggingly accept things like habits, cravings, family and history but rather incorporates them into the conversation. The more they are allowed in, the more able we will be to follow our best instincts. And although there are many respectable ways to think about meat, there is not a person on Earth whose best instincts would lead him or her to factory farming.
The substation in Marsh Harbor which feeds us the power's destroyed, Winslow said. And then, of course, you can see all the utility poles-- are pretty much destroyed.

And never overlook an opportunity to summon your party's single greatest unifier: Trump himself. There are no atheists in fox holes, but neither are there many free thinkers of any kind. The more your conference sees itself as under siege from Trump the easier it will be to keep it together.

What's needed is for nations to take aggressive action that addresses the linked needs of people and nature.
Sanders has made a $5.5 million ad buy in states that include South Carolina. Steyer has hired the chair of South Carolina's Legislative Black Caucus to serve as an adviser, a $10,000-per-month gig that drew criticism among those who found it curious that a campaign would be paying a state lawmaker while receiving his endorsement.
DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --that aren't reported yet. It's a big country three-- three hundred and forty million people, three hundred and thirty million people, so anyone's individual risk is-- is still very low. But we need to get those cases diagnosed and identified so we could start getting people quarantined and into treatment and prevent more spread. We need to start mitigating the implications of the spread. There was an analysis out today by Trevor Bradford, very good researcher out of the Hutch, looking at the genetic strains in Washington State. And by looking at the strains and the drift between the different strains for the people who have been diagnosed there, he's suggested that there's perhaps hundreds and maybe low thousands of cases. It's an interesting analysis. There probably are more cases. We have community spread now in Washington State, California, perhaps, Illinois, Oregon. So certainly hundreds of cases.

She is particularly helped by the emergence of her home state as an early primary. California Democrats will go to the polls on March 3rd as opposed to June, their traditional primary month. That puts the largest trove of Democratic delegates up for grabs four weeks after the Iowa Caucuses. If you can't play in California this time around, you can't play at all.
JOHNSON: Or during a crisis in Iran.
Doing that requires maintaining a distance from the election process, Lurie said. But the issue here is the public has the right to know, and the attorney general has this obligation towards the public. At the same time, he noted, he also has an obligation to the suspects, who have the right to a fair criminal proceeding and fair trial.
The study examined four new or updated Ocean Heat Content records — a fancy term for measuring how warm the ocean is, taking into account deeper water, not just surface temperatures — and finds the ocean warming is significantly higher than estimated in the last comprehensive report by the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2013.
Within the first 100 days of my administration, I will require the secretary of the Treasury Department to establish a Too-Big-to Fail list of commercial banks, shadow banks and insurance companies whose failure would pose a catastrophic risk to the United States economy without a taxpayer bailout.
Like most ranchers, Bradley and her husband have been largely accommodating of grizzly bears as their population has rebounded and they've spread from the mountains into the more-populated plains. They've started storing food for their cattle in a raised, bear-proof container. Neighbors have lined entire pastures with electric fencing. Bradley's daughter now knows not to leave the yard.
The election reduced the Liberals to a minority. They were entirely shut out of Alberta and Saskatchewan, where Liberal environmental and climate policies are widely blamed for gutting the energy industry.
The research, published in the journal Science, said that scientists found several inaccuracies with the way ocean temperatures were previously measured and that warming levels for the past few decades were actually greater than what scientists found in 2013.

LIASSON: That's right. His longtime friend Roger Stone, who is a self-described dirty trickster. I can't think of another president who's had a fixer and a dirty trickster in their orbit. But Roger Stone was invited - indicted. That increases the number of close associates to the president who have pled guilty or been indicted. Stone says he won't plead. He won't cooperate. He won't turn on the president. Maybe he's banking on a pardon. But what it seems like is that Robert Mueller is doing what most organized crime prosecutions do, working their way up the food chain, starting with small fry like Papadopoulos and then going up the ladder to people who are closer to the president. So it was a bad day for the president. But on the other hand, his capitulation on the shutdown took some of the attention away from the Robert - Roger Stone indictment. It was a bit of a distraction.
Then when it weakens, it causes like a dam to burst, and the cold air heads south, said Judah Cohen, a winter storm expert for Atmospheric Environmental Research, a commercial firm outside Boston.
Before the airstrike, 33% of voters rated foreign policy as an important issue affecting their choice for president, according to a poll by Suffolk University/USA TODAY in December. It ranked below the economy, health care, immigration and gun control but ahead of impeachment and climate change.
According to Fox News, Ken Blackwell, a former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Human Rights Commission, also called the behavior of Harris and Hirono thuggish and what might be expected from third world dictators.
The governors' real priority, some skeptical observers claimed, was to secure enough water for the California Waterfix — the Twin Tunnels project that will divert water from the Sacramento River under the California Delta to be pumped south.
There were several moments in 2018 when it was difficult to remain hopeful for any sort of meaningful action on climate change. The Trump administration has worked tirelessly to impede a transition to a green economy with actions ranging from opening the long-protected Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, to implementing tariffs on imported solar panels, to the president's own denial that humans are causing unprecedented warming ― despite his own government's comprehensive report stating the opposite.
Sanders, an independent from Vermont, has increasingly gone on the attack against Biden, calling his record weak and placing foreign policy atop his critique.

The recent influx of Democratic women into politics was spurred dramatically four years ago by a flagrant misogynist's defeat of one of the most competent presidential candidates in our history. The subsequent Women's March further fueled the surge. EMILY's List was deluged with women streaming through the cracks in the glass ceiling.
In addition to the litigation, officials said they expect to divest up to $5 billion in investments from as many as 190 companies with fossil fuel ties, even as they promised to maintain their fiduciary duty to New York's pensioners.
Climate change is real. We have a moral and economic responsibility in this country starting right now, she added.
Biden's support has not wavered, especially among people of color and disaffected whites — a coalition no other candidate can match. Once the nominating process gets past the white and unrepresentative states of Iowa and New Hampshire, the new America will show its power: States representing one-third of the United States population will vote on Super Tuesday, March 3. Biden is well positioned.
Sinks said he also worries that Tuesday's final rule deepens the broader attack on science by the Trump administration, and that it could have a lasting impact that goes beyond any single regulation.

Minnis and leaders of other island nations have proposed that the U.S. and European countries contribute to an insurance fund – think of it as a really rainy day fund – to help rebuild from future storms.
OCASIO-CORTEZ: Yeah. I think the first thing that we need to do is kind of break the mistaken idea that taxes pay for a hundred percent of government expenditure. It's just not how government expenditure works. We can recoup costs, but oftentimes you look at, for example, the GOP tax cut, which I think was an irresponsible use of government expenditure. But government projects are often financed by a combination of taxes, deficit spending and other kinds of investments - you know, bonds and so on.
MONIZ: Well, the labor unions who I think are very much aligned with the idea of low carbon but also understand we cannot strand too many assets and, frankly, strand too many workers with impractical, unrealizable objectives. We will jeopardize what has been, I think, the very significant movement of the large energy companies towards developing their new business models to function in a low-carbon world.

A wide chorus of voices had called for Trump to recommit to the Paris agreement: other world leaders and hundreds of scientists, of course, but also CEOs of major energy companies and other big U.S. corporations. Even many of Trump's own advisers support the deal, according to The New York Times.
Western monarchs generally follow a different migration pattern than eastern monarchs, which fly from the East Coast down to Mexico to overwinter.

The quarantine plan hastily hatched by the federal Department of Health and Human Services was soon scrapped by President Trump, who faced intense pushback from Alabama's congressional delegation, led by Republican Rep. Mike D. Rogers. Americans evacuated after falling ill aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan would not be coming to Anniston, a town of 22,000 people in north-central Alabama, after all. They would remain in the same Texas and California sites where they were taken after leaving the cruise ship.

I think that Georgia spoke very loudly in the last election, so it's very clear that we are an integral point of moving what needs to be moved forward.
As The Washington Post reported at the time, Trump was upset with what he saw as arrogance on the part of Tillerson: He was irked by rumors of disloyalty; some of the secretary's arguments on global situations involving Iran, climate change and North Korea; and Tillerson's visible frustration when overruled.
According to NOAA's assessment of the biggest U.S. weather disasters — those with an inflation-adjusted cost of a billion dollars or more — the economic toll rose from an average of $17.8 billion a year in the 1980s to over $81 billion a year in the 2010s.
Yes, but more for how long -- about 10 days -- the cold has lasted, than how cold it has been. On Tuesday, Boston tied its seven-day record for the most consecutive days at or below 20 degrees that was set exactly 100 years ago.
Yet new polling suggests white, suburban women in Rice's own southwestern Long Island district could turn on the Democrat if she refuses to back a Green New Deal, the umbrella term for the sweeping policy to combat climate change and overhaul the economy that Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has championed.

When it comes to climate change, we need to advance policies that don't ask Americans to choose between their jobs and clean air and water, Swalwell told Fox News this week. We can do that by greening the grid with investments in renewable energy and a wage and skills guarantee for any displaced worker.

Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have argued that the cost of inaction on climate change is unsustainable. According to Sanders, the proposed solutions -- infrastructure and investment -- would boost the U.S. economy as well during a time of widespread joblessness.
Sanders has pledged a $16.3 trillion environmental plan that would declare climate change a national emergency and calls for the U.S. to move to renewable energy across the economy until 2050. Warren wants to spend $3 trillion over 10 years to move the U.S. to 100% clean energy. And both are aggressive supporters of the Green New Deal, a sweeping plan to combat climate change.

Consumers can also take little comfort from Firestone's explanation of why it took so long to identify the Firestone failure problem. According to Firestone, the problem eluded them because manufacturers never properly analyzed data and personnel claims to identify defects or problems with tires. They say the university of claims data is simply too small. But a staff examination of the records, revealed since 1995 Firestone had reports on more than 1,600 lawsuits, property claims and personal injury claims involving their recalled tires. I must say I find it curious that Firestone did not regard 1,600 claims as significant when it took only 21 claims for State Farm Insurance Company to decide that a potential problem existed. Records available to the committee also indicate that some in Firestone, in apparent contradiction of its statements to committee staff and others, analyzed their claims dated 1998. These Firestone analyses show that the claims were especially high for ATX tires, and the claims were highest for tires produced at the Decatur, Illinois, plant. Contrary to Firestone's other assertions, at least one other American tire company, Goodyear, says it routinely looks at all its customer data, including claims data, to identify defect or failure trends with its tires. Whatever else we learn at the hearing today, we hope that we will find that all involved will find the need for more open and detail communication regarding these critical products and how they perform in the field.

On Wednesday, a successful West Coast governor who knows something about trade, Democrat Jay Inslee, suggested he would throw his hat into the ring for 2020. He is pitching himself as the guy to put climate change at the top of the nation's priority list. To govern is to choose, Inslee told MSNBC's Chris Hayes. He offered a list of his progressive successes — on voting rights, minimum wages, net neutrality, transportation, etc. — and made the case that green technology makes climate change a jobs message as well. He might consider stressing his entire record as evidence of his ability to successfully govern, which includes climate change policies, and his role in challenging Trump's vile immigration policies. Almost as an afterthought, he notes that renewable-energy legislation helped launched a multibillion-dollar wind industry and helped his state lead in GDP growth and wages. That seems to be his greatest selling point — creating a progressive haven while growing the economy, raising wages and saving the planet. If Inslee can articulate a vision entirely at odds with Trump's and evidenced by his successful stewardship, he could be onto something.

'I'm continuing to talk to people about it,' the Minnesota Democrat said in an interview in her U.S. Senate office, a day before the start of a new congressional term. She said those discussions have been with a handful of longtime political advisers in Minnesota, some fellow U.S. senators and others. … Her likeliest strategy would be to win or finish strongly in neighboring Iowa, with its presidential caucus on Feb. 3, 2020. Klobuchar declined to put an exact timeline on when she'd reveal her plans. But she acknowledged that the likelihood of a large Democratic field vying to challenge Trump means she can't wait too long.

A potential dilemma facing the new Democratic leadership of the Senate will be the future of the filibuster, a Senate procedural rule that requires 60 votes to pass significant legislation. The use of the filibuster has been weakened over time ― it no longer comes into play for Cabinet appointments and judicial appointments ― but many Democrats would like to shelve it completely. Others, though, have hesitated to embrace that view.

Kraushaar: Warren, Booker already making rookie mistakes - National Journal: As the first leading contender to announce her intent to run for president, Elizabeth Warren has drawn ample scrutiny over her decisions. From publicizing the results of a much-mocked DNA test showing a trace of Native American ancestry to announcing her candidacy before the New Year when few were paying attention, there's plenty to second-guess. But more consequential than these tactical decisions is the big-picture strategy that a candidate adopts. And Warren, in the run-up to her announcement, has concluded that she can't deviate from an agenda embraced by the party's progressive activists. When moderates (and conservative Democrats) make up over half of the Democratic electorate, and in a prospective field filled with progressive candidates, such down-the-line liberal orthodoxy threatens to be a major political blunder.

A month after the election, Sanders hosted the National Town Hall on Climate Change Solutions—featuring Bill McKibben, activist Van Jones, and Representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez—to introduce the Green New Deal to the world.

In 2020 and 2022, these new members will no longer be exciting insurgent challengers but incumbents, probably forced to compromise in ways that some supporters might find disappointing. If the volunteer energy and small-donor support that lifted them to victory in 2018 is missing, their campaigns will look very different. They'll have to turn to corporate PACs again and, much like their predecessors elected in 2006 and 2008, focus their attention on donors rather than their districts, compromising their promises.

While they are closely allied with groups like Justice Democrats in backing progressive primary challengers, the group's most significant campaign victory came months before Biden defeated Trump in November.

McAuliffe will have to overcome his association with the Clintons and big-money politics. He'll need to avoid sounding like Debbie Downer raining on the progressives' dreams. However, his effort to tie his own candidacy, should he decide to win, with the party's successes running moderate candidates holds promise. (As we approach 2020, he writes, we should look at the candidates who won in swing districts in 2018. They are an energetic, diverse group who ran on realistic goals of lowering the cost of health care, improving education and raising wages.) He could make his message a unifying one as a candidate for all Americans (urban poor, suburban middle class, college and non-college-educated): Trump is hyper-divisive and a failure at governance; McAuliffe is the uniter who knows how to govern.

They said that Trump doing this might have been a wag the dog effort to distract from impeachment. Last week supposedly he couldn't wait for impeachment, which is why Nancy Pelosi had such leverage. They can't stick with a particular storyline and it's making them looking like the only thing that they are consistent, and it is what they're consistent about, is opposition to Trump.
Those second-tier diseases include measles and dengue, which did gangbusters in the tropics. Cholera raged in Yemen. Polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat. In Pakistan, polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- A proposal to make California's drought-era water restrictions permanent could allow the state to chip away at long-held water rights in an unprecedented power grab, representatives from water districts and other users told regulators Tuesday. Members of the state Water Resources Control Board delayed a decision about whether to bring back what had been temporary water bans from California's drought, spanning 2013 to 2017. The plan is part of an effort to make water conservation a way of life, with climate change expected to lead to longer, more severe droughts.

Because they cover a vast area in a very heat-rich part of the world, they have the ability to affect global temperatures.
The Paris accord was reached in 2015 after lengthy negotiations. The deal relies on voluntary cuts in emissions by all member nations.

In the new book, Harris delves far more deeply into her upbringing by a single mother who was determined to see that she and her sister Maya would grow into confident, proud black women. A mother, Harris writes, who taught them to be tough and rarely offered praise for behavior or achievements that were expected.

Both are qualities that five years ago, at the end of 2015, enabled the world to come together in Paris and find a way forward on climate change. The Paris Agreement commits countries to reducing their carbon output, keeping global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, with efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees.
This isn't the day's news but pink. This is unique, original coverage about the roles of gender in politics and policy, said Ramshaw, who is CEO of the nonprofit.

Separatists have been specifically dismayed about equalization payments, where federal funds are transferred between wealthy and less wealthy provinces to help ensure reasonably comparable health care, education and welfare in all regions.

There is one chance to change that and to increase the incoming Biden administration's odds of limiting the loss of life. That chance is in Georgia in Tuesday's runoff elections, where Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock both are challenging sitting Republican senators.

The novel coronavirus has brought life to a standstill around the world and left millions of people wondering when things will return to some semblance of normal. One hope is that the virus could perhaps behave somewhat like the seasonal flu — taking a break during the warmer summer months, lessening the threat and giving society time to mount a systemic response. But there are many unanswered questions.

I saw what Congresswoman Cheney said, and I have an enormous amount of respect for her. The American people should know Donald Trump is not going to take words on a paper. We are going to see if the Taliban are prepared to live up to the commitments they've made. The Bush administration and the Obama administration both tried to get the words that were on the paper yesterday that the Taliban would break from al Qaeda publicly. We got that. That's important. Now, time will tell if they'll live up to that commitment is our expectation. They have promised us they will do so and we'll be able to see on the ground everything they do or choose not to do.

The love affair between celebrities and Instagram Live is poised to grow in 2021. Not only have direct broadcasts over the Internet become an easy pandemic-era way for stars to endear themselves to fans with near-guaranteed publicity, but the celebrities have complete control over what they say. They don't need to write a witty caption or agonize over the perfect filter; viewers crave — and expect — authenticity in a spontaneous real-time chat.
The fate of the Senate – and the nation – will be decided by Georgia voters, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., wrote in an opinion piece posted on the Fox News website. If Democratic Senate candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff are elected on January 5th, the Democrats' impending socialist assault on our nation will make President Obama's first two years in office look moderate by comparison.

And that is how he had an arsenal of commerce-based arguments ready when the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010. By then Barnett was a leading voice of the growing libertarian wing of the Federalist Society, and he became one of the architects of constitutional claims at the core of lawsuits against the health-care plan. His participation in the legal assault on Obamacare was hatched at — where else? — the Federalist Society's national convention in the fall of 2009, where, in the hallway of the Mayflower Hotel between sessions, he happened to bump into a clutch of fellow Federalists discussing the health-care legislation. (Josh Blackman, a popular Federalist social media force and a professor at the South Texas College of Law, documented the moment in his 2013 book, Unprecedented: The Constitutional Challenge to Obamacare.) Barnett told me how one person in the group says, 'You want to do something about this?' I said, 'Sure.' … And he said, 'Whatever we do, we've got to do it fast because it's going to come out of committee very soon.'

These CBS News surveys were conducted by YouGov between January 16-23, 2020. A representative sample of 2,500 registered voters in Iowa was selected, including 1,401 self-identified Democrats, as well as registered voters who lean Democratic or plan to participate in the Democratic caucus this year. A representative sample of 14,575 registered voters was selected in 14 states expected to hold primaries on Super Tuesday (Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia). This sample includes 8,593 Democrats, and registered voters who lean Democratic or plan to vote in their state's Democratic primary. Both samples were weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based upon voter registration lists and the U.S. Census Current Population Survey, as well as 2016 presidential vote. Likely voters were determined using a model that takes into account self-reported likelihood of voting, along with other individual- and aggregate-level factors. The margins of error are 3.9 points in Iowa and 1.6 points in the Super Tuesday sample.

Ultimately, no foreign policy priority in 2021 will matter as much as Biden's ability to lift the country out of the pandemic. Other nations are hoping that Washington can help lead efforts to distribute vaccines in the developing world, but the United States still has a long struggle ahead to heal itself. No matter Biden's avowed internationalism, the era of America First may not be over just yet.

A draft text of the plan has circulated around Congress and laid out a framework that includes eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and agriculture and dramatically expanding energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable sources.

Those seeming oddities occur because FEMA's index scores how often disasters strike, how many people and how much property are in harm's way, how vulnerable the population is socially and how well the area is able to bounce back. And that results in a high risk assessment for big cities with lots of poor people and expensive property that are ill-prepared to be hit by once-in-a-generation disasters.

Senator Loeffler not really answer that question, what she would do about
There's plenty of overlap between Warren and Sanders on policy, and both are likely to get rounded into one of the press's lanes or tiers as the left's potential candidate. But one of the most interesting debates inside the Democratic Party right now is between Sanders's democratic socialism and Warren's reformed progressivism. By doing so well in 2016, Sanders exploded the popularity of a political philosophy that had been sidelined in the United States for 100 years; Warren hasn't had the same platform to spell out what she stands for.
The Vermont senator — who remains a registered independent, and who is often accused of wanting to burn the Democratic Party down — was instead offering advice. Sanders seemed to indicate that as he sees the presidential nomination slipping away, he wants the party to thrive by addressing the issues he cares about the most.

Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Board of Governors violated the state's open meetings laws by secretly negotiating and approving a deal to dispose of a Confederate monument from the campus of the system's flagship school, according to a lawsuit filed by a student newspaper. DTH Media Corp., which publishes The Daily Tar Heel student newspaper on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus, wants a court to void two agreements between the Board of Governors and the state chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, news outlets reported on Wednesday. The deal has been denounced by students and faculty members as paying money to support white nationalism. UNC-Chapel Hill lost a $1.5 million research grant because of it. Superior Court Judge Allen Baddour said last month that he is reconsidering his approval of the deal. Baddour approved an agreement on Nov. 27 in which the SCV agreed to take ownership of the Silent Sam statue and build a center to preserve it. The statue stood for more than a century on the Chapel Hill campus before protesters took it down in August 2018. The university agreed to put $2.5 million into a trust to help defray the costs of the new center. In addition, UNC-Chapel Hill paid the SCV about $75,000 not to display Confederate flags or similar banners on any UNC system campus during any meetings or demonstrations for five years.

Our energy future will not be found in the dark of a mine but in the light of the sun, said Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., as he announced the legislation on Capitol Hill.
The flagship coronavirus legislation was the CARES Act, passed in late March with a unanimous Senate vote. Conventional wisdom in Washington regards the law as a smashing success. Even the chronically malcontent left has cheered the CARES Act for temporarily boosting unemployment benefits by $600 a week ― a level that put modest upward pressure on wages, since some workers found themselves better off financially after losing their jobs. Generous provisions for big business prevented a financial panic, and though clumsy, the hundreds of billions of dollars allocated to support small businesses did not go to waste.
Democrats want to end a GOP rule that required supermajority support from three-fifths of House members to raise taxes. They want to reinstate a pay as you go – or PAYGO – rule requiring tax cuts or new spending programs be offset with new taxes or spending cuts. (Republicans required that only new spending to be offset.) A few Democrats said they will vote against the entire package, arguing PAYGO would keep Democrats from expanding health care coverage and making other critical investments in education and infrastructure.

Changing history means not just telling the same old tall tales of the free market system and the Founders. No, it's the history according to progressives.

There are reasons to be optimistic, said Surabi Menon, vice president of global intelligence at ClimateWorks Foundation and a member of the steering committee for the U.N.'s emissions gap reports. The European Union, South Korea and Japan have committed to reducing their carbon emissions to zero by 2050. China says it will do so by 2060. Meanwhile, Joe Biden's election signals the United States' return to international climate diplomacy. With history's biggest emitter back in the Paris agreement, climate experts hope countries will be motivated to pledge deeper emissions reductions at the U.N. climate conference in November.
Now, 175 years later, the United States is the world's strongest military power and boasts the world's largest economy, but its future seems imperiled, with countless seemingly implacable, unsolvable political and social fractures. If the United States was just beginning its global ascent 175 years ago, then 2021 may mark the acceleration of its global demise. The norm-breaking presidency of Donald Trump and the country's disastrous response to the covid-19 pandemic are the most obvious symptoms of the country's internal rot, both of which in turn have only furthered U.S. divisions. Although Joe Biden will assume the presidency in a few weeks having won seven million more votes than Trump, the narrowness of his electoral college victory, coupled with Trump's lies about voter fraud and his refusal to admit defeat, do not bode well for the coming year. Tens of millions of Trump voters do not believe Biden won legitimately, and certain Republicans have called openly for secession — a stance millions of the most die-hard Trump voters probably support.
And Susie says, no, no, no. That would be way too close.

Still, it fell short of what some parties had hoped for. Island nations — which face an existent threat from rising seawaters — had pushed hard for a target of 1.5 degrees Celsius. (Why not even lower? Well, as of 2015, the global average temperature had already risen by 1 degree Celsius, and even with robust efforts to cut emissions, some further increase is essentially inevitable.)

Trump's refugee policy, which has shrunk the number of incoming individuals to levels unseen since 1980, is central to his agenda for raising wages and living standards for the American worker. The president and his allies have argued that a tight labor market benefits workers already in the country by pushing companies to invest in skill training and development. It also has the benefit of boosting wages, as there is a smaller pool of workers competing for open positions.
The microgrids Prime Minister Minnis is talking about are small-scale systems. More and more, they're solar arrays with battery storage for when the sun's not shining. They can either feed electricity into the larger grid or operate independently to power a single facility or a neighborhood.

What a transformation. Several years ago, a Republican changemaker complained to me that the party wasn't putting its thumb on the scale to help women overcome primary hurdles, such as the reluctance of conservative men to back them financially. (That complaint echoed research I had commissioned from a team of political and data scientists.) The lack of female candidates, in turn, exacerbated the exodus of women from the party. Even before Trump, insiders told me that Republican women voters were switching parties for ideological reasons like climate change, immigration reform and health care.

Yet buildings account for about 70 percent of the city's emissions, creating a steep political challenge for a mayor who, to the chagrin of the progressive activists who helped elect him, spent much of his first term wooing real estate developers. In September, de Blasio's rollout of a new set of mandates to cut emissions from big buildings faced blunt criticism from the New York City Council, which accused the mayor of acting unilaterally and failing to go far enough with the proposed rules.

But this horrific situation has been the impetus for an incredible new unity in the industry for change. During the pandemic, we've seen hundreds of independent restaurant owners change their own wage structures to pay a full minimum wage with tips on top. Even the industry's top trade magazines have had headlines declaring that the industry is rethinking the subminimum wage for tipped workers. Now we just need legislators to follow workers and employers who've already come to agree on this issue.
WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: I cannot do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that undercuts me.
MICHAEL CROWLEY: Well, that's a big question. You know, President Trump was getting close to nominating Congressman Ratcliffe back in the summer, and met so much resistance from senior Republicans in Congress who said this man is not qualified. He's only been on the Intelligence Committee for a year, may have inflated his resume, and is much more partisan around the people who've held that job. The President pulled back and didn't do it. The question is now has Ratcliffe changed any minds? There's not a lot of evidence to that, but there may be a little bit of a game going on here because the President has installed Richard Grenell, his ambassador to Germany, in that job, in an acting basis and because of complicated things that have to do with the-- the-- how long acting directors can serve. By nominating a new person, even if President Trump doesn't think Ratcliffe can get confirmed, that allows Rick Grenell to stay in that job for a longer amount of time. There's another theory that Rick Grenell is even more unpalatable to people in Congress than Ratcliffe. So Ratcliffe may be the more acceptable alternative. So there's a lot going on here and people are trying to figure out what's real and what isn't.
As a result, the unemployment rate was nearly 10% going into the 2010 midterm elections, contributing to the dismal environment that cost Democrats the House and limited Obama's political capital for the remainder of his presidency, these progressives maintain.

Inslee fought over the past year to pass Initiative 1631, a ballot measure that would have put a $15 per metric ton fee on carbon dioxide emissions and directed the money toward expanding public transit, energy-efficiency retrofits for big buildings and new wind- and solar-powered plants. The proposal, dubbed by some a state-level Green New Deal, failed after the oil industry spent a record $31 million pressuring Evergreen State voters to reject the measure. It was Inslee's third attempt at putting a price on carbon in his state.
The field has been whittled. And I think what we're left with now is not just left versus right, we're trying to make sure that we elect someone who will give us the kind of country that we deserve, not someone like Donald Trump. And, therefore, it is clogged. It is clogged.

In the Arctic the sudden warming in the stratosphere typically leads to blocking areas of high pressure — like a mountain of warm air — known as the negative Arctic oscillation, or -AO. As it turns out, the -AO is already underway and this SSW episode should act to prolong it. This blocking pattern forces and redirects the jet stream and cold Arctic air southward.

If it is industry practice not to share claims with automakers, then it is time for that practice to change, by statute or otherwise. Had the Houston television station not run the story that we've seen today, perhaps we would not be discussing these matters. As to NHTSA, we need to know that its resources are adequate; that it can effectively perform its important safety work. If budget cuts and other restrictions placed on that agency prevent it from protecting the public, then this committee should seriously look at increasing the budget and freeing the agency from constraints. It is also entirely appropriate at a time like this to evaluate whether NHTSA's statutory authority is sufficient, and I trust we will hear about this as we go forward.

I am thrilled to see so many of the potential 2020 presidential candidates embracing the idea of a Green New Deal, Ocasio-Cortez told CNN. The oil and gas lobbyists won't back down without a fight and that's why we need to support groups like Sunrise Movement in their efforts to keep the pressure up. When the scientific consensus says that you have 12 years to avoid climate catastrophe, it's time to get to work.
The EPA contends that the rule will improve public trust in environmental regulations by letting people know more about the data that regulators use to make their decisions about air and water pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions.

Trump's war with Sen. John McCain dates back to the early days of his campaign, when Trump disparaged the Arizona Republican's record as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. Since then the two have continued to spar; Trump vowed retribution against McCain for the senator's vote against repealing the Affordable Care Act, and McCain later went on the offensive, seeming to criticize the president's avoidance of the draft during the Vietnam War for bone spurs, though he later denied that was his intent.

The pivot temperature where a population will turn out 50 percent females and 50 percent males is based on genetics and varies with species and even individual nesting groups, the researchers wrote. Turtles seem to target their breeding periods to times when the sand is slightly warmer than their pivot temperatures, resulting in populations moderately skewed female. But shift the temperature of that period just a few degrees and the resulting baby turtles will be not just a bit female — instead, hardly a male will appear in the whole group.

Onetime senator and 1996 presidential hopeful Arlen Specter (Pa.) also stuck up for the truth when he assailed two leading GOP conspiracy theorists, Robertson and Pat Buchanan, as leaders of the intolerant right.
By May, a King's College London and Ipsos MORI study based on three surveys on Covid-19 conspiracies by Allington and his colleagues surveyed UK residents and found three in ten believed the virus was probably created in a lab. People who got their information from social media were more likely to believe in conspiracies than those who got it on television or radio the study also found.
The other group moved down into North and South America and are believed to be the direct ancestors of current Native Americans.
Sadly, it is not a surprise to most climate scientists. We've seen this coming for literally decades and now it's upon us, said Gleick, I expect there will be new, hotter temperature records broken over and over again in the future along with increasingly severe droughts and floods, rising sea levels, and worsening fire risks. There's no 'normal' anymore. And still our politicians dither. It's sad and disturbing to me.
Carbon dioxide is actually good for the planet, Happer claims; it's like fertilizer and makes crops more productive.
How would you have voted had you voted on that veto override?
This past summer, French food giant Danone took a somewhat radical step to put a deeper purpose in their corporate charter and adopted the French legal framework of entreprise à mission [a model created by French law, which requires companies to factor in environmental and social impacts] to lead the way to create and share sustainable value for all stakeholders.

But Markham concedes that it might not be possible to protect every site, particularly in less developed parts of the world.
Spending quality time with friends and family. Hibernation is an opportunity to spend time together. A favorite pastime for my family is playing cards and board games. Times of spirited fun and playful competition bond us and bring us closer together. This quality time is always a wise investment--especially when family are friends. Wintertime is a great time to start a weekend game tournament. We even award fun prizes!

The Environmental Protection Agency has completed one of its last major rollbacks under the Trump administration, changing how it considers evidence of harm from pollutants in a way that opponents say could cripple future public-health regulation.
McConnell and Trump have since worked to patch things over, at least publicly, and McConnell was instrumental in passing the tax bill.
It's not just a question of intangible moral leadership or even of the potential profits from green energy that would be on the table. The Atlantic reported last year that a U.S. departure would likely result in less-transparent mechanisms for actually enforcing the Paris accord — because Chinese faulty and unreliable energy statistics could play a prominent role.
For the Beringians who stayed behind, Potter says, it would have been a rough living as the last ice age drew to a close. They're dealing with climate change that we can only imagine now — major changes from [the] ice age, to extinction of a wide range of mammal species, including mammoth, he says. And these are the people that adapted in this region.

My view on this is why would we not want to honor indigenous people. These were the people who were here. These were the people who in Massachusetts reached out helped the first settlers to Massachusetts Bay colony and helped them survive those first harsh and rugged years. I'm in favor of honoring.

As part of a training group of professional distance runners based in Providence, my teammates and I build the foundation of our Olympic Dreams on the roads, tracks and trails of this small state with a big running history. Olympic medalists, World Championship finalists and Boston Marathon champions have preceded us on these training grounds, but these accolades are fewer now as the climate of the sport has changed over the last decade due to widespread doping.

As of Wednesday, there were 6,061 confirmed cases of the virus in mainland China, including 132 deaths, according to Chinese officials. The number of cases grew by around 1,500 from Tuesday, a more than 30% increase. The figures do not include Hong Kong and Macau, both of which have reported a small number of cases.
More than most potential candidates for the president, Warren seemed to be ready for the brickbats. The senator from Massachusetts is the first high-profile Democratic contender, with preexisting grass-roots support, a national fundraising network and credible poll numbers in early-voting states. Four years ago, Warren rejected a campaign to draft her into the presidential primary; since then, she has grown more influential in the party, introducing bills that would give workers more control of corporations, shrink the influence of lobbyists and turn the federal government into a generic-drug manufacturer.
Swarms were first spotted about a year and a half ago on the Arabian peninsula. By July of last year, they were reported in Yemen. Once the swarms arrived in Yemen, the FAO warned that if preventative measures weren't put in place, the insects would migrate to Kenya next.
Still, Sanders' campaign says the senator's comment to Colbert wasn't realistic. Even if several senators were looking to decamp from Washington to Iowa quickly after the impeachment trial concludes each day, they would be headed to different parts of the state.

We did a study last year with some worldwide experts and showed that in the U.S., the precipitation patterns are such that extreme precipitation -- in other words, when it rains, it's going to rain heavier -- is on the rise, Gritzo said. And there's good sound physics and good sound data behind that.
But that idea is totally at odds with the structure of a modern economy, of the benefits of economies of scale, the benefits of trade. We have to take the economy we have and the corporations we have and make them more accountable rather than try and turn back the clock to a time that won't return.
Collins, 54, who described herself as a lifelong Democrat who now supports Trump, said that kind of economic benefit makes it hard to consider the plant's effect on her health and the environment.
The most interesting passages of the book often tie back to Harris' family heritage and the values instilled in her by her mother, who separated from Harris' father when she was young.

Congresswoman, I mean this was such a sore point when the president said we're going to pull out that James Mattis, the defense secretary, quit over it. Now they seem to be reshuffling it. Do you understand what the policy is?
Men like Madison, Jefferson and Adams were keenly aware of the tyranny and corruption of authority concentrated in too few hands. They knew the thirst for power posed an existential danger to those who cherish freedom. Their genius was in crafting a sustaining document that would end the arrogance of one man rule and protect the inherent rights of all men. They knew that absolute power corrupts.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Yeah. You know, if that's what radical means, call me a radical.
What does this mean for us?
A continent away, frantic negotiations were continuing on the eve of the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) decision on the Bay-Delta Plan, the controversial new policy that will mandate that rivers in the San Joaquin watershed must have an average of 40% unimpeded flow during the spring months — a decision that shifts precious water from farmers and cities to the environment in an effort to save threatened fish populations.

Nos. 7 - 10 on the Chronicle of Philanthropy's list:
Purpose is the most distilled form of strategy. Once you can figure out what purpose your company is meant to serve, that should dictate the products you choose to sell, the processes you choose to create those products, with what supply chains, who you hire, the culture you choose to build, all of which should be rooted in purpose.
ALEX AZAR: We have no evidence so far that establishes a connection to somebody who traveled to an impacted area. And so we do not know how he contracted the virus. That's really what we do. That's the basic blocking and tackling right now of public health is we're going to trace the people that he had contact with. We're going to trace the other cases. There is a nursing home that sends patients to this hospital. And there are cases in that nursing home. But who spread to whom? We do not know yet.
For Ocasio-Cortez, it was an early lesson in congressional politics. And another one came when she defied Pelosi and voted against the speaker's new House rules, but was not joined by many other progressive Democrats. Ocasio-Cortez told us she's determined to keep fighting for what's being called a Green New Deal — a highly ambitious, some would say unrealistic, proposal that would convert the entire U.S. Economy to renewable sources of energy in just 12 years, while guaranteeing every American a job at a fair wage.
Now That's What I Call a Cold Front: Perhaps you were woken up by the wind the way I was around 1 a.m. as a truly potent Arctic front came barreling through the D.C. area. As far as frontal boundaries go, this one was a doozy. You need look no further than the daily climate numbers from Dulles Airport for evidence of just how sharp the change in air mass was. Dulles tied a record daily high of 70 degrees (previous record came in 2017) Friday and was still sitting at a toasty 61 degrees at 12:30 a.m. Then the front came through.
As Gritzo demonstrated, You can see that this projectile, which is moving according to a storm that has about 100 mph wind speed -- went right through that half-inch piece of plywood.
Need evidence? Look no further than the drama over the COVID-19 stimulus package wherein 78% of Americans support $2,000 stimulus checks and the GOP still blocked it. They can't even work together with Democrats at such a dire time in history so it's quite obvious they won't be reaching across the aisle when we're out of this once in a century pandemic.
This isn't a change. They're true, Warren said. The question is, what is the response that the president of the United States should make, and what advances the interests of the United States of America.
Wheeler delivered. In August, he proposed gutting fuel economy standards for new vehicles in a move seen as a giant giveaway to oil companies even as electric automobile technology made historic leaps forward. Weeks later, he unveiled a rule to weaken a landmark Obama-era power plant regulation, allowing by the EPA's own calculus enough pollution to cause an additional 1,400 premature deaths per year.
That is a stark contrast to the priorities of voters elsewhere in the country. According to a Gallup poll released earlier this week, Democrats nationwide consider health care the most important issue, followed closely by gun control and climate change. Overall, healthcare, national security, gun policy, education and the economy were cited as extremely important by over 30% of adults in the poll.
John Kerry, Obama's secretary of state and a key player in crafting the Paris agreement, also denounced the U.S. withdrawal as a self-destructive step that puts our nation last.
Now, Carmel is installing solar panels to generate its own electricity, which will save taxpayers money and ensure the lights are more likely to stay on if a disaster knocks out major power lines outside city boundaries.
Joe Biden could get a boost from his status as the second choice of those backing Amy Klobuchar, as well as from those polling lower. If they move to him on caucus night, he could see gains. Meanwhile, Warren is right on the line, and her backers' second choice is Sanders, more so than Biden or Buttigieg. That would mean Sanders could stand to pick up even more delegates if Warren backers don't make the cut in some places. If Warren holds at her current level or gains, this race will remain tight. All told, the caucuses look like they might very likely be decided by these kinds of local-level movements.
ERIC BARADAT/AFP via Getty Images Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has pledged to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement 10 years early. But some remain skeptical of the online giant, which doesn't participate in a leading climate disclosure initiative and still provides services to oil and gas companies.
The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which is used to estimate potential property damage, rates hurricanes on a scale of 1 to 5 based on a storm's wind speed, according to the National Hurricane Center. The scale tops out at Category 5 for any hurricane with sustained winds of 157 mph or higher. But that September storm, Hurricane Irma, hit 185 mph, breaking the Atlantic Ocean record, and other parts of the world have seen even worse.

A Stephen King thriller rarely disappoints, and this one , his third entry in the retro Hard Case Crime series, revisits one of his recurring themes: tormented adolescents facing off against evil. (See It, Firestarter, etc.) This time, his main character is a boy with supernatural gifts who is recruited by his mom's boyfriend, a NYPD detective, to help catch a killer.
But convincing voters that punishing a Democrat like Rice who opposes the policy is a boon to a Green New Deal's chances of implementation is another challenge altogether, Hauser said.

Ramirez called out Skinny Coffee Club as one particular culprit. The company sells coffee that's been reformulated to burn fat, boost antioxidants with many more benefits, according to the brand's website, promising noticeable weight loss within a week, higher energy and an improved complexion. However, what any coffee does is act as an appetite suppressant and provides energy, giving the impression that you are 'healthier,' she said. Once you stop these products, you'll go back to your old habits and, thus, there is no permanent weight loss.
ED O'KEEFE: It's going to be really difficult for a lot of these people to somehow make a mark here and somehow deal with maybe fifteen, twenty people who are running for-- for President and their party. And it's going to make things quite uncomfortable for them.
But Loeffler's and Perdue's campaigns were quickly subsumed by Trump's attacks on the Democratic outcome. Trump recently appeared to pressure Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on a private call, urging him to find enough votes to reverse his loss in Georgia, a state that every GOP presidential candidate had won since 1996. Raffensperger, a Republican, refused.
2020 was also a year to remember for many residents of US West Coast states , where deadly wildfires in California, Oregon and Washington forced tens of thousands of people into shelters amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Two months ago, the American people spoke, and demanded a new dawn, she said during an address to the House soon after securing a 220-to-192 vote affirming her speakership. They called upon the beauty of our Constitution: our system of checks and balances that protects our democracy.
The legislation would require the city to carry out a study on the feasibility of replacing existing in-city gas-fired plants with renewables that use battery storage, according to a draft HuffPost obtained. By Dec. 30, 2019, the city would have to lay out a plan to swap those gas-fired generating stations for new wind or solar units paired with batteries.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who found her political awakening fighting the constructionof the Dakota Access pipeline at Standing Rock, was a campaign organizer for Sanders' 2016 presidential run and campaigned with him in the summer of 2018.
Warren also highlighted her push to build 3.2 million housing units across the country, called for legalizing marijuana, repairing the criminal justice system, and she received one of her biggest applause when she touted I believe in science.
It's been over a year since a wolf — an endangered gray wolf to be exact — was shot in Modoc County, a rural area on the northern border of California. And now, officials with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are running low on leads. They are turning to the public for help with the investigation and offering a $2,500 cash reward for information.
ED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): Well, his team would tell you this is the momentum they need to convince any late-deciding voter who is not a fan of Bernie Sanders to side with them instead. Their hope is that by the end of Tuesday, he emerges as the clear alternative to Sanders. It's pretty mathematically impossible, based on what polling is showing us right now, for somebody to surpass Sanders, especially because he is going to have such a big win, it looks like, in places like California. But they are hoping, the Biden team is, that in the next few days they are able to raise millions of dollars and again convince people that he is the leading alternative.
Pelosi said of Trump in the interview: We have to stipulate to a set of facts if we're going to ever negotiate. But he simply won't do it. What he talks about with the wall isn't true. It isn't true about terrorists coming over the wall, people with illnesses flooding the country. I mean, really?
Cass Morris with ASC and Hannah Hessel Ratner with STC shared this advice:
[W]e believe that the United States' institutions are strong enough to survive this insurrection, they wrote, but we still have to get through the next couple of weeks. There still exists the possibility of further civil unrest, calls for Trump's removal from office, and a chance that the inauguration could be less than peaceful.

Either way, Victoria Beard, an urban planning professor at Cornell University and World Resources Institute fellow, says water scarcity will continue to be a problem, especially in cities, until governments of high-risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems.
Another notable provision would change the process to vacate the chair, a process to force out the speaker. Instead of only one member being able to trigger the process, the new rule would require motion to vacate to only be offered on the House floor if a majority of either party conference agrees to do so.
Today, institutions as diverse as the American Medical Association; the Centers for Disease Control; the Institute of Medicine, a division of the National Academy of Sciences; and the World Health Organization have linked nontherapeutic antibiotic use on factory farms with increased antimicrobial resistance and called for a ban.

We have to decide whether to give into the fear or whether to fight back, Warren said on Saturday in Muscatine. Me, I'm fighting back. That's why I'm in this.
But, you know, let me pick up with you, Michael, on the point I was making with Mayor Buttigieg. You've got Bernie Sanders over here on the left and with Elizabeth Warren starting to fade, seeming to have a pretty clear shot in his path. And, meanwhile, you've got this center lane all clogged up with Buttigieg and Klobuchar and Biden and Bloomberg about to get into it.
That leaves a lot of room for interpretation.

This isn't the first time Del Rey has fought off a woke cancel mob.
O'Donnell: Thank you. Your agenda has promised free health care for everybody, free college tuition, and to pay off people's college loans. The price tag for that is estimated to be $60 trillion over ten years, correct?
KANDER: I am trying to - I'm trying to remember exactly what was going on. I know that the moment when Sally makes a decision to have an abortion was a moment which, I think, had not yet been properly musicalized. I'm just trying to remember this now. I don't know if it's all correct. But we wrote a song which did exactly that. It was a song which starts out very jaunty and nasty and cheerful all at the same time, sung by a girl who's just been insulted by her lover and who's found out that she's pregnant and is in - actually is in misery. And in the middle of the song, our intention, without tipping it lyrically, was that she make her decision to get rid of the baby. I think it works really well on the stage. The interesting element in that song is that all the sort of popular versions of it - most of those performances are of a very jaunty, cheerful, hey mate, come in from the rain and let's have a good time. And, of course, that's the opposite of the intention of the song.

And at the end of the day, no one in this race can or should win the nomination without proving they have sweeping support from African American voters, she said. Vice President Biden is the only candidate who has already done so.
Reducing the number of future sexual assault victims requires new approaches and resources above what are currently provided for response programs, the report said, adding that service academies are unique environments that require programs tailored to their specific circumstances.
Fifty Republican senators were sworn into the 117th Congress this week along with 48 senators who will caucus with the Democrats. If both Ossoff and Warnock prevail Tuesday, the Senate is tied at 50-50 and Harris would be the tie-breaking vote as president of the Senate.
While the IOD is a natural mode of variability, its behavior is changing in response to climate change. Research suggests that the frequency of positive IOD events, and particularly the occurrence of consecutive events will increase as global temperatures rise, the bureau stated.
We don't want to have Congress becoming the arbiters over the fate of species, Ashe says. The longer this lingers, the more likely it is that people will try to find a political solution.
At the top of the list of the best ETFs to play this megatrend would be the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF XBI, +1.12% . This biotech-focused fund is deep, with roughly 170 holdings. It's also not market-cap weighted like other funds that rely on just two or three big picks in the space; not a single position is weighted at more than 1.2% at present. That ensures investors can tap in to the smaller names with the biggest long-term potential.
Atishi lost to former cricketer Gautam Gambhir, fielded by the BJP in East Delhi Lok Sabha constituency. In fact, all seven BJP candidates secured more than 50% vote share in the 2019 parliamentary election, an even higher margin than the Hindu nationalist party's seven-seat sweep in 2014. This time around, Atishi contested and won from the Kalkaji constituency.
Despite some incredible athletic performances amid the duress, it has been difficult to present sports on television without large numbers of fans. The TV tricks — fresh camera angles, manufactured crowd noise, dabbling with greater interactivity — couldn't prevent the product from being a glorified scrimmage. For die-hard fans, the outcomes carried emotional value, but it was hard to get past the practical reality: These weren't events as much as they were staged replicas to satisfy lucrative TV contracts.
The alert was ultimately sent out at roughly 4 a.m. local time, the L.A. Times reported, when the flooding had already began and it was clear the situation was only going to get worse.

Former national security adviser John Bolton's book manuscript has piqued the interest of Joe Biden, who mentioned it today at a campaign stop in Fort Madison, Iowa, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson noted. It's the timing that caught his attention. According to a New York Times report, in early May last year, President Trump told Bolton to call the Ukrainian president, a political neophyte who had just won the presidency, in order to ensure that he'd meet with the president's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani.

Longer lines at airports, national parks closed and, of course, for hundreds of thousands of federal workers, missed paychecks and worry about keeping food on the table. The partial government shutdown has had some immediate impacts. The longer-term ones can be harder to see.

Hey, Nate.
The growing socialist wing of the Democratic Party will flex its muscle Thursday with the seating of the new Congress, as more self-described Democratic Socialists join the ranks and dozens of sitting and incoming members – including likely 2020 hopefuls – embrace a massive government expansion that would make FDR look like a penny pincher.
Dr. Shaman: There's something to that that might be intriguing. If you look at Southeast Asia, the countries that have cases of COVID-19 but have not gone out of control are Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand and Taiwan; they have kept the growth of the virus linear. Korea and China, on the other hand, are further north and more temperate and have had bigger outbreaks to deal with. This could be a manifestation of differing climates, but it's pure speculation. This may much more reflect that they [Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan] have engaged in much more proactive control of the virus and are successful at it. The Japanese have also kept the growth of cases linear even though they have had a substantial number of cases. They have managed to control it, even though they are a temperate [colder and less humid] country. So, although there is this tantalizing possibility that the virus spreads less in warmer or more humid climates, it could also be linked to a country's response to the outbreak.
PG&E is under no legal obligation to disclose its internal discussions about ways to stave off bankruptcy. But given the potential impact on ratepayers and taxpayers if the utility eventually needs a bailout, Michael Wara, a lawyer and research scholar at Stanford University, calls the lack of transparency extremely disappointing.
Oklahoma City: A judge facing a felony charge of failing to file her state income tax returns has been removed from presiding over criminal trials. The Oklahoman reports Oklahoma County Judge Kendra Coleman was reassigned Friday by Presiding Judge Ray C. Elliott to handle victim protective order requests and mental health cases. Coleman is facing a felony charge for failing to pay state taxes in 2017, was admonished by the state Supreme Court for failing to pay her taxes and more than 60 parking tickets, and has been found in contempt by the Oklahoma Ethics Commission. Coleman's attorney, Joe White, has called the felony indictment false on its face, saying the taxes were eventually paid. The judge's attorney has also said the contempt citation must be more specific about the allegations against her.

MIKE POMPEO: Yes, Ma'am. This was a historic day. American blood and treasure have been expended in this place for an awfully long time. We went there after 9/11. No one still feels the anger of that day any more than I do. But it was time. And the Taliban knew it was time. President Trump has allowed us to take the fight to the Taliban these last two years. And we have done so. It's why they, for the first time, have announced that they're prepared to break with their historic ally, al-Qaida, who they've worked with much the det-- detriment of the United States of America. You can see, go read the document, the Taliban have now made the break. They've said they will not permit terror to be thrust upon anyone, including the United States, from Afghanistan. This is historic in that way and no one should underestimate the Trump administration. You can see our work on counterterror, whether it's al-Baghdadi, Qassem al-Rimi--
Food marketing continues to get more buzzy and sophisticated; unfounded claims on social media go viral; and influencers earn more sway on the general populace than health professionals have. All of this makes it difficult to sort out the truth when it comes to trendy diets and claims of health benefits. We're here to examine and shatter some of those health halos.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Tuesday night that President Trump used his prime-time Oval Office address to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from the turmoil in his Administration.
Just weeks after Dorian hit, Prime Minister Minnis spoke at the United Nations. He emphasized that most of the Bahamas was not damaged and eager for tourists, the lifeblood of the economy. Then he said that first-world countries and their pollution are at least partly to blame for the threat of ever-stronger hurricanes.

All of these could soon be targets of congressional Democrats. (EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler has claimed, dubiously, that his agency's transparency rule is not subject to the CRA.)
Despite this claim, the economy in the final six months of the Trump administration has out-performed the expectations of most economists. Re-opening many businesses and adjustments to business operations, including encouraging employees to work from home and making workplaces more amenable to social distancing, have allowed many businesses to regain their footing.
Whatever the source, the reality is that we're all standing atop virtually incomprehensible quantities of untapped energy abundance. In 2014, Breitbart News noted that the value of oil and gas under federal lands and waters amounted to $128 trillion. That $128 trillion, we might add, is six times the GDP of the U.S. Once again, that's just federal lands and waters—a fraction of this country's total territory.
They are sending the message: don't mess with us; we are not afraid of anything you can do to us, said Malley, who previously served on Obama's National Security Council.
GRAHAM: Well, what President Obama did, he didn't declare a national emergency about the DACA recipients. He took his power to pardon an individual or a smaller group and applied it to 1.8 million people. Ever president -- not every, a lot of presidents have declared emergencies. After 9/11, we did and they have taken money and powers to deal with a national emergency.
MARGARET BRENNAN: In the middle of the funding standoff, the one hundred and sixteenth Congress gavels in, Nancy Pelosi reclaims the title of speaker as Democrats take control of the House and usher in the most diverse Congress in history. A panel of freshmen members weighs in on inheriting a shutdown and early calls to impeach the President.
He was removed from the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge roster, and the revelations prompted fresh scrutiny of his voting record. The Houston Chronicle, the newspaper of record in Texas' biggest city, criticized his oil and gas ties in an editorial and warned that if fans of fossil fuels can't find an effective way to address climate change, Texas will have to start dealing with problems even more destructive than an oil bust.
Instead they seek to crack down on the sort of nonviolent civil disobedience that has shaped much of our nation's greatest political and social victories. The legislation's similarities were no coincidence. As climate change projections grew more dire and the bloody 2016 fight to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline became a new Alamo cry for environmentalists, the fossil fuel industry's political allies began promoting state legislation to restrict protests. Oklahoma passed the first legislation protecting pipelines as critical infrastructure in 2017. Shortly after, the American Legislative Exchange Council, the conservative policy shop funded by big business and right-wing billionaires, drafted a generic bill it called the Critical Infrastructure Protection Act.
But they kept going — down the steps, into the street, past the Washington Monument and, eventually, into Lafayette Square across from the White House — along with thousands of others who gathered for the fourth annual Women's March on Washington.
Bob Cowen, head of the National Association of Marine Laboratories, sees climate change as a challenge, but also a scientific opportunity. We're feeling it, and we're also studying it at the same time as best we can, he said. If labs like this one have to shut down, decades of on-site measurements could be disrupted — and, researchers say, academic budgets might not allow replacements to be built, or built on a comparable scale.
The White House blueprint does not address major safety net programs such as Social Security and Medicare, which the president has promised to protect. But Trump is calling for sharp cuts in discretionary spending, including the Environmental Protection Agency.

Given the scope and ambitious nature of the Green New Deal, it might be tempting to criticize or dismiss activists supporting it. But Amy Myers Jaffe hopes older, more experienced policymakers won't do that.
CBS News: A member of the Republican National Committee, fearing primary challengers to President Trump in the wake of incoming GOP Sen. Mitt Romney's scathing op-ed, is urging fellow committee members to change the rules to thwart intra-party threats to Mr. Trump in 2020. In an email obtained by CBS News, Jevon O.A. Williams, the national committeeman for the Virgin Islands, urged fellow elected RNC members … to close 'loopholes' in the nomination in a way that would make it tougher for even token challengers to Mr. Trump to enter the fray. … Williams also called for a resolution to declare Mr. Trump the presumptive nominee in 2020, calling for both of those moves to take place at an RNC winter meeting later this month.

In other words, like so many environmental studies these days, it is more of a political artefact than a scientific one.
In another conversation, Ireland's former president, Mary Robinson, warned of a strange moment in history. Much of the world had committed itself to very strong multilateral institutions, but she says, we seem to be now going into identity nationalism in a narrow sense.

KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, DHS SECRETARY: This is a severe humanitarian and security crisis.
These scenarios of apocalypse, of really cataclysmic climate change that people are scaring children around, are in the realm of an extreme, unpredictable event, he told me. He has reflected on eco-anxiety while observing his 14-year-old daughter and her friends grow more worried about the planet; his book on the topic, Apocalypse Never, is due out in June. He's not advocating that children be shielded from the science, but rather that it be presented seriously. The headline-grabbing threats of mass extinctions and deaths may motivate action, he says, but at what cost?
Federal appeals court appointments President Trump has appointed more judges to the federal appeals courts than all other presidents at equivalent points in their presidencies.

According to a study by chemistry professor Vadoud Niri and his team at State University of New York at Oswego, houseplants are a good way to absorb volatile chemical compounds in the air. These compounds, commonly found in paints, furniture, printers, cleaning supplies and even dry-cleaned clothes, can have adverse health effects. Some plants are more effective in absorbing certain chemicals than others; crassula argentea (jade plant) is very good at absorbing toluene, emitted by cars, gasoline, kerosene, heating oil, paints and lacquers.

When viewed over a longer period of time, Europe's record warm winter stands out even more starkly. Compared to normal conditions at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution (1850-1900), before human-caused greenhouse gases started to warm the planet, this winter was a remarkable 8 degrees Fahrenheit above normal across the whole continent.
I'm afraid I just cannot see how we could possibly go to zero carbon in a 10-year time frame.
To close the gala, McGahn and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell settle in armchairs below the giant Madison heads for an onstage tete-a-tete, during which they all but spike the football over the current pace of appointing conservatives to all levels of the federal judiciary — the judges project, as McConnell calls it. At the appeals court level, in particular, Trump has made more appointments than all other presidents at the same point in their presidencies, according to research by Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. (At the district court level, however, Trump's pace lags behind that of George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.) My goal … is to do everything we can for as long as we can to transform the federal judiciary, because everything else we do is transitory, McConnell says. The closest thing we will ever have an opportunity to do to have the longest impact on the country is confirming these great men and women and transforming the judiciary for as long into the future as we can. McConnell notes that the judges list played a big part in getting Trump elected. The majority leader looks out over the gathering almost mistily as he concludes: I hope you are proud of what we've done.

There's a reason Barack Obama built an entire national campaign apparatus outside of the Democratic National Committee. There's a reason that, when he didn't activate or continue that, we lost House majorities. Because the party — in and of itself — does not have the core competencies, and no amount of money is going to fix that.
But you are never going to accomplish any of these things if you don't take on the systems of power which make all of that impossible, she continued. Which means taking on institutional racism, it's taking on the corruption and greed in Washington, and taking on the special interests that write legislation in the dead of night, and I know that I have the compassion, courage, and fearless determination to get that done.

The announcement follows Trump's decision to pull out of the climate deal that nearly 200 nations agreed to in late 2015. As NPR has reported, the only other countries not part of the agreement are Syria, which is in the midst of a civil war, and Nicaragua, which argued that the Paris accord did not go far enough to curb global emissions.
Last week, the president praised the Justice Department for changing the way it's handling the case against former Trump associate Roger Stone. Stone was convicted in November on multiple counts of lying to Congress.

Green turtles are in fact remarkably widespread, and are found in tropical, subtropical and temperate waters around the world. They certainly are not dependent on a narrow set of weather conditions. In Australia alone, there are seven regional populations of green turtles that nest in different areas; the southern Great Barrier Reef, the northern Great Barrier Reef, the Coral Sea, the Gulf of Carpentaria, Western Australia's north-west shelf, the Ashmore and Cartier Reefs and Scott Reef. They have also been around for more then 100 million years, so the idea that they will all die out if it gets a bit warmer is palpable nonsense.

Acting rules for the EPA are vague and have generally gone unchallenged, and some argued Wheeler could have remained in his current role for the rest of Trump's first term.

Santa Fe: Native Americans go without medical insurance at a much higher rate than the state's other residents, according to a state-commissioned study from the Urban Institute that explores gaps in medical insurance coverage by race and ethnicity as well as age, location and education level. New Mexico fares relatively well overall in terms of paid access to health care services in comparison with the U.S. as a whole. The study found that 187,000 non-elderly residents go without health insurance – about 10.5% of the state population. The national average is just over 11%. Among Native Americans, 37,000 people go with insurance – or 16.2% of the population. Health insurance coverage also is relatively scarce in the northwest area of the state that is home to the Navajo Nation. The Urban Institute found that Native Americans working in the health care and educational fields are especially prone to go without health insurance.

This could have been a very expensive overuse of his money if he can't hit fifteen percent in those two states. But this is why, despite not winning anything so far, Elizabeth Warren is still in this race. Because she sees that she is doing well enough in California and in Texas and in a few of these other states, likely, that she can get above fifteen percent and keep a pool of delegates that keeps her in the race going into later March and April.

Seattle: Mayor Jenny Durkan said Seattle will no longer use fossil fuels like natural gas to heat, cool and cook in new and substantially altered city-owned buildings and will come up with a plan by 2021 to transition all city-owned buildings to clean electric systems over time. Durkan included those directives in a Green New Deal executive order Wednesday. Neither the new KeyArena now under construction at Seattle Center nor the massive Seattle Aquarium expansion pavilion planned for construction starting next year will be covered by the city's new fossil-fuel ban, however, Durkan said. That's because the projects are underway, she said. Both city-owned structures will use a lot of energy. The $930 million new arena and 50,000-square-foot aquarium pavilion will initially be allowed to include some fossil-fuel infrastructure, though both will be included in the city's longer-term electrification plans, Durkan's office said. There's no deadline yet for all city buildings to be fossil-fuel free. Last year, the council passed a Green New Deal resolution that said Seattle would seek to eliminate climate pollutants in the city by 2030.
The proposed changes to the 50-year-old National Environmental Policy Act could sharply reduce obstacles to the Keystone XL oil pipeline and other fossil fuel projects that have been stymied when courts ruled that the Trump administration did not properly consider climate change when analyzing the environmental effects of the projects.
For Democrats to choose a nominee on the far left bank of the political mainstream would cement their reputation as the party that never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity.
This past November, Venice nearly lost another of its gems. At La Fenice, where Verdi debuted his operas La Traviata and Rigoletto, November's flood hit days before the season opener. Once the danger was over, Fortunato Ortombina, La Fenice's artistic director, relived the drama of the panic backstage.
Meanwhile, federal officials never contacted the town's hospital, Regional Medical Center, about handling covid-19 patients, said Louis Bass, the hospital's chief executive.

Simply put, Republicans did not turn out in the numbers needed to beat an energized Democrat campaign. A campaign that was funded by massive contributions from liberals across the nation, spurred by dreams of a progressive future; a future driven by the prospect that taking control of the senate would allow them, as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said, to change the world.

A new study finds the world's oceans are warming significantly faster than previously thought. The analysis, published Thursday in the journal Science, raises the stakes for curbing climate change.
Sure, this ETF rode the coronavirus trend to more than 50% gains last year. But more important is the long-term performance of more than 630% gains since the end of 2010—profits that roughly three times that of the S&P 500 in the same period. The hard reality is that the world faces a host of serious conditions, from cancer to Alzheimer's, and the innovative medical stocks researching potential cures will remain in high demand.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And there are a lot of delegates at stake here on Tuesday. A thousand three hundred forty-four, it's about thirty percent of what's needed for the nomination. So, Ed, how do the candidates sort of crack the threshold? Explain some of the math here.
Though climate change has not figured prominently into the Senate races, Georgia's farms, cities and coastline are vulnerable to sea-level rise, heat waves and other extreme weather linked to rising global warming, according to the National Climate Assessment.

Bloomberg seems to be the only one who can make an argument for top-tier status thanks to his famous name, ability to fund his own campaign and track record as an advocate for gun control. As a party switcher and mega-rich white dude he will have a long way to go to answer concerns from Democratic loyalists, but if he's serious about running after a decade of false starts, he could be a contender.

They most certainly are. The name isn't an exaggeration — these storms develop explosively and quickly. They can produce destructive winds, coastal flooding and erosion, and, of course, very heavy precipitation. If the term conveys the importance and the danger associated with them, then I think that's a good thing.
Baltimore City is already feeling the impacts of climate change in severe storms and flooding, sewage backups and overflows, heatwaves, and polluted air, said Nabeehah Azeez, an organizer with the Baltimore Peoples Climate Movement. Baltimore deserves a fair trial on the basis of climate justice.

The Global Risks Report 2019, published by the World Economic Forum and based on a survey or more than 1,000 experts and decision makers around the world, found climate change risks at their highest-ever level, accounting for more than half of the top 10 risks. Experts are increasingly concerned that efforts to mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions will fail, given the lack of commitment to the investment needed and lack of support from some important players.
The main selling point for these items is resilience, not eco-friendliness.
SEN. SANDERS:-- is that he has the right to do anything he wants. Right now, we are confident, MARGARET, based on the fundraising that we are doing, is that we can beat Trump.
Scientists have long said the world has already warmed 1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels, or about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. And if greenhouse gas emissions ― the prime driver of global warming and, in turn, coral bleaching ― remain unchecked, warming will skyrocket.
Many companies are pushing towards this idea that if we care about a given purpose, it shouldn't be sidelined to a social responsibility report, it should be in our founding documents, it should dictate how we organize our business, how we compensate our executives, the products we choose to sell.
The idea of a Green New Deal has, in just a few months, become a central piece of Ocasio-Cortez's agenda and attracted the attention of ambitious national Democrats.

INGRAHAM: They're not even making any sense. Yes, he is a bad guy, but. If Ronald Reagan was the great communicator, Trump could be the great revealer. At every turn he is forcing Democrats to stumble all over their words, completely contradict what they said five minutes ago, and also the media, they are showing their true colors as well. In this case, they seem to be standing with Iran's sovereign right to exist to foment terror around the world.
The goal of the tour is to invite tens of thousands of young people into the movement, Stephen O'Hanlon, a spokesman for Sunrise Movement, said by phone.

On all those fronts, the new administration will have its work cut out. On climate, any collaboration with China — the world's biggest carbon emitter but also an emerging green-tech giant — will be met with Republican fury at home. On Iran, the landscape has markedly changed after four years of Trumpist maximum pressure; trust between all parties is low. On challenging authoritarianism and upholding liberal values, the mixed record of Biden's own time in office as vice president — which saw the sputtering of democratic revolutions in the Arab world and unchecked military adventurism by Russia — suggests that a liberal renaissance may not be around the corner.

They are asking the government to review and amend the law on marriage, currently defined as between a man and a woman, to the union of two persons, according to their lawyer Hectar Pun.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, two points. I am a member of the Democratic leadership. I have been in the Democratic caucus from my, you know, virtually my first day back in Congress thirty years ago and from-- in the state of Vermont, where I live, I am supported by Democrats that have won the Democratic primary. But we will win because we have an agenda that speaks to independents, to Democrats, and to more than a few Republicans. Look, we are living at a time when the American people are sick and tired of the kind of income and wealth inequality that exists in America. All over this country, Margaret, and I have been all over this country, you got millions of people who work eleven, twelve bucks an hour. They can't afford childcare.

He said that one of the first bills he'd like to pass as Senate majority leader would provide $2,000 stimulus checks to help Americans suffering from the coronavirus pandemic, which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, recently blocked despite President Donald Trump's support for enhanced aid. Democratic senators, who have been in the minority for six years, are now evaluating how to wield their gavels across various committees to address the health and economic crises.
These bromeliads can liven up your house with a hint of red, but they are also great air purifiers when it comes to benzene. The plant can absorb more than 90% of the chemical, which you can find in glue, paint, furniture wax and detergent.

The move follows announcements by the biggest U.S. banks that there are some industries and activities they don't want to finance, such as drilling for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or making loans to gun manufacturers who make assault-style weapons.

This is of course vitally important when the economy is still down more than 9 million jobs since February. We have an estimated 26 million people who are going hungry in the United States, and some 7 million to 14 million at risk of eviction. And many of the jobs lost in the hardest-hit industries, such as retail and hospitality, will not be coming back. Many workers will have to change occupations and some will be unemployed long-term; at present, the percent of unemployed who are long-term (more than six months out of work) is at 36.9%, up from 19.2% in February.
In what may seem paradoxical, as global warming has intensified in recent years, the number of big Northeast snowstorms has increased. In fact, many of the biggest snowstorms in New York City history, like the January blizzard of 2016, have happened in the past two decades. While some of this may be related to natural variability, Cohen feels changes in the Arctic clearly play a role.
If you have a long-term view that you want a fleet of direct air capture scrubbers to scale up and operate over the century, you actually shouldn't be too concerned about what energy supplies are connected to initial deployments, Hanna said.

Officials from several irrigation and water agencies said the restrictions are reasonable, but not the plan to impose them under the state Constitution's prohibition on the waste or unreasonable use of water.

For example, after an ad from Kelly Loeffler highlighted Warnock's domestic abuse issues, a fact-check from a CBS affiliate ran with a story titled Warnock's character questioned in dredged up bodycam of dispute with ex-wife. The term dredged up suggests that the footage of the dispute with his ex-wife was from the distant past, and that resurfacing it was somehow underhanded. Not so, on either count. The video is from March, and the confrontation involved the police.
The goals stem from the state's draft Climate Action Plan, released in November by the Department of Environmental Protection.

The 85-year-old's absence this week from oral arguments -- her first since joining the bench -- after her surgery in December sparked speculation about a possible departure, and even led to low-key planning by the White House for that scenario.

If the new members of Congress are able to govern as they campaigned, tirelessly, unafraid of hostile audiences, deeply connected to their districts, focused on improving individual lives, they might eventually pull politics out of the box in which either one party pushes through an entire unpopular agenda or Congress is paralyzed.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this an admission that the President made a mistake?
Richard Flanagan's article was compelling reading and succinctly reflected the appalling leadership void the Australian community is facing.
In response, they are also threatening to launch or back more aggressive primary challenges in 2020 to Democratic members who oppose or stay silent on the Green New Deal.
The Democratic sweep in Tuesday's Georgia Senate runoff probably won't alter much of the incoming Biden administration's reform agenda. Progressive hopes for everything from action on climate change to judicial reform remain limited, if not nonexistent. Even without the pandemic, the country and the world are marching steadily toward various modes of destruction.
The only words I can really think of to describe what it looked [like] was it looked like a World War I battlefield, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said Tuesday. It was literally a carpet of mud and debris everywhere.
Rhodium Group reported that three of the leading sectors for greenhouse gas emissions — transportation, electric power, and industry — were also among the sectors hardest-hit by pandemic-related shutdowns. For example, with travel far less in demand during the pandemic, emissions from the transportation sector declined 14.7% between 2019 and 2020.
Every four years, the eyes of the world turn to Iowa, and they do so with good reason — because here in Iowa, our caucuses represent true participatory democracy.
So far, the economic fallout has been ― shockingly ― minimal. The stock market has been unbothered; it's been booming for months, as some companies cash in on the pandemic and the Federal Reserve keeping the money flowing.
Heather Mac Donald has thought a lot about this question. She is the author of the book, The Diversity Delusion, a frequent guest on the show, and she joins us tonight. Heather, thanks so much for coming on.
We will debate and advance good ideas no matter where they come from – and in that spirit, Democrats will be offering the Senate Republican appropriations legislation to re-open government later today – to meet the needs of the American people, and to protect our borders, Pelosi will say about the Democrats' immediate agenda.
The Vancouver-based company said it will take a $1.13-billion writedown on the Frontier project in Alberta, which was expected to create an estimated 7,000 construction jobs, 2,500 operating jobs and about $12 billion in federal income and capital taxes, but was also expected to produce about four million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per year over 40 years.
We're fully supportive and we look forward to the opportunities to have thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of people go to work in the construction industry once these reforms are fully in place, said Sean McGarvey, president of the North America's Building Trades Unions.
Of the 3 inches -- 7.5 centimeters -- of sea level rise in the past quarter century, about 55 percent is from warmer water expanding, and the rest is from melting ice. But the process is accelerating, and more than three-quarters of that acceleration since 1993 is due to melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, the study shows.

In fact, Renaissance became one of the most successful hedge fund companies in the world. Its Medallion fund, which is mainly a tax-free employee retirement fund, racked up annual gains of more than 70 percent between 1994 and 2014, according to Bloomberg.
While there is little formal polling on it, the document's been heavily critiqued on social media, with people particularly drawing attention to its ideas around Alberta's unique culture and the assertion that the province is treated like a colony, many calling the latter statement outright racist.

The shift to work-from-home could have long-term environmental benefits — the equivalent of taking 14 million cars off U.S. roads every year, according to one estimate. But there's also a downside for those white-collar workers, mainly in the form of their work-from-home power bill.

For perspective, we might interject that today, carbon fuels—oil, gas, and coal—account for 77.6 percent of U.S. energy consumption. And that's all supposed to go to zero in 11 years? Hmmm.
Warren, Harris and Booker have also backed separate Medicare-for-all plans.
Armstrong's challenge was in response to Gore's warning of a looming dangerous tipping point in global mean temperatures. His proposal of a $10,000 bet was intended to draw attention to the need to assess the predictive validity of climate forecasts in an objective manner. Armstrong issued his challenge based on the knowledge that predictions of dangerous global warming were the product of methods that violated 72 of 89 forecasting principles relevant to the forecasting problem.
VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTE: Yes, I think that Trump has really confused people, Laura, because he showed restraint by not reacting to the interception of ships in the Gulf of Hormuz earlier. He didn't react to the drone attack. And then when he did, he didn't brag about it.
His demand for suburbia's death comes after he helped to make suburbia expensive by urging more immigration.
You're coming into a Congress that has a lot of bold-face progressive names, including some new folks. There's talk of the four-woman Squad growing in size.
I hope so. One glimmer of [hope from] the protests this summer was it was by and large a multiracial effort, mostly by young people. And that, I think, gives me a little bit of hope that the youth this time around may be a little bit more inclusive. But I'm not sure.
But even as they worry about the disappointing numbers, countries remain very divided on what to do next. In fact, we may be witnessing the return of an economic nationalism that threatens withdrawal from the global market.
This is the biggest issue in American politics today, Steyer said. We have a lawless president in the White House who is eroding our democracy and it is only going to get worse. Donald Trump's removal from power ultimately decides whether or not we can tackle every other challenge we face in America — and whether or not we continue to live in a democracy of, for, and by the people.
The southern part of Australia has warmed by 2.7 degrees since 1950, according to climate researcher Zeke Hausfather, climate and energy director at the Breakthrough Institute. This is consistent with the period of faster human-caused warming worldwide.
This advice resonates with what I had been picking up over a couple of weeks of conversations with people in and around the organization: Much of the Federalist Society's influence comes not from its very public Washington victories but from its behind-the-scenes, grass-roots ability to shift the law at the idea level, even the cultural level. And so, a glimpse of the impact yet to come could be had at far tables fanning out to the corners of Union Station where the sound is bad — the law students and professors from Houston, Boston and Los Angeles; the young lawyers at the dawn of long careers scarfing fancy food at tables underwritten by their firms. Let the politicians build the coalitions to confirm conservative judges and roll back the administrative state, Olowski says. That's not the Federalist Society's job. The Federalist Society's job is to put these ideas out there. And of course, as James Madison could tell us, ideas tend to outlive presidents, political majorities and even judges.
And I think the experience that we've seen is that unless we are going to be aggressive about climate change, unless we're going to have a real plan for education and the economy of the future, young people will vote elsewhere.
Although planned portions of the rules relating to the House's handling of ObamaCare were tabled for the future, the 234-197 vote marked a decisive defeat of New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's opposition to the measure.
Even more disturbing, Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal includes upgrading every residential and industrial building for state-of-the-art energy efficiency, comfort and safety, a plan that would cost trillions of dollars and give government access to every household in America.

I have never been alone with Kate Upton, Marciano said in the statement. I have never touched her inappropriately. Nor would I ever refer to a Guess model in such a derogatory manner.
The past decade shifted our view of global politics. Long gone is any certainty in the inexorability of liberal democracy — single-party states still flourish, while demagogic populism and far-right nationalism are powerful forces within many of the world's major democracies. Rights groups warn of the erosion of once-healthy democracies and new threats to freedom and privacy posed by government cyber surveillance.
Mr. Sanders has embraced the title of socialist, putting himself to the left even of many democrats. On first winning election to the House of Representatives in 1990, he famously said, I am a socialist and everyone knows that.

Robert Socolow, another Princeton colleague, has mixed feelings about Happer's post. Socolow's own biography — first a physicist, then a specialist on the environment — makes him a kind of bridge between Happer and the environmental scientists on Princeton's campus. He doesn't doubt Happer's technical grasp of climate science but says that everybody has areas of irrationality.
Congress enacted a wide range of reforms that promised to restrain presidential power. The War Powers Act of 1973 created mechanisms to ensure that Congress authorized the deployment of American troops abroad. The Budget Reform of 1974 centralized the process used by the House and the Senate to make decisions about spending money so as to make the legislative branch more of an equal of the executive. The Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1974 established a system of public finance for presidential elections along with spending and contribution limits.

Yang is running on a platform to provide a universal basic income of $1,000 a month for every American adult. An entrepreneur and tech industry veteran, Yang, 44, says he wants to protect the nation from the impending dangers he sees in automation. He has a prominent online following — and has surprised the many who doubted his long-shot run by ticking upward in the polls, qualifying for the third and fourth Democratic presidential debates.
Politico: Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown is preparing the biggest step yet toward a potential presidential campaign: a trip to Iowa in the coming weeks, which is in the final stages of planning and will soon be announced, according to four people with knowledge of the trip. Going to Iowa would be the latest signal from Brown and his wife, Connie Schultz, that he is considering a White House run organized around the 'dignity of work,' the theme of his reelection campaign last year. But preparations go beyond public statements as Brown's longtime aide and current chief of staff, Sarah Benzing works backstage to set up a campaign — with a particular focus on Iowa, where she grew up and worked on a series of congressional, Senate and presidential efforts earlier in her career. … And she has spent the weeks since Brown's reelection to the Senate … calling her Iowa network, seeking advice and operatives to staff a Brown presidential bid.

MARGARET BRENNAN: --the first ten days.
The bill's announcement comes nearly two weeks after an equipment malfunction at a Consolidated Edison substation next door to the Astoria Generating Station released an electric arc flash that illuminated the city sky with an eerie neon blue. The accident, the result of a broken voltage monitoring system, had no direct connection to the neighboring power plant.
For this particular SSW event it appears the main Arctic outbreak will occur first over Europe and eastern Asia through mid-January. But then computer models show a shift occurring, with the potential for Arctic invasions in the U.S. later this month.
The European Union's investment pact with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been characterised as a real setback for the free world by the founder of Hong Kong Watch, as human rights campaigners, diplomats, and others chastise the bloc for cosying up to the dictatorship in Beijing.
WALLACE: We'll ask Mayor Pete Buttigieg about his pitch to voters in Nevada, South Carolina, and the Super Tuesday states.
Some of what Sanders dared Biden on wasn't too challenging. He asked Biden, Are you really going to veto a 'Medicare for All' bill, if it is passed in Congress?
Because the use of fire is a traditional part of tropical agriculture to clean agricultural land, grazing land, it is very difficult to stop it, Alves said in an email.

Mayor, let's start with the numbers from the two states which are going to be holding contests over the next few weeks, put them up on the screen. In Nevada, you're in fifth place with 10 percent support. In South Carolina, you're also in fifth place with 7.5 percent support. You're trailing Tom Steyer in both states.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark, one of the other things that may not be breaking through but is a big headline today is the National Security advisor in Israel making an announcement that seems to be yet another change in the Syria policy. The President said he was pulling troops out in thirty days, then we stretched that to a hundred and twenty days. Now what's being described as a total indefinite stay of U.S. troops in Syria. What are people of the Pentagon actually being told to do?
Pressed on whether cutting back or eliminating altogether programs that help the poor was not being compassionate toward people who needed help the most, Mulvaney said that passing this budget was one of the most compassionate things we can do because it was being compassionate toward taxpayers who are funding those programs.
By signing, Inslee is laying the groundwork for a historic, if long-shot, bid for the presidency on the single issue of scaling back planet-warming emissions and preparing for climate change. The move is bold but timely. Record-breaking storms, droughts and wildfires wreaked havoc across the U.S. over the past three years as President Donald Trump attempted to boost the fossil fuel industry by gutting or delaying nearly every major federal climate regulation.
Don't have a backyard? No problem. The Great Backyard Bird Count can be done anywhere, whether that's standing on a street outside an apartment, looking out a window at the office, or wandering around a park.
There are reasons for hope. Myriad governments have embraced ambitious plans to transition their economies toward being carbon neutral. The incoming Biden administration intends to add momentum to global climate efforts abandoned by President Trump, while Chinese President Xi Jinping said last month that China plans to decrease its carbon footprint to at least 65 percent of where it was in 2005 by 2030. The World Economic Forum — a bastion of optimism — foresees a future in 2030 in which urban centers are transformed into zones shaped by pedestrian activity, technology increasingly obviates the need to own cars, fewer people eat meat, people breathe cleaner air and renewable, clean energy dominates the energy sector.
enough widespread fraud to overturn any vote in any state. But the pressure
Some Republicans in Congress, including several representing districts particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, also rebuked reports of Trump's decision. Climate change is a serious issue, tweeted Rep. Vern Buchanan of Florida — with a photo of development near a Florida beach.
Harvard University, where Lessig teaches law, is currently under scrutiny for allegedly discriminating against Asian-Americans in the university's admission process.

Comey has punched back with indirect posts seemingly aimed at Trump and his associates on Twitter and Instagram.
The wife of Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) said in an interview with the Christian Post that the Joe Biden administration will be just as strong as the Trump administration on the issue of religious freedom.
To see the painted bunting, here, just minutes away from her home? Vickie Kwong's eyes lit up at the thought. She clapped her hands together in excitement.
We might pause over that word: contain. That is, the people of Brazil just elected a new leader, knowing full well of his pro-growth agenda. And yet now, the Sierra Club, and other Western Greens, seek to contain him—and, by extension, to contain the Brazilian standard of living.

We have 12 years, according to science, if we're going to meet the challenge of the climate crisis. And to do that we have to tackle fossil fuels head-on. And the resolution just doesn't quite get us there, says Nicole Ghio, senior fossil fuel program manager at Friends of the Earth.
And, let's not kid ourselves. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department didn't just bail out shadow banks. As a result of an amendment that I offered to audit the emergency lending activities of the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis, we learned that the Fed provided more than $16 trillion in short-term, low-interest loans to every major financial institution in the country including Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, not to mention large corporations, foreign banks, and foreign central banks throughout the world.
Sanford's top issue was improving public schools. Per pupil spending in North Carolina then was well below the national average. As governor, he persuaded the state legislature to raise taxes and use the proceeds to make schools better. His plan added 2,800 teachers, raised teacher pay 22 percent, improved teacher training, doubled library money and increased money for school supplies.

Need to Know:Irrational exuberance? Why last year's stellar returns may have been a reversal of 'excessive pessimism'
House Democrats on Thursday created a new select committee on climate change, but it has been denounced by environmental activists preferring a bolder approach.
He never was able to get a foothold. And the two things that you point out, the two major policy positions on abortion and on immigration, he never got enough support that those policies were actually scrutinized.
But behind these headlines, the dysfunction in U.S. policy reflects trend lines that have been clear since Trump took office. First, the killing of Soleimani is emblematic of Trump's tendency to come up with solutions to problems America didn't necessarily have. He did this by withdrawing from the Paris climate accord; recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel; withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria; and exiting a flawed but still highly functional Iran nuclear accord — arguably the reason we are now in this crisis with Iran.
WALLACE: Well, it -- we've got less than a minute left.
Responding to Rhodium's analysis, May Boeve, executive director of climate advocacy group 350.org, stressed that the Trump administration energy and environmental policies come with consequences.

According to the Gallup study, based on polling data, the percentage of Democrats identifying as liberal averaged 51 percent in 2018. That was up from 50 percent in 2017, but underscores a steady increase over the years. In 1994, only 25 percent identified as liberal and another 25 percent identified as conservative. Among Americans overall, conservatives outnumbered liberals by nine points, although that is down from 19 points in Gallup's first poll in 1992.
Trump impeachment:Pelosi says she'll send Senate articles of impeachment against Trump 'soon'
Emissions from buildings increased by 54 million tons last year, a sevenfold increase from its typical rate of increase. That's partly because of weather, with a colder winter requiring more heating, but Rhodium expects population growth to keep driving emissions in this sector.
Chuck, this fire was started back in, you know, January of 2017, Mr. Johnson responded, criticizing what he perceived as bias in the news media throughout Mr. Trump's term and pointing to a tweet from a lawyer for the government whistle-blower whose concerns helped spur impeachment proceedings. On CNN's State of the Union, Stacey Abrams, a voting rights activist in Georgia, described as troubling efforts by Republicans to declare victory for someone who clearly lost the election. She made a distinction between what Republicans in the Senate planned to do and her own efforts in 2018, when she lost a bid for governor and refused to concede. I never challenged the outcome of the election, she said. I challenged the system that denied access to the right to vote. Appearing on MSNBC, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic majority leader, said the Republican effort would fail but would nonetheless be a sad day for democracy. It is just a tragedy that so many members of the House and the Senate are undermining the confidence in our democracy, he said.

The book is a rallying cry against what Harris views as the un-American policies of the Trump administration, alongside her set of policy alternatives. She casts herself as a champion for everyday Americans against the powerful, and she is unsparing in her disdain for the policies of President Donald Trump.

Lincoln: A state lawmaker concerned about prison overcrowding plans to propose building a new 300-bed work release facility in Omaha. State Sen. Steve Lathrop tells the Omaha World-Herald he'll introduce a bill calling on the state to begin planning a new community corrections facility. Building the new facility could cost more than $40 million, but Lathrop's bill would only require the state to plan for the new work release facility. Nebraska's prisons currently hold 2,006 more inmates than their design capacity of 3,535 inmates, putting the prison system at 157% of its design capacity. Lathrop says the state is facing a prison overcrowding crisis and needs to address the issue. A consultant recommended expanding Omaha's community corrections prison in 2014, but the project was never done. Lathrop says work-release facilities can help better prepare inmates to return to society.
My opponent says that, as a senator, she told bankers to cut it out and end their destructive behavior. But, in my view, establishment politicians are the ones who need to cut it out.

Along with the late lyricist Fred Ebb, who died in 2004, he wrote the songs for such musicals as Cabaret, Chicago and The Kiss Of The Spider Woman, and for the film New York, New York. When Terry spoke with John Kander in 2015, he had just released a double CD called John Kander: Hidden Treasures. It collected many of his demo recordings as well as recordings of great songs from his shows that weren't hits.
Florence: Authorities are investigating the fatal shooting of an airport public safety officer officer in Florence. A man shot and killed the officer Sunday morning during a traffic stop at Florence Regional Airport, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division said in a news release. Florence County Coroner Keith von Lutcken identified the victim as Jackson Ryan Winkeler, 26, of Dillon, WPDE-TV reports. The suspect, 37-year-old James Edward Bell, initially fled but was later captured by Florence County deputies, officials said. Winkeler also volunteered with the Latta Fire Department, which lowered its flag to half-staff Sunday.
Republican challengers unseated two of those Democrats, and the remaining one, Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.), is expected to support Wheeler again.
Elsewhere in the United Arab Emirates, the emirate of Ras al-Khaimah attempted to set a new Guinness World Record with the longest straight-line display of fireworks reaching 7.35 miles (11.83 kilometers).

The results mirror support for Ocasio-Cortez, whose surprise primary victory over the summer skyrocketed the 29-year-old to national fame. In Rice's district, 52 percent of those polls viewed Ocasio-Cortez favorably, of which 56 percent said they'd support a Green New Deal proponent in a 2020 primary.
The former judge said she found a culture of deference, subservience, acquiescence and silence and recommended that people in management roles, including Bercow, should consider their positions. The Speaker has been the subject of multiple bullying allegations, which he denies.

The pandemic revealed both how insecure so many workers are, and that many of the most insecure, undervalued jobs are essential ― essential to our health, safety and well-being. From the farm worker and grocery worker to the child care and home care worker ― many of our essential workers lacked the wages, paid sick time and family leave, access to health care and family care needed to keep themselves safe as they were keeping us all safe. We must never forget that essential workers are essential all of the time, and that all work in America should offer the basic safety and security that allows for our collective well-being.
The Green Party is now the country's second largest, polling at 22% behind the CDU's 28%. The SPD, like most European center-left parties, is down to historic lows, polling at 14%. The question of a green-conservative alliance will be one of the most discussed in the coming months.

BAIER (voice-over): It's all comes down to Tuesday in these crucial runoff
What we have got to do now, Sanders said, is to see if we can get a handful of Republican senators to understand that climate change is real, that environmental protection is enormously important for this country, and get them on board to demand that Trump appoint an EPA administrator who represents the American people and not just the fossil fuel industry.
WALLACE: All right. Panel, we have to take a break here.
You can keep reminding people of data and science that climate change is happening and that polar bears are going to ultimately disappear, but at some point, you have to slap people in the face and just say, 'This is what's happening, this is what climate change looks like,' Nicklen said.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is a bad guy. He's gone now. But the point is, what is Trump's foreign policy? It's incoherent.
If they are anomalous, though, how come this fact doesn't show up in NOAA's temperature charts?
WALLACE: Another question for the new chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
We've got some great people out there who are thinking of running, he said. They are my friends. And I've got to make that decision that, based on my background, based on my past, based on my ideas that, in fact, I am the candidate that can defeat Trump.
According to a document obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, Trump officials discussed how to block such research in a Jan. 25, 2018, briefing on the proposed rule. Referring to Harvard's Six Cities study and another pollution study conducted by the American Cancer Society, the notes read, The scientific community has identified major shortcomings in the methodologies and findings of these studies, all of which could be addressed if EPA provided the underlying data for independent review.
The Fire Weather Index is based on weather conditions like temperature, wind, humidity and rainfall combined with the moisture content of vegetation, or lack thereof. This numerical index is used worldwide to estimate fire danger.
Recently we heard from an adviser in the Trump administration. Michael Anton's official title is deputy assistant to the president for strategic communications at the National Security Council. He says he's been so consumed by the day-to-day, he's had little chance to focus on the long term — despite that he came to prominence as a man who was trying to think long term. In 2016, while working at an investment firm, Anton anonymously published essays that sought to make sense of the Trump phenomenon. The most famous was The Flight 93 Election. Anton compared Trump voters to passengers on the plane hijacked on Sept. 11, 2001, who were choosing to rush the cockpit. They might still die but it was their only hope.
U.S. criticized for inequality and cuts in welfare
The 2016 U.S. Democratic presidential candidate made the comment on CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS show on International Women's Day, Sunday. Clinton used the sticker as an example of what she called appalling overt misogyny that persists across the globe.
Meanwhile, on Wednesday, President Donald Trump threatened to cut off wildfire aid to California from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. He said in a now-deleted tweet that state officials had to get their act together, which is unlikely and improve forest management.
Much of the work involves design, assembly and place-making. Sarah J. Hull's Stasis is a large fabric square made of smaller squares, neatly geometric yet intentionally rough in execution. Alanna Reeves's embroidered monoprints contrast grids and organic forms. Madeline A. Stratton's cartoonish, candy-colored domestic interiors are smaller versions of the work reviewed in this column in November.

A relatively uncontroversial Democrat could win the next presidential election if he or she appeals to moderates, comes across as sane and competent, proposes practical solutions, and is competitive in key battleground states such as Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
MARGARET BRENNAN: How is a mistake like that made? Because people are very nervous right now and getting some of these basic facts right affects public trust.
The pandemic has changed that, of course.
It is important to note that the Paris accord is only as strong as each nation's actual reduction in emissions. That means leaving the agreement isn't the only way to weaken it: Trump could have kept the U.S. as a signatory but continued to slash the programs that would actually make it possible to reach the target for emissions.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So in France, they shut down the Louvre Museum. They're telling people, don't kiss, don't shake hands. In Japan, they're closing schools for a month. Canada's health minister told his people to start stockpiling food. In the U.S. there are closures, as we just said, in Washington and in Oregon. They've declared a state of emergency out there. And the CDC said this week, disruption to everyday life might be severe.
Grizzly populations in the Yellowstone region and northwest Montana flourished. Today, there are an estimated 1,400 to 1,700 grizzly bears in the contiguous U.S.
Manjoo is one of many young status-seeking progressives who want to abolish the ideal suburbia because they cannot afford to buy housing in fashionable districts. So he wants government to help investors fracture, diversify, split, and subdivide ordinary Americans' suburbia into affordable mini-homes, duplexes, four-unit apartments, and parking lots.

And the window in which to do them is closing in places like the southeast. This is prime time for prescribed fire there. I talked to Jim Karels, the director of the Florida Forest Service, and he says the feds have already missed out on three weeks of good burning conditions there.
WALLACE: But Barr said the tweets are making it impossible to do his job.
Although Sanders and his campaign team were not directly involved in Saturday's events, the house parties were co-sponsored by People for Bernie and Our Revolution, the latter group created to carry on the mission of Sanders' 2016 campaign.

The GCF is designed to do this in a range of ways, says Martinez-Diaz, who is now global director of the Sustainable Finance Center at the World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank. For example, if a private company is leery of investing in climate projects because of political and financial risks, the GCF will offer it loans, loan guarantees, or other forms of insurance.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's not winner take all.
archived recording (scott morrison) I also want to acknowledge the outstanding work that is being done.
In an interview with USA TODAY, she mocked Trump for his shifting explanations of what his wall might be, which he initially described as a cement structure that Mexico would finance. Now he's down to, I think, a beaded curtain or something, she said.
60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft reported on the case last year. He spoke with Oregon lawyer Julia Olson, who recruited the climate kids from environmental groups around the country. Their suit alleged that the use of fossil fuels is causing climate change, and the government's continued support of the fossil fuel industry endangers the plaintiffs' future and violates their constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property.
The future of grizzly bears is in the hands of the people who live, work and recreate in bear habitat, he says. And if those people feel that no matter what they do, nothing's ever going to change, nothing's ever good enough, then they won't invest the time in helping with recovery.
Then the Trump administration signs a peace deal with the Taliban to end the war in Afghanistan. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is just back from that signing ceremony with the Taliban, and we will talk to him.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You have rallies planned out in California. There is very much a concern about the spread of the coronavirus on the West Coast. Is it safe for you? Have you spoken to any government officials about whether people can really appear at your rally and not worry about their own health?
Senator, you'll be campaigning and we will be her covering it. Thank you

The new measure of actual ocean heat matches almost perfectly the average projection from the best coupled ocean-atmosphere models (CMIP5). By this metric, the climate models are performing very well. It gives climate scientists and the public greater reason for confidence in future projections.

The insects grow in size extremely fast, but only live three to five months. Within that short lifespan, however, a locust population can explode if left unchecked. The swarms have grown so big that one spotted in Kenya contained about 200 billion individual locusts, occupying a space in the sky three times the size of New York City.
Since the review, McCarthy has ordered the firing, suspension, or re-assignment of 14 of Fort Hood's senior leadership – a number of whom were part of CID. It marks one of the most significant punitive actions ever executed by the service.

Amid the worldwide pandemic, many indigenous peoples quickly organized to self-isolate, cancel big events, and translate health guides into native tongues, according to Vargas. However, hunger during the quarantine also poses problem, forcing indigenous people to ask for donations of food and clean water.

MIKE POMPEO: They have an enormous amount of American blood on their hands.
The challenge isn't just confined to the winter, of course. Chilly offices have long been the bane of women who complain air conditioning is cranked up in the summer to appease their male, suit-wearing counterparts. And there are certainly many offices with overzealous furnaces that prompt workers to crack open windows even on the coldest days.

Martinez-Diaz notes that the GCF was never meant to be the only channel for mobilizing the $100 billion per year that rich countries promised would flow annually to poor countries by 2020. Not even as an intermediary or pass-through, he says. It was meant to be one of several financing mechanisms. Other examples include multilateral development banks like the World Bank.
Frederick served as a Clinton-era assistant to the solicitor general from 1996 to 2001 and appeared on the Obama administration's short list for the top job in 2008.
Even amid a three-week partial government shutdown leaving federal workers scrambling for pay, the Trump administration is continuing to approve oil and gas drilling permits, Bloomberg reported.
But the president uses this contrived failure as a pretext to arrogate the authority of another branch of government. He wields his pen to legislate by executive decree. He well knows he is exceeding his power. In 2011, he said, I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the (immigration) on my own. But that's not how our system works. That's not how our democracy functions. That's not how our Constitution is written. He was right. It was a rare moment of clarity for a man who fancies himself a constitutional scholar.
He said he's lost count of how many times he's retired over the years.
Green predicted that Senate Republicans' excessive use of the filibuster against popular legislative priorities might eventually soften Manchin's opposition to getting rid of the tool ― or at least, dramatically curtailing its use.

Sanders maintains that he is still considering whether he is the best person to defeat President Donald Trump.
Inslee is the second governor to sign the pledge, following newly elected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D). California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), who was sworn in this week, took a similar pledge ― called Oil Money Out ― but the oath was limited to the oil industry in the Golden State. But Inslee is the third likely contender for the next Democratic presidential nomination to take the pledge, after Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.).
I would have preferred for them to leave and in hindsight we should have left, he said. I don't know how I got lulled.
People talk a little bit too broadly about the athletes' social movements. The WNBA players have generally been really far ahead of the curve, and beyond that, extremely organized.

For years, BlackRock basically said that, even as the largest owner of stocks in the world — investing the assets of big customers like public pension funds and corporate 401(k) plans that hold the assets of millions of workers — it had little ability to push social issues like climate change or gun regulation. That's because BlackRock offers what are called passive index funds that track everything from the S&P 500 to the companies in fast-growing economies like Brazil and China.
The lesson here is, tested, installed and maintained protection works effectively, Gritzo replied. One sprinkler, he said, would reduce a fire to a distraction, rather than a disaster.
Those folks want Alberta — and sometimes other Western provinces — to leave Canada to a certain degree. Some want to form a new country, others propose joining the United States while others just want Alberta to start governing more of itself a la Quebec.
But the novel coronavirus posed a different kind of challenge.
[Ed. note: I guess I must have gotten a little too crabby sounding about our pitiful Congress, Mr. Hutchins! I remain highly optimistic about our future. Not to be too self-promotional but the book I wrote last year was about that very idea. We have had much closer brushes with authoritarianism in our past. We have also had periods of much deeper chaos, including a period between the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963 and the American defeat in Vietnam in 1975. It has been worse before and in the not too distant past. We can do this and I believe the current trials and tribulations will result, as they did before, in a renewal of our commitment to republicanism and democracy.]
Trump's Wall Doesn't Scare These Seasoned Illegal Border Crossers
Vice has no depth or insight. The choppy, scattered story rolls out like a series of marginal-to-bad Saturday Night Live/Funny or Die skits. McKay was a longtime writer at the former and a co-founder of the latter, and boy does it show.
The California Department of Water Resources notes: On average, California receives about 200 million acre-feet of water per year in the form of rain and snow. (It adds that the state rarely experiences an average year.) The state's reservoirs can capture about 42 million acre-feet of that — roughly one-fifth. The rest seeps into underground aquifers, or flows out to the sea.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this now a two-man race?
These support levels would translate into a substantial delegate lead for Sanders. We estimate that his current support in California would yield nearly half of the state's massive delegate prize, with Biden and Elizabeth Warren splitting the rest. In Texas, voters' current intentions translate into a narrower delegate lead for Sanders over Biden, with Warren trailing them. And Mike Bloomberg, who is just under the 15% delegate threshold statewide, is in position to pick up delegates in specific districts, as many as a few dozen in his better simulations.
I'm not sure how we lost our ability to coexist, but if I had to guess, social media and the carefully curated world of the smartphone have given us a staggering sense of self-importance that tells us our opinions are the only ones worth hearing. It almost makes sense in a world where we never stop sharing our hot takes and our hot meals. We no longer keep up with the Kardashians, we are the Kardashians, minus the great work on prison reform.

Ontario's emissions have been falling since the mid-2000s, largely because the Liberals phased out coal plants. Wynne, who still sits in the legislature as an MPP, sometimes shouts, You're welcome, when PCs say Ontario has cut its emissions.

As the estimated 7,500 marchers converge on the state capitol, I come upon Chris Bray and his children, sixth-grader Arianna and second-grader Colin. Dressed in plaid shorts and blue sunglasses, Colin hovers shyly behind a homemade sign (a picture of coal with the word Why? and a shining sun with the words Why not?). The boy is scared about the planet, he tells me, but it feels good to be surrounded by so many other people who care, since he can sometimes feel as if nobody else is worried.
Shortly after leaving the meeting, Pelosi told a private gathering of fellow Democrats that the wall was a like a manhood thing for Trump, a comment seemingly calibrated to unnerve the president — and promptly and widely leaked to the media.
Some of the efforts are small, like Denver's decision to create a list of air-conditioned facilities where residents can take refuge during heat waves. Others are more ambitious: In Alaska, officials are preparing to relocate several native villages in danger of being washed away by seas that no longer freeze solid for months at a time. Many more fall into the middle, like the decision by Florida Keys officials to raise up portions of their low-lying roads to serve as flood barriers, or efforts by Austin, Texas, to reduce water consumption in anticipation of droughts in.

There is, in short, a gross mistrust in governments and politicians, which means that asking for sacrifices today in exchange for the promise of a better life tomorrow won't pass muster. And this is especially true of trickle down policies: tax cuts for the rich that eventually are supposed to benefit everyone else.
Instead of carrying out many of its current functions, the agency would primarily support States and Tribes in their important role protecting air, land, and water in the 21st Century, the document adds.
On Sunday, Iran effectively backed out of a nuclear deal with world powers, saying it would no longer abide by operational restrictions on its enrichment of uranium. The Trump administration withdrew from the agreement, which was negotiated by President Barack Obama, in May 2018.

Peduto's position is in line with his constituents' evolving politics. Since Trump's election, Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh and its immediate suburbs, has moved to the left politically, with Democrats flipping two state Senate seats and one seat on the county council.
COONS: Well, frankly, I think the confirmation of Justice Gorsuch was conducted in a completely sort of measured and appropriate way in terms of its beginning, middle and end. What made the confirmation hearings of Justice Kavanaugh so difficult and ultimately so divisive was that there were credible allegations of sexual assault and we entered sort of a second phase of the hearing.
He's the Saddam Hussein of economics. He's one of the fat cats that the president says causes the problem. He was on the board of governors of the Federal Reserve from 2002 to 2005 and was chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers from 2005 to January 2006. In February 2006 he was appointed as a member of the board for a 14-year term and to a four-year term as chairman.
Over the past couple of years, he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change. They aim to give medical professionals in low-income countries real leadership roles. At the university level, students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field's colonial history in global health curriculum. And communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media. Many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags #ShiftThePower and #DecolonizeGlobalHealth.
WALLACE: So you think you could legitimately beat Donald Trump?
Character is on the ballot, Biden said in Waukee on Thursday in a speech aimed at President Trump, according to CBS News Campaign Reporter Bo Erickson. Does it matter if a president lies? Does it matter if a president has no moral compass? Does it matter if a president believes they're above the law? Does it matter if a president is petty? Mean? Cruel? Spiteful? Does the character of a president matter? I believe the answer to each and every one of those questions is yes.

Now, the mounting intensity and lifespan of tropical cyclones has sparked the question among climate scientists: is a new classification needed? Should there actually be a Category 6 storm?
We're going to call on President-elect Biden to lean into the agenda that he ran on, which was bold with a vision for addressing climate change and racial and economic justice, said Saenz. We know that our job will continue to be to hold him accountable to his promises, to support him and support other elected officials when they do right, and to campaign hard against those that would stand in the way.
So, it's not -- it's disingenuous to say that people -- presidents don't comment on criminal matters.
Either way, we are seeing an administration taking a dramatic course of action that was not well thought through either on the front end (why Soleimani was killed) or on the back end (how would this impact U.S. interests in a volatile region). And a president driven by any number of motives that are still opaque — from anger over pictures on cable news, to frustration with impeachment, to a desire to appear tough and bold in the wake of Iran's rocket attacks that killed an American contractor and wounded U.S. servicemen.
Notice that I said related to rather than caused by climate change. This is a distinction that has flummoxed many people over the years. Any individual weather event has multiple causes, which was one reason news reports used to avoid mentioning the possible role of climate change in natural disasters.
There's an old saying in horse racing that you've gotta be a mudder who can run on a sloppy track in order to win the big races. We were all mudders in 2020. The track got sloppier by the second but if you're reading this it's because you found a way to keep going. You may not have won the race but give yourself credit just for finishing because as years go, 2020 was one of the longest decades ever.
Before the 1980s, mass bleaching of corals was unheard of, even during strong El Niño conditions, but now repeated bouts of regional-scale bleaching and mass mortality of corals has become the new normal around the world as temperatures continue to rise, Terry Hughes, the study's lead author and the director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies in Australia, said in a statement.
Five states ― Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Rhode Island ― and a number of cities ― including New York, Baltimore and Oakland, California ― have filed lawsuits since then, making the case that some of the biggest oil companies operating in the U.S. broke the law by hiding the reality of climate change.
SEN. SANDERS: Well, look, Mr. Bloomberg is free to do anything he can with his 60 billion dollars, and that's legal. All I can say is at this point, we are confident that we can receive the kind of campaign funding that we need from working class and middle class people, that we don't have to be beholden to any powerful special interests. Look, one of the things that upsets people--
It sort of is! The issues and concerns outlined are very similar to those put forward by the folks behind Wexit, aka the separatist movement.
Still, in the last Congress, there were 116 attacks against the Endangered Species Act, according to the Center for Biological Diversity. Bills and riders added to them were proposed to delist specific species, limit habitat protections, and to block funding for species like the New Mexico meadow jumping mouse. None passed into law.
To more liberal Democrats, the prospect of such an ambitious economic and environmental package at the center of the 2020 campaign may be particularly energizing.
He is a damn good scientist, says Steven Koonin, a prominent physicist who is now a professor at New York University and who has known Happer for 30 years. There are two really significant contributions associated with him.
The legal strategy has already been embraced by several California cities and counties, but prior lawsuits seeking to blame companies for their role in causing climate change have foundered.

Was there a hole that needed to be filled that you needed to write a new song for?

Mindful that farmers could be hurt by stricter radiation standards, the co-op set up a fund in 2013 to provide compensation to farmers whose produce had been rejected. The money, which was raised in a donations drive, helps pay for measures to reduce radiation pollution on the affected properties.
Opponents cite what they say would be the risk of environmental damage from the construction and from the operation of the terminal. They also question the safety of transporting 3 million to 4 million gallons of LNG a day through the Philadelphia metropolitan area — to a site that for a century was a DuPont dynamite factory.

Here in Nevada, for example, we've got over 100 organizers on the ground, volunteers as we speak getting ready to go out and talk to fellow Nevadans in a state that looks to the future and in a state where I'm encountering a lot of workers concerned about how these political decisions are going to affect them. Whether it's workers who are concerned about health care and how to preserve the health care choice that is so important to them, people concerned about immigration reform and wanting to know that we're seriously going to get something done. And a lot of people looking to the future worried about climate.
This is the problem of presenting your purity above your practicality, said Democratic strategist Chris Lippincott, who has not endorsed any of the 2020 primary candidates. When we think about certain candidates who talk a lot about the environment … you're going to hold them to a different standard.
The divisions over water storage do not match partisan divisions on other issues. In the Central Valley, Democrats tend to be as vociferous in their advocacy for water storage as Republicans are. And in the past, Republicans were as skeptical of such projects as urban Democrats are today.
A key reason for the activist left's emphasis on economic recovery funding is its experience with the first two years of the Obama administration. Progressives blame deficit hawks in the Obama White House for blocking economist Christina Romer from presenting Obama with an option for a stimulus package that exceeded $1 trillion ― a figure closer to the size of the hole in the economy than the roughly $800 billion bill Obama ultimately settled on.
While Mullan believes in the power of therapy to reverse this course, she acknowledges its current limits.

One major consequence of a Democratic Senate would be the nominees the Biden administration sends to Capitol Hill for confirmation. Faced with the threat of Democratic filibusters, Senate Republicans during the Trump administration turned to filling the federal judicial ranks with judges they hoped would be friendly to conservative causes.
Some subscribe to the theory that the government we should want is a divided government, one where the excesses of one party can all be checked by the other. But that's a theory, if you subscribe to it, for a time when we are not in the throes of the largest national crisis in a century. That may be a theory for when we are not at war. A theory for a time Americans shouldn't have to wonder whether government inaction means they won't have enough money to eat, or keep their homes, if they are unemployed.

The analysis comes on the heels of two gut-wrenching climate reports, one by the United Nations and another authored by scientists from more than a dozen federal agencies in the U.S., that warn the world is running out of time to stave off catastrophic, and potentially irreversible, climate change.
What does it mean, for instance, that two men amassed enough wealth this year to end all hunger in America (with a price tag of $25 billion, according to one estimate) eight times over?

Biden also has proposed several steps to root out the systemic racism that has hindered the ability for people of color, particularly African Americans, to buy or hold onto property. Those obstacles have included everything from onerous interest rates that leave Black people vulnerable to falling behind on payments and ending up in foreclosure to biases that undervalue homes simply because they are owned by Black Americans.

And this sort of haphazard approach driven by Trump's moods, ego or domestic politics doubly pertains to the way his Iran policy has played out. His maximum pressure campaign of sanctions against Iran has been effective in squeezing Iran's economy. But it has never been clear what the goal is: To fracture the regime, weaken it and lay the basis for regime change? Or to pressure Iran into returning to the negotiating table to reach a new deal more favorable to Washington?
Many major banks have ruled out financing for Arctic oil exploration, and it is unclear how much interest the lease sale will attract.

The woman and the felines were found living in a Virginia Beach self-storage unit this week, the city's Animal Care and Adoption Center said on Tuesday. The city doesn't have a limit on how many cats residents can own, Animal Control Supervisor Meghan Conti told The Virginian-Pilot. The adoption center said the cats were understandably scared, but are otherwise in good health and didn't show signs of neglect. They're being housed together and awaiting adoption into new homes. The animal shelter didn't say how long the cats and their owner had been living in the storage unit or what happened with the woman.

Portland: Lawmakers have approved a $4.5 million contract with a hazardous waste removal company to clean up homeless encampments across the city. The City Commission unanimously voted to give the contract to Rapid Response Bio Clean on Wednesday after the agenda item was pulled late last month over concerns from homeless people and their advocates, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported Thursday. Opponents said the cleanups are traumatic for homeless residents and cause them to lose their property. Under a modified deal, Rapid Response workers will get training in nonviolent conflict resolution and to carry naloxone, an injection that can reverse drug overdoses. The workers generally disposed of the needles, shopping carts, trash and human waste that are left behind after a homeless camp is cleared. Notices about a clean-up must be posted at least two days before the work begins. The city has contracted with Rapid Response since 2016. But in recent weeks, the contract, which expands the scope of the company's responsibilities and significantly increases the amount of money approved for campsite cleanups. Mayor Ted Wheeler said the new contract strikes an excellent balance between keeping the city clean and respecting the homeless. Rapid Response was to resume its work by Thursday.

According to statistics by Mental Health America in 2018, only about 50 percent of Black adults with mental illness received treatment. Mullan says therapy that takes historical factors and cultural needs, while focusing on healing rather than just diagnosis, can make the difference for Black people and ultimately Black youth. She explains that intergenerational trauma is not only about passing down behaviors and beliefs. Research supports that trauma can leave a chemical mark on a person's genes, she says. Our environment changes our genes, our DNA expression, and that is passed down to subsequent generations.

Trump demands in a call that a Georgia official 'find' votes to overturn the election. President Trump has spent almost nine weeks making false conspiracy claims about his election loss. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times WASHINGTON — President Trump demanded that Georgia's Republican secretary of state find him enough votes to overturn the presidential election, and vaguely threatened him with a criminal offense, during an hourlong telephone conversation with him on Saturday, according to audio excerpts from the conversation. Mr. Trump, who has spent almost nine weeks making false conspiracy claims about his loss to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., told Brad Raffensperger, the state's top elections official, that Mr. Raffensperger should recalculate the vote count so Mr. Trump would win the state's 16 electoral votes. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, Mr. Trump said on the call, a recording of which was obtained by The Washington Post, which published excerpts from the audio on its website Sunday. Because we won the state. Mr. Raffensperger rejected the president's efforts to get him to reverse the election results, which are set to be certified by Congress during a session on Wednesday. Some of Mr. Trump's allies in the House and the Senate have said they will object to the results of the elections in several states, including Georgia. But Mr. Raffensperger told Mr. Trump that he stood by the results.

Perhaps no one better personifies the confusing ride that makes for a frenemiship with Trump than Attorney General Jeff Sessions. An early and prominent supporter of Trump's candidacy — he was the first senator to endorse him — Sessions was awarded with the prominent Cabinet nomination, narrowly winning Senate confirmation after a wide debate. Just a single Senate Democrat voted to confirm Sessions.
In at least a partial nod to the presumably mammoth cost that overhauling the nation's economy and energy sector would entail, it says that the financing of the Plan would be accomplished by the federal government, using a combination of the Federal Reserve, a new public bank or system of regional and specialized public banks, public venture funds and such other vehicles or structures that the select committee deems appropriate, in order to ensure that interest and other investment returns generated from public investments made in connection with the Plan will be returned to the treasury, reduce taxpayer burden and allow for more investment.
BlackRock has been in the crosshairs of climate change activists in the past.

In recent days, the former vice president has made an increasing number of stumbles and gaffes. The gaffe follows several others Biden has made on the campaign trail in recent days. Most notably, the former vice president elicited attention on Tuesday for pushing a voter and suggesting because of a disagreement about climate change that the man go vote for someone else.

Lawmakers of the 117th Congress met for the first time Sunday as they prepared to take the oath of office. In the Senate, Vice President Mike Pence led a ceremonial swearing in. Credit Credit... Pete Marovich for The New York Times On the other side of the Capitol, the Senate convened an even more subdued opening day as both parties await a pair of runoff elections in Georgia on Tuesday that will determine which of them begins the year in control. The outcome could determine the fate of Mr. Biden's legislative goals on climate change, taxes and health care; his response to the coronavirus pandemic; and his ability to fill his cabinet and influential federal judgeships. Republicans currently have an edge, with 51 seats to Democrats' 48. Democrats would have to sweep both races to draw the chamber to a tie and effectively take control when Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, who would cast tiebreaking votes when needed, is sworn in with Mr. Biden on Jan. 20. With the coronavirus circulating rampantly, members-elect expected little of the pomp that usually accompanies Congress's initial convening. Lawmakers took the oath of office and voted for speaker in small groups, rather than all together in the normally boisterous hall of the House. The architect of the Capitol had even constructed a small plexiglass enclosure in one of the galleries overlooking the chamber so that three lawmakers in a protective quarantine could vote in person but not mingle on the House floor.

The people of Georgia spoke very clearly on Nov. 3, when they elected Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and gave them our 16 electoral votes, Warnock said on NPR. We counted those votes three times. It is clear, when you look at the swing states all across our country, Joe Biden is the president-elect. Unfortunately, there are enablers of this nonsense in the United States Senate. And that's why the people who I'm running into all across Georgia are frustrated with politics.

New York: Throngs of demonstrators joined by elected officials walked solemnly across the Brooklyn Bridge in a solidarity march Sunday against anti-Semitism and all acts of hate. The No Hate, No Fear march was organized by New York's Jewish community in the wake of recent anti-Semitic attacks, including a knife attack at a Hanukkah celebration north of New York City that left five people wounded and a fatal shootout at a kosher grocery in Jersey City, New Jersey. The crowds of participants, thousands strong, jammed the streets in lower Manhattan as they waited their turns to get across the bridge. It is wonderful that we are doing this and sad that we still have to do it, said Claudia Stoller, 31, of Manhattan. But it was never lost on me that the Jewish community could always be targeted and should always be ready to be strong.

Farmers and ranchers have long used fire to clear land, said Poirier, and are likely behind the unusually large number fires burning in the Amazon today.
If the way we raise animals for food isn't the most important problem in the world right now, it's arguably the No. 1 cause of global warming: The United Nations reports the livestock business generates more greenhouse gas emissions than all forms of transportation combined.
Terry McAuliffe. The former Virginia governor told CNN that he is obviously looking at a presidential bid, then distinguished his support for universal health care from the versions endorsed by liberal Democratic senators: We have to actually pay for what we're actually promising.
John Kostopoulos, president of the Democratic Club of Long Beach Island, succinctly put it this way: I gave money to him to represent the Democratic Party, not take the money to buy advertisements as a Republican with my money.
Of course, nothing could have been further from the truth. There is no evidence that Iran started behaving any better after the deal and in no serious Republican or Democrat is even attempting at this point to argue that. Iran never released Bob Levinson, a former CIA officer, whom they've held for 13 years, ditto for at least five other American who've been held prisoner on absurd spurious grounds.
Indeed, problems have plagued Fort Hood through multiple administrations, according to family members torn by grief and frustration.
Not a ton of votes in those counties, but every little bit helps. I'm looking at (the extremely appropriately named) Early Co., which could be a Dem flip from the presidential result. 52-47 Trump in Nov., and with 82% of the expected vote tonight, it's 55-45 to the Dems tonight. https://t.co/qHuzCYLoG9 — Adam Kelsey (@adamkelsey) January 6, 2021
Sunrise, along with Ocasio-Cortez and the Justice Democrats, are concerned that the committee itself is not committed to addressing climate change issues over the 12-year timeline addressed in the detailed and dire October report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
Wildlife officials believe those connections will happen naturally, over time. Grizzly bears are venturing further afield, they point out, entering places they haven't been for generations.
The grizzly bear proposal, by Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., would have directed the Interior Department to delist the bears in the Great Yellowstone Ecosystem and prohibit future judicial review.
I would say this album is about growing up and becoming an adult, the pop star told CBS News of her new album, Tell Me You Love Me. There's songs on the album that represent past relationships that I've been through. There's some about sexuality, but also there's ones about overcoming obstacles.
Ceres, and other parties who are pushing for mandatory climate-risk disclosures for companies have acknowledged that the lack of leadership from the U.S. on climate has stymied that effort and few expect much from the Securities and Exchange Commission during this administration.
Surfacing promising judicial candidates who can be nominated when conservatives have electoral power is just one byproduct of the network, and on its own maybe not the most important one, Teles explains. There's a supply-and-demand relationship between the judges and the network. The judges need scholarship and arguments extending Federalist principles into new areas. Where new legal theories depart from the status quo, they need them to be vetted and legitimized through public debate. They require targeted cases raising questions that provide an opening to move the law. Without professors and lawyers in the network filling that demand, Teles says, you're not going to maximize what you got through the electoral process.
In Nevada, we have just put together a multigenerational, multiracial coalition which is going to not only win in Nevada, it's going to sweep this country, Sanders said at his rally in San Antonio on Saturday.

We will update the number when that number becomes available, which could be substantially higher, Jake Crouch, a climate scientist at the National Centers for Environmental Information, said on the call.
On Monday, Loeffler announced she would join that effort.
GRAHAM: Well, number one, that story came from somebody who leaked it with an agenda. So I'd like to know who leaked it because they have an agenda not very friendly to President Trump and I for one don't trust what I read in The New York Times.
When she entered the Oval Office on Dec. 11 for a meeting with Trump and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), she had a phrase in mind that she planned to use in private — Trump shutdown.
Over the last two years, however, Castro's star has waned, as he stayed out of electoral politics while former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke ran an underdog campaign that brought Texas Democrats within striking distance of winning statewide office for the first time in two decades.
Mainstream (FAKE) media refuses to state our long list of achievements, including 28 legislative signings, strong borders & great optimism!, Trump tweeted Saturday afternoon.
But, Monteleone said, geopolitics plays a huge role in why China is pushing the project. This is the thing: It looks like an economical initiative, but in fact it is probably more of a foreign policy initiative. This is leverage China will have on countries once they start economic relations.
The solution is very simple but very hard: You have to give in a little bit to avoid full rupture, but not so much as to really fracture your new coalition. Find ways to humor cranky members. Wild goose chases and special select committees make good busywork for members with more ambition than ability.
Initially, local authorities evacuated nearly 200,000 people downstream of the dam. But a herculean effort by engineers managed to save and stabilize the emergency spillway, averting a massive disaster.
In fact, it's those surroundings that draw people here. All of explora Valle Sagrado's 50 rooms and suites boast mountain views, thanks to windows that take up much of the property's back exterior wall. Accommodations have comfy beds with fluffy comforters (and chocolate at turndown), hot showers, and jetted soaking tubs. They don't, however, have televisions or Wi-Fi. But that's okay; days here aren't meant to be spent in your room.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, Margaret, it is not only-- it is not only the amount of money that we raised, and that is a phenomenal amount, it's how we raised it. We don't have a Super PAC like Joe Biden. I don't go to rich people's homes like Joe Biden. I think Joe has contributions from more than forty billionaires. What we have done is receive more campaign contributions from more Americans than any candidate in the history of the United States, averaging eighteen dollars and fifty cents. This is a campaign of working people and by working people. And I'm extraordinarily proud of that. But we have enough money now not only to take us through Super Tuesday, but take us through the entire process fueled by the contributions of working-class people all across this country.
FOLDS: It's about unformalizing the symphony orchestra in a way that doesn't intimidate people. People go to the symphony and they think, oh, how do I dress? They don't even know. So, you know, we make it informal in a way for them to feel comfortable to be there.

Democrats have been calling on Trump and Senate Republicans to allow a vote on a short-term bill that would open the government, giving the two sides more time for talks.
SCHUMER: Given that Mr. Bolton's lawyers have stated, he has new and relevant information to share. If any Senate Republican opposes issuing subpoenas to the four witnesses and documents we've requested, they would make it absolutely clear, they are participating in a cover-up.
Mini Mike Bloomberg just quit the race for President. I could have told him long ago that he didn't have what it takes, and he would have saved himself a billion dollars, the real cost. Now he will pour money into Sleepy Joe's campaign, hoping to save face. It won't work! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2020

Smith had stretches this season where he caught touchdown passes in four straight games and also had 50-plus receiving yards four times in a row at one point.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So this is significant. And according to the deal that was released, the U.S. will bring down troops to eight thousand six hundred in the next hundred and thirty-five days. And then if conditions are met, a total withdrawal within fourteen months. But the President said yesterday, if bad things happen, we'll go back in. What's the benchmark there?

If Klobuchar is successful on Monday, it will likely be because her decision to tour every corner of the state, her focus on pursuing more moderate policies, and her message of uniting the country at a time of deep partisan division. She has campaigned relentlessly, holding more events than any other candidate in the top tier, and her campaign believes they'll see an advantage in rural areas because they visited every one of Iowa's 99 counties.

Job hopping is typically considered the best bet for a big salary bump. Job switchers saw their wages grow nearly a percentage point more over the past year than job stayers, according to a mid-2017 report from Nomura.
The growth of the zones is yet another consequence of global warming — including increasing ocean temperatures — triggered by greenhouse gases and, closer to the coasts, contamination by agricultural runoff and sewage.
We're grateful that he came. We're grateful for his time and attention, Newsom said, according to the Sacramento Bee. That said, we're living in an environment, tweet by tweet, day by day, issues raise themselves to the fore. That makes it challenging for us to cooperate at all levels all of the time.

Yet at the same time, Bolsonaro has plenty of enemies, especially in the international media. Although he embraces the label Tropical Trump, the media escalate from there; it's common to see him characterized as a neo-fascist, or just a plain old fascist.
Under California law, utilities must pay for wildfire damage if their equipment caused the fire, even if negligence wasn't involved. In most other states -- and for other types of natural disasters -- liability requires evidence that the utility was negligent. That system no longer works in a world where wildfires are more frequent and more destructive, said Ralph Cavanagh, co-director of the climate and clean energy program at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

He has rejected the idea, floated by sometimes-ally Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., that the wall is a metaphor for border security. That was a suggestion that might have made it possible to take funding for other steps to secure the southern border and still claim victory.
Civil rights activist Gloria Richardson was one of several people who marched in Cambridge, Maryland, in 1963, fighting for desegregation. She wrote a telegram to U.S. Attorney General Robert F.

For many, dealing with climate change is inherently a political issue. A December report issued by the state of Texas about the need to future-proof the state from worsening natural disasters never directly mentions climate change, or the role that humans have played in emitting heat-trapping carbon dioxide by burning the oil and gas Texas has long been known for.
The grassroots movement behind the Green New Deal offers a ray of hope to the badly battered establishment: they should embrace it, flesh it out, and make it part of the progressive agenda. We need something positive to save us from the ugly wave of populism, nativism, and proto-fascism that is sweeping the world.
The students announced a national symposium to be held at Yale in the spring of 1982. Word spread ahead of the conference, and so many letters came from students at other schools asking how to start a chapter that Otis says she and another co-founder quickly drafted a guide. Daniel Kelly was a senior at the College of the Holy Cross and applying to law school when he heard about it. Thrilled at the prospect, he and some friends drove 100 miles from Worcester, Mass., to New Haven, Conn., and slept on the floor of a friend's Yale dorm. They were saying something that seemed completely plain sense and true to us, Kelly recalls, which is when you look at the Constitution, you should look at the way the framers wrote it and interpret it as best you can based upon the intention of the framers. Kelly is now head of the Federalist Society lawyers chapter in Boston, where, in late October, Sessions gave one of his last speeches as attorney general.
On Thursday, the chairs of four different committees in the House of Representatives sent a letter to President Trump expressing concern about recent reports that the National Security Council (NSC) is planning to assemble a secret panel, led by a discredited climate change denier, to undermine the overwhelming scientific consensus on the nature and threats of climate change.
Montpelier: The number of fatalities on Vermont roadways went down by about 30% in 2019, according to state figures. Vermont State Police and the Vermont Agency of Transportation released figures that show the tentative number of deaths on the state's roads in 2019 was 47, down from 69 in 2018, the Times Argus reported. But state officials are not sure what to attribute the decrease in road fatalities. Lt. Tara Thomas, commander of safety programs for the Vermont State Police, said the reduction was unexplainable. Thomas said that 47 deaths are still too many for state police. We wish we knew what the formula was to keep the numbers down. 47 is still too many for the state police. That's 47 families that don't have a loved one with them, so in our eyes, it's still high. We're averaging just way too many each month, she said. The 47 deaths resulted from 44 crashes last year. The figure is tentative because if someone dies as a result of injuries from a 2019 crash within the first 30 days of 2020, that person's death would be added to the list of fatalities from 2019. Vermont also had no fatal crashes reported in the state on any of the holidays last year.
A comprehensive study published in 2015 in Nature surveyed 6,000 people across 24 countries and found that emphasizing the shared benefits of climate change was an effective way of motivating people to take action — even if they initially identified as deniers. For example, people were more likely to take steps to mitigate climate change if they believe that it will produce economic and scientific development. Most importantly, these results were true across political ideology, age, and gender.
Likewise, Del Duca said the most important thing the Liberals need is a leader who can hit the ground running as soon as the convention is over.
The worst flood in Venice's history happened in 1966. It was only a few inches higher than this past November's. Back in '66, experts said the flood was a once-in-800 year event. Nonetheless, thousands of Venetians left for good.

But first, Trump, the realist. That's the focus of tonight's Angle.
Headlines like this have become commonplace every January when the major climate monitoring agencies tally the numbers for the year before. Because of human-caused climate change, the last six years have been the warmest six years in the record books, which date back into the 1800s.
The California Supreme Court soon put a stop to the weddings, but four years later, it ruled 4-3 that preventing same-sex couples from marrying violated the state constitution. It helped pave the way for a U.S. Supreme Court decision 10 years later legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide.

A lot of girls were sharing how excited they were about the different opportunities they got and the start of their career, Upton said. I remember being in that place whenever I got the meeting to go meet with Paul Marciano and how different my view of the industry after that meeting was and I wanted to prevent that from happening to these other girls who were just starting out.
I also think understanding how social media is cultivating groups with very different worldviews means that we have to think not in terms of integration or assimilation, but to function in more of a pluralistic society. And I think that's going to be key. And if we can do that, I think we might have some hope.
Vice Media's hypocrisy may be the least of its concerns these days, however. The site started off 2018 by being rocked with a litany of sexual harassment allegations. That year, the company also lost Shane Smith as CEO. In November, the Vice Media reportedly was on track to lose $50 million and was reportedly looking to make major staff cuts.
Dover: Authorities who launched a two-day sting in response to a rash of shootings in the capital city say they seized guns and drugs. The operation targeted Dover's Capitol Park neighborhood, where there were four shootings in the last two weeks of the year, Delaware State Police spokeswoman Master Cpl. Melissa Jaffe said. A drive-by shooting on New Year's Day also injured two teens. No arrests were made, but Jaffe said authorities seized a loaded Smith & Wesson .40-caliber pistol, a black tactical-style ballistic vest and a loaded assault rifle, as well as 656 baggies of heroin. Police said in a news release that officers had learned the contraband was being hidden on state and county land. The effort involved more than 60 troopers and law enforcement officers from multiple other agencies.
And in some respects, again what we're seeing, I think, is more of these divisions — even with some of the young folks recognizing and reckoning with the movement for Black lives and addressing anti-racism. On the other hand, I think other people are sort of going, I don't want to say backwards, but consolidating whiteness and trying to hold on to power by any means necessary. And by doing that, it's not just dog whistles, it's sort of trumpets.
WASHINGTON – Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said Friday that she now supports President Donald Trump's renegotiated United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement because it makes improvements.
LIASSON: I do. As it was described to me, unless he got the full amount of funding for the wall that he was demanding, he would do this because this is a way for him to keep faith with his base, to say that he did everything possible to build the wall, even if it's stopped in the courts. His advisers really believe - he really believes that the wall is absolutely key to his re-election. Now, of course, now he has to convince the courts that a national emergency is whatever a president says it is. And he really undercut himself in that speech in the Rose Garden, where he said, I didn't need to do this. In other words, he's doing this for expedience not necessity. He said, I just wanted to build the wall faster. He's also said at various times that the wall is already being built. So if it's already being built, why do you need to declare a national emergency to build it?

Ocasio-Cortez – Occasional Cortex, as she's known, because she's so thick she doesn't even know how stupid she is – is the lipstick, obviously.
In just the past year, Inslee kiboshed two major fossil fuel projects and added new regulations on existing infrastructure. Last January, he personally intervened to reject permits to build what would have been the nation's largest oil-by-rail facility at the Port of Vancouver. He signed a bill in March putting a new tax on pipelines, forcing the operators to fund a state program to protect against oil spills. In May, he blocked construction of a $680 million coal-export terminal on the Columbia River.
During an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Graham suggested that Trump sign a bill funding the government for three weeks to allow time for further negotiations with Democrats before the president pulls the plug on an emergency declaration.
And it's time now for our Sunday group.
SHANNON PETTYPIECE: Well, yeah. Well, I mean, and-- we can talk about this. Meanwhile, at the White House, they are very clearly in 2020 mode. I mean, we could say they were in 2020 mode, you know, two years ago today, but the White House is transitioning into 2020 mode. And while you have these Democrats who are exploring, and making their first trip to Iowa, now you have a President Trump who has a real campaign infrastructure behind him. It's not the Trump Tower, you know, papers flying all over the place, no one know who's in charge, they have an actual campaign. They have raised millions and millions of dollars. They have a big data operation. They are out of the gate and running and the Democrats are still kind of trying to find where the starting line is or decided if they're going to show up at the race. So, I mean, that's what they're going to be up against. And they also feel like despite how much criticism and how unpopular the President might be, they also feel like they have something really to run on, the whole slogan for 2020 is this, promises made, promises kept. You might not like the promises that he kept but they are going to say that he did what he said he was going to do. He was not one of those politicians who came to Washington and-- and-- and, you know, did a flip flop.
Set it all aside and keep your eye on resisting the rise of the rabid socialists who will run you over while they'll enrich Wall Street and China, Ingraham added.
Well, now the president says it is true -- he can alter the laws unilaterally. Why the metamorphosis? What changed? The law and the Constitution are still the same. Which leaves Obama. When it comes to the truth, inconvenient or otherwise, he is a chameleon like no other politician. He never hesitates to contradict himself, conjuring a new breadth of hypocrisy.
President-elect Joe Biden's closing message to Georgians: Vote for Democrats to get $2,000.
Pelosi's greatest opposition has come from her right flank, from members who said they wanted fresh blood in the leadership role and are from swing districts where backing Pelosi is a liability. She assuaged many of those members by agreeing to implement term limits on party leaders in the House.
In the past four decades these structures have grown in their political importance, size and scope. This applies to gerrymandering, as in the Republicans winning a 33-seat majority in the House of Representatives in 2012, with more than a million fewer votes than the Democrats. It applies to the Electoral College, with eight of the past 20 years under Republican presidents (George W. Bush and Donald Trump) who lost the popular vote; and to the Senate, where about half the U.S. population elects 80% of the Senate, while the other half gets 20%. And then there is voter suppression that targets minority and poorer voters, and disenfranchises them disproportionately.

Juice cleanses ― regardless of whether they have health benefits (doubtful) ― are extremely dangerous! registered dietitian nutritionist Casey L. McCoy of Country Doctor Community Health Centers said with an eye roll. They typically involve restriction of most macronutrients and leaves only vitamins, mineral and sugar for quick energy that then results in a blood sugar crash since there's no fiber. But when we restrict energy to this degree, our bodies go into energy preservation mode, prioritizing survival functions like heart pumping, breathing … but all the other functions go by the wayside. That's why people feel so fatigued and weak when they do juice cleanses.
In speeches, interviews, and in at least 49 published plans throughout his presidential campaign, Mr. Biden talked about the actions he'd take in the earliest days of his administration — what he would do if he triumphed in what he saw as a battle for the soul of the nation against President Trump.

Liberating our minds from these fashionable pieties cannot tell us exactly how we should manage relations between the sexes in circumstances that differ significantly from ancient Greece and 18th-century Geneva.

A sign of possible tensions within the party was on display in November, when environmental activists took part in a sit-in outside Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi's, D-Calif., office, demanding leadership do more to promote the Green New Deal.
WALLACE: Almost 50 years later, the bonds among the cast remains strong.
Their first order of business, however, likely will be a bid to pass another COVID-19 relief package. Biden and Democrats have promised to push for $2,000 in direct payments to Americans who meet certain economic criteria — a proposal McConnell systematically blocked as the last Congress ended in favor of checks totaling only $600.
And Joe Biden doesn't do any of that. He bypasses it and says something they could learn to code, which I think will come back to haunt him.
Emissions in the country jumped 3.4 percent last year, the second largest annual increase in more than two decades, according to a preliminary estimate by the economic research company Rhodium Group.
But Environmental Defense Fund General Counsel Vickie Patton, whose group obtained the document, said in an email that it reveals the Trump EPA is focused on attacking the peer-reviewed health science that has saved tens of thousands of lives each year from deadly air pollution and protected America's children from pesticides.
In his submission, Jones told the review that the word 'trick' was not intended to imply any deception, simply the 'best way of doing or dealing with something.'
GONYEA: Afterward, Sanders doesn't hang around long, taking selfies like most other candidates do. He works the rope line for a bit then exits out a back door. But the audience is clearly energized by this 78-year-old candidate.
Pelosi returned to the White House on Wednesday — behind closed doors and joined by a broader cast of congressional leaders, a setting several Democratic aides cast as a White House effort to avoid a repeat of the earlier fiasco. Rather than with words, this time she made her point with her power.
This does not yet exist here today and, unfortunately, the growing debate around this issue has placed Frontier and our company squarely at the nexus of much broader issues that need to be resolved, Lindsay wrote.

This continues a trend at the TVA of shuttering coal plants in favor of other sources for generating electricity, including natural gas and renewable energy. The move has helped attract companies like Google that build large data centers and want to power them with cleaner sources of energy.
The two were soon holding meetings with advisers and funders, pitching them on their vision and honing it as they went.

The rule reflects the Trump administration's dogged push to lock in as many policies as possible before President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20. Although the new administration will probably seek to overturn it, such an effort will take months, if not longer. The EPA administrator is allowed to waive the requirement on a case-by-case basis, but it is possible that outside groups could challenge those waivers in court.

Additionally, Democrats are changing the rules regarding motions to vacate the chair, a procedural tool that could be used to force out a sitting House speaker. It is the procedural weapon that conservatives led by Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., were planning to use to try to oust Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, in 2015 before he made the decision to step down.
Tillerson, meanwhile, was frustrated by some of Trump's behavior, including the president's frequent and incendiary use of Twitter, which he has used to make statements that contradict Tillerson's, and Trump's remarks that there were fine people among the white nationalists marching at a rally in Charlottesville in August. Still Tillerson pledged his loyalty to the president after the incident and sought to play down the rupture.

If you had a nickel for every time a Democrat used arguments about science in discussions about climate change, you'd be rich. Scientific studies about the existence of climate change – be it man-made or naturally occurring – are often used as cudgels against opponents of the left's radical environmental agenda or international regulatory regimes like the Paris Climate Accord.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is one of the rising stars of the new Democrat-led Congress and the left's latest media darling. Millions were captivated by her surprising 2018 primary victory over long-time liberal House member Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., and her achievement of becoming, at age 29, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress.
Really waking up, and not just dreaming to ourselves that things will be O.K., has become urgent — beyond urgent, she writes. She paraphrases fire officials in the Australian state of Victoria: The world is in danger, and we need to act immediately to survive.
The move comes after the Justice Department recently opened an antitrust investigation into a deal between California and four automakers for tougher pollution and related mileage requirements than those sought by Trump.

State agencies are already making a push. Last June, New York's Department of Public Service issued a report outlining an energy storage roadmap. In December, the state's Public Service Commission released a plan requiring utilities such as ConEdison to procure a total of 350 megawatts of storage as part of a broader blueprint to decrease the state's dependence on fossil-fueled peaker plants. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority earlier vowed to conduct a study on how to move every sector in the state to 100 percent renewable energy, although Politico reported last week that the report had not been made public by the end of 2018 as promised.
He's filling up a tanker with water. He's got a hose and a pump, and he's desperately trying to ward off these flames, which are meters high.
As the ones usually tasked with bringing climate change information to their students, teachers are increasingly taking on the weight of the psychological implications. Lisa Balazs, a science teacher at a private school outside Birmingham, Ala., told me she persuaded her school to offer a specialized climate change class last year. She wanted to walk students through the physics and chemistry of the changing climate, but also focus on solutions. I wanted them to feel like they were empowered in the way you could have an intelligent conversation, she says. The scary part is feeling like there's nothing you individually can do, especially when you look at the government. So turning it around and putting it back in your personal control, this is what you can vote for and work for.
Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen. Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2019
The U.K. has also announced plans to merge its Department for International Development into its Foreign Office, a move that more than 100 charities say risks politicizing U.K. aid. These shifts by the U.S. and U.K., two of the world's largest aid donors, could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world, says Konyndyk. — Joanne Lu
The changes take on added significance after a year in which low-wage workers were hit especially hard by the coronavirus pandemic.
We're bringing the fight against climate change straight to the fossil fuel companies that knew about its effects and intentionally misled the public to protect their profits, de Blasio said in a statement ahead of Wednesday's press conference. As climate change continues to worsen, it's up to the fossil fuel companies whose greed put us in this position to shoulder the cost of making New York safer and more resilient.

In fact, Mercer is typical of a new kind of mega-donor in politics these days, she says.
Like Sanders, who may end up joining the race, Warren simply does not use the language of compromise or national unity; she uses the language of resistance. As they pile into the race, some Democrats will find themselves arguing for a return to the less divisive politics of the pre-Trump era, while others, such as Warren, will call for a president to dismantle the financial forces that made Trump's win possible. To those in the latter camp, Trump never could have won had he not been able to define himself as a blue-collar billionaire against Clinton's Wall Street supporters; for them, in 2020, the job will be giving him an opponent who can make a populist case against him.
Can a candidate like Warren break through in a race with a credible, female black candidate? She's finding out.
Not yet. I don't think any particular progress was made today, McConnell told reporters when he returned to Capitol Hill from the White House.

The whole idea of the law is to give better information in advance to decision-makers and the public. It appears that these changes are an effort to undermine both of those purposes of the statute, Caputo said. It would basically make the federal government become an ostrich, sticking its head in the ground rather than thinking about the environmental impact of its actions.
The host's acerbic wit was nothing new. He'd certainly offended in the past from the awards stage, and ads for Sunday's telecast played upon the idea that anything could happen, including Gervais being a jerk. His knack for ripping on Hollywood and offending the glitterati is well known among the thin-skinned in the industry. But at the Beverly Hilton, where the three-hour-plus ceremony took place, the mood was already sober thanks to an impeachment, the threat of war with Iran and devastating bush fires in Australia. The last thing anyone needed was for the smirking master of ceremonies to reprimand them for having hope, or taunt the room for trying to use their influence to change things for the better.
Many of the adults I talked to said the heightened rhetoric around climate change reminded them of the panic around nuclear weapons during the Cold War, when school lessons were interrupted by duck and cover drills and there was perpetual fear that the world might end at any moment. The 1983 TV movie The Day After, which dramatized the fallout from a nuclear attack on the Midwest, emerged as an apocalyptic touchstone; surveys after the film aired found viewers were more depressed about their chances of survival and were less optimistic about their ability to influence nuclear weapons policy.
The five key environmental risks the report tracks— biodiversity loss, extreme weather events, failure of climate-change mitigation and adaptation, man-made disasters and natural disasters—are once again listed in the high-impact, high-likelihood category, which means experts are worried that they are increasing and will have a huge effect.
New Year's Eve saw record cold temperatures for much of the upper Midwest.
However, the extra energy in the Earth system goes a step further. A warmer atmosphere and ocean can also power more intense weather systems, which increase rainfall rates and also the overall precipitation which falls in a storm. So, even if a region's average rainfall is decreasing, individual storms still tend to produce more precipitation.

While people were still partying on the dance floor, Steyer left to attend a town hall of a very different vibe: one hosted by Mi Familia Vota at a union hall for plumbers and welders.

The Atlantic today, I'm going to read this. Title was, it's 2003 all over again, Congressman Waltz. The factors that made the Iraq war a disaster are present here, false and dubious claims, hubristic thinking, lack of foresight and planning, civilian military divides, ideology eclipsing practical strategy, all of this means that while the Iran crisis might not be the disaster on the scale of the Iraq war, it could easily be a disaster. Your reaction to that. Are we creeping into a potential long conflict with Iran?
There are good reasons for today's disgruntlement: four decades of promises by political leaders of both the center-left and center-right, espousing the neoliberal faith that globalization, financialization, deregulation, privatization, and a host of related reforms would bring unprecedented prosperity, have gone unfulfilled.
Guthrie has taken his views national as the co-founder of the nonprofit Schools for Climate Action (S4CA), which asks schools and other educational groups to pass resolutions highlighting the effects of climate change on children.

A surge in national coverage of Warren finally turned into a polling spike as the summer came to a close. By the time the mid-September debates rolled around, Sanders was enough of an afterthought that superrich individuals and members of the Democratic establishment ― elected officials, donors and operatives ― were training their fire exclusively on Warren.

Thanos, the villain (and protagonist, really) of the $2 billion-grossing megahit, Avengers: Infinity War, was basically an omni-powered Paul Ehrlich. Whereas the comic book version of Thanos sought to kill half of the universe in order to prove his love for an anthropomorphized Death, the film version was driven insane by his home planet's self-immolation after a series of resource wars. Determined to eliminate suffering over food and land, over clean water and clean air, Thanos used the Infinity Gauntlet not to create abundance of each but to kill half of all living things.

This dynamic of tough love parenting and even physical punishment, she says, is passed down through generations. The result is a generation of Black children without the proper tools and resources to stay aware of their mental health. Without widespread access to culturally competent mental health care plus systemic racism and exposure to the constant police killings of Black people, which studies show have an adverse mental health impact on Black people, a mental health crisis among Black youth is seemingly inevitable.

But passion and urgent messaging only go so far, and the Sunrise Movement faces considerable challenges. Labor unions, a necessary constituency for a policy that essentially amounts to an industrial plan, are skeptical of proposals to end fossil fuel use, a source of lucrative contract jobs. The Sunrise Movement's meteoric ascent was fueled by aggressive protests against potential Green New Deal champions, which risked burning allies, according to E&E News. In a competition with immigration, health care and taxes, climate change remains an underdog issue with relatively few vocal champions on the national level despite its ubiquitous threat.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Schools. Yeah. My—my mom wanted to make sure that I had— a solid chance and a solid education.
WALLACE: There were new questions this week about Justice Ginsburg after it turned out that she has missed arguments, a lot of us didn't know this, for the first time in her quarter century on the court.
We all stand to lose from this gulf between the sciences and the humanities. The sciences run the risk of being decontextualized from their moral and social consequences, pursuing technologies that should be regulated and scrutinized. Artificial intelligence research, for example, as many philosophers and, thankfully, scientists have recognized, needs to have safeguards so as to guarantee that, in the advent that we do build machines more intellectually capable than ourselves, they would still be willing to work with us and not against us. The same with CRISPR/Cas9 biotechnologies, that can effectively and specifically change genes within organisms, thus allowing us to engineer life following target goals. On the other hand, the humanities run the risk of becoming disconnected from the pace of scientific discoveries and myopic to how they are effectively transforming the world we live in.
Black Belt areas could be more important:
The NAACP's Roy Wilkins, one of the Big Four civil rights leaders, gave a shout-out to Sanford in his March on Washington speech in 1963 when he called on lawmakers to be as brave as our sit-ins and our marchers, to be as daring as James Meredith, to be as unafraid as the nine children of Little Rock. And to be as forthright as the governor of North Carolina.
Pelosi is expected to regain the gavel Thursday, securing the votes to become speaker even after some new and returning lawmakers signaled they wanted new leadership. She would be the first woman to hold, then return, to the office.
She told GMA's Robin Roberts on Friday that she found the courage to come forward after doing a workout with some of the newer models participating in New York Fashion Week.

Millennials, in particular, are eager to make a move. Fifty-six percent of those aged 18 to 34 are currently looking for a new job or plan to this year, Glassdoor said. Most are looking for higher-paying positions, followed by greater career opportunities or a company culture that fits their needs, according to Dobroski.
Details have continued to be revealed decades later because of technological advances, and Peschel, a scientist, says he expects that trend to continue.
What are the specifics of that framework?
Trump also said the USMCA would increase the U.S. gross domestic product by 1.2 percent. That number is significantly higher than most mainstream estimates, including a U.S. International Trade Commission report in April that found the USMCA would expand the economy by 0.35 percent once it is fully implemented in six years. Trump's senior advisers have also given a more measured assessment of the eventual impact of the deal.
It has been a great honor to serve as president of this remarkable institution, full of passionate individuals dedicated to the mission of ending extreme poverty in our lifetime, Kim said in a statement. The work of the World Bank Group is more important now than ever as the aspirations of the poor rise all over the world, and problems like climate change, pandemics, famine and refugees continue to grow in both their scale and complexity.
But Trump is unlikely to notice, let alone care. Most Americans just don't see climate change as a credible problem.
Since all California utilities face similar challenges, Cavanagh is worried that crippling PG&E wouldn't only eliminate a major investor in the state's clean-energy infrastructure. It could also spell doom for some of the very companies that have been at the forefront of decarbonizing the economy -- an effort that's key to the fight against climate change.
Still, the GOP has stuck with its almost exclusively negative messaging ― relentlessly working to portray both Ossoff and Warnock as radical extremists. Republicans are hopeful Trump will pick up on that message during his trip to northwest Georgia on Monday night, rather than focusing on his ongoing feud with Georgia election officials over their refusal to indulge his fantasies about voter fraud.
He blamed his department for the doctored photo, adding: but if you must Photoshop, please focus on the hair (lack thereof), not the feet!
I think she's doing great....One thing that I think has even increased my respect for her is the fact that when you are the Speaker of the House and when you are the leader of the party there is a necessity, no matter what your political opinions are, where you have your own personal political ideology - what you cast your votes on, how you represent your individual district - and then there's this kind of you know herding cats of trying to bring people together, some of whom don't believe in my opinion and women's rights and others who are the staunchest progressives in the party. And when your job is to get all of those people to do the same thing it's extremely difficult to do. And I think that she's done a really good job so far.
You may get a good price, but it also carries with it a lot of regulatory and political risk, Miller says. There's no good outcome for ratepayers under any scenario and not an ideal outcome for shareholders, either.
A few brave souls resisted the urge to jump on the population explosion bandwagon, urging calm and rationality. One was economist Julian L. Simon, who later noted that whatever the rate of population growth is, historically it has been that the food supply increases at least as fast, if not faster.
Democrats moved to allow the House to vote remotely for the first time in the history of the chamber, instituting a system that would allow a lawmaker to have a colleague cast a vote for them by proxy if they were unable to travel. A Stimulus Deal Almost Derailed Republicans' showing in the November elections left Mr. Biden, who was declared the victor soon after, with a slim majority in the House and Democratic control of the Senate contingent on the outcomes of two runoff races in Georgia. The political stakes of the contests helped shift the monthslong debate over providing pandemic relief to millions of unemployed Americans, small businesses, schools and hospitals across the country, prodding leaders into negotiations over another package. Shortly after the election, a group of moderates began work on a compromise framework. They finally yielded a $900 billion deal that passed both chambers days before Christmas after several near-misses. Still, Mr. Trump threatened not to sign it, plunging the fate of the legislation into uncertainty and holding out the possibility of yet another government shutdown. Four days before the new year began, he signed it into law.
How can trust in business be be restored?
Twenty states raised their minimum wage rates in 2021 -- some by pennies, others by a dollar or more. Some of the increases were part of previously scheduled efforts to adjust for cost of living, while others were aimed at moving toward goals like $15-an-hour minimum pay.

Conditions prompted an emergency response beginning around 2:30 a.m. Pacific time. In Montecito, a wealthy area near Santa Barbara, mudslides cut a gas line, sparking a fire that spread to multiple homes. Responders have been delayed in some areas due to waist-deep mud, along with downed trees and wires, Eliason said. Helicopters are being used because of road conditions.
And that's when it clicks. That red glow she saw, it was the fire.
When you work out in the cold, you don't feel like you're sweating as much as you do in the warmer months, said Katie Barrett, an instructor at the fitness studios B/SPOKE and MyStryde and a six-time marathon runner. It's easy to get dehydrated in the winter because we don't feel like we are losing as much water.
Worst of all, however, was the lack of concern for state and local governments. Back in July, the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning think tank, estimated that the coronavirus crash would create state government budget shortfalls of about $555 billion ― a figure that would increase substantially if local and tribal governments were included in the calculation. The CARES Act included just $150 billion in state and local government relief.
The act prohibits federal agencies from authorizing activities that will destroy or harm a listed species' critical habitat.
Authorities have said this season's fires are the worst in the country's history, and the crisis is likely to last for months. Hundreds of fires are active across the nation, and more than 12 million acres of land have been scorched.
Even if you are an experienced runner, working out in the cold can bring new challenges, so start slowly and build up your endurance. Winter runners should increase their miles cautiously, according to Rui Li, a National Academy of Sports Medicine-certified personal trainer with a specialization in injury prevention and gait analysis who is owner and CEO of New York Personal Training.
Sanders also delivered a strong pro-choice message, promising to expand federal funding for Planned Parenthood, and specifically addressing the men in the room: Women right now are under attack all over this country. Stand with the women!
TRUMP SAYS CALIFORNIA CITIES 'DESTROY THEMSELVES' WITH HOMELESSNESS
Meghan is clearly going to be made the modern day Yoko Ono/Wallace(sic) Simpson within the Royal Family & the press... #GetOut #Megexit, tweeted Claudia Wright.
Biden wants to make community college and comparable training programs free. And students from households earning less than $125,000 a year will not have to pay tuition if they attend four-year public colleges and universities. He also wants to raise the value of Pell Grants, doubling the top amount students can receive.
But he welcomes liberals to the Federalist Society's jurisprudential worldview: There are liberals who work really hard at trying to develop a neutral, originalist approach to interpretation, he said. The fact that people may come out differently occasionally — that's okay. Half the battle is just agreeing that it is essential.
Climate change's impact on Iowa voters CBS News' Natalie Brand traveled around Iowa speaking to farmers, environmental activists, business owners and the state's secretary of agriculture about extreme weather conditions and how those situations and climate change are impacting voters.
This is the last Women's March we're going to need because Trump is going to be gone by this time next year, said Joann Edmunds, 69, a Roanoke resident who attended the march with three friends. Once he's out of office, there won't be the same need for it.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --because they think it's going to take down the President.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-Vermont/@BernieSanders/Democratic Presidential Candidate): Good morning, Margaret.
President Trump's tough talk on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada has raised many questions — including how such a move might negatively affect the flow of beloved produce to the U.S.
You know, nothing was rote, nothing was linear. I had to work around things, work differently, see the world differently, Newsom told KQED. It allowed me to think outside the box. I've always been willing to take risks because you have to because you're never going to thrive in the more traditional sense.
The senator said last week's riots underscore the need for Mr. Biden's nominees to key national security posts to be swiftly confirmed, including his picks to lead the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, State and Justice.
OCASIO-CORTEZ: I think this is where our style and where our organizing comes in, when everyday people begin to organize, when they make their presence known and their opinions known to their officials. It's the same way that we were able to save the ACA in a Republican majority. It's the same way that we're able to overcome some of those challenges of private industry and the role of money in politics.
Kavanaugh, Gorsuch, Alito and Thomas are all at the banquet — a record turnout of Supreme Court justices for the annual affair. There's also a trio of Trump's once and future Justice Department leaders: Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (alumnus of the Federalist Society's Harvard Law School chapter), recently fired attorney general Jeff Sessions (frequent society speaker) and acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker (recommended by Leonard Leo to be Sessions's chief of staff). It's as if the players in the recent melodramas surrounding the Justice Department are minor actors compared with the Federalist Society itself — which provides the enduring climate within which storms on the right come and go.
Carluccio said that means if the Gibbstown project goes ahead, oceangoing tankers laden with LNG will be sailing past low-income neighborhoods in Chester, followed by the port of Wilmington, various coastal refuges on the Delaware and New Jersey riverbanks, and Delaware's beaches.

And earlier this month, Mercer was dragged into the spotlight when he was sued by Renaissance partner David Magerman, who claims he was fired for publicly criticizing his co-CEO's political views in a Wall Street Journal article.
NAUGHTON: Well, I think the nature of careers as, especially as independent practitioners for physicians, it does allow for greater flexibility and the ability to take time out of their career without being punished for it later. But what we are trying to do, although we include physicians in our umbrella group, we really want to bring people in from teaching, from research, from fields that are under-represented currently.
Anderson Cooper: There are people that say that you don't understand how the game is played.
Rousseau returned to the Laws for guidance in a most surprising situation. Members of his intellectual circle in Paris publicly proposed that a theater be established in Rousseau's native city, the republic of Geneva. This would require a change in the sumptuary laws, and Rousseau foresaw a cascade of harmful consequences for the moral climate of the city. His lengthy and detailed critique was both philosophically subtle and politically effective in helping to defeat the proposal.

According to AP, Quang Paasch of the activist group Fridays for Future said governments attending next week's annual climate conference should keep in mind the goals of the 2015 Paris accord, which set a target of keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit). We need to keep taking to the streets, we need to defend Paris.
Happer, 79, joined the staff of President Trump's National Security Council last fall. And according to documents first leaked to The Washington Post, he appears to be pushing the White House to mount a challenge to the government's official assessment of climate change, which calls climate change a serious national security threat.
Earlier this week, House Democrats formalized proposals for a new committee on climate change, but without the features that proponents of a Green New Deal have sought -- such as the power to subpoena and the authority to vote on legislation and send it directly to the House floor.
It also ignores the fact that the Endangered Species Act has been incredibly successful at accomplishing its main goal: preventing extinction. Ninety-nine percent of the animals that have been listed under the act still exist today.

She sees several possible reasons for the gender discrepancy in terms of attitudes about the virus. Part of it has to do with frontline medical workers: Four out of every five health-care workers in Canada are women. Nursing, in particular, is an overwhelmingly female work force, with more than 90 per cent of Canada's nurses identifying as women.
Offsets, for instance, might be linked to forest restoration in Brazil or promoting renewable energy use in fast developing India.

According to the majority opinion, written by Judge Andrew D. Hurwitz, the plaintiffs have made a compelling case that action is needed. But he continued: Reluctantly, we conclude that such relief is beyond our constitutional power. Rather, the plaintiffs' impressive case for redress must be presented to the political branches of government.
DAN BALZ: And-- and whatever-- and-- and frankly-- and, yeah. So whatever that means. And I think it's-- it is remarkable that we have gone now two-plus weeks and there has been absolutely no indication of where the negotiating could actually take place. Every time they sit down, they seem to be farther away than they were and more dug in. It feels as though each side still believes that this can be a win-lose proposition. I win, you lose.
A BlackRock spokesperson said the firm is in the process of rebranding a number of its funds as environmentally and socially aware to let customers know that these funds include companies with favorable characteristics but are also optimized to offer a similar risk and return profile to broad market indices.

We are down to seven, the magnificent seven, perhaps, who are going into Tuesday. Will the field shrink after Tuesday? Probably. But, again, if you're somebody who can hit viability, fifteen percent in a few of these states, you have no reason to get out yet.

San Diego: Homeless people facing a ticket or arrest by San Diego police could have the infractions cleared if they agree to stay for 30 days in one of the city's shelters, according to a report. The program could help stabilize lives and get people connected with services, while also allowing officers to enforce laws on the street, San Diego police Capt. Scott Wahl told the Union-Tribune. The San Diego Police Department launched a neighborhood policing division in 2019 that includes outreach teams and officers who enforce quality-of-life laws that often involve homeless people. Last summer, police began offering shelter beds in lieu of citations to homeless people who had been contacted for encroachment, illegal lodging, littering or other minor infractions. But while about 300 people took the offer, many left the shelter within a day or two, Wahl said.

One reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long-term effects of some of the earliest large-scale cash transfer programs — a series of government assistance schemes that began in Latin America in the late 1990s. Already we're starting to see the first wave of long-term evaluations, says Evans, who is on leave as a lead economist at the World Bank.

Our founding fathers gave the responsibility over war not to the president but to Congress, Sanders said. That is very clear in the Constitution. And in my view, Congress must, must act in the face of a president who has shown time and time again that he cannot be relied upon to tell us the truth or to make well thought out decisions.

Biden has laid out a plan for unemployment benefits: He would create a health crisis unemployment initiative to help all workers facing a loss of work because of the pandemic; create plans to ensure unemployment benefits are available to those who lose jobs but would be denied benefits for a variety of reasons; extend COVID-19 crisis unemployment insurance, and provide guaranteed emergency paid sick leave and caregiving leave.
Maybe accepting that truth is the first step toward dismantling narratives about patriotism, whose dissent is tolerated and the appropriate ways to protest. White terror helped establish this democracy; Black Americans have tirelessly fought for racial equality and freedom since its inception. Any narrative to the contrary is just watering down the truth of our country's legacy.

The ad focused on trying to split Trump from Loeffler, by highlighting how Kemp—Georgia's governor who Trump says he intends to back a primary challenger against in two years—appointed her to the seat vacated by the now retired former Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA). But the most interesting part of the ad may be how it opens: I'm Raphael Warnock and I approved this message.
Holder will assist Gov. Jerry Brown, yet-to-be-confirmed Attorney General Javier Becerra and the Legislature to protect California's economy and our sensible policies on climate change, health care, civil rights and immigration. This is a critical moment in the history of our nation.

None of the bottles will be opened until the end of February. That's when the company will pop open a bottle or two for an out-of-this-world wine tasting in Bordeaux by some of France's top connoisseurs and experts. Months of chemical testing will follow. Researchers are eager to see how space altered the sedimentation and bubbles.
For Biden, this is not about ruling the minority party. He demonstrated in the primary and general election campaigns that he clearly understands our divided nation. His role as president might be most closely akin to President Abraham Lincoln's: healing deep wounds, listening to and including the voices of rivals — as he did on the political left in reaching out to Sen. Bernie Sanders and his supporters. Should the Democrats control the Senate, Biden's instinct to be magnanimous and inclusive would not only help defeat the pandemic, it also would slowly bring a more constructive tone to our politics.
While there is an ongoing dispute about what is causing the slowdown, scientists agree that it could have a dramatic impact on ocean ecosystems, such as coral reefs and deep-sea sponge grounds.
It's very hard to describe it after that except to say that we improvise together at the same time, in the same room. It's a kind of unique way of working for us. Most people do not work that way.

And for the 26 or so years that we've been together, that's always been the way we work.

As more households transition from just consuming energy to also producing energy with solar panels and other renewable technologies, we will need to build a modern, decentralized electric grid to accommodate them. Rural Americans today need access to broadband Internet the way they once needed electricity. As Americans, especially millennials, look for new transportation options without the stress and cost of driving, we need to provide them with new choices, such as convenient public transportation. And since whatever we construct today will be expected to last for a long time, our investments must make sense in an era of climate change.

What else is holding things up? There is no reason for a Democrat to vote against it unless they fear for their re-election chances. And because of you, they do.
While the swarms appear almost biblical, there is a clear suspect for the cause of the outbreak: the changing climate. Unusually wet and rainy seasons has contributed to the number of locusts, which thrive after rainy weather, Patta reports.
WALLACE: What you think about the report in The New York Times that in 2017, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether or not the president of the United States was a Russian agent?
A key factor, according to Democratic operatives, is anger over the GOP's vociferous attacks on Warnock, the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, the onetime pulpit of Martin Luther King Jr. Loeffler and Republican outside groups have engaged in repeated over-the-top and false slams on Warnock, taking his sermons out of context, labeling him a Marxist and suggesting he covered up child abuse.

So far, this winter has brought ample snows to the Sierra Nevada, the spine of mountains that runs along California's eastern flank. That's good news for Californians, because the range's melted snow provides 60 percent of the state's water supply. Anyone in the United States who likes fruit, vegetables, and nuts should rejoice, too, because water flowing from the Sierra's streams and rivers is the main irrigation source for farms in the arid Central Valley, which churns out nearly a quarter of the food consumed here.

It's crazy to think that 11 sitting senators will all compete for the Democratic nomination, and that's because it's not going to happen. You sometimes get the sense with senators that they say they're interested because it would be too embarrassing to say otherwise. If everybody else has an exploratory committee, why not you?

You can imagine that there might be something like the 'Cornhusker Kickback' ― or the 'Coal Miner's Kickback' in this instance, for Joe Manchin, said Shahid. (The Cornhusker Kickback was the nickname for a short-lived backroom deal that then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) cut with then-Sen. Ben Nelson (D-Neb.) in 2009 to secure Nelson's support for the Affordable Care Act.)

Biden is asking Americans to override their sense of pandemic fatigue and recommit to wearing masks, practicing social distancing and avoiding indoor gatherings, particularly larger ones. He contends it's still the surest way to slow the COVID-19 wave, with more than 4,400 deaths reported just on Tuesday.
After all the drama surrounding her bid to become speaker, she ultimately lost just 15 Democratic votes, mostly from freshman lawmakers who promised on the campaign trail to oppose her.
Again, the mob traipsed through the city, unmasked and sure there would be no threats against their livelihood. The shedding of the masks was a subject of internal debate for the group, a move that some felt would grant their organization added legitimacy and respectability, the Post reported.
Kathryn Murdoch, the wife of Rupert Murdoch's younger son, James, pledged $1 million to the venture. Convinced by polling showing women had vastly different views from men on issues such as climate change and Trump, Murdoch saw the relevance of Ramshaw's idea.
While 2020 brought CO2 emissions declines totaling 6.4% driven by an unprecedented worldwide economic lockdown from COVID, S&P Global Platts Analytics currently projects that global CO2 energy combustion emissions will grow 4.4% in 2021 vs. 2020 levels and not be aligned with the long-term downward trajectory needed to hit emissions targets, said Roman Kramarchuk, head of future energy analytics with S&P Global Platts.
The researchers found that ignoring the VOCs from chemical products had significant impacts on predictions of air quality. In outdoor environments, they found that these products could be responsible for as much as 60% of the particles that formed chemically in the air above Los Angeles.
That portion of climate science is not settled yet — many peer-reviewed papers indicate that might be happening in the future — there are other peer-reviewed papers that indicate those are cyclical changes in terms of the orientation of the jet stream, Morales told The World.

And all the while, people can look to a younger and farsighted vice president as the logical next step. Perhaps the quickest way to get a President Stacey Abrams or President Pete Buttigieg is to first elect a President Biden.

All of these groups and individuals embraced aspects of American history and culture that they celebrated, but they hoped to discard other aspects they abhorred. Because they traveled to regions that were not under U.S. control, they were not secessionists but expatriates.
Ninety-five percent of all the avocados Americans eat are Hass, a variety discovered in California in the 1920s. But the climate of the Central Valley does not allow Hass avocados to grow as well as they do in the milder climates of coastal and Southern California. Even in these locations, Hass only grow at certain times of the year — and not enough to compete with the large amount coming in from foreign markets.
Negotiations are slated to continue throughout the week to resolve the shutdown, which has furloughed 380,000 federal workers and forced an additional 420,000 to work without pay. On Wednesday, Fox News learned, Trump will head to Capitol Hill for a policy lunch with Senate Republicans. Congressional leaders from both parties have been invited to the White House for a 3 p.m. ET sit-down afterward.

MARTIN: Their answers for that question are different, too. It's going to shape Dan's political choice this year. He says he'll caucus for Elizabeth Warren for a lot of reasons, including her plans to fight climate change. Tim, on the other hand, is a conservative. His primary issue isn't climate change at all. It's the economy. And he's voting for Donald Trump. We say our goodbyes...

In short, the agreement doesn't eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States and ships them to foreign countries, he added. This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States.

Peacock echoed that caveat. On their own, each of the components easily fit into a well-balanced and nutrient-dense diet. However, when they all come together into a single meal, it can be a sugar overload. Looking at a couple of popular chains that sell açai bowls, they can have upward of 70 grams of sugar! With such a significant amount, it's frustrating seeing them touted as a super healthy breakfast or snack.

WILLIAMS: No, not surrender. See, I don't think it's a matter of capitulation or surrender. I think it's a matter of saying to the president, let's be honest about this. You had two years of Republican majorities, didn't get done. You had the Senate majority leader say let's negotiate. You refused. So it's bad behavior.
It's breathtaking and heartbreaking the damage that's been done. … A tipping point is playing out right now, the world-renowned climate scientist Dr. Michael Mann, from Penn State University, said in an interview with an Australian TV network. By chance, Mann happened to be on sabbatical in Australia studying bushfires during the most intense part of this fire season.

In my view, it is unacceptable that the Federal Reserve has been hijacked by the very bankers it is in charge of regulating. I think the American people would be shocked to learn that Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan Chase, served on the board of the New York Fed at the same time that his bank received a $391 billion bailout from the Federal Reserve. That is a clear conflict of interest that I would ban as president. When I am elected, the foxes will no longer be guarding the henhouse at the Fed. Under my administration, banking industry executives will no longer be allowed to serve on the Fed's boards and handpick its members and staff.
And Republicans know Democrats' majority is on shaky ground. Democrats lost control of the Senate in 2014, after Republicans ousted Democratic incumbents in North Carolina, Arkansas and Colorado, and swept open seats in West Virginia, South Dakota and Montana.

Most people just see us as the agitators who are never happy, who are never really going to back anyone, who are just constantly throwing stones but not willing to go to bat for any political leader, besides maybe AOC, executive director Varshini Prakash told CNN.

Recent extremely hot, dry conditions have also fueled the fires. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, 2019 was both the hottest and driest year ever measured in Australia.
The entire world will be watching...to see if people of this state are prepared to fight back, Sanders said in Storm Lake on Sunday, according to CBS News Campaign Reporter Cara Korte. He has also emphasized that the Democratic establishment is worried about the strength of his movement. We are their worst nightmare! This is their 'Nightmare on Elm Street,' Sanders said in Sioux City on Sunday, Korte reports.
About $20 billion would be allocated for a more disciplined focus on vaccination, on top of some $8 billion already approved by Congress. Biden has called for setting up mass vaccination centers and sending mobile units to hard-to-reach areas.
Among the changes negotiated by Democrats are stronger provisions regarding the enforcement of labor and environmental standards. For example, the revised pact calls for monitors in Mexico City to make sure Mexico lives up to tough environmental laws, regulations and practices. A verification process will enable U.S. customs workers to block goods from entering the country if they have been produced in violation of those rules.
Last January, a massive cavity the size of two-thirds of Manhattan was found under the glacier, a sign of rapid decay. Scientists continue to warn that the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet could collapse within the next 100 years, leading to a sea-level rise of nearly 10 feet and flooding coastlines around the world.

After a streak that lasted more than two centuries, the transfer of power in the United States has not been peaceful this time around. Until Thursday afternoon, Trump failed to concede. He didn't say he'd participate in an orderly transition of power until around 4 a.m. Thursday, hours after his supporters stormed the Capitol. He's maintained to his millions of his followers that the incoming administration is illegitimate, raising the prospect of more civil unrest in the future.
Sanders: I'm sorry. I really-- I know the media likes that issue, but I'm not gonna get into that issue. We had it out. Senator Warren is somebody I've known for 25 years, have a lot of respect for. We're gonna go forward together. And I have the feeling we'll be working together.
Sending his children to the school was an astounding breach of Southern racial protocol, said Campbell, the former mayor of Atlanta who grew up in Raleigh as the child of civil rights activists.

Ahead of President Obama's last State of the Union address, Republicans are once again blasting what the White House considers a key accomplishment of the president's foreign policy legacy: the Iran nuclear deal. And this time, they're warning that the international agreement could take down the U.S. oil industry.
Raphael Warnock, the pastor of Dr. King's famed Ebenezer Baptist Church; and Jon Ossoff, a young media executive from the Atlanta suburbs, are the Democratic candidates. Kelly Loeffler, one of the Republican senators pushed into the runoff, is a wealthy businesswoman who is an owner of the city's professional women's basketball team and has an estate in the affluent Buckhead section of the city. The context of recent events has injected energy into the runoffs, which have already drawn enormous turnout. The election comes after Joseph R. Biden Jr. became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Georgia in 28 years, a reflection of the party's growing strength in the state, driven overwhelmingly by voters in Atlanta and its suburbs, which together make up nearly half the state vote. It also follows the protracted campaign by President Trump to overturn his loss through recounts, legal challenges and a barrage of baseless allegations of fraud.
We support Premier Jason Kenney's initial efforts in this regard, as his government's Fair Deal panel explores the creation of a provincial revenue agency, withdrawing from the Canada Pension Plan, establishing a provincial police force, and other measures, the report reads.

One of the things that's really driven that is what they call the blogosphere. It's the fact that there are lots and lots of challengers and critics who get out there and discuss, argue, make suggestions, call for changes and the scientists find themselves in that debate, he said.
WALLACE: Then there is -- I guess you have to call him the former frontrunner now, Joe Biden, who took it drubbing in Iowa, an even worse drubbing in New Hampshire and is now counting on the votes of minorities, Latinos, African-Americans in South Carolina and Nevada, to -- to rescue him.
That's a really big — potentially impossibly big — undertaking.
A rising trade deficit, which reduces economic growth, means that the United States is buying more goods and services from other countries than it is selling them. President Donald Trump views America's massive trade deficits as a sign of economic weakness. He blames them on bad trade deals and abusive practices by China and other trade partners.
Is this the way the EU will work post-Brexit? The Brits are just out and we're already missing their open market-oriented approach, the diplomat went on to say, adding: If Germany weighs in too much, smaller EU countries have nothing to say.

The Hamiltonians are the business-minded internationalists, cold-eyed and stability-oriented and wary of wars that seem idealistic rather than self-interested. The Wilsonians are the idealists, whether neoconservative or liberal-humanitarian, who regard the United States military as a force for spreading democracy and protecting human rights. Most foreign policy elites belong to one of these two groups, both political parties include both tendencies in their upper echelons, and most recent presidencies have been defined by internal conflicts between the two.
While awaiting normalcy, sports executives must be more creative in doing something that will seem novel to them: finding a dependable audience. And they must do so with limited resources. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said 40 percent of the league's revenue comes from game nights at arenas. Other sports are similar — and some are even more dependent on live events. Vaccines notwithstanding, teams don't expect a fast return to regular times. All are concerned about how long they can hold on while experiencing extreme revenue shortfalls.

Since being listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 1975, grizzly bear populations in northwest Montana and the Greater Yellowstone Area have more than tripled in size, thanks, in no small part to a hard-earned tolerance and efforts from people like Bradley to reduce conflict between human and bear.
Bleaching events are increasingly taking place regardless of natural warmer or cooler cycles such as El Niño or La Niña. Before the 1980s, mass bleaching of corals was unheard of, even during strong El Niño conditions, but now repeated bouts of regional-scale bleaching and mass mortality of corals has become the new normal around the world as temperatures continue to rise, Hughes said.
If David Frederick is willing to argue against accountability for Shell in court, despite the copious evidence of the company's decades-long campaign to mislead consumers and the public about the existential threat of climate change, they wrote, his appointment would also have wider implications for all communities seeking redress from corporations that lied about the dangers they knew their products would cause.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will also be at the White House meeting. But he has pointedly declined to engage on the budget battle. The Senate unanimously passed the short-term funding bill before Trump, facing a hail of criticism from conservative talk-show hosts, announced he wouldn't sign it because it didn't include funding for the wall. (See Bottom line, above.)
This is the latest in a string of controversial decisions the EPA has made in the final stretch of President Trump's administration. In December, the agency decided not to strengthen air quality standards for ozone and soot, and it enacted a new rule that requires future clean air regulations to weigh economic costs of curbing pollution while ignoring benefits, such as the deaths that could be avoided.
Now, however, by granting legal status to roughly half the nation's population of illegal immigrants, Obama is twisting the law, ignoring the Constitution, and forsaking his primary responsibility as chief executive. For years, he argued publicly it would be unconstitutional for him to take such action because he said, I'm president, I'm not king. Apparently, he now favors a crown on his noggin. In truth, he is king of self-confutation, negating himself with his own words.
She continued in her role as editor in chief of the Texas Tribune but could not get the idea out of her head. In March last year, she sat down with Amanda Zamora, the Tribune's chief audience officer and a veteran of the investigative nonprofit ProPublica, and presented her idea.
Gov. Jerry Brown lifted California's emergency drought status a year ago, after a wet winter. Strict 25 percent conservation orders for cities and towns and other restrictions then were phased out.
3. Setting new ethics rules that prohibit lawmakers and aides from sitting on corporate boards and a new requirement for annual ethics training for all lawmakers.
But the tides turned as the FBI's investigation into alleged Russian collusion with the Trump campaign progressed. During a visit at the White House, Trump called Comey out by name, shaking his hand and saying, in what was both a compliment and a barb, He's become more famous than me. Comey later described an uncomfortable private dinner with the president in which he said Trump asked him twice to pledge his loyalty.
Trump announced the proposal at a White House ceremony that featured invited guests, including construction workers who wore safety vests and white hard hats.
The results Tuesday will help determine the extent to which Biden will be able to enact his $2 trillion plan for reducing emissions from the power and auto sectors. Already his administration is preparing to act without much legislative support.

When Cape Town reaches Day Zero, residents in the popular tourist city of 3.7 million will have to line up to collect 6.5 gallons of drinking water per person per day at some 200 distribution stations. Those restrictions adhere to the World Health Organization's guidelines for the minimum amount of water needed in emergencies.
Congress initially passed the PAYGO or pay-as-you-go rule in 1990 but it expired in 2002. Democrats later reinstated the rule in 2007 but former President Obama carved out room for the 2009 stimulus designed to absord the impact of the financial crisis.

Liberal legal advocates and scholars realized they were in a serious battle for the law with the Federalist Society after the Supreme Court decided Bush v. Gore in 2000, handing the White House to George W. Bush. Peter Rubin, then a professor at Georgetown, founded the American Constitution Society to win hearts and minds of students, lawyers and judges.
Some activists expressed surprise that Hogan joined Franchot and Kopp in voting against the easement, noting that he did not halt the project when they requested he do so last year. At the time, Hogan's office said the issue was for the Army Corps of Engineers to decide.
The former minister says his biggest accomplishment in office was funding a massive expansion of public transit and investments in infrastructure like roads and bridges.

Your country was entered into a green experiment far more radical and transformative (and insane) than anything anywhere within the European Union — including, even, Germany's economically ruinous Energiewende
According to Berkeley Earth, global mean temperature in 2020 — which includes both surface air and ocean temperatures — is estimated to have been 1.27 °C (2.29 °F) above the pre-industrial 1850-1900 average. Pre-industrial is the time before greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels started to impact the climate. That means the planet is only a quarter of a degree away from surpassing the Paris Agreement goal of staying below 1.5 °C of warming.

The next day, I got a text from her saying that although 'it may have seemed okay,' upon further reflection, she felt uncomfortable, the statement read. It was true that everything did seem okay to me, so when I heard that it was not the case for her, I was surprised and concerned. I took her words to heart and responded privately after taking the time to process what she had said.
But I am proud to be here to announce that I will do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to remove a president.

Activists expect Biden not only to use executive orders to roll back a range of anti-LGBTQ policies enacted by President Donald Trump but also choose openly LGBTQ judges.
They also know that a handful of people on Wall Street have extraordinary power over the economic and political life of our country. As most people know, in the 1990s and later, the financial interests spent billions of dollars in lobbying and campaign contributions to force through Congress the deregulation of Wall Street, the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act and the weakening of consumer protection laws in states.
Before [COVID-19], you spent from eight to five in an office. Your heating and cooling was taken care of, your power for your computer was taken care of, you left the lights on, he said. Now that consumers can see those costs, they want them lowered, he said.
There's no lack for public interest and public service-experienced litigators, Hauser said. We don't need to rotate between Republican Big Law and Democratic Big Law.
TRUMP: Congress should do this. If they can't do it, I will declare a national emergency.
SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, D-N.Y.: We should get rid of cash bail entirely.
EDMUNDS: Absolutely. It's a situation where you've got slow challenges playing out over decades and centuries. And you've got short-term challenges playing out overnight. And one playing out over the night were the hurricanes. And the longer-term things are rising sea water temperature and declining pH of the ocean. And so since there are now fewer corals on adjacent islands, it will slow the rate of which the reefs recover. And I think that is very worrying. But that's quite different from saying that they won't recover. And I think in addition, the kinds of coral that live there are changing dramatically, as well.

To examine climate change's real-world impact, this forensic analysis involved investigating the change in probability of Australia's heat, drought and the Fire Weather Index since 1900 by looking for trends in both observations and climate computer simulations. Both methods must be blended together to draw robust conclusions about the impact of climate change.
And what we're most concerned about is making sure that the 35,000 rank- and-file FBI men and women who bravely do their job every day with integrity and fidelity and bravery don't -- aren't being put in that same big toxic stew with those, including Andy McCabe, who are at the top levels of the FBI in 2016 trying to prevent Donald Trump from being president.

While representing the state of Delaware in the mid-2000s, he persuaded the Supreme Court to block BP's bid to build a liquefied natural gas facility in Delaware waters on the grounds that it violated state laws protecting the coastline.
There will be another opportunity to approve a standalone bill that sends money to the American people soon after Biden's inauguration. If Democratic Senate candidates Raphael Warnock and Joe Ossoff are in D.C., that will be possible. If Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue win on Tuesday, McConnell will block that desperately needed assistance.
The giant trade pact between the United States, Mexico, and Canada — ultimately a renegotiated NAFTA — is expected to come up for a vote in the Senate soon (unless there are any impeachment-related setbacks). But environmental advocacy organizations who have condemned the deal's failure to consider climate change are raising alarm about moving forward without binding standards on Mexico to regulate pollution.
After the deal's Thursday release, she also cast the plan as simply one of any number of environmental proposals the House might consider.
And so, it's a new situation, the Middle East is not in the middle of anything anymore and yet he's saying that in this situation with Iran, we were very patient and now we've reestablished deterrence and the levers that adjudicate whether one side wins or loses a war or diplomatic, economic and military. And in this particular situation with Iran they have neither. None of those three and all their decisions are bad in their case.
A separate study from the nonprofit group Mental Health America and The Faas Foundation, which surveyed more than 17,000 U.S. workers, found that employees are even more fixated on finding new positions in the near future.
At a Dec. 11 briefing on the Environmental Protection Agency's proposal to gut an Obama-era clean water rule, acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler credited Trump's leadership for a 2.7 percent reduction in CO2 emissions from 2016 and 2017.
The EPA has been one of the most active agencies in carrying out President Trump's mandate to roll back regulations that conservative groups have identified as being unnecessary and burdensome to industry.
And the scales had fallen from my eyes. There was this other world….It was like being introduced to sex, he said.
Even the lower end of that range of futures, however, can mean destructive storms, displacement and economic upheaval, and that's the reality that teachers have to communicate. To Meghan Duffy, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Michigan, the climate change lecture in her introductory biology course is the most important class she teaches. But, worried that the class might be overwhelming or not communicated well, she surveyed her students for a study published in 2019. After the climate change lesson, students knew more but felt worse: Only 4 percent of the class thought humans would successfully address climate change. One student wrote in an anonymous survey, I understand that global warming is an important part of learning from this class, but at some point one of the lectures gave me an anxiety attack, so that wasn't fun.
Last June, the chemical engineer became what's believed to be the oldest American ever awarded a patent. He says that system could be a big step in saving the world from climate change.
He attacked President Donald Trump's immigration policies, highlighting the White House's six-week experiment with systematically splitting parents from their children at the border.

Still, the extent -- and limits -- of the moderate-progressive coalition that would eventually help elect Biden was not clear until after the unity task forces commissioned by Biden and Sanders wrapped up and published their reports and recommendations. Of the six working groups, none yielded as much movement from the Biden side as the group gathered to address climate policy.
The real opportunity here for investors is that obsolete telecom infrastructure necessarily means big business for firms helping the likes of AT&T T, +0.53% and Verizon VZ, +0.20% upgrade their networks.

The study's authors believe that their research points to a dim future for this population of north Great Barrier Reef turtles. If temperatures continue to rise as a result of climate change, it could lead to a dramatic decline in population.
Cory Booker's former supporters are picking new favorites in Nevada this week, among the new endorsements rolled out Friday by the Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden campaigns. Included are two women of color in the state: state Assemblywoman Selena Torres, now backing Biden, and Reno-Sparks NAACP President Patricia Gallimore, now behind Warren. CBS News Campaign Reporter Alex Tin says a quarter of the Nevada's Democratic electorate is estimated to be women of color, with 22% of likely caucus-goers in the demographic still undecided in a recent poll by advocacy group She the People in the state. Biden and Bernie Sanders virtually tied for the lead in the survey, with only Warren (10%) and Tom Steyer (14%) also clearing double digits.
There's no question this is a hard-power budget, Mulvaney also said Wednesday. It is not a soft-power budget. This is a hard-power budget. And that was done intentionally.
The scandal fueled skepticism about the case for global warming just weeks before world leaders met to agree a global deal on climate change at a United Nations conference in Copenhagen last December.
They want to shake things up. There is a sense that things are broken, and prioritizing working families has to be at the center of the economic system, said Weingarten, whose union has not endorsed a candidate but last week approved its members to support Sanders, Warren or Biden.
Today, we need to cap interest rates on credit cards and consumer loans at 15 percent.
Friends, family and foes, even those within her party who pressed for her to step aside for the next generation, praise her political skills.
We need a banking system that is part of the productive economy – making loans at affordable rates to small- and medium-sized businesses so that we create decent-paying jobs. Wall Street cannot continue to be an island unto itself, gambling trillions in risky financial instruments, making huge profits and assured that, if their schemes fail, the taxpayers will be there to bail them out.

Hurricane Harvey cost $125 billion, second only to 2005's Katrina, while Hurricane Maria, which slammed Puerto Rico, cost $90 billion, ranking third, the NOAA said. Irma was a $50 billion storm, the fifth most expensive hurricane in U.S. history.
Here's what gives me hope. There's a traditional bifurcation in peoples' lives where they separate themselves into one part moral and one part economic. In other words, traditionally we are in a society of let me maximize my income during the week and then I'll give it away during the weekend, which is best embodied by the Warren Buffett giving pledge [where ultrawealthy people commit to giving away at least half their fortunes].
It doesn't have a capital to update its transmission lines, and when I was a kid, the wind didn't have much of effect it does now.

Henson understood the need for more mental health care not just because she's parent, but because she was a substitute teacher before landing her breakout role in the film Baby Boy in 2001. She worked in a special education classroom full of Black boys, she said. One day, one of the boys simply said to her I can't learn this. I can't do this, she says.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Okay. Here's what he's open to. He's open to getting his wall money. We need five billion dollars for the wall in light of the increased threats. He has always put on the table--he put 1.8 million illegal immigrants having a pathway to citizenship in his own plan. So how can you say he's not open minded to it. Here's what I think the deal would look like: given the money we need to secure our border in five billion-- five, six could be well spent. And I think we can put on the table TPS reform. There's four hundred thousand people going to lose their legal status soon who've been here for decades. I'd like to deal with that problem and I would--
The names you see listed below are grouped here by their offices or careers. This is only useful here in the very early going when we are still five months away from the first debate. As we progress, new lanes and groupings will emerge based on the ideologies, personal traits, electoral strategy and attitudes of the candidates. But for now, job description will be enough.
You know, it's one thing to have this so-called top law enforcement policy of stop and frisk. It was ruled unconstitutional. And it has taken him years to say I'm sorry about that. He has the -- he has the resources, but I'm -- I am very uncomfortable with -- with his record. Very comfortable.

Then, at the start of October, Sanders had a heart attack. For a moment, it seemed like he might be down for the count. The incident kept Sanders off the campaign trail for two weeks and raised fears among Democratic voters about his age and health.
Everyone else is up, he said, referring to other countries' overall emissions. We're going down while we have our record-breaking oil and gas production.
Indeed, if we want a quick measure of which countries are rich and which aren't, we might view a nighttime map of the world. Where we see dark, not light, there's not many people, nor much prosperity. And Brazil has plenty of people; the problem is that they lack the wealth to purchase that obvious indicator of economic progress, lights at night.

Part of the problem is that inequality has a new face, according to a new report by the United Nations Development Programme. People are no longer just angry about income; they're concerned about inequalities in political representation and power, higher education, access to technology and the resources to survive climate change.
However, it does not recognize same-sex marriage. Campaigners say gay and transgender people face widespread discrimination and often come under family pressure to marry and have children.

Internal PG&E planning documents on the potential sale, labeled privileged and confidential, show that company officials are concerned about regulatory approval.
As European Union member states, the countries have already abandoned many of their sovereign rights by ditching their national currencies for the euro, agreeing to open borders within the bloc, and submitting to European courts as their highest legal arbiter.

The desert locust is considered the most destructive migratory pest in the world, according to the FAO. A small swarm of locusts can consume enough food for 35,000 people. Farmers are complaining that about 90% of their crops have already been destroyed. The locusts are now moving towards Uganda and South Sudan, a country that is already under significant strain from food insecurity.
It has long been recognized that decarbonization, if done correctly, would be a great job creator, as the economy prepares itself for a world with renewable energy. Of course, some jobs — for example, those of the 53,000 coal miners in the U.S. — will be lost, and programs are needed to retrain such workers for other jobs.

The only crisis here is one that's been created by the president's abrupt change in position at the end of last year in the last days of a Republican-controlled Congress.
O'Rourke had won plaudits for taking the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge administered by the watchdog group Oil Change USA, which bars politicians from accepting contributions over $200 from PACs, executives, or front groups of fossil fuel companies. In December the investigative news site Sludge found that he accepted $430,000 from individuals working in the oil and gas industry, 75 percent of which came in the form of donations over $200. Fossil fuel executives made at least 29 large donations.

He was on a panel about freedom of association. Most people consider it a hallowed right — yet it is one that is not mentioned in the Constitution. Some legal theorists fret over assorted rights being smuggled into the Constitution by activist judges. On the panel, Barnett knew he was seated beside a conservative advocate of judicial restraint. And so, Barnett told me, I said at the end of my little talk, 'I know what you're thinking: What gives lifetime-appointed judges the power to protect a right that isn't actually mentioned in the text of the Constitution?'  He recalled that he paused dramatically. And then, as I had prepared, my next thing was to read the text of the Ninth Amendment, which says the enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. And when I said that, this huge roar [of approval] came up from the audience.
Hollie Chandler, a senior policy analyst with the Russell Group, said in a statement that it was fair to assume that uncertainty over Brexit and the UK's future relationship with Europe could be a significant factor.
I suspect that there will be heightened cooperation within the automotive and tire industries from now on. The regulatory question to ask is whether agency resources have been put in the right place, and whether regulators are focusing their attention on the most important issues. We should also resolve to do the most good for the consumer, by putting agendas aside and responding on the basis of the facts as they emerge. I was disturbed to find a web site called, quote, The Firestone Tire Recall Legal Information Center, end quote. This seemed to be more devoted to finding cases for trial lawyers than for providing assistance to consumers. There will be some hard questioning today, and properly so. The Commerce Committee has a long tradition of oversight in the public interest. We must put safety first. I look forward to our witnesses and the questioning that will follow. And I yield back. WATERS: Congressional hearing getting under way up on Capitol Hill with opening statements by members of two subcommittees. We're expecting to hear from witnesses who you've seen shots of along the way here. They include Sue Bailey, who is the administrator of NHTSA, the new administrator of NHTSA, the Bridgestone/Firestone CEO, Masatoshi Ono and the Ford CEO, Jacques Nasser. We'll also be hearing from a spokesman for State Farm and the Center for Auto Safety this afternoon.

Park Guthrie knows about this paralysis in climate-change-spooked kids. A sixth-grade teacher in Sonoma County, Calif., he has seen the toll that the state's raging wildfires can take on the generally enthusiastic 11- and 12-year-olds in his classes. He has witnessed panic attacks triggered by the mere smell of smoke. When smoke from a nearby controlled burn once drifted to the school, he recalls, one boy smiled blankly and announced, I think I'm having PTSD. Last year, after the Kincade Fire burned nearly 78,000 acres in the county in late October, Guthrie found himself, not for the first time, comforting students worried about their homes and their relatives.
In the last Congress, lawmakers proposed to delist a species of jumping mouse, Mexican wolves, the American burying beetle, freshwater mussels and grizzly bears.
LIASSON: Republicans would've never agreed to that. They know this is something very popular with the president's base. And that's their base, too. They don't want to get in between the president and his base. Of course, now we're going to see how many Republicans vote against it because the House will pass a resolution opposing this. It will go to the Senate. And it will have to be voted on. And there are Republicans who have objections to this on many different levels. On one reason, they don't like, as you said, money being taken from the Pentagon for important projects in their districts some - in some cases to be spent on this.
Lead author of the new study, research wildlife biologist Anthony Pagano, said the new findings require further study. The next step is to use this information to really start to quantify how changes in movement patterns might be affecting the energy demands of these bears.

For many years in California, Harris recoiled from questions about her personal life, which helped establish her image as a disciplined and cautious politician. Her first book, Smart on Crime, reflected that private veneer with its narrow focus on policy, drawing from her experience prosecuting crimes that ranged from child sexual assault to homicide in Alameda County and San Francisco.
The idea that wealth trickles down from the richest to those less privileged has been bashed by none other than billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has argued that people like him should pay more in taxes.

SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, we're going to see. I mean I think based on the polling, we're doing pretty well in Virginia. I think we got a shot in North Carolina. All I can say is the issues that we are talking about and that is health care as a human right, raising the minimum wage to a living wage, dealing forcefully with the existential threat of climate change. Those are ideas, Margaret, that I think are resonating all across this country. I think we have an excellent chance to do well on Tuesday and to win the Democratic nomination.
China is the biggest trading partner for all of its Asian neighbors and a growing investor. But some Asian governments are uneasy about Beijing's strategic ambitions, especially after it built artificial islands and military bases in the South China Sea to enforce its claim to most of the region.

In an email earlier this month inquiring about the status of the more than 200 boards that had come under review, Interior spokeswoman Heather Swift said, Boards have restarted. She did not provide any further details and did not respond to an inquiry Tuesday.
This editorial is correct about the destructiveness of President Trump's actions on climate change. It accurately and poignantly portrays the status of the climate change movement. It is buttressed with historical and scientific fact. It impassionedly appeals to our hearts, minds and souls.
Throughout his lengthy legal career, Frederick, 59, has notched notable progressive victories at the nation's highest court, winning decisions in favor of Tyson Foods workers whose wages the meatpacking giant stiffed, against tobacco companies advertising light cigarettes as safer, and against a gas facility that British oil giant BP tried to build in Delaware waters.

Global sea levels were stable for about 3,000 years until the 20th century when they rose and then accelerated due to global warming caused by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, said climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute in Germany, who wasn't part of the study.

Pelosi's election followed a tense period after the Nov. 6 midterms during which rebellious Democrats pressed for her to step aside in favor of a younger leader. Instead, she battled for weeks to pick off vote after vote, finally securing her victory in mid-December by agreeing to serve no more than four more years as speaker.
There have already been an astounding number of discoveries made about Ötzi, who never could have predicted his future fame the day he was killed in the Alps, near the current border between Italy and Austria. After being shot in the back by an arrow, he was naturally mummified and preserved in a glacier until he was found by a pair of hikers in 1991.
We deserve to be respected for our green record. We do not deserve to be called climate-change deniers by anybody ... We want acceptance of our made-in-Manitoba green strategies.
However, many soldiers and families connected to Fort Hood told Fox News that the personnel changes were merely cosmetic, and they feared business as usual when the spotlight faded.
It's no wonder the ordinary folk who voted Brexit are growing increasingly restive and bitter. The Remainer Establishment — or Deep State, if you prefer — is snatching Brexit away from them; and it's so arrogant, so complacent, so contemptuous of the public that it's scarcely bothering even to hide its tracks.
Governments are expected to spend nearly $13 trillion to help their countries recover from the pandemic, offering an unprecedented chance to fund research on green technology and transition away from fossil fuels. If stimulus packages are invested the right way, the International Energy Agency has found, they could trim expected 2030 emissions by as much as 25 percent. Not since the end of World War II has society seen such an opportunity to reinvent itself.

The left had been sleeping on its laurels, still living in the Warren Court and all of the sudden we were going to have the Roberts Court. And so the idea was to found an organization that would help organize progressive lawyers to protect the core fundamental values that we see in the Constitution.
According to the study, data from past decades showed that fall snow cover in Siberia increased as the Arctic warmed, which cooled northeastern Eurasia. Meanwhile, melting sea ice fueled warmer temperatures in northwestern Eurasia.

I want to mention something, Kellyanne talked about George Herbert Walker Bush in the Rodney King case, as well as Barack Obama in the Freddie --
No, here's -- if you're going to do that -- you know what? I'll take that on any time. I'll take a leave of absence from the White House and talk all day long about that stuff.
I wanted to bring my mom, but I couldn't because any women I stand next to, they say I'm dating them, Pitt joked, as Aniston looked on. It'd just be awkward.
WASHINGTON — Post-election tensions between the West and the federal Liberal government are showing signs of easing, two of Canada's premiers suggested Friday as a contingent of provincial leaders fanned out across the U.S. capital to make the case for cross-border trade and investment in the after-NAFTA age.

DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right. Well, certainly expanding the diagnostic capability is the right move. We're going to have the capacity by the end of this week to diagnose probably ten thousand people a day or screen ten thousand people a day with the public health labs. Hundred labs doing hundreds tests a day. By the end of the week after that, we'll probably bring on another ten thousand. So we'll have testing capacity of, perhaps, as much as twenty thousand a day by the end of the next two weeks. Once we bring on the academic labs, that was really a critical step, bringing on those academic labs--
In other words, Grafton Thomas gave us plenty of warning. The people in charge of protecting us just decided to ignore those warnings.

He says the beginnings of the sudden warming in the stratosphere starts much closer to the ground, in a layer of the atmosphere called the troposphere. But in order for this abrupt disruption to reach upward from the troposphere into the stratosphere, you need the excess energy of an extreme weather pattern — something that has been in no short supply lately in the Arctic.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Who do you think, as people who just ran competitive and successful races, how do you win as a Democrat in 2020 in a presidential race?
So much of that, and more, is contained in H.R. 1, [the For the People Act], which is a great piece of legislation. It doesn't contain everything I would have in there. Election Day, for example, should be a national holiday. But it would be transformative to enact that incredible piece of legislation.
Democratic chairmen of the eight South Jersey counties also fired off a statement last month, demanding an immediate refund of every dime he raised from Democrats since he sold out in December.
Those three elements came together in heart-wrenching fashion this past December when the couple released a video of a starving polar bear on social media. They photographed it on a recent arctic expedition and it was viewed more than 30 million times on National Geographic's social media and web platforms.

But many women said this year's march took on a new tone. Instead of feeling angry, fearful or devastated by Trump's ascent to the presidency, demonstrators said they felt something new: hope.
Georgia is a reliably red state that has not elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 20 years.
THOMPSON: Every time I come out here, I am super surprised at how many, you know, older folk are here. I think that's really important for them to turn out.
But he was so ignored that he could say that and people were like, oh, yeah, okay. You know, whatever. I just want to ask you --
The world ushered in 2019 in a variety of ways, with major capitals and cultural centers drawing the most revelers – and attention.
And now you have a president who took out a general who had blood on his hands? What do we say to somebody, what do we say to these troops having to go there? What do we say, this was said by my friend Mike Wallace, what do we say to those Gold Star families, what do we say to those who have been maimed, what do we say to those who Soleimani did to our country, and when we had a chance to take him out the president acted in very realist terms, as you said earlier. And we did it with purpose.
Pressed as to whether she believed Schumer was doing a good job, Ocasio-Cortez again demurred, turning the focus on President Trump and the current Senate Majority Leader. It's a hard thing to say, too. We've had to deal with a fascist president and Mitch McConnell, she said.
After years of studying these phenomena, Cohen says a clear pattern has emerged. Warm Arctic conditions and a weaker stratospheric polar vortex, is linked to more cold extreme episodes in some parts of the mid-latitudes.
The bottom line in Ossoff/Perdue: Perdue is outperforming Trump in suburbs w/ lots of country club type Rs (no surprise). But he's underperforming Trump in heavily Black areas, where there's a slight but significant drop-off in White turnout relative to Black turnout. #GASEN — Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) January 6, 2021
In the Senate, meanwhile, Republicans solidified a narrow majority while Majority Leader Mitch McConnell publicly disclaimed responsibility for breaking the spending impasse. Hovering over it all was Trump, who showed no sign of adapting to the new political environment.
I'll tell you what happened, I got re-elected with 80 percent of the vote in my generally Democratic, but socially conservative community. More than I had the first time that I ran for office.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And you can watch more of that interview tonight on 60 MINUTES.
The same thinking on comparison shopping applies to car insurance policies. Websites like NerdWallet.com and Compare.com aggregate price quotes for drivers. Not all drivers are created equal in the eyes of insurers.
In October, United Nations scientists issued a dire warning, giving world governments a 2030 deadline to halve emissions or face a cataclysmic temperature spike. Yet emissions hit an all-time high last year and look set to continue soaring as new estimates released Tuesday showed a 3.4 percent surge in the United States alone.
WALLACE: Wish (ph) you could be talking to the commercial.
The first clash could come in the opening days and weeks of the Biden presidency, when the administration and Democrats in Congress craft and begin negotiations with Republicans on what he has promised will be a transformative stimulus bill. This summer, Prakash told CNN she believed that if the first leg of this is a massive infrastructure and jobs plan to reboot the economy and climate isn't a central pillar of that, we're totally screwed.
RICKY GERVAIS, COMEDIAN: If you do win an award tonight, don't use it as a platform to make a political speech. You are no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg.
