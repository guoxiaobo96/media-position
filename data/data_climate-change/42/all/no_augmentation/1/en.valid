the reason he's taking heat is because the people that don't execute his play, defensive end ricky jean francois said. it's going to make it seem like 'well he doesn't know what he's doing, he's not adjusting, he's not doing this.' sometimes he may not have done that, but the majority of times when he did do it, did we follow him? and when we didn't, now he's in the hot seat. now his job is on the line. so i really don't blame it fully on him.

men have not agreed to do a share, let alone a fair share, of domestic work, because they have never agreed on the amount of work that needs to be done. it is difficult to know how they could, because most of the work done in the home does not need to be done. the men who leave ziggurats of dirty dishes festering in the sink are actually involved in a power play which they have no intention of losing. all they need to do is to exploit inertia, and wait it out. sooner or later, the woman will give in, because the squalor is not held against the menfolk but against her. a man who is slovenly and untidy is considered normal; the woman who is, either a slut or a slommack or a sloven or a slag. the external attribute becomes a moral quality, as it does not for a man. this works both ways; a house-proud woman equates her spotless house with her virtuous self and derives her sense of self-worth from the orderliness of her cupboards, rather than qualities of her mind or soul. the only way to escape this tyranny of housework is to abandon the house. you can live with nomads or hunter-gatherers, maybe, or become a nun with nothing but a cell to distract you from the day-long excitement of prayer. or maybe you can make a vow that no more than an hour in any day may be spent on housework—and keep it.
a lifetime of service may best be preserved by giving a life. … honorable purpose in life invites honorable purchase in death. 'this is not new, as many have chose [sic] to give a life based on the view that no other action can most meaningfully address the harm they see. here is a hope that giving a life might bring some attention to the need for expanded actions, and help others give a voice to our home, and earth is heard.

in 1998, a makeover was announced; the millennial barbie is to stand on flat feet, her bosom and hips are to be slightly reduced and her waist slightly enlarged, but she will still be a far cry from action woman. even so, a u.s. columnist objected, why not just give her a moustache, cellulite and varicose veins too? the further from the natural a female form, the more attractive it becomes. the further from the natural a female form, the more feminine it is. barbie has been instrumental in teaching broad-shouldered women, short-legged women, wide-bodied women, real women the world over, to despise their bodies as we do, so that they pay out money that could be put towards the cost of books or computers or bicycles, for cheaply produced, expensively packaged beauty products.

for so many who have called themselves eagles fans for a generation, this is the day, the game, the season, and the team we've dreamed of. the 2017-18 philadelphia eagles are super bowl champions, and they've brought tremendous joy to hundreds of thousands throughout the city and region. they consistently wowed us with their dynamic play and relentless pursuit of victory. their next man up mentality when injuries arose was inspiring to anyone who has ever faced a setback, as was their willingness to embrace the role of underdogs. they looked another storied football franchise in the eyes, and never blinked. so to every member of the eagles, from owners jeff and tina lurie, and christina weiss lurie, to howie roseman and the entire front office staff, to doug pederson and his coaches, and to the players who won our hearts with their resilient and exciting play: thank you. you are champions, and your accomplishments will forever be part of the rich history of philadelphia sports. to the fans: i have long felt that our city's professional and collegiate sports teams bring philadelphians together, regardless of race, income, neighborhood or gender, and that was never more true than during the eagles' brilliant season. we know you have waited years, some for decades, for the chance to crown your birds as champs. i urge everyone to celebrate in a way that is safe and respectful to everyone from neighbors to strangers. go forth and celebrate, but do so in a way that will make philadelphia shine.

neither his good intentions nor his clean prison record were enough to get him a parole date, however. i'm getting denied for what we consider as being little things — you know, insight, you're not showing remorse, he told me over the phone shortly before his ninth parole hearing. those little things, of course, were the very things the parole board considered paramount, but a lot of the board's preoccupations seemed illogical to smith. it had taken him a long time to understand why the authorities considered his group of associates to be a gang — a word he associated with large criminal organizations — or why he would be guilty of murder when the victim was shot by someone else. he said he thought about terry brown's murder every day, but it was hard to access his feelings sometimes, particularly in the hearing room. each time he went before the board, smith ended up tongue-tied and inarticulate. but was that indicative of the future danger he posed to the public?

miller, whose antipathy for immigration dates back to his high school years (when he wrote editorials critical of hispanic students while blasting bilingual high school announcements) and is himself descended from immigrants, has gone so far as to associate immigration, as he said in a june 2016 trump rally, with heartbreak, heartache and needless death. in august of 2018, miller's uncle denounced him as an architect of immigration policies that repudiate the very foundation of our family's life in this country. a former national security council official told politico in november that miller said at one meeting: we must save americans from these immigrant criminals! despite evidence showing that immigrants commit crimes at far lower rates than native-born americans, miller's persona and policy objectives make it clear that, to him, a fixed immigration system is one in which as few immigrants as possible cross america's borders, illegally or otherwise.

jefferson city: the chairman of the missouri veterans commission resigned after releasing an investigative report that criticized the commission for its response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 140 lives at seven veteran nursing homes since september. tim noonan told the st. louis post-dispatch on thursday that he was resigning, citing comments gov. mike parson made last week about the veterans and the commission. a summary of the investigation was released earlier in december, but noonan, who was commission chairman since 2017, had resisted an open records request from the post-dispatch to release the full report. officials inside parson's administration and state sen. jill schupp, a democrat from creve coeur, had urged noonan to release the full report, and he did so after attorney general eric schmitt directed him to, noonan said. that came after parson on wednesday expressed frustration with the commission, which is an independent body. i'm not going to worry about everybody's personal lives that sit on the commission, or the chairman, parson said. i'm just going to absolutely worry about the veterans, and that's my whole focus. noonan said he resigned because of those comments.

denver: a day after gov. jared polis announced that restrictions for places like restaurants and gyms will be eased in much of the state starting this week, some local public health officials said they were concerned about the move. the governor cited improving statewide covid-19 metrics in lifting certain restrictions in 33 counties, including denver and the entire front range, but his announcement wednesday came as not all of those counties meet the individual requirements to downgrade restrictions, the denver post reports. it appears that if there's enough pressure from the business and economic forces in the state that we will change the dial to meet those demands, and that's kind of frustrating, said mark johnson, executive director of jefferson county public health. the announcement came a day after colorado said it had confirmed the united states' first case of a new and apparently more contagious variant of the coronavirus. we don't believe that it in any way reflects the spread of the disease or how dangerous the disease is or our concern about what is going to happen with christmas, new year's or the new variant that is more infectious, johnson said.

the concept of changing one's biological sex is, of course, nonsense, as sex is determined by unalterable chromosomes. an individual can change his hormone levels and undergo surgery to better imitate the opposite sex, but a male on the day of his conception will remain a male on the day of his death. and as discussed below, the idea that there is a real personal trait called gender that challenges or invalidates the identity significance of biological sex is equally fallacious. but the absence of genuine evidence is simply ignored, and faux evidence is created to validate the mania.

on one hand, even with the additional $85 billion added by house leaders to help older people pay for their insurance premiums, many moderates feel the age-based tax credits in the bill replacing those in the affordable care act are too small, particularly for people in their 50s and early 60s. the cbo estimated that under the original version of the house bill, premiums for a 64-year-old with an income of $26,000 a year could rise from $1,700 currently to more than $14,000.

growing up, whenever my sisters or i would have an overly dramatic reaction to something--a loud gasp or high-octane oh my god--we'd say to each other: whoa, you just aunt sara-ed that one. of course, my sisters and i were just engaging in adolescent drama--- spilled milk and all. but for aunt sara, those audible reactions---sometimes heart-attack-level sounds for skinned-knee situations---came from a primal place of genuine concern. she just loved everyone around her too damn much, and didn't like to hear about bad things happening to them. and so, in my family, aunt sara became a verb.

business leaders often turn to examples from history for inspiration — bullet points from business consultants can only take people so far. for those readers, this biography of former supreme court justice sandra day o'connor — the first woman on the highest court — by journalist evan thomas is unlikely to disappoint. before joining the court, o'connor became the first female majority leader of a state senate and then served time as a judge on the arizona state court of appeals. the book's synopsis suggests that it offers inspiration for women and men who want to be leaders and be first in their own lives — who want to learn when to walk away and when to stand their ground.

speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) will try to sell fellow republicans on a bill to help puerto rico deal with its debt crisis at a special meeting friday. ryan said the morning conference meeting would be solely devoted to puerto rico, in an effort to educate members and bring them on board with the bill, which has faced persistent conservative opposition. a lot of members are just coming up to speed on this, he said thursday. it is why tomorrow morning, we're doing a policy conference on just the issue of puerto rico. the members who have been spending a lot of time on this are going to give a presentation to the broader conference to bring people up to speed. the fate of that legislation took a turn for the worse late wednesday, when the house natural resources committee abruptly canceled a markup of the bill. republicans said the delay was spurred by democrats in congress and the obama administration. committee chairman rob bishop (r-utah) said the administration was still trying to alter the bill, making a markup impossible. and ryan contended that the bill did not receive consideration because democrats were not willing to back it. but a wednesday morning hearing on the bill also made clear there was ample conservative discontent as well. several committee members lambasted the proposal, arguing it was a bailout for an island territory with a record of fiscal mismanagement. . . the current bill does not commit any federal funds to puerto rico.

since winning election in 2018, far-right brazil president jair bolsonaro has waged an all-out assault on the country's democratic institutions, sought to undermine faith in its electoral system, and trafficked in many of the same voting-related conspiracy theories that trump and the republican party fomented over the last six months.

proponents of new york city's matching fund system point to changes that greatly enhanced the role of small donors as the public match was increased and the contribution limit for matching funds was lowered. currently, the system provides an 8-to-1 match for contributions up to $175. that means a $175 contribution actually counts as a $1,575 contribution after the public funds are added in. democrats' for the people act uses a 6-to-1 match, a rate used by the new york city system from 2009 through 2018, for contributions up to $200.

women who were unselfconscious and unmade-up 30 years ago, who walked at a natural pace and worked alongside men in the fields and the factories, are now infected. in provincial cities in china, hanging up over shop doorways, you can see boards with padded brassieres pinned all over them, and trays of cheap lacquer and lipstick under fly-spotted glass, so that women who are naturally small-breasted can assume the new shape. beauty salons crimp and curl shining hair with a fall like silk into shapeless frizz. the two billion people worldwide who regularly view baywatch are all recognising a single, tawdry, synthetic kind of skinnied-down, pumped-up, bleached and depilated female beauty. real girls tell me that when they run along the beach, their male companions make fun of their real breasts that bounce up and down—unlike the rigid half-tennis-ball boobs of the baywatch babes. who cares that pamela anderson, who has been put together out of all the movable parts of male and female fetishism, has been abused by her husband? we are selling fantasy here.

boston: gov. charlie baker signed a wide-ranging health care bill friday that he said will codify in law many of the emergency changes made to the state system in response to the coronavirus pandemic. the republican said the new law extends requirements for all insurance carriers in massachusetts to cover covid-19 testing and treatment. it also increases insurance coverage for telehealth services, which have become vital during the pandemic. baker's office said the law also expands the scope of practice for nurse practitioners, other specialized nurses and optometrists; takes steps to protect consumers from surprise medical bills; and calls for a study on the effects of covid-19 on the health care system, among other steps. meanwhile, a covid-19 field hospital that was supposed to open at umass lowell last week instead will open monday after staffing shortages delayed the soft launch. while the site has capacity for 77 beds, the facility has so far only recruited enough nurses to staff one 14-bed pod. lowell general hospital currently has 63 covid-19 patients at its main campus.

and i know you would like to get to the bottom of it, although i saw you on television today and you said that you found nothing wrong. i mean, you know, and i didn't lose the state, brad. people have been saying that it was the highest vote ever. there was no way. a lot of the political people said that there's no way they beat me. and they beat me. they beat me in the ... as you know, every single state ... we won every state. we one every statehouse in the country. we held the senate which is shocking to people, although we'll see what happens tomorrow or in a few days.
the soak-the-rich idea's early traction points to party in which the center of gravity has already moved measurably to the left. barely two years ago, hillary clinton's platform called for imposing a surcharge on the incomes of those earning more than $5 million, effectively saddling them with a 44 percent top marginal rate. and four years before that, after winning a resounding reelection victory in part on a pledge to raise taxes on the rich, obama signed a package that raised the top rate from 35 percent to 39.6 percent for couples earning more than $450,000 a year. obama negotiated that deal with a republican congress.

that communication gap is further exacerbated by what houston prenatal genetic counselor blair stevens calls the elephant in the ob/gyn's office: some patients agree to take the nipt simply to learn the sex of their baby. they may not understand that the nipt is not 100 percent accurate and should be confirmed by a diagnostic amniocentesis or cvs. and they also might not be prepared for — or even expecting — the possible genetic problems the test can reveal.

in practical terms, however, trump and his aides may be able to do less than they did in syria. in that case, tomahawk cruise missiles launched from two navy destroyers destroyed syrian warplanes, air defense systems, fuel and other supplies. but nothing similar is likely from the carl vinson or its escorts — in fact, if any shots are fired it could be the start of a serious major conflict.

smith, a baldheaded black man with a short, graying beard and a nose that looks as if it had been broken more than once, worked as a cook in san quentin prison. he hadn't had a serious disciplinary violation in two decades but was denied parole in each of his eight hearings since becoming eligible in 1996, receiving three-year denials each time. (every parole denial comes with a prescribed length of time — three, five, seven, 10 or 15 years — before the inmate is allowed to try again.) inmates can petition to have their hearing dates moved up; his most recent hearing was just a year and a half earlier. since then, he had studied the transcript carefully, highlighting the parts that told him what he needed to do to increase his chances of parole. he had to participate in self-help groups that focused especially on three things: gangs, overcoming criminal thinking and the suffering of crime victims. the commissioners, he felt, were trying to help him. i know exactly what she was trying to tell me, he said, referring to the commissioner who presided over his last hearing. she's trying to make sure that i don't go out there and fall into the hands of the same people that i dealt with when i came here, which is understandable.

o'toole, an emeritus professor at the university of southern california's business school, shares the stories of more than two dozen business entrepreneurs — some famous, some little known — who tried to incorporate socially responsible business practices into how they ran their companies. yet the result is not a hagiography lauding the careers of these enlightened capitalists, which includes everyone from chocolate magnate milton hershey to cosmetics and skin care founder anita roddick, but a cautionary look at how so many of their sustainable practices were cut short by bankruptcies, acquisitions or unwilling successors — and what other executives can learn from them. at a time when more and more consumers expect business to benefit the greater good, the book is timely. it asks big questions like whether socially virtuous business tactics are actually compatible with shareholder capitalism, and, as he writes in the preface, what may matter most: whether in the collective judgment of corporate executives, executives actually believe it is possible — or sensible — to try to do good as they seek to do well.

as the journal goes on to note, mbs is looking quite a way back into history for that memory of moderate saudi islam, since its harsh blend of strict wahhabi islam was brewed up in the 18th century by the eponymous cleric mohammed ibn abd al-wahhab. tribal influences, and of course the presence of islam's holy cities of mecca and medina, have pushed the kingdom in an islamist direction ever since.

opec and russia fail to agree on oil production levels. an oilfield in the irkutsk region of russia. the prospect of opec, russia and other oil producing countries opening taps could quickly depress oil prices. credit... vasily fedosenko/reuters officials from opec, russia and other major oil-producing countries were unable on monday to reach agreement on whether to allow further increases in oil output in the face of reduced demand from the pandemic. the videoconference was adjourned and was expected to be continued on tuesday. the main issue in the meeting was whether to allow members of the group to raise oil production in february. during a difficult meeting in december, the group, known as opec plus, reached a compromise that permitted production to increase by 500,000 barrels a day starting jan. 1, instead of a previously agreed two million barrels a day. the group also agreed to meet monthly to consider whether further increases were warranted. the first of those monthly meetings, on monday, highlighted differences in the group. producers like russia, iraq and the united arab emirates have their reasons for wanting to lift production. but other members, led by saudi arabia, the de facto leader of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries, are pushing to proceed cautiously. with the pandemic worsening in europe and the united states, the saudi-led bloc figures the demand for oil remains relatively weak, and rising production would probably lead to falling prices.

every day, we hear of women abused; every day, we hear of new kinds of atrocities perpetrated on the minds and bodies of women; yet every day, we are told that there is nothing left to fight for. even if it had been real, equality would have been a poor substitute for liberation; fake equality is leading women into double jeopardy. the rhetoric of equality is being used in the name of political correctness to mask the hammering that women are taking. when the female eunuch was written, our daughters were not cutting or starving themselves. on every side, speechless women endure endless hardship, grief and pain, in a world system that creates billions of losers for every handful of winners. it's time to get angry again.

we entered 2020 on the brink of a trust crisis, as traditional institutions from mainstream media to the government became divisive sources and many flocked to social media circles to serve as their most relied upon source for financial guidance. in fact, during the prosperous decade that preceded 2020, the rise of crowdsourcing meant many of us not only used recommendations from strangers to decide where to eat or what movie to see, it also determined our biggest financial decisions.

greer on barbie it seemed, a quarter of a century ago, that the days of the barbie doll were numbered. barbie was descended from a swimsuit-clad german porno-toy called lilli—a 12-inch peroxided nymph with a sidelong glance, designed to be sold to men in tobacconists' shops. at her american debut in the spring of 1959, barbie was the first toy to be directly marketed to three- to 11-year-old girls on saturday morning television. american girls now own eight barbies apiece, british girls six. with her non-functional body, boasting a nipple-free bosom more than twice the circumference of her minute waist, legs twice as long as her torso, and feet so tiny that she cannot stand on them, barbie is unlikely to have been very effective in her career roles as astronaut, vet or stewardess. every year, barbie gets 120 new outfits, including a range of sexy underwear, and a new career. she has 35 pets, as well as a kitchen, a bathroom and a patio. she is put together by 11,000 chinese peasant women in two factories in guangdong province; 23p of the total price of a barbie doll is payment for their labour. sales last year topped $1.2 billion. more than one billion barbies have been sold since 1959; she is brand leader in every one of the 140 countries where she is sold.
the disadvantage is that the government would have to create a whole new system to asses wealth — including real estate and private business ownership — and then tax it. that wouldn't be cheap. and many experts say it's even easier for rich people to avoid a wealth tax than an income tax as they can shelter much of their wealth overseas.

moncef slaoui: well, its-- and its capacity to spread is higher. frankly, i'm-- i'm not very clear about the data showing a differential in accelerated spread between adults and children, but the fact of the matter is it will spread faster into the population. i think it should be a signal, again, to say what we need to do as a population is wear masks, distance ourselves, wash our hands, be very aware of people around us and continue to be very careful around the transmission.

to best explain it, swan used the example of a grandmother copying and pasting a link and sending it to her grandson. it's a popular news story that's been trending, but the original site that housed the content has no idea that the traffic generated from that simple share stemmed from grandma's original email. her grandson can tweet out the story, which gets re-tweeted by 10,000 people who then click on it. it starts a domino effect with an untraceable chain, which carries with it implications for how brands and organizations need to better assess their analytics and how they're reaching users.

-- small towns with federal workers are seeing the strain on local businesses. heather may, annie gowen and joel achenbach report: many of the affected federal workers — including 10,000 people in utah, 6,200 in west virginia and 5,500 in alabama — have salaries far below the average $85,000 for government employees. but those paychecks drive local economies, and workers are starting to make tough choices about how to spend them — eating out less, limiting travel and shopping at food pantries instead of grocery stores — creating a ripple effect through the neighborhoods and towns where they live.

abby finkenauer and cindy axne: first women elected to house from iowa
the house a year ago passed a bill to make the prohibition on federal funding for abortions — usually contained in a legislative provision called the hyde amendment — permanent, but the senate did not, and it's not on the agenda. the house also last year passed a bill banning abortions in most cases after 20 weeks (considered a late term abortion, one of trump's pledges), but a similar measure in the senate is seen as unlikely to pass.

according to the department of transportation, which oversees the observance of daylight saving time, the uniform time act of 1966 established the practice of switching clocks as we know it today. the dot says moving the clock forward by an hour saves energy by providing an extra hour of sunlight in the evening, thus reducing the need to use household electricity for lighting. the agency says that it also prevents traffic injuries because more people are commuting during the daylight and that it helps cut crime because more people are out conducting their affairs during the daylight rather than at night, when more crime occurs.

-- democratic operatives with ties to a disinformation campaign in last year's alabama senate race, which was inspired by russian tactics, are attempting to distance themselves from the effort. craig timberg, tony romm, aaron c. davis and elizabeth dwoskin report: recent revelations about project birmingham … have shocked democrats in alabama and washington. and news of the effort has underscored the warnings of disinformation experts who long have said that threats to honest, transparent political discourse in the age of social media are as likely to be domestic as foreign. … but all those who have acknowledged playing a role in project birmingham have denied knowing the full extent of the activities described in [a document on the operation]. project birmingham got its funding from internet billionaire reid hoffman, who emerged as a leading underwriter of democratic causes after the 2016 election. while acknowledging his money ended up paying for project birmingham, hoffman said he did not know how his funds were used until details began to emerge in the new york times and the post.

for more than two months, as trump has parroted absurd claims of voter fraud and stolen or disappeared votes, bolsonaro remained one of his only international allies in the fight. he was one of the last world leaders to recognize president-elect joe biden's november victory, and still seems hellbent on pretending that trump isn't going anywhere yet.

for any headlines that read, 'daines to oppose electoral college vote or anything like it ... they are incorrect, or perhaps, more misleading, daines spokesperson katie schottler told the missoula current. for all stories following today's news, if you are to include something like 'daines is to object to electoral college vote,' it absolutely should be noted that it's contingent on the election commission, and it's focused on disputed states.

workers in goods-producing industries like manufacturing and agriculture are also quite common in the early states, especially in iowa and south carolina. they may provide an insight into who could do well among blue-collar voters in key midwestern swing states. but nevada ranks near the bottom on workers who make or grow products. service workers, who make up a lion's share of the national economy but get less attention politically — are the stars in nevada, where las vegas union members are a critical voting block.

the important caveat in what pelosi has said this week about impeachment is that mueller has not yet completed his investigation or issued any kind of report. key former trump aides are still cooperating with the russia investigation. whatever mueller finds could change the impeachment equation immediately and dramatically. or not. that's why it's important to wait and see what he finds. there are plenty of democrats who think there are already grounds to impeach trump right now. but they are not, as described above, in the majority.

during the 2016 election campaign, abortion advocates on both sides studied trump's past as a supporter of abortion rights and planned parenthood for clues about how reliable, true or deep his conversion to the other side has been. at this point, the analysis of trump seems to have stopped, and the focus has shifted to the fact that he has surrounded himself with leaders well known in the antiabortion movement, including vice president pence (who spoke at last year's march) and charmaine yoest, longtime leader of americans united for life and now a top communications executive at the department of health and human services.

not content with showing pre-teens how to use foundations, powders, concealers, blushers, eye-shadows, eye-liners, lip-liners, lipstick and lip gloss, the magazines identify problems of dryness, flakiness, blackheads, shininess, dullness, blemishes, puffiness, oiliness, spots, greasiness, that little girls are meant to treat with moisturisers, fresheners, masks, packs, washes, lotions, cleansers, toners, scrubs, astringents—none of which will make the slightest difference and all of which would cost money the child does not have. pre-teen cosmetics are relatively cheap but, within a few years, more sophisticated marketing will have persuaded the most level-headed young woman to throw money away on alchemical preparations containing anything from silk to cashmere, pearls, proteins, royal jelly, placenta extracts, ceramides, biotin, collagen, phytotensers, bisabolol, jojoba, hydra-captors, serine, fruit hydroxy-acids, oleospheres, corneospheres, nanovectors, glycerol—anything real or phony that might fend off her imminent collapse into hideous decrepitude. yet consumer research regularly reports that nothing applied to the surface of the skin can affect the underlying structures or prevent aging, and still the anti-aging products sell. every day, hospitals put placenta into special freezers to be collected once a week by unmarked vans and sold to face-cream manufacturers. so desperate are some women to stave off aging that they are prepared to submit to injections of botulin toxin to freeze their facial muscles and prevent wrinkles. what is truly depressing about the false dawn of feminism is that, as we have been congratulating ourselves on largely imaginary victories, bdd has become a global pandemic.

democrats won't have a chance to strengthen their hand in the senate until the next election in 2020, which also happens to be when trump is up for re-election. beating him and putting a democrat in office is probably a much more tantalizing idea to someone like nancy pelosi than impeaching trump. her most recent comments on impeachment, made to nbc news just before she was sworn in as speaker, were interesting on this point, when she said no decision should be made until special counsel robert mueller delivers his report on the russian election interference investigation.

link copied link defense minister says no decision on pulling canadian troops from iraq, calls situation 'complex' toronto — canadian defense minister harjit sajjan said monday that no decision has been made to pull canadian troops from iraq and stressed the need for de-escalation in the region. in a television interview with the canadian broadcasting corp., sajjan said that the iraqi parliament's decision to pass a nonbinding resolution calling on all foreign troops to leave the country created a complex situation. we know the current situation is now far more complicated, and we have to accept their process, he said, but it is more complicated than just one vote. canada has hundreds of military personnel in iraq as part of both the nato mission and the global coalition fighting the islamic state. it has suspended both of those missions, but sajjan said he hopes they will continue. he told the cbc that canada has taken the appropriate steps for force protection in iraq and that some nonessential personnel have been moved out of the country in the wake of soleimani's killing. asked if u.s. officials had given canada notice of their plan to kill the iranian general, sajjan said that canada had an indication something was going to happen but did not know what was going to happen. in a television interview on monday with ctv news, sajjan condemned iran's actions in the region but would not comment on whether he thought soleimani's killing was legal.

what's more, even outside his proposed wealth tax, bloomberg's broader tax plan could save him and his company millions versus what he would pay under plans proposed by his rivals. for instance, bloomberg would raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from a current 21%, but not all the way back to the 35% where it was before president donald trump and congressional republicans lowered it in late 2017. (rivals like pete buttigieg, sanders and warren would like to roll back mr. trump's corporate tax cut completely.) that 2017 corporate-rate change saved bloomberg's company roughly $550 million last year.

the grand mosque terrorist incident was also a landmark moment in deteriorating relations between saudi arabia and iran, and by extension sunni and shiite islam, since iran was widely believed to be involved in the attack. a dismal contest between saudi arabia and iran began to demonstrate which was more pious and faithful to islamic law. fundamentalism spread rapidly across formerly liberal and cosmopolitan cities across the middle east, which until the islamist upheaval of the late seventies resembled american and european cities of the same era. it didn't help matters that islamic fundamentalism mixed easily with marxist quackery.

-- if britain leaves the european union without a deal, it could reverberate across other e.u. countries, including the netherlands. michael birnbaum reports: the netherlands — britain's main trading partner on mainland europe — is among the most-prepared for the possibility that britons will leave the e.u. on march 29 without a deal to manage the withdrawal. leaders here fear that the best efforts of a nation that loves to be prepared may not be enough to safeguard against the mess. and britain's other trading partnerships in europe could be even worse off. … irish lawmakers may have to set aside all other business this month to pass 45 pieces of emergency legislation aimed at mitigating the impact of brexit. france is building roads, warehouses and checkpoints near its ports in preparation for new customs controls.

what women won was the right to undergo invasive procedures in order to terminate unwanted pregnancies—unwanted not just by them but by their parents, their sexual partners, the governments who would not support mothers, the employers who would not employ mothers, the landlords who would not accept tenants with children, the schools that would not accept students with children. historically, the only thing pro-abortion agitation achieved was to make an illiberal establishment look far more feminist than it was. the abortionists who went to prison in the run-up to legalisation for helping girls in trouble were all male. all saw themselves as champions of women and defenders of women's rights. they were repaid with the love and loyalty of women, who were grateful for the right to expiate their sexual activity in pain and grief. the goal was every child a wanted child; it should also have been every abortion a wanted abortion, but the two sides of the phony debate were never to meet. any feminist who saw abortion as an assault on women and agitated for a concomitant right to bear children without being condemned to poverty, misery and failure was suspected of being a crypto-right-to-lifer. in 1997, cardinal winning [leader of scotland's 750,000 catholics] took the first step in the direction of providing a genuine alternative to abortion by offering support in the form of an unspecified lump sum of money to women who would otherwise have an abortion because they could not afford to have a baby.

the killers at barclays center (jan. 9, 8 p.m.). in an era short on arena-level rock 'n' roll heroes, the killers perform a valuable service simply by continuing to exist. the group's fifth album, wonderful wonderful, is a good example: it's a fun listen, and it provides a welcome excuse for the band's frontman, brandon flowers, to strut through a decade-plus of killers hits at concerts like this one in brooklyn.

castro: i think the administration has to be careful not to be too heavy-handed given the united states' involvement in latin america in the past. ultimately, the people of venezuela have to be able to choose who their leader is. but i think there's two things that need to happen immediately. first, we need to make sure that that humanitarian aid gets into the country because there's so many people who are starving and suffering. the second thing is that the united states congress should move right away and the president should move right away to offer temporary protected status to the people of venezuela to be able to come here to the united states at least temporarily if they need to.

the less she expected it, the more generous he feels for having done it. to her anxious question do you love me? he has an easy answer. of course. i married you, didn't i? the interesting thing about this particular con is that men need marriage more than women do. a man without a wife is fragile; prisons are full of men who never married and unmarried men are more likely to die violently. a wife, whose first duty is to stand by her man, reassure him, build up his confidence and attend to his creature comforts, is an asset to any man; performing such a role is not necessarily advantageous to the performer. yet marriage is represented to women rather than men as a sign of success so effectively that failure in a woman's pair-bonding will neutralise success in any other field. success which might put pressure on her pair-bond is success too dearly bought. magazine after magazine offers young women advice on how to get their man to commit himself; there is nothing comparable in men's literature. men buy literature about men's toys and pastimes; women buy magazines about men and relationships. though young men have searing anxieties of their own about relationships, relationships are not represented to them as the only things of value in their lives. this fundamental asymmetry distorts all youthful male-female interaction: the girls put too much into their sexual relationships and set too much store by them, making demands that immature males cannot afford to recognise.

iraq is a tough country under any circumstances, made more so after the 2003 u.s. invasion that upended the middle east and cost so much in u.s. lives and treasure. but iraq also created strange bedfellows. the u.s. troops worked alongside iraqi and iranian militia to destroy a common enemy, the islamic state terrorism group. and even as washington was confronting iran over its nuclear program and malign behavior elsewhere, we maintained an uneasy coexistence in iraq, where tehran holds considerable sway.

greer on body image show me a woman who loves her body every woman knows that, regardless of all her other achievements, she is a failure if she is not beautiful. she also knows that whatever beauty she has is leaving her, stealthily, day by day. even if she is as freakishly beautiful as the supermodels whose images she sees replicated all around her until they are more familiar than the features of her own mother, she cannot be beautiful enough. there must be bits of her that will not do: her knees, her feet, her buttocks, her breasts. however much body hair she has, it is too much. however little and sweetly she sweats, it is too much. left to her own devices, she is sure to smell bad. if her body is thin enough, her breasts are sad. if her breasts are full, her arse is surely too big. what is pathological behaviour in a man is required of a woman. a bald man who wears a wig is a ridiculous figure; a bald woman who refuses to wear a wig is being stroppy and confrontational. women with too much (i.e., any) body hair are expected to struggle daily with depilatories of all kinds in order to appear hairless. scientists call abnormal preoccupation with a perceived defect in one's appearance body dysmorphic disorder, or bdd. yet no one would say that the woman who puts herself through the agonising ordeal of hot-waxing her bikini-line must be suffering from bdd.

preoccupation about her appearance goes some way towards ruining some part of every women's day. multi-million-dollar industries exploit both her need for reassurance and her need to do something about the way she looks. thirty years ago, it was enough to look beautiful; now a woman has to have a tight, toned body, including her buttocks and thighs, so that she is good to touch, all over. remember, she will be told, beauty starts from within, so she keeps her bowels open with plenty of fibre and her kidneys flushed with lots of pure water. being beautiful from within takes even more time than slapping beauty on from without. demi moore is said to work out for four hours a day, beginning with a cardiovascular aerobic workout, then working her legs and buttocks with pliés, standing lunges and thigh lifts, her upper body with shoulder and punching exercises, and toning her abdominal muscles. she also eats only non-processed, pesticide-free, totally vegetarian foods. the result—taut abs, a rock-hard butt and twanging musculature—was still not enough to save her marriage. whatever a woman does, she must not look her age. the fitness regime is lifelong, to go with the lifelong sexual activity that is nowadays obligatory. the uk beauty industry takes ú8-9 billion a year out of women's pockets. magazines financed by the beauty industry teach little girls that they need make-up and train them to use it, so establishing their lifelong reliance on beauty products.

both moves were predictable, as was the release of baalke, whose success as a gm with the 49ers now, it's clear, was dependent on how jim harbaugh molded and improved the players baalke gave him. baalke won a power struggle with harbaugh, who headed to michigan. the niners became historically bad without him, and baalke's choice of kelly to work with such a weak roster looks worse than hiring caretaker jim tomsula after harbaugh left. at least tomsula went 5-11, three more victories than kelly managed.

greer on marriage some of the briefest marriages are those that follow a long period of cohabitation. nobody quite knows why this is so, but the theory is that unforced cohabitation is less oppressive than sanctioned cohabitation. marriage does make a difference; even when the marriage service does not contain the bride's pledge to love, honour and obey, it acts in the interest of a husband rather than a wife. though the bride herself may not feel that she has left the family of her father and been taken into the family of her husband, the ancient dynamic still prevails. his friends will now be her friends, but her friends are unlikely to become his; even if her parents are not entirely displaced by his, his will take precedence. the dynamic of mutual accommodation that propelled a couple's informal cohabitation is unnecessary once marriage has confined them. as both are bound, the power will come to be concentrated in the person best prepared to take advantage of the situation, and that person is the male partner. having been so lucky as to acquire a wife, he begins to take the liberties that husbands have traditionally taken, comes and goes as he pleases, spends more time outside the connubial home, spends more money on himself, leaves off the share of the housework that he may have formerly done. she sees her job as making him happy; he feels that in marrying her, he has done all that is necessary to make her happy.
new york stock exchange pressured to push ahead and delist 3 chinese firms a china telecom office in shanghai. the new york stock exchange said monday that it had halted plans to delist china telecom, china unicom and china mobile. credit... alex plavevski/epa, via shutterstock the trump administration and members of congress pressured the new york stock exchange on tuesday to remove china's three major state-run telecommunications companies from the exchange. the stock exchange late monday had reversed its original plans, announced last week, to delist the companies to comply with an executive order from the administration aimed at stopping american investment in companies linked to the chinese military. monday's sudden reversal by the exchange sowed confusion and reflected the ongoing fighting within the trump administration about how hard a line to take against china during president trump's final days in office. treasury secretary steven mnuchin has been pushing for greater accommodation for chinese companies, while officials in the department of defense have argued that the companies in question must be delisted for national security reasons. the big board said late on monday that it had halted plans to delist the companies after consulting with the treasury department. the about-face came a week after the exchange said it would stop the trading of shares in china unicom, china telecom and china mobile by jan. 11 in response to a trump administration executive order that blocked americans from investing in companies tied to the chinese military.

portland: a health care worker was hospitalized after having a severe allergic reaction to the moderna covid-19 vaccine, according to the oregon health authority. the worker, an employee at wallowa memorial hospital, experienced anaphylaxis after receiving a first dose of the vaccine last week, officials said late thursday. the health authority said vaccines for covid-19 can cause mild to moderate side effects in some people, including pain and swelling on the arm and sometimes fever, chills, tiredness and headache. the centers for disease control and prevention has reported that in rare cases, some people have experienced severe allergic reactions after getting a covid-19 vaccine, health officials said in a press release. an allergic reaction is considered severe when a person needs to be treated with epinephrine or epipen, or if they must go to the hospital. health officials will continue to track adverse reactions to the covid-19 vaccines.

i just, i just don't know why you don't want to have the votes counted as they are. like even you when you went and did that check. and i was surprised because, you know ...the check... and we found a few thousand votes that were against me. i was actually surprised because the way that check was done, all you're doing is you know, recertifying existing votes and, you know, and you were given votes and you just counted them up and you still found 3,000 that were bad. so that was sort of surprising that it came down to three or five i don't know. still a lot of votes. but you have to go back to check from past years with respect to signatures. and if you check with fulton county, you'll have hundreds of thousands because they dumped ballots into fulton county and the other county next to it.

(the idea also drew praise from at least one figure on the right, with ann coulter tweeting she agrees.) julián castro, the former obama administration housing chief moving toward a presidential bid, pointed to history in endorsing ocasio-cortez's idea during a sunday appearance on abc's this week.

he made an educated guess: a little bit of it, maybe, you've got a freshman quarterback [trevor lawrence], you've still got some young guys on the offense that even though they've been through a lot of battles, are still kind of feeling their way out. i remember that with deshaun's group a little bit their freshman and sophomore year — referring to deshaun watson of the nfl, formerly of clemson — we kind of got better as the game went, and then by deshaun's junior year, we got off to some really fast starts early. i think that comes with experience. but there's no doubt, we want to get off to a fast start, but you know, the same thing two years ago, i think we were down 14-0 [early in the second quarter, before winning, 35-31]. so there's some lessons to go if you get in that situation as well.

a trickle of trucks continues to ease britain into life outside the e.u. a police officer in the port of dover, england, checks a driver's coronavirus test on monday before allowing the truck onto a ferry. credit... glyn kirk/agence france-presse — getty images on the first working day after britain left the european union's single market and customs union, the traffic trickling through the country's busiest port was running smoothly. so far, the imposition of customs declarations for british exporters, the first in decades, hasn't led to the delays some had predicted. but the transition has been made easier by low levels of truck traffic. the eurotunnel and ferry operators, which carry trucks across the english channel, said boats and trains were running on time on monday. grant shapps, the transport secretary, said on sunday that 98 percent of the trucks heading to mainland europe via dover and nearby terminals had the documents they needed. but traffic numbers were low because of the new year's day holiday and weekend. the amount of goods flowing between the two countries was also low because companies had stockpiled last year amid uncertainty about whether london and brussels would sign a trade deal and eliminate potential tariffs by dec. 31, the end of the brexit transition period. much of britain is also under strict business and social restrictions to curb the pandemic.

there will be a split among democrats. it's much easier to be united in pursuit of power than it is to stay united in power. trump, to his credit, was able to effectively marshal republicans, often through fear and bullying, during his time in office. as president, it's unlikely biden will use those same tactics. and he'll have to contend with progressives on the left who want more attention to big problems like climate change and inequality that require systemic change the moderates in his party have less interest in pursuing. a year from now, it will be much easier for republicans to focus on biden's policies -- and he's likely to be a relatively moderate president -- in a way to aggravate and turn off progressives. vermont sen. bernie sanders won't quietly let biden take the moderate route. neither will massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, new york rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez or the congressional black caucus.

in the united states, surgical abortion is usually a 10-minute procedure—vacuum aspiration with local anaesthetic; in canada, a cumbersome two-stage procedure, involving the insertion of a laminaria tent, and dilatation and curette under general anaesthetic 24 hours later, is preferred; in russia, which has the highest abortion rate in the world, no anaesthesia is used; in britain, vacuum aspiration under general anaesthetic is usual. recently, the use of better pregnancy testing and smaller cannulas has made possible the surgical removal of the fertilised ovum as early as eight to 10 days after conception, when it is no bigger than a pinhead—at much the same point that it would be shed by the women using the contraceptive pill or an intrauterine device. at the time of writing, only about 20 of the clinics affiliated with planned parenthood are using the method—and only in the united states. to be pregnant against your will is to see your life swerve out of control. to become a mother without wanting to is to live like a slave or a domestic animal. like any other adult, a woman would wish to be infertile and fertile when appropriate: she is led to believe that contraception is her duty and that the available techniques are easy to use and completely effective. if she were totally in control of the manner in which she is sexually active, she might insist that her male partner control his excessive fertility rather than delegating to her the responsibility for inhibiting his power to fecundate.

scenario no. 5 — if the two sides can't agree on a long-term deal by feb. 15, the redskins limit cousins's ability to go elsewhere by using the nfl's transition tag during the permissible window ( feb. 15 to march 1). the transition tag's salary guarantee is less than franchise tag (the nfl hasn't yet released the position-by-position tag values for 2017. in 2016, the transition tag value for quarterbacks was $17.696 million — or roughly $2.3 million less than the franchise tag.) under the franchise tag, cousins could negotiate with other teams and sign an offer from another team. the redskins would have only the right of first refusal and would get no draft-pick compensation if they choose not to match the other team's offer.

he doesn't have a typical day but his job goes beyond what the job title suggests. the reason why i can stay here as long as i have is because, truly, each week and each day there is something new. when you are dealing with that many associates, it's kind of like working at the united nations. if you name the nationality, personality or temperament, we have it. you have to be as much of a chef as you do a financial planner, a guidance counselor, even a pastor at times. it's amazing what comes across the chef's plate here and to keep all the moving parts moving is unique.

there will be so much more covid. the beginning of biden's presidency will likely be judged more for what he does to kickstart the use of covid vaccines than for any large policy proposals. the country is at war with the disease and, as he prepares to take office, thousands of americans are dying each day. he's promised to move heaven and earth to get vaccines out to americans, something more easily said than done as he navigates public skepticism of vaccines.

other major factors include the large-scale incorporation of surface, air and undersea drones, meaning carriers could operate at safer standoff distances when enabled by new platforms such as the mq-25 stingray, a first-of-its-kind drone able to nearly double the strike range of carrier-launched fighter jets such as f-35s and f/a-18s. then there is the question of evolving ship defenses, meaning newer kinds of layered defense weapons to include ew (electronic warfare), lasers, aerial sensor nodes, advanced radar and faster computer processing for fire control all continue to massively improve carriers' ability to operate safely in high-threat environments such as waters within striking range of china's heavily touted carrier-killer df-26 and df-21d anti-ship missiles. fast-evolving ship defense technologies are likely one reason why senior navy leaders continue to emphasize that u.s. carriers are going nowhere soon and can operate wherever they need to, whenever they need to when called upon. while the mission to project massive attack power from the sea is by any estimation here to stay, its particular size, shape and technological configuration certainly may evolve.

dev patel plays saroo as an adult struggling with his identity, something i've found to be an experience every adopted kid feels at one point in their lives or another. the results of his search are beyond belief, but it's his journey that resonated most strongly with my own experience. on the one hand, you share the unconditional love for your parents that they have for you, not to mention eternal gratitude for the life they've given you. but as saroo shows, there's often a lingering thought about where you came from. we all yearn for our truth; who we are, where we come from, maybe where we get certain quirks or talents (for me i long wondered where my voice came from since my mother very well knows it was not from her). but finding those truths is the most personal of journeys, coming to each of us at different times and in different ways. on top of that, there's always a part of you that worries this is somehow a betrayal as if your parents and your life are not enough.

instead of refining petroleum, the refiners would reprocess spent electrolytes and instead of dispensing gas, the fueling stations would dispense a water and ethanol or methanol solution as fluid electrolytes to power vehicles. users would be able to drop off the spent electrolytes at gas stations, which would then be sent in bulk to solar farms, wind turbine installations or hydroelectric plants for reconstitution or re-charging into the viable electrolyte and reused many times. it is believed that our technology could be nearly 'drop-in' ready for most of the underground piping system, rail and truck delivery system, gas stations and refineries.

your position is not that you are opposed to this ideal outcome in which there would be two states, but that you recognize that at this moment given the circumstances that exist in the world today, and in that region, in particular, it is not likely to have that outcome. and hopefully, that will change. hopefully, the palestinians will have better leadership. hopefully, they'll be more prosperous. hopefully, they'll have an opportunity to grow their economy and their security. and maybe in 20 years, 15 years, five years, sooner rather than later, we all hope there will be the opportunity for this to occur, but right now those conditions are perhaps not in place. and the worst thing to try to do is go in there and impose on our most loyal and important ally in the region a deal that is bad for their security and bad for their future, is that an accurate characterization of your feelings with regards to the two-state solution?

television commercials show beaming women snatching a single soiled garment from the back of husband or child, and producing it blazing clean minutes later, having been through the whole washing and drying process aided by a horde of sophisticated bio-digesters, enzymes and whitening agents as well as immense amounts of power and water, all squandered on a single garment. kids won't wear their jeans and t-shirts for more than a few hours each before into the machine they go. the person who does all this work is usually female. advertisers and market researchers who tried to buck the stereotype and show men spraying harpic under the rim of the toilet very soon realised their mistake. nowadays, it is always a woman who pops the meal in the microwave, whips off her apron, uncorks the wine, lights the candles and waits. there is no magazine called man and home. the 23 percent of men who will consent to cook when they have a woman in the house do so on special occasions with great song and dance, leaving the clearing up to be done by her. men who clean and wash are presumed to have a wife in hospital. the few men who do a hand's turn around the house expect gratitude and recognition, so sure are they that, though it is their dirt, it is not their job. work around the house is as gendered as ever it was.

women's liberation did not see the female's potential in terms of the male's actual; the visionary feminists of the late sixties and early seventies knew that women could never find freedom by agreeing to live the lives of unfree men. seekers after equality clamoured to be admitted to smoke-filled male haunts. liberationists sought the world over for clues to what women's lives could be like if they were free to define their own values, order their own priorities and decide their own fate. the female eunuch was one feminist text that did not argue for equality. at a debate in oxford, one william j. clinton heard me arguing that equality legislation could not give me the right to have broad hips or hairy thighs, to be at ease in my woman's body. thirty years on, femininity is still compulsory for women—and has become an option for men—while genuine femaleness remains grotesque to the point of obscenity. meanwhile, the price of the small advances we have made towards sexual equality has been the denial of femaleness as any kind of a distinguishing character. in the last 30 years, women have come a long, long way; our lives are nobler and richer than they were, but they are also fiendishly difficult. the career woman does not know if she is to do her job like a man, or like herself. is she supposed to change the organisation, or knuckle under to it? is she supposed to endure harassment, or kick ass and take names?

panasonic is hardly the first company to try to change a product's image, though most marketing makeovers are aimed in the other direction — turning old and fusty into young and hip. think not your father's oldsmobile or the rebranding of old spice cologne for younger men. in a world where hip-hop and dance music have become worldwide phenomena, sought after by marketers of everything from energy drinks to running shoes, it is in some ways remarkable that an authentic part of the culture has turned its back.

there's no one in the administration or in d.c. that's contemplating a federal bailout of puerto rico, white house press secretary josh earnest told reporters on june 29. that statement is simply false. it may be true that the treasury is not contemplating cash subsidies or loan guarantees for puerto rico, but it already is providing something just as good: tax credits for u.s. companies operating in puerto rico on a puerto rican tax designed to give those companies u.s. tax credits. sound complicated? yep. that's why nobody is paying attention. think about it this way: puerto rico imposes a tax that the federal government pays. u.s. companies operating there are just the middlemen. here are the details. since 2011, approximately 20 percent of puerto rico's total revenue collections have come from a temporary excise tax on certain products manufactured in puerto rico. . . now here's the financial magic. on march 30, 2011, the irs released notice 2011-2 ruling that this new excise tax was a foreign tax creditable against u.s. taxes. the notice stated that the new tax was novel and that determination of the creditability of the excise tax requires the resolution of a number of legal and factual issues. until these issues were resolved, the irs would not challenge taxpayers' claims that the tax was creditable. further, if the irs decided the credit was not creditable in the future, the new position would apply only prospectively.

new haven: some of the city's public school students will return to their physical classrooms later this month for the first time since last spring, according to the superintendent of schools. superintendent iline tracey announced on the district website thursday that officials are preparing for a limited return of students to a hybrid learning model starting jan. 19. the new haven district has been closed for in-person instruction except for some special-needs programs since the coronavirus pandemic forced schools across the country to shut down last march. officials in new haven chose to keep school buildings shuttered in september as other districts in connecticut offered either full-time or part-time in-person learning. a plan to reopen new haven's schools on nov. 9 was shelved amid rising covid-19 cases. tracey said schools will open jan. 19 to students in prekindergarten through fifth grade as well as students in special-education programs and programs for new immigrants at two of the district's schools. two schools, quinnipiac school and west rock school, will remain closed because city health officials determined that a lack of ventilation renders them unsafe during the pandemic, tracey said.

but even as protocols and systems vary depending on the hospital or the state, the exposure many chaplains have to covid-19 is very real. daniel russell, a fuller seminary graduate who works as a hospital and hospice chaplain in the los angeles area, regularly visits covid units. before each session, he stops at the black tape that marks the entrance to the covid hallway to don gloves, a gown and a papr — a futuristic white helmet that encases his entire face.

it's all very official in scalzi's world. tony went to school for this — he's a government employee, works with the insurance companies, does a lot of paperwork. but then one day a friend of his, another dispatcher who may or may not be involved in some shady side-gigs, goes missing, and we're off to the races. there's a police officer, lots of conversations at hot dog stands and greek diners, the questioning of a grieving spouse (with whom tony has a history), and some dealings with rich men and mobsters. like i said, hurfancy with a side of gumshoe. and that is amusing, at least for a bit.

obama picked ken salazar, an oil and gas ally, as his interior secretary, and balanced new federal support for renewable energy with boosts to fossil fuel drillers, promising an all of the above energy play. the approach relied on congress, both chambers of which democrats controlled when obama took office, to enact a new carbon pricing scheme that would gradually increase the cost of fossil fuels and incentivize a shift to solar, wind and energy efficiency. democrats' landmark cap-and-trade bill ― a conservative and incrementalist policy that aimed to set a cap on carbon emissions, then let companies trade pollution permits ― fizzled in 2010. going forward, the gop, seemingly hell-bent on obstructing anything obama proposed and financially encouraged by dark-money groups unleashed by the supreme court's 2010 citizens united ruling, adopted a full-fledged position of denying the reality of climate change itself.

they are able to evade and conceal their precise targets from defenses until just seconds before impact. this leaves targeted states with almost no time to respond…..hypersonic missiles require a reconsideration of traditional second-strike calculations, as they have the potential to decapitate a nation's leadership before it has the opportunity to launch a counter attack, speier writes.

raleigh: covid-19 hospitalizations and test positivity rates both are reaching record highs in the state. the news & observer of raleigh reports there were a record-high 3,576 people hospitalized with covid-19 over the weekend, according to data reported by 95% of the state's hospitals. two weeks ago, there were 2,783 people hospitalized with the virus. that's a difference of 793 people. on friday, the last day for which data is available, the state's health department says 13.6% of covid-19 tests came back positive. that brought the seven-day average of daily testing results to 14.2%, the highest rate since at least april. the average is seen as giving a better indication of covid-19 spread because it better accounts for daily spikes and valleys. every day since christmas has seen a double-digit positivity rate, including thursday's record-high 15.5%.
columbus: as gov. mike dewine applies pressure to get covid-19 vaccines administered faster throughout the state, those charged with inoculating people against the virus say a combination of factors has contributed to a slow rollout. vaccines arrived during the holidays, when more workers were off and less likely to be available to get the vaccine. in some cases, vaccine hesitancy has contributed to lower demand as well, they say. shipments also have been unpredictable, sometimes arriving later than expected or in smaller quantities than previous allotments, making it difficult to plan for distribution. protocols require a 15-minute observation window for each patient, limiting the number of people who can cycle through a chair each day. this is not your routine stop by the primary care office to get a flu shot. this is a whole different operation, said dr. andy thomas, chief clinical officer at ohio state university's wexner medical center. on wednesday, dewine said he had grown impatient with the rollout and challenged hospitals to administer the vaccine within 24 hours of receiving it, calling it a moral imperative to get the vaccine out as quickly as possible.

after seeing so much hype, i figured it has to be worth it. after all, twitter is never wrong. described as an east coast 'big little lies,' i figured the show would have twists and turns to keep me hooked for six episodes. so i spent a few days bingeing and watching seemingly unnecessary close-up shots of nicole kidman. almost all my knowledge revolved around talk of her coats on the show, from a velvety green number to a wine-colored robe ― sartorial experts were extremely excited about the outwear of their beloved protagonist.

in february 1997, a national opinion poll found that nearly seven out of 10 women feel political parties do not pay sufficient attention to issues of importance to women. these women would not answer to the description of feminist, but if feminism is the consciousness of women's oppression, they were not afraid to display it. even now, women may enter political institutions only after those institutions have formed them in the institutional mould; the more female politicians a parliament may boast, the less likely it is to address women's issues. prime minister blair has less trouble keeping his party under an unprecedented degree of central control because so many of the labour mps are inexperienced, young and female. a male labour mp called them the stepford wives with a chip inserted in their brain to keep them on message; the media call them blair's babes. few of the silly rituals of the house have been abolished, nor has the parliamentary timetable been modified. after a year in the rowdy bear-garden that is the british house of commons, and many weeks without seeing their families for more than a few minutes at a time, the new women mps were reporting levels of stress approaching the unbearable. changes in british legislation have been slow and tentative, commitment to the economic enfranchisement of women more apparent than real. a woman is now slightly more likely to find a job than a man, entirely because of the restructuring of the job market in the employer's favour.

vancouver: quartz mountain distillers was surprised last week by a $14,060 fine from the u.s. food and drug administration for producing hand sanitizer, but the company found out the next evening that the fee is not being enforced. owner randy kyle said the distillery began making hand sanitizer in april. the family owners gave almost all of it away to help local health care workers remain safe, the columbian reports. all distillers that made hand sanitizer during the covid-19 pandemic were facing the fine. the department of health & human services on thursday announced it was directing the fda not to enforce the fine after the fda received heavy backlash on social media. small businesses who stepped up to fight covid-19 should be applauded by their government not taxed for doing so, the department of health & human services said on twitter. kyle said he was unaware of any fine from the beginning of the pandemic. if the company were forced to pay it, he would have to closed down. i'd just have to lock the door and walk away, he said.

the crown actress olivia colman really wasn't prepared to win, and she admitted it flat out on stage. i've honestly gotten a little boozy, because i didn't think this was going to happen, she said to knowing laughter. her rambling speech was still adorable, with a shout-out for her other show, fleabag, which took the best comedy award earlier in the night. yay, 'fleabag'! yay, olivia!

this will feel very familiar to many investors who have seen all the blithe assumption about operating and maintenance costs on all kinds of technological green marvels fail to meet expectations. biowaste generators, biomass, thermal pellets – you name it, and the rosy assumptions failed to materialise because the difficulties in making them work and keeping them working were glossed over by the promoters. most of the smart money already knew that about renewables and is deeply sceptical. the not-so-smart money still laps the deals up. sadly, renewables is likely to become another charming but flawed investment thesis. i am no stranger to investment madness – three times i've invested in airships and lost my dosh every time.

stephen miller, donald trump's 33-year old senior policy adviser, is rumored to have written a good bit of the speech that the president delivered last night from the oval office. taken by itself, the speech and its horror-heavy rhetoric would suggest that the trump administration and miller take issue only with illegal immigration to the united states, the sort they believe authorities could stem with a physical barrier.
trump was accompanied here by treasury secretary steven mnuchin, white house economic adviser larry kudlow, and a delegation including national security adviser robert c. o'brien, trump's daughter ivanka trump and his son-in-law jared kushner. also present was adviser and speechwriter stephen miller, whose hard-line stance on limiting immigration and denunciations of globalism infused trump's address to the united nations in september.

carl icahn sells a $600 million chunk of his stake in herbalife. carl icahn at the dealbook conference in 2015. by reducing his stake in herbalife, the investor will also give up five board seats held by his designees. credit... karsten moran for the new york times the billionaire financier carl icahn has begun to cash out of his nearly decade-long bet on the nutritional food supplements company herbalife, an investment that survived both regulatory review and a prominent — though unsuccessful — challenge by another activist investor. herbalife said late on sunday that it would buy back about $600 million worth of stock held by mr. icahn, who has been the company's biggest shareholder since 2013. doing so would also mean that he will give up five board seats held by his designees. the move, which will reduce mr. icahn's stake to 6 percent from 13 percent, caps an investment success few could have foreseen in late 2012, when the billionaire first poured money into herbalife. at the time, mr. icahn pushed back against a campaign by william a. ackman, the manager of the hedge fund pershing square capital management, who had prominently accused the company of being an illegal pyramid scheme on the verge of being shut down. mr. ackman shorted herbalife shares, wagering that their price would fall to zero, eventually pouring $1 billion into his bet. herbalife denied the accusations, and mr. icahn became one of several hedge fund managers to bet against mr. ackman.

i can remember it like it was yesterday. it was a hot, thursday night and i was catching up on tmz, one of my favorite shows. i had class in the morning and knew i should have been getting ready for bed when the next segment caught my eye. the story was about maya henry, a girl younger than me from texas, who just had a $6 million dollar quincenera (a traditional mexican coming-of-age party for girls, similar to bat mitzvahs). hundreds of people showed up to the venue, which was custom built just for her party. there were cherry trees taller than anything i've ever seen before, floral decorations and arrangements everywhere, making the space look like a scene from the secret garden. the inside of the party was just as fabulous, with butterflies hanging from the ceiling, and more floral arrangements cascading the space like arches. she also got the chance to wear not one, but two beautiful gowns, which contributed to almost half a million dollars. both dresses exemplified elegance and grace, and honestly, it felt like something straight out of a princess fairytale from the 21st century. i was so fascinated by this girl and her life, and before i knew it, i had drifted into slumber, the voices in the background still telling maya's story.

there can be no gainsaying that women cannot manage their own lives if access to abortion is to be denied, but the need for abortion is itself the consequence of oppression. if we accept every instance of abortion as the outcome of unwanted and easily avoided pregnancy, we have to ask ourselves how it is that women are still exposing themselves to this risk. a woman who is unable to protect her cervix from exposure to male hyperfertility is certainly not calling the shots. the man is most likely to have initiated the episode of intercourse, to have chosen the place and the time; the woman is probably still dancing backwards. if the child is unwanted, whether by her or her partner or her parents, it will be her duty to undergo an invasive procedure and an emotional trauma, and so sort the situation out. the crowning insult is that this ordeal is represented to her as some kind of a privilege: her sad and onerous duty is garbed in the rhetoric of a civil right. she is confronted with other people who know better than she what she ought to do. she will be required to undergo investigations of her pregnancy for which there is no treatment but termination, whether she would countenance a termination or not. if she undergoes the tests, say for down's syndrome, and refuses the termination, she will be asked why she had the test in the first place. and she will probably be talked into the termination.

acid is the enemy of the alkaline diet. the thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. you may be thinking: what else is there to eat? the alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. these are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a ph value of 7, which is neutral, or above. foods with a ph value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go. that said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the ph values of your food will change the overall ph balance of your body. it will do that naturally. however, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.

mayeda: i think that they're kind of running through a menu of options. one of the options, as i mentioned, is to move your supply chain to a place like malaysia or vietnam. there's no question that that is happening. some companies are actually engaged in what's called tariff engineering. so if i have a certain good that is hit by tariffs, as it stands now, i could slightly change the way that the good is manufactured so it is actually not covered by tariffs. and there's no question, as the president is actually hoping for, that some companies are reshoring to the united states.

democrats have to focus our argument on the repeated corrupt and criminal activities that trump and his allies have been caught engaging in. the point isn't that he's violating norms; it's that he's violating laws. don't just lament the way that trump ignores the separation of powers by not having witnesses testify. make it clear that he's gagging witnesses and refusing to answer questions himself.

there is a limited supply of masks and while companies are increasing their production, demand is increasing at a very high rate, cautions pekosz. there will most likely be shortages of personal protective equipment at medical institutions and this may in part be driven by supplies being purchased by the general public. emergency preparedness efforts will address supply chains, but there really is no reason for the general public to purchase large numbers of n95 masks.
u.s. has leverage in trade talks, trump says. alan rappeport and jim tankersley at the new york times: trump is cheerleading his way past the economic warning signs that have rattled financial markets and unnerved economists, insisting that the united states has an advantage in a crucial first round of trade negotiations beginning on monday in beijing. it helps his case that the labor department published a jobs report for december that soared past expectations.

when i walked into the hospital room the first time, aunt sara--frail and bone-thin--was moaning in pain while her children and grandkids sat all around her and tried to make her comfortable. and i was immediately struck by how both ugly and intimate death seemed to be. her sallow face and bony chest and missing teeth. different hands taking turns holding onto her. the shrill, bird-like noises that came out of her as she asked repeatedly for something to drink, only to push it away whenever anyone brought one to her mouth. the not quite knowing what she wanted--thinking something would help only to realize that it didn't.

regardless, if the trump administration really understood the dynamics of iraq, it might have anticipated a move like the attack on the u.s. embassy. administration officials might have worked more closely with the iraq government to think through the best way forward. instead, in essence, trump walked into iran's trap.

there are more germs in her mouth and under her fingernails and in her hair than there are under the rim of the toilet, but the houseworker is not told this. her vocation is to rid the world of germs with the aid of a knight in shining armour, a genie in a bottle, a white tornado. this is housework as heroic exploit. the houseworker can only know that she has done her duty when she has squirted bleach-based agents into every nook and cranny of her house, even down the drains. houses no longer smell of cooking; they smell of cleaning. yet kitchens are not operating theatres and antisepsis in kitchens is as undesirable as it is impossible, because it can only be achieved by huge overuse of powerful chemicals. millennial food preparation takes less time than the old methods; the time spent getting food on and off the table has shrunk by a third, but it must not be thought the houseworker has more leisure time as a result. housework expands to fill the time available. time not spent doing one task will be taken up by another. washing used to be done on a single day of the week, usually monday. when washing machines became cheap enough to be owned by the majority, washing came gradually to be done on any day of the week, and then on every day of the week. laundry is nowadays done several times a day.

albuquerque: more than 6,500 businesses and nonprofits will receive up to $50,000 under a state program created to help companies cope with economic fallout from the pandemic. that's about half of the companies that applied, the albuquerque journal reports. the number (of applications) that we couldn't fund was very hard for us, said marquita russel, ceo of the new mexico finance authority, the state agency that administered the program. the state implemented the program to help businesses as part of a bigger $320 million coronavirus relief package passed by new mexico lawmakers. the program uses $100 million in federal coronavirus relief funds allocated to the state. about $40 million of that sum was allocated for businesses located outside the state's four largest cities. russel said while her agency had expected to receive roughly 10,000 applications, it received more than 14,000. in all, 6,530 applications were funded. russel said the agency prioritized businesses that experienced the most significant losses as a result of the pandemic.

-- one facebook page tied to the disinformation campaign impersonated baptist prohibitionists who allegedly supported republican roy moore's candidacy. the new york times's scott shane and alan blinder report: the 'dry alabama' facebook page, illustrated with stark images of car wrecks and videos of families ruined by drink, had a blunt message: alcohol is the devil's work, and the state should ban it entirely. along with a companion twitter feed, the facebook page appeared to be the work of baptist teetotalers who supported [moore]. 'pray for roy moore,' one tweet exhorted. in fact, the dry alabama campaign, not previously reported, was the stealth creation of progressive democrats who were out to defeat mr. moore — the second such secret effort to be unmasked.

stocks on wall street sink in their steepest decline since october. wall street began the year with a tumble on monday, with the s&p 500 suffering its steepest decline in more than two months as it retreated from record territory. analysts traced the sell-off to a number of factors, including political jitters stemming from tuesday's runoff election in georgia — which will determine control of the u.s. senate — concerns about a resurgent coronavirus, and the simple need for investors to take a breather after a stretch of sizzling gains. it wasn't clear that the slump would continue into tuesday. stocks in asian markets were steady early on tuesday, while futures markets suggested that wall street would stabilize when it opens. the index fell 1.5 percent, its sharpest drop since late october. stocks that have been most sensitive to investor sentiment about the coronavirus pandemic led the decline. shares of royal caribbean cruises, wynn resorts, marriott international and carnival were all down by 5 percent or more.

but that latter argument ignores history, as well as the geographic suppleness of global extremist movements in general. few saw the isis caliphate coming in iraq and syria before 2014 but then, all of a sudden, it was there. and the former argument shows a poor appreciation of how counterterrorism intelligence is developed — usually by cooperation with partners on the ground — as well as an unrealistic appreciation for the geographic remoteness or ruggedness of the hindu kush. standoff counterterrorism is generally an oxymoron.

as the obama and trump presidencies prove, it could likely be a rocky road. absent new legislation, the white house must creatively interpret its legal mandate to enact rules under existing statutes, leaving them open to challenge. republican state attorneys general sued the obama administration so routinely that the top cop in texas joked: i go into the office in the morning. i sue barack obama, and then i go home. gop-led states persuaded the supreme court to block obama's signature power plant regulation in 2016, and that was before trump added three right-wing justices to the bench and stacked lower federal courts with conservatives. red states are already vowing to pursue that same strategy.

scenario no. 4 — if the two sides can't agree on a long-term deal by feb. 15, the redskins limit cousins's ability to go elsewhere by using the nfl's non-exclusive franchise tag during the permissible window, feb. 15 to march 1. under the non-exclusive tag, which guarantees a salary that's slightly less than the exclusive tag, cousins can negotiate with other teams and sign an offer from another team. but the redskins have the right to match that other team's offer.

cash transfers have also been gaining momentum as a mechanism to reduce poverty. the idea is that recipients know best how to spend the money — whether on meals, school fees, health care or whatever else they need most — to lift themselves out of poverty or keep themselves from falling into it. india, kenya, finland and other countries have also been exploring the idea of providing cash stipends for all citizens (or a universal basic income) as a social safety net to reduce inequality. the stipends are usually not enough to live on, but a couple of hundred dollars a month, while pocket change for a millionaire, could mean never missing rent for someone living paycheck to paycheck.

though vasectomy is available, it is culturally invisible. men don't get pregnant, therefore men don't bother about contraception. men do get sexually transmitted diseases so they do use condoms, sometimes, but nowhere near as often as they should. these days, contraception is abortion, because the third-generation pills cannot be shown to prevent sperm fertilising an ovum. yet no one feels so strongly against abortion at any stage that they picket the factories where birth control pills are produced. iuds are clearly abortifacient: these devices work by creating inflammation of the uterus, often accompanied by infection. women who accept them as contraceptive devices are actually being equipped with a do-it-yourself abortionist's tool. the outcome is frequent occult abortion, heavy bleeding and pelvic inflammatory disease, with the accompanying elevated risk of ectopic pregnancy. whether you feel that the creation and wastage of so many embryos is an important issue or not, you must see that the cynical deception of millions of women by selling abortifacients as if they were contraceptives is incompatible with the respect due to women as human beings. you must also see that expecting women to be grateful for the opportunity to have inserted into their bodies instruments for sucking and scraping out the products of avoidable conception shows them as much contempt. fake contraceptive technology manipulates women in ways that we are coming to condemn when they are practised on members of other species. what women don't know does hurt them.

the bill doesn't specifically counter the withdrawal – a surprise move that alarmed foreign policy hawks like republican sen. lindsey graham of south carolina but also more mainstream rank-and-file members from each party — but does include new sanctions against the syrian government that will open the door to debate about the sudden change in us policy and its impact.

stamford: the town has voted to overturn in its community gov. phil scott's emergency orders issued with the intention of protecting the state during the covid-19 pandemic. the select board of the town of about 800 people along the massachusetts border voted 3-2 tuesday to terminate the governor's restrictions. the three board members in favor of the idea cite a section of vermont law that they believe allows them to reject the governor's order. select board member daniel potvin said during the meeting that quarantine requirements, restrictions on large family or public gatherings, and face mask requirements violate the constitution in part because they were imposed without normal due process of law. he asserted it was important to stand up against such measures because it could lead to more loss of personal freedoms later on. scott hasn't enforced the orders heavy-handedly, he said, but that could change. potvin said friday the town is expecting some type of legal action from the state of vermont, but until it's cleared up, the governor's orders are still in effect.

it's entirely possible to create a compelling crime show featuring standout coats without actually having to discuss said coats. twitter didn't go apeshit over the outerwear sported by alia shawkat, john early or meredith hagner, but it should have. the series takes place over various seasons but each coat perfectly encapsulates each ridiculous and over-the-top character without talking it to death.

the movie suggests almost no one has the appropriate level of self-esteem. i feel pretty can be criticized as too rosy on the grounds that the power of positive thinking can only get us so far. indeed, it can even reinforce the repressive social norms it claims to challenge. but renee's positive thinking has such a dizzy, life-affirming charge that she makes you believe if she's not quote, pretty, it's because the definition of pretty is inadequate. it needs to be elasticized or maybe blown to smithereens.

as my mother and nana tell it, the first word i ever read was macy's. i was just shy of 2 and read it off of someone's shopping bag at a mall in new jersey, where we spent most winter saturdays in my childhood. my grandma on my dad's side operated a clothing store out of her home in brooklyn for years. my parents were set up by those two grandmothers after they kept bumping into each other at ― you guessed it ― the wholesale clothing store they both shopped in seasonally. one grandma was shopping for her store, the other was shopping (likely just as abundantly) for herself.
another statute allows the pentagon to apply the resources of the department of the army's civil works program, and to reprogram those resources to construct or assist in the construction, operation, maintenance, and repair of authorized civil works, military construction, and civil defense projects that are essential to the national defense. despite its name, the army corps of engineers is made up almost entirely of civilians who administer construction contracts, so troops wouldn't actually be building the wall.

over the decades, various remedies to address discrimination have been met with legal challenges. supreme court rulings have established that race-based policies are constitutional only if they achieve a compelling governmental interest and are narrowly tailored to do so. the court has most notably allowed race to be used as a factor in college admissions to achieve student diversity. but the court in recent decades has also sided against one of the original rationales for affirmative action policies — to undo past discrimination and its lingering effect.

the workers who will accept a zero-hours contract, which means that they are only called upon if business is brisk and then paid an hourly rate, who will carry pagers and mobile phones and be at the employer's beck and call 24 hours a day, who take work home every night, who have no job protection or guarantee of safe and hygienic conditions or insurance against work-related injury, are women. prestige and power have seeped out of professions as women joined them. teaching is already rock-bottom; medicine is sliding fast. though they are close to parity in numbers, the total earned by british women is only 60 percent of what men earn; their pay hour by hour is 79 pence for every pound earned by a man. the differential between women's pay and men's pay has now been enshrined. a woman who brings a case before an employment tribunal will wait for years before a decision will be reached; a decision in a single case is simply that. british equal pay legislation is legislation meant to be ineffective, designed to be ineffective. women are discriminated against by building societies, who treat maternity leave as long-term sick leave and will not lend to couples with both partners in work if the woman is pregnant. women pay 50 percent more for medical insurance. women are the stomping ground of medical technology, routinely monitored, screened and tortured, to no purpose except the enactment of control.

just how effective are the vaccines they're smuggling into the country in their small refrigerated lunch boxes is unclear. neither of the vaccines prevents cancer; rather, they are a kind of immunotherapy that prompts the body's immune system to battle the disease in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. in january, the roswell park comprehensive cancer center in buffalo, n.y., launched a clinical trial of cimavax with cuba's center of molecular immunology, which developed the vaccine. it is the first such joint venture between the two countries since the cuban revolution.

good morning, and welcome to face the nation. as we begin the new year, optimism over the prospect of vaccinations is facing the reality of delays, confusion, lack of communication, and, once more, a federal government seemingly without a coherent plan for making the millions of doses already manufactured accessible to americans. overwhelmed states, many struggling with this latest surge, have been left in charge of getting the vaccine to americans, and they're having a hard time doing so. meanwhile, the death toll continues to climb. more than three hundred and fifty thousand people have now died of covid-19 in the u.s. california is the new epicenter of this latest outbreak. cbs news correspondent carter evans reports from los angeles.

you've learned the value of having realistic expectations about a spouse. your partner is not going to change. in other words, you can't change a cat into a dog. love just isn't enough to significantly alter a person's basic nature and upbringing. for instance, if you fall in love with someone who is reserved and you need outward signs of affection to feel secure, you'll feel chronically dissatisfied. most likely, these differences will probably erode loving feelings over time and diminish positive interactions in your relationship.

h-1b applicants who get requests for evidence are actually the luckier bunch among all visa applicants. a new policy directive issued by uscis last summer permits the agency to summarily deny visa applications for immigrant visas, for green cards and for adjustments of status without first issuing a request for evidence or a notice to appear as they used to. instead, the agency can, at their discretion, deny the visa and immediately label the applicant illegal and deportable, without giving them an option to depart voluntarily. the real consequence of the policy change is to make many more people ineligible for re-entry into the united states, because they have been deemed deportable. in cases of immigrant visas, applicants appearing for green card interviews have been rejected and then immediately detained because, under this new policy directive, they had been declared illegal.

destroying or disabling work, student, immigrant, asylee and refugee programs is apparently not enough to sate the nativist sentiment that undergirds this miller-led transformation of the us immigration system. early in 2018, the trump administration set about dividing real native-born citizens from naturalized citizens, inaugurating the denaturalization task force, whose operation janus and operation second look are pursuing denaturalization proceedings and screening old naturalization applications for fraud. no public guidelines exist for whom they may investigate or for how long. furthermore, naturalized citizens, along with all other visa holders, are being monitored by the government through their social media accounts, and the information is being stored in files known as a-files that are kept and maintained by uscis. a naturalized citizen, it seems, in the trump administration's view, is not entitled to the fourth and fifth amendment protections the constitution provides against just such surveillance.

and i brought that to the bourne movies, too, by the way. you know, i think one of the reasons why young people particularly liked the bourne movies is because it was one of the first kind of movies that brought that kind - those kinds of images into the mainstream because that's what kids were used to. they were using - beginning to use their mobile phones and have all sorts of rough and raw and ready verite images, and that was their language. and bourne, i think, just brought that language into the mainstream of hollywood cinema. now it's much more normal to see it.

drone evolution may be the hidden key to all of this in several respects. certainly the navy's mq-25 will not be the only carrier-launched drone to emerge, as others will likely follow, and how about the idea of large unmanned carrier-like platforms launching unmanned strike assets? all while command and control operations are performed by human sailors at safer standoff ranges? that would certainly change the equation when it comes to operating in high-risk areas more vulnerable to enemy fire. as part of this equation, it would seem important to point out that the navy is already well on the way to engineering new large unmanned ships such as the medium and large unmanned surface vessel programs. large drone boats could perform anti-submarine warfare, conduct reconnaissance operations and even coordinate strikes for aircraft from strategically vital vantage points enabling maritime forces to project power from wherever needed.

the question regarding the future has been studied extensively in recent years through a number of formal navy studies, and many weapons developers continue to ponder a range of potential contingencies. some of these include greater use of f-35b armed amphibious assault ships for carrier-like power projection missions. certainly, having 5th gen attack capability extends the tactical and operational envelope for amphibs, and newer amphibs are being engineered with new abilities to command and control large fleets of surface, air and even undersea drones. would amphibs be less vulnerable targets sufficiently capable of sustaining a high-op tempo sortie rate for maritime attack?

salt lake city: less than a quarter of the 127,375 doses of covid-19 vaccine reportedly received in the state have been used to vaccinate health care providers and long-term care facility residents and staff as of the end of the year, deseret news reports. the initial rollout of the vaccine has been slow, slower than anticipated, slower than we wanted, said rich lakin, immunization program director with the utah department of health. we hope to be at a much faster pace in the next 15 days. utah is already starting to speed up the process, health department spokesperson tom hudachko said thursday. more than 6,000 doses were reportedly administered in the state thursday, double the daily increases earlier in the week. what's making the difference, hudachko said, is that local health departments, including tribal clinics, and long-term care facilities are able to give doses much faster than hospitals. in davis county, a mass drive-thru clinic at the legacy events center is able to vaccinate 28 health care workers at a time with appointments, he said. at long-term care facilities, cvs and walgreens and other contractors are quickly inoculating both residents and staff.

link copied link e.u. foreign ministers to hold emergency meeting friday to respond to iran crisis brussels — european union foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting on friday in brussels to discuss how to respond to the escalating crisis with iran, diplomats said monday, including whether europe starts the process that could lead to the eventual reimposition of sanctions on iran. the unusual gathering will give europeans a chance to coordinate plans among all 28 member states. leaders have been reluctant to publicly condemn the united states for soleimani's killing, focusing most of their ire on iran, which they view as the core threat to their security interests. but they have invested more than a year of efforts to try to preserve the 2015 iran nuclear deal following trump's pullout. many european diplomats view soleimani's death as the final blow to hopes that the accord could hold together until the possible election in november of a u.s. president more supportive of the nuclear agreement than trump. iran on sunday announced that it would take major additional steps to depart from the terms of the nuclear accord, although it stopped short of saying it would significantly increase its uranium enrichment. europeans took that as a sign that tehran is still interested in extracting concessions in exchange for returning to at least partial adherence to the deal, rather than walking away from it altogether. triggering the process that could lead to the reimposition of sanctions would entail additional months of negotiations.

peugeot and fiat chrysler to merge, creating the fourth-largest carmaker. a psa assembly line in slovakia last year. the merger with fiat chrysler automobiles is intended to help both companies make the transition to electric vehicles. credit... radovan stoklasa/reuters shareholders of fiat chrysler automobiles and psa, the french maker of peugeot, citroën and opel cars, voted on monday to merge as the companies try to survive a transition to electric vehicles. the new company, called stellantis, would be the world's fourth-largest carmaker based on vehicle sales during the first nine months of 2020 and would employ 400,000 people. executives of fiat chrysler and psa agreed to merge at the end of 2019 and have been working out the details and securing regulatory approval since then. but the new company faces major challenges. neither fiat chrysler nor psa has a strong presence in china, the world's largest car market, and they have been slow to introduce electric vehicles. both companies have been hard hit by the pandemic. psa's vehicle sales were down 30 percent in the 11 months through november, while fiat chrysler sold 30 percent fewer cars and trucks in the nine months through september, the most recent reporting period. the pandemic has made the rationale for the merger even more compelling, mr. elkann said. jack ewing and

greer in abortion feminism is supposed to be pro-abortion. there are some who fancy that feminists used to march shouting, what do we want? abortion! when do we want it? we want it now! those same people think that, for once, marching and shouting were effective. reluctant authorities gave in to the women's screaming, and allowed a tide of feticide to sweep the world. this is not what happened. in the united states, the crucial factor was a decision in the supreme court in the case of roe v. wade, which upheld the principle that, as the law had no part to play in what passed between a woman and her doctor, intervention by the state to prevent an abortion was a breach of the patient's privacy. jane roe or norma mccorvey, a sometime carnival barker and druggie who was pregnant for the third time, was the stooge selected by a young texas lawyer. she has subsequently been born again and now repudiates her part in the decision that legalised abortion in the u.s. the decision in roe v. wade did nothing to confront, let alone resolve, the deep moral conflicts surrounding the issue of abortion. pregnancy is unlike other patient-doctor relations in that there are two other individuals involved—the father-to-be and the child-to-be. every time a fetus is recognised as a party to other litigation, the safety of the decision in the case of roe v. wade is called into question.

dallas: coronavirus hospitalizations fell slightly saturday but remained near their record high, as health officials said there were about 600 intensive care beds available across the state of nearly 29 million people. texas reported 12,319 covid-19 patients in hospitals saturday, ending five consecutive days of record-breaking hospitalizations. but even with the decrease of more than 160 patients from friday, the virus continued to strain medical resources. intensive care units in several parts of texas were full or nearly full, with 626 icu beds available statewide saturday, according to the texas department of state health services. the department reported 96 new fatalities, as well as 3,995 newly confirmed cases of covid-19 and 487 probable cases. the actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven't been tested, and some who get sick don't show symptoms. over the prior seven days, nearly 1 in 5 coronavirus tests in texas came back positive, according to data from johns hopkins university.

columbia: nearly 700 nonprofits are receiving state grants totaling $25 million to help offset costs during the coronavirus pandemic. the state department of administration announced wednesday that 686 nonprofits would receive grants ranging from $2,500 to $50,000. among the groups that got the money are arts organizations, churches and food banks. the grants can be used to cover expenses such as staffing and operating costs as well as personal protective equipment and revenue loss. the state had to turn down another several million dollars' worth of requests, as a total of 1,590 nonprofits applied for $76 million in aid. the volume of requests led to a two-week delay in notifying winners. that delay had put more stress on businesses already strained by the pandemic, frank knapp, president of the state's small business chamber of commerce, told the post and courier. the monies were allocated by the legislature in september to spend federal covid-19 aid for south carolina. the state is also issuing $40 million to small businesses affected by the pandemic.

trenton: more than 70% of the state's supply of covid-19 vaccine had not been used as of thursday, echoing a national trend of slow distribution, according to data released by state officials. of the 265,000 doses of the pfizer and moderna vaccines that have been delivered to new jersey, 72,657 residents had been given a shot by thursday afternoon. despite months of planning, state officials said wednesday that a lack of personnel, along with logistics and timing issues, was to blame. remember, you need health care workers to do this, gov. phil murphy said at a briefing. i'm not qualified to deliver these vaccines. the slow rollout has been frustrating to a public eager to end a pandemic that has infected at least 477,000 new jerseyans, killed more than 19,000 and caused vast economic hardship. state health commissioner judy persichilli said the rollout of the moderna vaccine in particular has been slow because it was delivered just before christmas. persichilli said 57% of the state's stockpile of pfizer doses had been administered as of wednesday, calling it one of the highest percentages that i've seen nationally.

little rock: coronavirus hospitalizations in arkansas have again set a new record high, as the pandemic strains medical resources across the state. there were 1,216 people in arkansas hospitals with confirmed cases of covid-19 on saturday, state health officials reported, an increase of 31 from the day before. arkansas has repeatedly broken previous records for hospitalizations and case counts over the past week, as the virus surges following holiday gatherings and travel. the arkansas department of health also reported 1,597 new confirmed cases of covid-19, 403 more probable cases and another 18 deaths. those case counts are down from friday's record high, but gov. asa hutchinson warned that the numbers were deflated by a drop in testing on new year's day. the actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven't been tested, and some who get sick don't show symptoms.

congress can cancel a national emergency, but it would require a rare amount of bipartisanship. congress would have to approve a joint resolution disapproving the national emergency, which would easily pass the democratic-controlled house but could face opposition in the republican-majority senate. if both houses pass the joint resolution, it would require the president's signature, and mr. trump would be unlikely to sign a bill which overturns his own declaration.

anchorage: health officials said the state plans on receiving almost 53,000 doses of coronavirus vaccines this month from drug companies pfizer and moderna. that figure is about 7,000 fewer vaccines than the state received in december. thus far, only front-line health care workers in hospitals, residents and employees at long-term care facilities, emergency personnel, community health aides and people conducting vaccinations have been eligible to be inoculated in alaska. starting monday, another tier of people will begin receiving vaccines. that group includes people working in health care who are at the highest risk of contracting the virus, are considered essential to the health care system, and do regular work that can't be done remotely or postponed. almost 50 alaska residents spoke at a public hearing last monday to advocate for their demographic to be included in the next vaccination group. that group included teachers, older adults and seafood industry workers, the daily news reports. alaska has so far vaccinated over 13,000 people, according to a state tracker last updated last monday.

when an commercial succeeds, it can both charm viewers and change the way consumers think of a brand. witness apple's 1984 commercial, which broadcast the message that the computer company was breaking away from colorless rivals. but for every 1984, there's at least one advertiser that wants to succeed on a similar scale but falls far short. sometimes, those ads make viewers cringe, spark boycotts or calls for the commercial to be yanked.

baton rouge: with the announcement that the state soon will allow people ages 70 and older to get the coronavirus vaccine, residents clamoring for the immunizations have hurried to pharmacies trying to receive a shot, even though those vaccinations don't begin until monday and require a scheduled appointment. the louisiana department of health said friday that it has received multiple reports of people who meet the new, expanded criteria showing up at pharmacies, overwhelming their phone lines and even calling some hospitals trying to get vaccinated days before doses are available. health department spokeswoman aly neel stressed that only a limited supply of 10,000 moderna vaccine doses will be available this week for those newly eligible, that only certain pharmacies will be administering those doses, and that appointments are required to receive the shot, or the person will be turned away. still, news of wider availability was drawing intense interest, which neel described as a promising sign. with thousands of first doses of the two-dose vaccines administered to the first-prioritized groups, gov. john bel edwards announced thursday that he is expanding the list to include anyone 70 and older, people with kidney failure and additional health care workers.

no cream, whether made of placenta or the brains of aborted fetuses or ground glass, will break down cellulite. your cellulite is you, and will be with you till death or liposuction, which is expensive and extremely painful and sometimes more disfiguring than the dimply fat itself. as fat distribution is hormonally regulated, the fat will probably build up again gradually after liposuction. as cellulite will neither kill you nor go away, it is a goldmine for doctors, nutritionists, naturopaths, aromatherapists, fitness experts and lifestyle managers. the manufacturers of creams, exercise equipment, skin brushes and dietary supplements all make a bundle out of women's carefully cultivated disgust with their own bodies, scarfed about as they are by unsightly fat cells. criminalising cellulite is just another way of demonising fat, any fat, anywhere. as a way of inducing them to buy products of no use or value, women have been deliberately infected with bdd. conditions that practically all women suffer from are spoken of as unsightly and abnormal, to make women feel that parts of their bodies, perhaps their whole bodies, are defective and should be worked on, even surgically altered. most women think that their hair is not good enough and dye it or bleach it or perm it. most women feel that their legs are not long enough, that their thighs are too heavy or not firm enough. most women are unhappy about their bottoms, which are either too flat, too low-slung, too fat or too broad.

'i've just got to get today done.' warren's hard-edged brand of progressive politics has annoyed some of her colleagues at times, but the lack of support from her caucus isn't personal. with a wide open democratic primary, including perhaps a half-dozen of warren's own colleagues set to join the race, there's no sense in getting out ahead of anyone, according to a dozen democratic senators from across the ideological spectrum.

now that the house oversight committee is run by democrats, cohen has every incentive to shift the blame for this potentially embarrassing deal to president trump. he probably has little fear that democrats would want to see him prosecuted for misrepresenting what happened – as long as it advances their narrative that donald trump is guilty of something.

greengrass: the newsreaders, really, have a gospel route. in my country, they would have been the methodist preachers, the nonconformist preachers who weren't allowed to preach in the churches but went out into the town squares and brought the good news. and of course, that - later after the american revolution, they were a feature of american life, too. and of course, what starts as bringing the good news becomes bringing the news, you know. and they would leaven their gospel stories with local news, and so it became, steadily, the news.

fort yates: the standing rock sioux tribe is prioritizing the distribution of covid-19 vaccines to those who speak dakota and lakota languages. standing rock tribal chairman mike faith told kxmb-tv the policy is aimed at keeping customs alive. it's something we have to pass on to our loved ones – our history, our culture, our language. we don't have it in black and white; we tell stories. that's why it's so important, faith said. the standing rock reservation straddles the north dakota and south dakota border and is home to about 8,000 people, more than half of whom live in north dakota. faith said only about 300 people on the reservation are fluent in the language. front-line health care workers already have begun receiving the vaccine at the fort yates hospital, but starting this week, priority will be for those who speak their native language. in addition to those who can carry on the culture, the next phase includes elders, law enforcement, tribal courts and the school system, tribal officials said. tribal health director margaret gates said the lakota and dakota speakers are the most important asset to our tribe and people because of the language.

senate finance chairman orrin hatch, r-utah, is also expected to send a letter to the president this week asking him to reconsider his position. hatch opposes new tariffs because he believes they will undermine any economic boost delivered by the gop's tax cuts. should the administration opt to move forward with tariffs on steel and aluminum, american manufacturers, businesses, and consumers would be forced to bear the brunt paying more for steel and steel products. such action could very well undercut the benefits of the pro-growth tax reform we fought to get on the books, hatch said in a weekend statement.

francis noted that the pharisees weren't really looking for jesus' opinion on the mosaic teaching but rather were trying to ensnare him in a catch-22 situation. either jesus contradicts the law of moses by recommending leniency, thus alienating himself from his jewish followers, or he takes a hardline stance and recommends the stoning of the woman, thus betraying his own call to gentleness and mercy.

it's likely that most callers are actually polite. if a few people contacting superdelegates are being obscene they'll of course drown out reasonable voices and harden opinions. however, it's useful to look at what's causing some of the anger and outrage we're seeing. voters know they are being disenfranchised by superdelegate influence and these privileged voters are a reasonable target for frustration. and, let's be honest, if superdelegates aren't prepared to deal with the public, they shouldn't be party officials.

her agony of mind is increased by the regular publication of results of research to establish whether and when human fetuses become aware, feel pain, can learn. in march 1998, we learned that fetuses are alert and can learn at 20 weeks gestation, before the formation of a cerebral cortex. the evidence was unconvincing, in that reaction was being construed as consciousness, but it had the desired effect—which was to worry women. feminists have argued that delaying abortion is immoral, but all measures to put in place speedy and non-traumatic abortion procedures, which would be embryologically identical with what passes for contraception, have been blocked by the same authorities who regularly produce evidence about the developing sensibilities of the fetus. a woman who is granted an abortion does not get to choose between abortions: abortion is presented to her as a single entity, when there is a bewildering array of options. non-surgical, do-it-yourself abortion has been possible for 20 years or more, but the health establishment rations and controls access to it. in the united states, the so-called morning-after pill is unavailable. in britain, it is not usually made available until the client has endured a sermon on reliable contraception. (one of the best-kept secrets in gynecology is the use of methotrexate and other cytotoxics for non-surgical abortion.)

it is best understood as a theocratic coup, and not an unsuccessful one because it permanently altered the relationship between saudi arabia's royal family, secular bureaucracy, and hardline islamist clergy. the government did much to curry favor with the wahhabi extremists to prevent anything like the grand mosque attack from happening again. the most pessimistic interpretation of the aftermath is that fundamentalists effectively blackmailed the wealthy saudi government into bankrolling extremism and terrorism. the siege made the government look weak, dishonest, and decadent to many saudis.

the point is that charitable organizations need money all year round, not just at the end of the year. for 2017, consider giving to charity steadily throughout the year. for example, if you donate to your local animal shelter like i do, consider handing them a donation check in, say, may. of course, they'll appreciate your donations whenever they come, but it could be an especially welcome gift if it comes at a time of limited cash flow.

which is what thompson and lowry and george and beal will be trying to do on saturday night, along with four others: devin booker, eric gordon, wayne ellington and tobias harris. the dunk contest, meanwhile, now relies on lesser-known, and often younger, players because of the longstanding reluctance of stars to participate. only one all-star, victor oladipo of the indiana pacers, is participating in the contest this year. derrick jones jr., who came in second in last year's dunk contest, had played in only seven n.b.a. games when he competed in 2017. and the 2017 winner, glenn robinson iii, was the 40th pick in the 2014 draft.

as stancati notes, even young women eager for reform in saudi arabia today grew up being taught that drawing pictures of animals was an insult to allah's sacred and unique ability to create life, or that listening to music for pleasure would get them tortured for all eternity in the afterlife by having hot metal poured in their ears. top saudi clerics criticized the government for giving women the right to drive by saying it would give them easy access to worldly temptation, and as we know, women are weak and easily tempted.

soleimani was in the middle east, in iraq, and traveling around the middle east. he had just come from damascus, where he was planning attacks on american soldiers, airmen, marines, sailors, and against our diplomats. so this strike was aimed at disrupting ongoing attacks that were being planned by soleimani, and deterring future iranian attacks, through their proxies or through the irgc quds force directly, against americans. as president trump said today, this action was taken to stop a war, not to start a war, he said.

… in recent years, americans — silicon valley leaders included — have put too much faith in the private sector to ensure u.s. global leadership in new technology. now we are in a technology competition with china that has profound ramifications for our economy and defense — a reality i have come to appreciate as chairman of two government panels on innovation and national security. the government needs to get back in the game in a serious way. important trends are not in our favor. america's lead in artificial intelligence, for example, is precarious. a.i. will open new frontiers in everything from biotechnology to banking, and it is also a defense department priority. leading the world in a.i. is essential to growing our economy and protecting our security. a recent study considering more than 100 metrics finds that the united states is well ahead of china today but will fall behind in five to 10 years. china also has almost twice as many supercomputers and about 15 times as many deployed 5g base stations as the united states. if current trends continue, china's overall investments in research and development are expected to surpass those of the united states within 10 years, around the same time its economy is projected to become larger than ours.

this sequel to the female eunuch is the book i said i would never write. i believed that each generation should produce its own statement of problems and priorities, and that i had no special authority or vocation to speak on behalf of women of any but my own age, class, background and education. for 30 years, i have done my best to champion all the styles of feminism that came to public attention. though i disagreed with some of the strategies and was troubled by some of the more fundamental conflicts, it was not until feminists of my own generation began to assert with apparent seriousness that feminism had gone too far that the fire flared up in my belly. when the lifestyle feminists chimed in that feminism had gone just far enough in giving them the right to have it all—i.e., money, sex and fashion—it would have been inexcusable to remain silent. in 1970, the movement was called women's liberation or, contemptuously, women's lib. when the name libbers was dropped for feminists, we were all relieved. what none of us noticed was that the ideal of liberation was fading out with the word. we were settling for equality. liberation struggles are not about assimilation, but about asserting difference, endowing that difference with dignity and prestige, and insisting on it as a condition of self-definition and self-determination.

the philosophy of this diet is in the name. the paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our paleolithic ancestors. in case you need to brush up on your high school science, the paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago. basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. and, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the paleolithic era, paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. those who follow the paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to stone age-approved meals.

'spongebob squarepants' moves from pineapple under the sea to hulu live. nickelodeon, home to spongebob squarepants, is among 14 cable networks that will join hulu live tv. credit... nickelodeon thanks to a new agreement between viacomcbs and hulu, the streaming platform controlled by the walt disney company, there will soon be another way to watch nickelodeon's spongebob squarepants and mtv's ridiculousness. when cbs reunited with the cable and film giant viacom at the end of 2019, after a decade apart, executives who swung the deal promised that the combined company would become a bigger player in digital media. viacomcbs took another step toward that goal on monday with the announcement that it had struck a deal to add 14 cable networks to hulu live tv. the 14 networks — a group that includes comedy central, mtv, nickelodeon, bet her, teennick and nicktoons — will join hulu live alongside corporate siblings like pop tv and the cw, which were already available on the service under a previous arrangement between cbs and hulu. when it comes to streaming, viacomcbs has mainly focused on supplying films and tv series to other companies. that strategy is expected to shift slightly this year, when the company will introduce paramount+, a platform named after the company's struggling movie studio.

what did i think when i watched it? the last film i made was 22 july about anders breivik, who's a right-wing terrorist in norway who attacked the government and the young labour group as well. you know, it was an attempt to decapitate the state. the reason i made that film was because breivik, anders breivik, is a very important figure in the growth of the far-right, both in america and in the u.k. and across europe, because he's seen as a standard-bearer. if you look at charlottesville, all that trouble, a lot of the language that was being used by the white supremacists was breivik's words from breivik's manifesto - same in some of the other right-wing attacks across europe. you know, he's a profoundly important figure.
he was going to come onto the movie after christmas break and i get a call over the holidays. he's like, i broke my arm. i'm like, what? and so there was some shuffling around and then everyone panicking for a second, and then i came up with this idea that we make it part of his character. so the cast in the movie does play a story point. ... and it becomes part of his spy craft at the end of the day, which is fun. you know, the things that happen in production that you just have to react to. the show must go on, as they say.
hanna-attisha: absolutely. so, you know, so many people ask me, like, who do you want in jail or who should go to jail? and there's not one villain. there's not 10 villains. there's many villains. and this is what i say in my book. i say there are lots of villains in this story. a disaster of this scale does not happen completely by accident. many people stopped caring about flint and flint's kids. many people looked the other way. people in power made tragic and terrible choices, then collectively and ineptly tried to cover up their mistakes. while charges have been brought against some of the individuals who are culpable, the real villains are harder to see because the real villains live underneath the behavior and drive it. the real villains are the ongoing effects of racism, inequality, greed, anti-intellectualism and even laissez faire neoliberal capitalism. and these are the villains that we don't usually notice and don't want to, and these are the villains that poison flint with policy. and i hope one day we can go after these systemic villains and bring forth justice.

in social media, trends change rapidly. last week's snapchat could be this week's yik yak. what is consistent is the shift toward personal, private communications through larger social channels. for instance, members of generation z -- the group younger than millennials, born in 1996 or later -- have gravitated away from the very public forums presented by social networks like facebook and twitter and toward messaging apps that are immediate, visual, impermanent, and most crucially private. it is a more intimate take on the kind of social media interaction that exploded in popularity over the past decade.

there was a section of the movie we really wanted to ground in some sort of reality where the consequences felt real. and i guess in terms of having someone her [theron's] size fight a 6-foot-4, 230-pound russian, you know, there are techniques that you would use that obviously you don't always see in movies, but elbows and knees, you know, body weight throws, leverage techniques. you know, punching with your fists is not optimal when the guy's head is made of granite. so it's better to use weapons of your body that are more resilient and that have a stronger force.

at best, the fact that any member of congress is fuming about the inconvenience of a metal detector ― days after a violent insurrection at the capitol, when the coronavirus is killing roughly 4,000 americans every day, in the midst of a presidential impeachment ― reflects an embarrassing level of entitlement and shows how out of touch they are with regular americans, who would not fare well at airport security if they shouted about the constitution and blew past the metal detector.

philadelphia: scores of costumed performers took to the streets of their south philadelphia stomping grounds for a new year's celebration of mummers tradition, far from the customary parade route and despite official cancellation of the annual event and a ban on large gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic. participants in brightly colored costumes, some with faces painted, paraded down 2nd street in south philadelphia on friday following trucks that blared string band or popular music. some wore masks, but many did not. mayor jim kenney announced in july that the city would not grant permits to planned outdoor events with more than 50 people, effectively canceling the large annual parade and other events as officials struggled to keep a lid on the spread of the virus. some mummers leaders and organizations also asked members to stay home. city spokeswoman lauren cox said there were no major issues friday but said seeing pictures of many participants without masks was very concerning given the seriousness of this current wave of the pandemic. she urged voluntary quarantines and testing for anyone who had been in large crowds.

greer on the tyranny of housework by the millennium, housework should have been abolished. in a sane world, meaningless repetition of non-productive activity would be seen to be a variety of obsessive-compulsive disorder. people who said that they enjoyed doing housework, or needed to do it, or that doing it made them feel good would be known as addicts. once the word got out that a person was cleaning her toilet every day, therapists would come to her house and reclaim her for rationality and the pleasure principle. instead, we have professor jean-claude kaufman of the sorbonne telling us that housework is a deeply sensual experience—for women, that is, not for himself. women do menial work because it turns them on; it doesn't turn men on, therefore they should not be expected to do it. strange, isn't it, how much men know about sensations they have never had? kaufman knows a woman in whom dish-washing produces explosions of joy. according to him, rhythmic, repetitive, mindless tasks function as sexual anticipation, building up pleasurable tension until it climaxes in conjugal relations. faking it in bed has clearly not been enough; now women are having to fake sexual arousal even when they are cleaning the toilet.

trying to evolve food intake into meal supplements is not only an indulgence for wealthy consumers. garcia and soto are planning to evolve sani's business line, admitting that while we're still a start-up that is perfecting our supply chain, our future includes a buy one, give one plan, where a consumer who is able to buy a sani meal also provides a meal to a child in need. being business students, garcia and soto have determined that donating food to a developing country or area actually can hurt that local economy more than help it. we want to work with organizations that already have established relationships, like who's child-meal program, said garcia, to avoid the risk of hurting more than helping.

greer on sex and the singly woman out of 3.8 million british women in their thirties, almost a million are single or divorced. not only are many women not at present half of a couple, and not likely to become so, but they are also sexually inactive, which is a dereliction of their duty to themselves and the body politic. there is very little they can do about this, bar spending a fortune on body, clothes, face and hair, because, though they can signal availability in a dozen ways, they cannot actually make themselves attractive. the power to make an object attractive lies with the beholder of the object, not the object itself. as a woman grows older, her chances of mating on any but humiliating terms grow less and less. the constant pressure to be sexually active, which has replaced the old pressure to reproduce, actually places unmated women in jeopardy, and fills them with anxiety and the sense of failure. it is the greater pity then that so many feminists accept and perpetuate the notion that people who are not sexually active are of no account. so let this feminist say it again: no sex is better than bad sex. bad sex is bad for you. looking for sex can be humiliating, disappointing and dangerous. making yourself available can mean putting yourself in jeopardy. no sex does you no harm at all.

on monday, israeli scientists suggested our earth's constant companion may actually be a melting pot of many mini-moons. rather than one giant impact that shaved off a chunk of earth and formed the moon, a series of smaller collisions may have created multiple moonlets that eventually merged into one, according to the researchers.
the event could unfold much the same as a hearing last week in another county that ended with nassar getting sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison. the judge in that case described it as signing the doctor's death warrant.

at some point, we all have the chance to accept things in our lives simply as they are. this includes our own human failings, the mistakes and foibles of those we love, the tragedies we've survived and, yes, the suffering we've somehow caused. the past is past. all of it. whatever happened back then, happened already. yes, it brings us to where we are in our lives now, but we can't really be who we are right now if we let the past define us. this means, we miss out on just about everything.

scott gottlieb: well, look, we've-- we have forty million vaccines that-- that were delivered in december. five million were injected into arms. that's thirty-five million vaccines sitting on a shelf somewhere. i'm saying that we can be delivering these vaccines directly to walmart and walgreens, and in new jersey they're shipping them through shoprite, and allow these retail establishments to start opening up more general vaccination programs for the broader public instead of working very slowly through these preordained phases that we've-- we've articulated. continue to-- to accomplish that mission because it's important, but also take some of this excess supply and push it through a retail channel to the general public. if someone who's seventy years old or sixty-five years old wants to schedule an appointment at cvs to get a vaccination, they should be able to do that this month. so i think we should start working through the age brackets and just work our way down until we work off some of the supply. there's more vaccine coming on the market every day. we're going to have a significant backlog right now or, you know, warehouse inventory of vaccines.

she would be a woman who did not exist to embody male sexual fantasies or rely upon a man to endow her with identity and social status; a woman who did not have to be beautiful, who could be clever, who would grow in authority as she aged. i gazed at women in segregated societies and found them in many ways stronger than women who would not go into a theatre or a restaurant without a man. osage women in oklahoma, and anmatyerre and pitjantjatara women in central australia, taught me about survival. no sooner had i caught sight of the whole woman than western marketing came blaring down upon her with its vast panoply of spectacular effects, strutting and trumpeting the highly seductive gospel of salvation according to hipless, wombless, hard-titted barbie. my strong women thrust their muscular feet into high heels and learned to totter; they stuffed their useful breasts into brassieres and, instead of mothers' milk, fed commercial formulae made up with dirty water to their children; they spent their tiny store of cash on lipstick and nail varnish, and were made modern. while western feminists were valiantly contending for a key to the executive washroom, the feminine stereotype was completing her conquest of the world. this insidious process was floated on the lie of the sexual revolution. along with spurious equality and flirty femininity, we were sold sexual freedom. one man's sexual freedom is another man's—or woman's or child's—sexual thraldom.
meet in the middle? given the stakes, horizon investment's greg valliere predicts progress. both sides have compelling reasons to act – china quite clearly is suffering from an economic slowdown, and donald trump obviously fears that a nervous stock market could imperil his re-election, he writes in his morning note. thus we believe there will be a constructive statement tomorrow, with hints that high-level officials will meet later this month to hammer out an agreement in principle.

the democracy vouchers idea was first proposed by constitutional law professor bruce ackerman decades ago, but had never been adopted until seattle voters backed a 2015 initiative to implement the idea. the program has already enabled a large number of people who would otherwise be incapable of affording political donations, including homeless people, to participate in the political process by contributing to candidates. one study found that 84 percent of people who used used their vouchers in the city's 2017 elections had not made a political contribution in at least the previous two election cycles.

such insecurity has been instilled into women over generations; we have made not the least headway in the struggle to dispel it. every issue of every woman's magazine exploits women's anxiety about unwanted hair. even if you escape hairiness, you will fall foul of cellulite. when the female eunuch has written, cellulite was a french disease. the english word should by rights be cellulitis, but, as british pharmaceutical companies jumped on a bandwagon set off by sales campaigns for french products, they adopted the french word. cellulite is subcutaneous fat, pure and simple. it keeps women warm and softens the contours of their bodies and, if it builds up, it often dimples. whether or not your fat dimples is a matter of genetic endowment; some women have tight smooth fat and some women have softer fat, which droops and dimples, even on their knees, invariably on their bottoms. the characteristic orange-peel appearance can be seen even in the bottoms of babies who have not eaten chocolate, drunk coffee or alcohol or smoked, or committed any other of the sins that are punishable by cellulite. once upon a time, men and women both admired dimply fat; it took 20th-century marketing to render it disgusting. most of what is written about globular fat cells, poor lymphatic drainage and toxins that have solidified is cynical tosh. dimply fat will only disappear if it is starved off; no amount of pounding or vibrating or massaging will have any effect on it whatsoever.
is motherhood a privilege or a punishment? it is now understood that women can do anything that men can do: anyone who tries to stop them will be breaking the law. even the president of the united states, the most powerful person in the world, can be called to account by a female nobody who accuses him of asking her to fellate him. power indeed! the future is female, we are told. feminism has served its purpose and should now eff off. feminism was long hair, dungarees and dangling earrings; post-feminism was business suits, big hair and lipstick; post-post-feminism was ostentatious sluttishness and disorderly behaviour. we all agree that women should have equal pay for equal work, be equal before the law, do no more housework than men do, spend no more time with children than men do. or do we? if the future is men and women dwelling as images of each other in a world unchanged, it is a nightmare. in the female eunuch, i argued that every girl child is conceived as a whole woman but, from the time of her birth to her death, she is progressively disabled. a woman's first duty to herself is to survive this process, then to recognise it, then to take measures to defend herself against it. for years after the female eunuch was written, i travelled the earth to see if i could glimpse a surviving whole woman.

in the study, researchers analyzed dna from two kinds of bacteria that had taken a trip to the iss: staphylococcus aureus (which is found on skin and causes staph infections) and bacillus cereus (which is present in digestive systems and soil and usually harmless). both microbes were collected from the ambient environment of the space station and probably hitched a ride to space on the skin of astronauts or inside their bodies. the results revealed that while the returned bacteria had mutated differently than their earthbound counterparts, they hadn't developed any of the obvious genetic traits of superbugs.

these days, housework doesn't just use people; it requires a gang of machines: vacuum cleaners, washing machines, dishwashers, driers, food processors, microwave ovens, refrigerators and freezers, immense quantities of water, power and detergent to feed into them, and an army of technicians who treat them when they malfunction—and charge more than doctors do for a home visit. though the houseworker doesn't now scrub and polish floors or pound clothes on a washboard or put aside an evening for ironing, she is equally busy hoovering, spraying-and-wiping and stuffing clothes in washing machines. as more and more home appliances have appeared in more and more homes, they have brought anything but increased leisure for the houseworker (who probably also has to earn the money to pay for them). changing standards and notions of cleanliness have made cleaning more time-consuming than ever before. kitchen worktops need to be constantly wiped; kitchen floors need to be mopped whenever a footprint or a pawprint appears; the bath has to be cleaned between baths; once a day is not often enough for the toilet. every few minutes, a television commercial illustrates the standard and shows a way of achieving it, tightening the headlock on the housewife. a recent television commercial for bold laundry detergent opened with a mid-shot of a slender, good-looking, but not too good-looking, woman. a door opens behind her and a schoolboy rushes in. hi, darren, she says. he does not answer. she answers herself, hi, mum. darren enters bedroom, looks surprised.

omaha: restaurants that were allowed to start selling carryout cocktails amid the pandemic want to continue doing so even after the public health crisis wanes. the omaha world-herald reports the nebraska restaurant association plans to push for the expansion during the upcoming 2021 legislative session. the waiver extends until the end of the pandemic emergency. this is a way for our restaurants to survive and come out the other side of this pandemic, said zoe olson, the executive director of the restaurant group. olson said the association's proposal would include a requirement for some sort of seal on carryout beverages that, if broken, would indicate someone had opened their takeout drink in transit. the proposal would also end to-go drinks at some point, so legislators could review the policy and decide whether it should be extended. but the idea is getting some pushback from groups that oppose binge drinking and drunken driving. when you increase the availability and the ease of access to alcohol, that's when you get increased harms, said chris wagner, executive director of project extra mile, an omaha-based group that seeks to prevent or reduce problems associated with alcohol.

scott gottlieb: well, i think we can have a dual strategy here where we continue to prioritize certain hard to reach communities and have public health departments focus on that mission. and they're uniquely skilled to do that mission and then make the vaccine more generally available through the retail pharmacies, through walmart and walgreens and cvs, to a broader population, to a general population starting with age. we can walk it down the age continuum, make it available for seventy-five and above first, then seventy above, then sixty-five and above. there's fifty million americans sixty-five and above, a large percentage of them probably want to be vaccinated. at some point we need to allow supply to meet demand here and get the-- the shots into the arms of the people who really want to get vaccinated and are going to go out and seek out the vaccination. if we're pushing it through the retail pharmacies, you're not going to see the long lines. they're going to have a scheduling system in place and it's going to be a more orderly distribution. and then, commensurate with that, we can have the public health departments focusing on the critical mission of going into homes, reaching harder-to-access communities, people who are more reluctant and need a little bit more encouragement to get vaccinated.
