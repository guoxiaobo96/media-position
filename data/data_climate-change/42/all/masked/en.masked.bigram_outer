{"original_sentence": "Sun flips magnetic field (CNN) -- The poles of the sun's powerful magnetic field have reversed, signaling a time of peak solar activity that could spell trouble for planet Earth, astronomers said this week. The sun's magnetic north and south poles were in their respective northern and southern hemisphere several months ago. Yet since then they have migrated to the opposite sides of the star. The bipolar flip did not take astronomers by surprise. It takes place like clockwork on the sun, once about every 11 years. This always happens around the time of solar maximum, NASA physicist David Hathaway said in a statement. The magnetic poles exchange takes place at the peak of the sunspot cycle. In fact, it's a good indication that Solar Max is really here. During Solar Max or solar maximum, the sun tends to exhibit more sunspots and eruptions, and jettison more solar flares, which send powerful streams of charged particles into the solar system. Solar blasts heading toward Earth can stoke up beautiful auroras in the nighttime sky, and wreak havoc on communications satellites and electrical power grids. Astronomers consider the current solar maximum more powerful than average, but less intense than the last two in 1989 and 1979. Earth's magnetic fields also change places but with much less predictability and frequency. The reversals take place between intervals lasting from 5,000 to 5 million years.

For me, it wasn't really bouncing back into my normal intimate life with my husband. That took long, long time and I think two bottles of wine. But I mean, I'm talking about like seven months I think. The last couple of weeks of being pregnant, I lost all sensation in my hands. So one after another, all 10 fingertips went numb. It's some syndrome where your wrists swell up so much that the nerves that go through your wrist stop sending the impulses through from your fingertips. I think it took probably more than two to three months for sensation to come back in my hands. If you can't feel what you're doing, it's a very weird thing to be taking care of a very little child. I never had a serious or real injury before in my life until C-section. So that was a big thing. I had no idea what's going to happen there or how it's going to look like after the surgery. I had a scar.

{"original_sentence": "The trip comes a day after the stunning revelation that Mr. Trump asked Georgia's Republican Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, to find 11,000-plus votes in order to overturn the will of the state's electorate. On Monday, Mr. Trump signaled on Twitter that he planned to make his case at the campaign event, intended to kick-start sluggish Republican turnout. It was low in early voting, prompted by skepticism among his own die-hards about the validity of the November results. Mr. Trump muscled his way to power by bullying the Republican establishment — and the party's leaders now worry that he might drag them down with him. In Saturday's call, which was made public by Mr. Raffensperger's office, Mr. Trump vaguely threatened to the secretary of state that he would incite wrath — and discourage Republicans from voting — if he did not get his way. You're going to have people just not voting, said Mr. Trump, hinting at a dark outcome for politicians, like Mr. Rasffensperger, who opposed him. They don't want to vote, they hate the state. They hate the governor, and they hate the secretary of state. Mr. Raffensperger, in an interview on ABC's Good Morning America, said of the taped one-hour call that Mr. Trump did most of the talking.

Hyde (R-Ill.), as the panel met to hear from constitutional experts about the standards for impeaching a president. We paid attention to the polls and the elections. But, Hyde said, I'm frightened for the rule of law. . . . I really believe that notion that no man is above the law. He condemned all of the sophistries that I hear, rationales, justifications -- 'Everybody does it. It was just about sex.' In the wake of the GOP's poor showing in last week's elections and the continuing large majority of Americans who say they would like Congress simply to drop the subject of Clinton's alleged misconduct in the Monica S. Lewinsky matter, the president's prospects for avoiding impeachment seemed significantly improved. But committee Republicans yesterday appeared more energized than chastened, despite their party's five-seat House loss and the conclusion by strategists in both parties that the GOP may want to consider an exit strategy for an investigation that may have backfired politically.

I don't think censure is a possibility, said Rep. Steve Buyer (R-Ind.). Either we proceed or we do not. Hutchinson expressed similar reservations. The options are limited constitutionally, he said. Opening the daylong constitutional law seminar, Rep. Charles T. Canady (R-Fla.) was biting in his assessment of Clinton's conduct and the arguments by the president's supporters that, however reprehensible, it did not rise to the level of an impeachable offense.
