You know we were hoping that we'd have more injections in people's arms at this point and the vaccine could be starting to have an impact on the trajectory of the epidemic. And the new variant certainly creates more risk that this epidemic peak could get extended. We're going to see the epidemic probably peak at some point this month, hopefully earlier in the month. I mean, that was the original estimates and the original modeling. But the lag in terms of the effect on a health care system is going to be about three weeks. And so the health care system is not going to see maximal resource utilization told closer to the end of the month. And that's when we're likely to see the peak number of deaths on a daily basis as well. So we still have a ways to go with this current surge of this epidemic until we start to see cases decline, hospitalizations start to decline, and, hopefully, deaths start to decline.

When CBS reunited with the cable and film giant Viacom at the end of 2019, after a decade apart, executives who swung the deal promised that the combined company would become a bigger player in digital media.

So far, the imposition of customs declarations for British exporters, the first in decades, hasn't led to the delays some had predicted.

But traffic numbers were low because of the New Year's Day holiday and weekend. The amount of goods flowing between the two countries was also low because companies had stockpiled last year amid uncertainty about whether London and Brussels would sign a trade deal and eliminate potential tariffs by Dec. 31, the end of the Brexit transition period.

Doing so would also mean that he will give up five board seats held by his designees. The move, which will reduce Mr. Icahn's stake to 6 percent from 13 percent, caps an investment success few could have foreseen in late 2012, when the billionaire first poured money into Herbalife. At the time, Mr. Icahn pushed back against a campaign by William A.

It also increases insurance coverage for telehealth services, which have become vital during the pandemic.

{"original_sentence": "Fort Yates: The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is prioritizing the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to those who speak Dakota and Lakota languages. Standing Rock Tribal Chairman Mike Faith told KXMB-TV the policy is aimed at keeping customs alive. It's something we have to pass on to our loved ones – our history, our culture, our language. We don't have it in black and white; we tell stories. That's why it's so important, Faith said. The Standing Rock reservation straddles the North Dakota and South Dakota border and is home to about 8,000 people, more than half of whom live in North Dakota. Faith said only about 300 people on the reservation are fluent in the language. Front-line health care workers already have begun receiving the vaccine at the Fort Yates hospital, but starting this week, priority will be for those who speak their native language. In addition to those who can carry on the culture, the next phase includes elders, law enforcement, tribal courts and the school system, tribal officials said.

{"original_sentence": "Grafton: What was initially thought to be a major human error of someone damaging 57 vials of the coronavirus vaccine at the Aurora Medical Center Grafton has since grown into a federal investigation. A pharmacist at the facility intentionally removed 57 vials of the Moderna coronavirus vaccine from the refrigerator and left them out overnight knowing that the vaccines would be useless to those who received them. On Dec. 26, Aurora gave 57 people the vaccine from the tampered vials. After further review, the vials were discarded, and an investigation began. On Wednesday, Aurora notified Grafton police, and it became public that the vials were left out intentionally. The pharmacist was arrested Thursday. The FBI and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were also investigating, police said. Jeff Bahr, president of Aurora Health Care Medical Group, called the pharmacist a bad actor.

Remember, she will be told, beauty starts from within, so she keeps her bowels open with plenty of fibre and her kidneys flushed with lots of pure water. Being beautiful from within takes even more time than slapping beauty on from without. Demi Moore is said to work out for four hours a day, beginning with a cardiovascular aerobic workout, then working her legs and buttocks with pliés, standing lunges and thigh lifts, her upper body with shoulder and punching exercises, and toning her abdominal muscles. She also eats only non-processed, pesticide-free, totally vegetarian foods. The result—taut abs, a rock-hard butt and twanging musculature—was still not enough to save her marriage. Whatever a woman does, she must not look her age. The fitness regime is lifelong, to go with the lifelong sexual activity that is nowadays obligatory.

Another poll, carried out by MORI, showed that abortion was no longer a minority issue; 45 percent of the sample knew close friends or members of the family who had had abortions, compared with 27 percent in 1980. The people polled were asked if they thought that abortion should be available for all who wanted it and 64 percent answered in the affirmative; of the 11 percent of the people polled who were Catholics, half agreed with what 30 years ago would have been considered an extreme position. People also showed the beginnings of a retreat from the notion of eugenic abortion in cases where mental or physical handicap was suspected, which was supported by 84 percent of people in 1980 and by only 66 percent in 1997.

{"original_sentence": "Though vasectomy is available, it is culturally invisible. Men don't get pregnant, therefore men don't bother about contraception. Men do get sexually transmitted diseases so they do use condoms, sometimes, but nowhere near as often as they should. These days, contraception is abortion, because the third-generation Pills cannot be shown to prevent sperm fertilising an ovum. Yet no one feels so strongly against abortion at any stage that they picket the factories where birth control pills are produced. IUDs are clearly abortifacient: these devices work by creating inflammation of the uterus, often accompanied by infection. Women who accept them as contraceptive devices are actually being equipped with a do-it-yourself abortionist's tool. The outcome is frequent occult abortion, heavy bleeding and pelvic inflammatory disease, with the accompanying elevated risk of ectopic pregnancy. Whether you feel that the creation and wastage of so many embryos is an important issue or not, you must see that the cynical deception of millions of women by selling abortifacients as if they were contraceptives is incompatible with the respect due to women as human beings. You must also see that expecting women to be grateful for the opportunity to have inserted into their bodies instruments for sucking and scraping out the products of avoidable conception shows them as much contempt.
