As George Mason University professor Todd Zywicki and the Heritage Foundation's James Sherk wrote of the Chrysler bondholder cram down:

Lyons is willing to cut the crown prince a lot of slack for playing rough as he consolidates power, because it's necessary to implement rapid reforms against bureaucratic and social inertia in Saudi Arabia. There is also some comfort in knowing that MBS has practical dollars-and-cents reasons to make his reforms stick; if his sense of idealism flags, the sound of a doomsday clock ticking on a trillion-dollar economic collapse should strengthen his resolve.
Maths should be about maths, it should not be about sexualizing children, he told Breitbart London, warning the new textbooks will make it significantly more difficult for parents to protect their children from the malign influence of left-wing identity politics.

The Department of Health and Social Care, led by Jeremy Hunt MP, said that young people have a right to determine what happens to their own bodies, including consenting to drug treatments that can sterilise them and stunt growth.
As Strauss continued his report, he revealed that Nike didn't bother to offer Curry the chance to lead a training camp — something he really wanted to do — didn't give him much personal attention, delivered a Power Point presentation with Kevin Durant's name in it, and even mispronounced his name during a pitch session!
Let's repeat that phrase for the dimmer kids at the back of the class, Johnson.
The pro-democracy opposition in the National Assembly, meanwhile, is issuing stern statements condemning Maduro. Here in the National Assembly we work Monday to Friday. The decree [license] to vagrancy dictated by the regime will not paralyze us, the head of the assembly, Henry Ramos Allup, tweeted Tuesday.
By some accounts, losing Curry was one of Nike's biggest goofs. As Strauss notes, Sonny Vaccaro said, This is Nike's biggest fear. They can't overcome this in the shoe business. This is going to be detrimental to them. Psychologically.
Jenkins added that instead of giving the tickets to someone who is sick or well deserving, he gave the tickets to the murderer to encourage people to think outside the box and to listen and hear from one another.

With the potential for clean, efficient, and reusable fuel, both hybrid and electric vehicles could be poised for a leap into mass consumer relevance. Backed up by higher capacity and recharging that is as easy as a stop at the gas station, we may be looking at the first truly pragmatic alternative to fossil-fueled vehicles. All that remains to be seen is whether the cost of implementation is prohibitive. If not, Purdue and Ifbattery may very well force car companies and consumers alike to take notice.
All the vice president has to do, he added, is send them back to the States, AND WE WIN.
I am convinced that the Democratic Party has moved so far away from moral decency that it's impossible for any Catholic to make the case, in a reasonable way, for why it's okay for him/her to remain a Democrat, and vote for Democrat politicians, wrote Catholic author Shane Schaetzel in 2019.
It means that I am human, secondary school teacher Nora told Sky News at a Riyadh derby game. No other can prevent me from doing what I want. No other [can] decide what I want. I am the one who decides.
Granted, some of the social liberalization described by Stancati is incremental, such as upscale Riyadh women getting to decide what color fabric they wish to be wrapped in from head to toe, instead of having to settle for all black. Also, liberalization in the big Saudi cities is much more noticeable than in small towns and distant areas.

… in recent years, Americans — Silicon Valley leaders included — have put too much faith in the private sector to ensure U.S. global leadership in new technology. Now we are in a technology competition with China that has profound ramifications for our economy and defense — a reality I have come to appreciate as chairman of two government panels on innovation and national security. The government needs to get back in the game in a serious way. Important trends are not in our favor. America's lead in artificial intelligence, for example, is precarious. A.I. will open new frontiers in everything from biotechnology to banking, and it is also a Defense Department priority. Leading the world in A.I. is essential to growing our economy and protecting our security. A recent study considering more than 100 metrics finds that the United States is well ahead of China today but will fall behind in five to 10 years. China also has almost twice as many supercomputers and about 15 times as many deployed 5G base stations as the United States. If current trends continue, China's overall investments in research and development are expected to surpass those of the United States within 10 years, around the same time its economy is projected to become larger than ours.
After his diagnosis with PTSD, Vance began training in martial arts, and said it changed his life.

What has happened here in this last election because of COVID — people just sending ballots out to anyone who is on the rolls. Well, these rolls have not been cleaned up. And this isn't the first time this has happened, he added. When are we going to straighten out our elections, and when can we have a debate about the integrity of the elections? And if we really want to unite this nation, that's what the House should be doing — and the Senate. This should never happen again in the future. We've watched it before. We have to change it, and we have to make sure that our elections are accountable, have integrity, and are safe.

Despite the focus on surgery to change one's appearance in order to look more like the opposite sex, there is no scientific evidence that transgender treatments such as puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgeries, actually benefit young people with gender dysphoria, mainly because gender identity is a psychological — and not a biological — phenomenon.
But in many respects, his argument today echoes the words of former President George W. Bush, who defended the TARP bailout of banks that he later used to bail out the auto companies when he infamously said: I've abandoned free market principles to save the free market.

A better politics isn't necessarily a more profane politics. But the left half of the left wants to push broader boundaries, and it's no wonder they worry when the rest of the party starts to pull instead. The liberal vanguard Tlaib belongs to seeks massive change, from Medicare for all to a grand climate bargain. They see no hope for compromise now, so they look to a future of Democratic control, when ramming transformation through will require breaking things. The party establishment so far has shown small desire to do so. And that, Tlaib might say, is a motherf—ing shame.
Crucially, there does not seem to be any massive fundamentalist pushback lurking, comparable to how Saudi modernization at the beginning of the oil boom fed the resentments that erupted in 1979.

We're not going to change that now just because the Democrats want their way. This is so much bigger. The Senate's doing their job. We need to encourage and thank them for that, she added.
There have been more than 6,000 grooming crimes recorded in the UK in less than five years, with numbers dramatically rising in the past 12 months, Home Office statistics reveal.

Those states allow absentee ballots only for voters who give a valid reason to get one — and require they be requested for each election. Of those, Delaware and New York are phasing in no-excuse mail voting.
I think some of the commentary suggested that we didn't really speak on this issue, Rice said. I think we did speak on this issue, it's just that we understand there's a legal framework that has to be developed first.
There is chaos occurring. Puerto Rico passed a law negating, arguably, their debt. We want to bring order to the chaos. And the need for Puerto Rican legislation is to bring order to the chaos. And my number one priority as speaker of the House with respect to this issue is to keep the American taxpayer away from this. There will no taxpayer bailout. We want an oversight board, just like we did with the District of Columbia a number of years ago, to be involved, to provide the kind of leadership and structure that is necessary for Puerto Rico to gets its own fiscal house in order and to guide the kind of debt restructuring that is necessary so that Puerto Rico can continue to access the capital markets and keep the taxpayer out of this. That is our primary responsibility is to protect the American taxpayer and to help bring order to the chaos that will befall Puerto Rico if the status quo continues going in the direction it's going.

Under questioning by Marco Rubio (R-FL) during Thursday's confirmation hearing held by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Friedman emphasized his skepticism toward a two-state solution, suggesting that imposing the deal on Israel would be bad for their security and bad for their future.
German homeland minister Horst Seehofer, the leader of Germany's anti-mass migration Christian Social Union remarked on the link between Western military action adn the arrival of migrants, saying Thursday: We both would like the conflicts to be solved diplomatically and through dialogue. A continuation of this spiral (of violence) would amplify the problem of migration.
The former prime minister's claim was included in a 32-page document arguing Brexit was harming the NHS, jobs, and living standards, likely designed to make the case for blocking Brexit by pushing for a second referendum in 2019, as he suggested Thursday.

The stakes were high for Nevada Democrats to avoid a repeat of the chaos in Iowa, and it appeared Saturday's caucuses were largely successful.
The Taliban wants to change the venue of scheduled peace talks with the United States this month from Saudi Arabia to Qatar over Riyadh's push to include the Afghan government in the negotiations, members of the Taliban declared on Sunday.
Speaking to the press from Downing Street on Saturday morning, she described the joint action with the U.S. and France as limited, targeted and effective and insisted the aim was not to bring about regime change.
In addition, it appeared Nevada Democrats were able to successfully navigate a complicated process for adding early voting to the caucus process. Nearly 75,000 people cast early ballots over a four-day period, and the party was able to process those in time for Saturday so they could be integrated into the in-person vot.

The official 2016 platform of the Democratic Party has been dubbed the most pro-abortion platform in history, and the President of NARAL Pro-Choice America Ilyse Hogue called the 55-page document far and away the most progressive platform on reproductive health, freedom and justice in the history of the party.
A few weeks ago, I saw an article come across my text that he was getting out, and I wanted to do something special for him, Jenkins told the New York Daily News on Jan. 25. I knew I wanted to do something to celebrate him coming home because I understood he really dedicated himself to a life of service and he's trying to repay what he's taken from society. I know he has some great ideas and we're trying to accomplish the same thing when we talk about reform and healing our communities.

The concept of changing one's biological sex is, of course, nonsense, as sex is determined by unalterable chromosomes. An individual can change his hormone levels and undergo surgery to better imitate the opposite sex, but a male on the day of his conception will remain a male on the day of his death. And as discussed below, the idea that there is a real personal trait called gender that challenges or invalidates the identity significance of biological sex is equally fallacious. But the absence of genuine evidence is simply ignored, and faux evidence is created to validate the mania.
The German interior minister has said migrants will be denied permanent residence if they refuse to fit in to German society.
Students do not engage with the alma mater on a regular basis. By contrast, other renamed or changed traditions involved phrases like House Master (a change we opposed) which were used regularly. Indeed, the line in question has not been a source of consternation among students. In our view, the proposed change merely serves as a token that will ultimately achieve little in the greater scope of issues that plague Harvard College.
In bankruptcy, the secured status of these bonds should have meant that the secured creditors would be paid in full before any money was allocated to subordinate creditors, such as the UAW's VEBA plans. Instead, the plan imposed by the government forced Chrysler's secured creditors to accept only 29 cents on the dollar, while the UAW recovered most of the value of its claims.
The petitioners had concluded their appeal by asking: If a young person cannot legally buy a glass of beer below the age of 18, how is it we encourage them to make life-changing decisions involving the surgical mutilation of an otherwise healthy body, lifelong infertility, and with a lifetime spent on sex change hormones carrying well documented health risks and shortening life expectancy?
In a show of confidence, Sanders left Nevada early to rally supporters in Texas, which offers one of the biggest delegate troves in just 10 days on Super Tuesday. The progressive senator told cheering supporters in El Paso that Trump is a pathological liar running a corrupt administration.

Instead of refining petroleum, the refiners would reprocess spent electrolytes and instead of dispensing gas, the fueling stations would dispense a water and ethanol or methanol solution as fluid electrolytes to power vehicles. Users would be able to drop off the spent electrolytes at gas stations, which would then be sent in bulk to solar farms, wind turbine installations or hydroelectric plants for reconstitution or re-charging into the viable electrolyte and reused many times. It is believed that our technology could be nearly 'drop-in' ready for most of the underground piping system, rail and truck delivery system, gas stations and refineries.

The Algemeiner reports: Ahead of President Donald Trump's visit to the Jewish state next week, hundreds of family members of Israeli terror victims have signed a letter to the American leader that urges him to pressure the Palestinian Authority (PA) to stop giving money to terrorists and their families, the Hebrew news site nrg reported on Tuesday.
'Motherf—er' is filler, writes Roberts. It means little more than someone more unpleasant than 'unpleasant' can convey. Saying you grab women by the p—y, on the other hand, is truly damaging: It turns members of that gender into something to be played with. Calling immigrants an infestation dehumanizes them.
Jenkins mounted his protests starting in 2016 and continued them throughout the 2017 season until November when he said he decided that the issue was well worn and recognized. He also decided to stop the protests because of the $89 million the league promised to spend on social justice issues and programs.
In his reflection on the Sunday gospel reading, the Pope recalled the episode where a group of Pharisees drag a woman caught in adultery before Jesus to see how he will react, reminding him that Moses prescribed stoning for this sin and hoping to trap him in his response. Rather than take a stand on her punishment, Jesus suggests that the one with no sin on his own conscience be the first to throw a stone at her.
The three and a half million Americans living in the U.S. territory deserve the attention and support of Congress. After decades of mismanagement, Puerto Rico's investors also deserve better. A protracted and chaotic legal battle would not serve the interest of creditors or the island. Worse would be a mutli-billion dollar taxpayer bailout thrust on the shoulders of America's taxpayers and retirees. The PROMESA Act will ensure that the island meets its debt obligations in a controlled, responsible manner, without saddling the U.S. taxpayers with the bill. If we get this right, we have an opportunity to put the people of Puerto Rico on a path to economic opportunity. However, if we do nothing, the American people will be on the hook.
In July 2019, attorney and writer Jane Robbins observed at the Witherspoon Institute's Public Discourse:

As Stancati notes, even young women eager for reform in Saudi Arabia today grew up being taught that drawing pictures of animals was an insult to Allah's sacred and unique ability to create life, or that listening to music for pleasure would get them tortured for all eternity in the afterlife by having hot metal poured in their ears. Top Saudi clerics criticized the government for giving women the right to drive by saying it would give them easy access to worldly temptation, and as we know, women are weak and easily tempted.

In the year 2020, how can a president of the United States give a State of the Union speech and not mention climate change? — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) February 5, 2020
Despite brushing off criticisms of Tlaib's use of vulgar language from unspecified pro-civility crusaders, in a column published in November, Roberts called for amplified political censorship across Facebook and Twitter. She encouraged social media companies to further flex their power to shut down disinformation and false news, terms she neglected to define.
However, Sanders has yet to address his excessive use of private air travel on the campaign trail. Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings reveal that the socialist senator spent more on private air travel than his rivals in the final quarter of 2019, spending $1,199,579, precisely, on Apollo Jets, LLC, which the Free Beacon notes is a luxury private jet charter service.

Traditionally, Father-Daughter dances were created to be inclusive, not exclusive. Prior to such events, fathers often felt excluded from their daughters' school activities because most activities were aimed at mothers and daughters. While fathers and sons were typically involved in sports and similar activities, there were few school events for a father to do with his daughter. The Father-Daughter Dance was created to give fathers an event where they could participate in their little girls' school activities.
In the year 2020, how can a president of the United States give a State of the Union speech and not mention climate change? Sanders asked following the conclusion of Trump's address to the nation:

If the Israelis and the Palestinians were able, through direct negotiations, to achieve a two-state solution along parameters agreeable to them…I would be delighted to see peace come to this region where people have suffered on both sides for so long.

I think that in my view is a foundational problem, but I think it can be remedied and I hope it is.

The mixing of unrelated men and women, let alone singing and dancing, was no longer acceptable. Cinemas closed and music stopped. In public, women were forced to wear face-covering veils, which in parts of the country such as Asir had been virtually nonexistent. The religious police, formally known as the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, was given the job of enforcing the new order. Radical Islamists infused the school curriculum with the teachings of Wahhabi scholars. Textbooks instructed students to hate Christians and Jews and denigrated Shiite Muslims. Some of the more extreme views often came from teachers, who sometimes recruited students to extremist causes. Saudi charities linked to the government helped spread that interpretation of Islam beyond the kingdom's borders, inspiring generations of jihadists.

Friday was Powell's second attempt to reassure markets and businesses that the Fed would not go overboard in its rate hikes. In mid-December, following the Fed's decision to hike rates for the fourth time in 2019, Powell sounded somewhat less certain about future rate hikes than he had in an interview in October.

The high court's move left in place a lower court ruling from 2015 that favored O'Bannon, though it was a decision that did not satisfy advocates for college athletes to make money from advertising.

A snap poll taken after a Sunday night television appearance by the Chancellor, in which he again called on his German counterpart Angela Merkel to change course on her migrant strategy, found broad agreement with the new direction of travel for the country.

I know that 'eco-dictatorship' is a nasty word. But we may have to ask ourselves the question whether and to what extent we may be willing to accept some kind of eco-dictatorship (in the form of regulatory law) in order to move towards climate neutrality.
The BBC noticed a striking example on Monday, a headline that literally questioned the statistics coming from the regime.
There's no one in the administration or in D.C. that's contemplating a federal bailout of Puerto Rico, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on June 29. That statement is simply false. It may be true that the Treasury is not contemplating cash subsidies or loan guarantees for Puerto Rico, but it already is providing something just as good: tax credits for U.S. companies operating in Puerto Rico on a Puerto Rican tax designed to give those companies U.S. tax credits. Sound complicated? Yep. That's why nobody is paying attention. Think about it this way: Puerto Rico imposes a tax that the federal government pays. U.S. companies operating there are just the middlemen. Here are the details. Since 2011, approximately 20 percent of Puerto Rico's total revenue collections have come from a temporary excise tax on certain products manufactured in Puerto Rico. . . Now here's the financial magic. On March 30, 2011, the IRS released Notice 2011-2 ruling that this new excise tax was a foreign tax creditable against U.S. taxes. The notice stated that the new tax was novel and that determination of the creditability of the Excise Tax requires the resolution of a number of legal and factual issues. Until these issues were resolved, the IRS would not challenge taxpayers' claims that the tax was creditable. Further, if the IRS decided the credit was not creditable in the future, the new position would apply only prospectively.

We were supposed to meet US officials in Riyadh next week and continue our peace process that remained incomplete in Abu Dhabi last month, a senior Taliban jihadi based in Afghanistan told Reuters on condition of anonymity, adding, The problem is that leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) wanted us to definitely meet the Afghan government delegation, which we cannot afford to do now, and we have canceled the meeting in Saudi Arabia.

The FWD.us report is just one part of a broader campaign by companies and investors to convince legislators that they must quickly pass a labor-supply bill in 2021. That short timeline would minimize legislators'opportunity to debate the value of flooding the labor market for college graduates.

Fundamentalism spread rapidly across formerly liberal and cosmopolitan cities across the Middle East, which until the Islamist upheaval of the late Seventies resembled American and European cities of the same era.

The president needs to hear from his base — now is precisely the time to stand up and not stand down out of fear of pressuring the President. … He wants to be pressured [because] it is very hard for the President to go in one direction when 100 percent of the pressure inside the administration is headed in the other direction. The mistake that Trump supporters make is they wait until it is too late to stop the President from feeling compelled to go with the swamp … The time to get to the President is early and often.

Outside the capital, the situation was even worse, as officials began rationing the water supply similarly to how necessary goods are rationed in supermarkets. Currently, Venezuelans must wait up to six or seven hours on supermarket lines to buy essential goods like flour, vegetable oil, and milk. Increasingly, these lines have become violent, with individuals physically beating each other for access to limited food resources. The electricity shortage will likely force supermarkets to be open for fewer hours, worsening wait times to pay for groceries.

Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) will try to sell fellow Republicans on a bill to help Puerto Rico deal with its debt crisis at a special meeting Friday. Ryan said the morning conference meeting would be solely devoted to Puerto Rico, in an effort to educate members and bring them on board with the bill, which has faced persistent conservative opposition. A lot of members are just coming up to speed on this, he said Thursday. It is why tomorrow morning, we're doing a policy conference on just the issue of Puerto Rico. The members who have been spending a lot of time on this are going to give a presentation to the broader conference to bring people up to speed. The fate of that legislation took a turn for the worse late Wednesday, when the House Natural Resources Committee abruptly canceled a markup of the bill. Republicans said the delay was spurred by Democrats in Congress and the Obama administration. Committee Chairman Rob Bishop (R-Utah) said the administration was still trying to alter the bill, making a markup impossible. And Ryan contended that the bill did not receive consideration because Democrats were not willing to back it. But a Wednesday morning hearing on the bill also made clear there was ample conservative discontent as well. Several committee members lambasted the proposal, arguing it was a bailout for an island territory with a record of fiscal mismanagement. . . The current bill does not commit any federal funds to Puerto Rico.

This will feel very familiar to many investors who have seen all the blithe assumption about operating and maintenance costs on all kinds of technological green marvels fail to meet expectations. Biowaste generators, biomass, thermal pellets – you name it, and the rosy assumptions failed to materialise because the difficulties in making them work and keeping them working were glossed over by the promoters. Most of the smart money already knew that about renewables and is deeply sceptical. The not-so-smart money still laps the deals up.

The upcoming negotiations, the fourth in a series aimed at ending the 17-year war in Afghanistan, are scheduled between the leaders of the Taliban and US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad to discuss the withdrawal of foreign forces and a possible ceasefire in 2019. Leaders of the hardline Islamic militant group have rejected the Kabul government's offer for direct talks, despite growing international pressure in favor of the Western-backed Afghan government having a seat at the table.

It is best understood as a theocratic coup, and not an unsuccessful one because it permanently altered the relationship between Saudi Arabia's royal family, secular bureaucracy, and hardline Islamist clergy. The government did much to curry favor with the Wahhabi extremists to prevent anything like the Grand Mosque attack from happening again. The most pessimistic interpretation of the aftermath is that fundamentalists effectively blackmailed the wealthy Saudi government into bankrolling extremism and terrorism. The siege made the government look weak, dishonest, and decadent to many Saudis.
In a sit-down interview with Anderson Cooper for CBS's 60 Minutes, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) floated taxing the wealthy as much as 70 percent to fund her climate change plan called the Green New Deal.
Let's look after our country, let's open up, let's transcend ourselves, and let's show the snake oil sellers that they have no place among us, he urged. Let's show the rest of the world what it really means to be French. We are an open, courageous and fraternal people that has no need of two-bit ideology to get by. A great people grows even greater by supporting and reaching out to others.
As the Journal goes on to note, MBS is looking quite a way back into history for that memory of moderate Saudi Islam, since its harsh blend of strict Wahhabi Islam was brewed up in the 18th Century by the eponymous cleric Mohammed Ibn Abd al-Wahhab. Tribal influences, and of course the presence of Islam's holy cities of Mecca and Medina, have pushed the kingdom in an Islamist direction ever since.

But Schmidt argues that America's technological advantages can be preserved by continued reliance on these foreign experts:
Roberts heralds the Democrat Party's most openly left-wing politicians, casting them as trailblazers pushing against an insufficiently left-wing party establishment. Concerns over profanity, she argues, are secondary to championing those with the vision to break what must be broken in America towards ushering in transformational political change:
Ohio State has had to grapple with coronavirus issues throughout the season. In fact, the Big 10 had to change their rule for competing in the conference championship after Ohio State fell short of the six-game minimum due to several Covid-related cancellations.
Making the case for military action, the document further stated: The UK is permitted under international law, on an exceptional basis, to take measures in order to alleviate overwhelming humanitarian suffering… there is convincing evidence, generally accepted by the international community as a whole, of extreme humanitarian distress on a large scale, requiring immediate and urgent relief.
SARS had about a ten percent mortality [rate], but it only affected about 8,000 people, recalled Siegel. Swine flu had a very, very low mortality for flu, but flu itself really only causes about a point-four percent death rate, and [coronavirus] is about one-point-four percent. So this is killing more than flu, but I want to make a couple of points that will reassure people.
A quick and easy fix? Not always.
A person under 16 can consent to a sex change procedure if they have 'sufficient understanding and intelligence to enable him or her to understand fully what is proposed', they claim.

Experts say none of these efforts will likely reduce the nation's energy consumption, least of those the time change. They are thinking of water and electricity conservation, but there are few families who will abide by recommendations for saving [energy], so really this will not be very effective, Venezuelan Professor Wílliam Fuenmayor told El Nacional. Fuenmayor noted that late dictator Hugo Chávez had tried to change time zones in an attempt to save electricity and failed.

This makes a nonsense of Johnson's airy claim that his green revolution will create hundreds and thousands of new jobs. Of course it won't. There is plenty of evidence to support Heymann's claim. None to support Johnson's.
The report was one of several inputs the president considered in his deliberations, but he was very appreciative of the thoughtful approach taken by the historians, argued university spokesman Tobin Klinger.

During CNN's election coverage on Tuesday, CNN Political Commentator and former Obama adviser Van Jones reacted to the partial results in the 2020 Iowa caucuses by saying that 2020 Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden fell down these stairs, and I don't know how he gets up.
So far this year, there have been quick moves to extend mail voting in only two cases, both limited in scope: Maryland postponed its primary but decided to hold next month's special congressional election by mail. And the Democratic Party in Wyoming, which already was sending all its members ballots, has canceled the in-person portion of its presidential caucus.
But with inflation very low despite extremely low levels of unemployment and stronger-than-expected growth, many now think the Fed should rethink its model. The economy appears to be able to grow at a faster rate and unemployment to fall further than Fed economists thought was possible without inflation getting out of control. This suggests potential growth may be greater than the Fed believed.
Friedman told the lawmakers that he agreed with President Trump's recent comments marking a departure from the hardline stance the U.S. has maintained until recently, in which the two-state solution was the only option on the table.

According to a column in the Crimson by the staff editorial board, the reference to Puritans in the school's song was not a concern for members of the Harvard community before the announcement that the change would be made.
For states that don't already have vote-by-mail or that greatly restrict it, such a change could require amending state law. It also would require major changes to state and county voting and tabulating systems. Buying the equipment and software to track ballots and read the signatures on them could cost millions. And that's not to mention deciding who pays for return postage — individual voters or taxpayers?
Your position is not that you are opposed to this ideal outcome in which there would be two states, but that you recognize that at this moment given the circumstances that exist in the world today, and in that region, in particular, it is not likely to have that outcome. And hopefully, that will change. Hopefully, the Palestinians will have better leadership. Hopefully, they'll be more prosperous. Hopefully, they'll have an opportunity to grow their economy and their security. And maybe in 20 years, 15 years, five years, sooner rather than later, we all hope there will be the opportunity for this to occur, but right now those conditions are perhaps not in place. And the worst thing to try to do is go in there and impose on our most loyal and important ally in the region a deal that is bad for their security and bad for their future, is that an accurate characterization of your feelings with regards to the two-state solution?

Another ayatollah named Abbas Tabrizian, hailed by his followers as the father of Islamic medicine in Iran, became a figure of both local and international mockery for claiming the coronavirus can be held at bay by rubbing a cotton ball dipped in violet oil across the anus. An Iran-based religious scholar with over a million followers named Hadi al-Modarresi who raised a stir by claiming the virus was undoubtedly an act of Allah that is divine punishment against the Chinese for their treatment, mockery, and disrespect towards Muslims and Islam admitted on Wednesday that he himself has contracted the disease.

At this point, Riley is little over 1 year old. She is presented with a Nike sneaker, an Adidas sneaker and an Under Armour sneaker. She picks up shoe one, a Nike.

The climate change agenda is being driven by the metropolitan liberal consensus in London, where few jobs will be at risk. Outside of London there is little support for Net Zero, but people there have little say in policy decisions.

Maduro announced Tuesday that government workers would be expected to come into work two days a week until further notice, a measure intended to reduce the nation's use of electricity. Venezuela depends on hydroelectric power and is currently suffering a drought that has left its main dam barely operational. ABC News notes that the measure affects an estimated three million workers on the government dole. They will be paid full weeks despite the measure. Schools are explicitly included in the measure, leaving the nation's children without class for most of the week.
Mansfield called Harvard America's trendiest university, and said that the move is a surrender to groups who want to use the university to gain their own political ends and who do not understand or care for the search for truth regardless of party.

Although Germany has remained steadfastly pro-migrant through the crisis, despite being the focus of much social upheaval and enormous costs, Germans are growing more wary of multiculturalism and there is some desire for newcomers to attempt to fit in. Playing to that, Mr. de Maizière said yesterday there has to be a connection between the successful completion of integration and how long you are permitted to stay in Germany.
Since his NBA debut as a first round, seventh overall pick in 2009, Curry has become one of the most exciting players on the hardwoods.

Along with being the NBA's most valuable player that year he is also a three times NBA All-Star from 2014 to 2016. And that is just to start as he has a long list of achievements going back to college.

Francis noted that the Pharisees weren't really looking for Jesus' opinion on the Mosaic teaching but rather were trying to ensnare him in a catch-22 situation. Either Jesus contradicts the Law of Moses by recommending leniency, thus alienating himself from his Jewish followers, or he takes a hardline stance and recommends the stoning of the woman, thus betraying his own call to gentleness and mercy.

The victory, while encouraging for Sanders supporters, only deepens concern among establishment-minded Democratic leaders who fear that the self-described democratic socialist is too extreme to defeat Trump. Sanders for decades has been calling for transformative policies to address inequities in politics and the economy, none bigger than his signature Medicare for All health care plan that would replace the private insurance system with a government-run universal system.

It's not that they love Zion, Katz said in irony, discussing the Iranian investment in money and manpower in several conflicts around the world.
