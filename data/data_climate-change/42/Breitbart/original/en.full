It is a move that would effectively boost the influence of superdelegates and potentially damage Sanders' chances of becoming the party's nominee.\\n\\nPolitico reports:\\n\\nI do believe we should re-open the rules. I hear it from others as well, one DNC member said in a text message last week to William Owen, a DNC member from Tennessee who does not support re-opening the rules. Owen, who declined to identify the member, said the member added in a text that It would be hard though. We could force a meeting or on the floor. Even proponents of the change acknowledge it is all but certain not to gain enough support to move past these initial conversations. But the talks reveal the extent of angst that many establishment Democrats are feeling on the eve of the Iowa caucuses. … There's talk about somehow trying to change this rule at this convention — just casual conversation, and I have participated in it some, said Don Fowler, a former DNC chairman from South Carolina who opposed the DNC's decision in 2018 to strip superdelegates of much of their power in the presidential nominating process. But I want to be clear that I would not be a party to any effort to do that in the 2020 convention … It's bad sportsmanship.\\n\\nThe discussion comes on the heels of Sanders' steady rise in both early state and national polls. He currently leads in Iowa just days ahead of the February 3 caucuses, the current RealClearPolitics average indicates. Additionally, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey released on Friday shows Sanders edging out Joe Biden (D) for first place, 27 percent to 26 percent.\\n\\nSanders supporters have been growing frustrated with the DNC due to chairman Tom Perez's appointment of former Hillary Clinton surrogates, who were openly hostile to Sanders in 2016, to the rules committee. Former Massachusetts lawmaker Barney Frank was named as a co-chair of the rules committee. Clinton former campaign manager John Podesta was appointed to the same committee.\\n\\nIt's very disappointing to see Chairman Perez build a list of this magnitude, Sanders' national co-chair Nina Turner said in an interview with Status Coup's Jordan Chariton following the news.\\n\\nThe DNC should be ashamed of itself because it really is a slap in the face to folks what we're asking for reform, she continued.\\n\\nIf the DNC believes it's going to get away in 2020 with what it did in 2016, it has another thing coming, she warned.\\n\\nHowever, the DNC is indicating that it is not taking talks of a rule change seriously.\\n\\n[DNC Chairman] Tom Perez fought tooth and nail to ensure our nominee would be chosen by pledged delegates, not automatic delegates, DNC spokesman David Bergstein said, according to Politico.\\n\\nThe DNC passed these reforms unanimously.

{"original": "(AP) On Hadra al-Faqira's wedding anniversary, just weeks after she gave birth to a daughter, her husband walked out and took a second wife.\\n\\nShe hasn't seen him since he moved down the road in their dusty Bedouin town and started a new family, with seven more children.\\n\\nI can't bear the thought of her, al-Faqira said of the second wife. He destroyed my household when he started another.\\n\\nAlthough Israel outlawed polygamy decades ago, it's widespread in the impoverished Bedouin sector.\\n\\nIsrael is now trying to end the old custom, for the first time prosecuting suspected Bedouin polygamists. But many Bedouins, who complain of systematic neglect and discrimination by successive Israeli governments, see only a ploy to curb their population growth and criminalize their community members.\\n\\nThe Justice Ministry's director-general Emi Palmor, who spearheads the campaign, says she's determined to enforce the law but is trying to do so with input from the community. She said she has spent two years researching the issue and discussing solutions with Bedouin activists.\\n\\nThe Bedouin community is the only place in this country where polygamy is legitimate, out loud, exposed, and no one is ashamed, she said. It's a delicate issue, but it has to end.\\n\\nCritics of the campaign, including Bedouin women opposed to polygamy, mistrust the government's motives and the timing of the campaign. It's simple: polygamy means more Bedouin children, and that means more demographic concerns from a Zionist perspective, says human rights lawyer Rawia Aburabia.\\n\\nThe Bedouins, descendants of nomadic tribes, are part of Israel's Arab minority of 1.8 million, or about 20 percent of Israel's population. Some 240,000 live in the southern Negev Desert, many in makeshift encampments lacking electricity, sewage or running water.\\n\\nMost Bedouins fled or were forced out of what is now Israel during the 1948 War of Independence. Israel did not recognize their land claims, and many of those who remained live in unrecognized villages, deprived of basic services and vulnerable to government eviction orders and home demolitions, said community activist Yousef Abu Jafar.\\n\\nAround 20 to 30 percent of Bedouin men practice polygamy, according to government figures, with the rate climbing as high as 60 percent in some villages. Bedouin polygamy takes many forms, from several wives cohabitating under the same roof to men picking up and moving on to second wives without looking back.\\n\\nIslam permits a man to take up to four wives, but the practice varies greatly among different Muslim communities, often depending on education and income.\\n\\nAl-Faqira, 47, was married off by her family at age 16. After eight years and four children together, her husband left her, saying his family preferred he take a younger, wealthier wife. For the past decade, he has refused to see her or their children, now in their twenties, claiming they are no longer his business, she said.\\n\\nAl-Faqira said her children have fallen into drugs and street crime. She claimed that fierce competition with her husband's second wife has led to physical assaults on her family. Her husband's polygamy, she said, unleashed violence into my life.\\n\\nPolygamy has been linked to domestic violence, psychological disorders and deepening poverty. The custom has contributed to lowering Bedouin girls' average age of marriage to 18 and driving up their school dropout and unemployment rates to 85 percent and 80 percent, respectively, experts say.\\n\\nPalmor's committee, formed in 2016, seeks to crack down on the practice through expanded police enforcement alongside anti-polygamy education in Bedouin schools and funding for programs that boost women's employment.\\n\\nOver a dozen indictments have been issued, and in November, the first conviction for polygamy was handed down. The defense sought community service for the man, who took a second wife after his first fell ill. The prosecution is pressing for 18 months in prison. The sentence is expected soon.\\n\\nPalmor said these new efforts coincide with Israel's development plans for the Negev. We're starting to invest in southern Israel and we realized if we want to build industry and army bases and make the south grow, the progress must include the Bedouin, she said.\\n\\nIsrael approved an $800 million redevelopment project in 2017 as it moved two huge military bases into its vast southern desert. The project also pledges to provide the Bedouins with jobs, education and new infrastructure.\\n\\nBut many Bedouins say they have yet to see benefits, and claim promises of development only provide cover for efforts to uproot communities from their ancestral lands. For years, Israel has tried to resettle the Bedouins into recognized villages or custom-built cities.\\n\\nThe Bedouins have resisted these transfers, viewing them as land grabs that fly in the face of their traditions and clear the way for construction for Jews.\\n\\nWe're always hearing about billion dollar budgets but we only see more demolitions, more police, and more Jewish settlements, said Bedouin lawyer Khalil Alamour.\\n\\nShefa al-Sana, a Bedouin social worker who helps women affected by polygamous marriages, said that despite a common goal, she doesn't trust the government. She pulled out of Palmor's committee, worried its emphasis on law enforcement would further marginalize the Bedouins.\\n\\nPolygamy is not a random crime. It's a problem of ego and ignorance, men who have been stripped of their land needing women to treat as property, she said.\\n\\nCompounding suspicions has been the inclusion of Regavim, a pro-settler group invited to present research to Palmor's committee. It has framed the fight against polygamy as a way of stemming the expansion of Bedouin villages.\\n\\nPalmor dismissed accusations that her plan is politically motivated, pointing to support she has garnered from some Bedouins, most notably the human rights attorney Insaf Abu-Shareb.\\n\\nAbu-Shareb has remained in Palmor's committee, despite a backlash of Bedouins accusing her of betraying her community.\\n\\nWe've been waiting for 70 years, and the longer the government does nothing, the harder polygamy becomes to change, she said. If I want the situation of Bedouin women to improve, I need to work with them."}

{"original": "Health authorities in Hong Kong announced Monday that they have procured 500 electric trackers to place on individuals suspected of being infected with the new form of coronavirus originating in China last month.\\n\\nThe Hong Kong government is ordering anyone residing in Hong Kong present in the city or returning to it after visiting Hubei province – whose capital, Wuhan, is the location where the virus is believed to have first jumped from animals to humans – in the last two weeks into quarantine at home. To ensure that no one violates the 14-day isolation period and puts others in the population at risk, officials will use wristbands to monitor their location.\\n\\nThe trackers will be tied to the wearer's smartphone via Bluetooth technology. The phone's GPS technology will provide the person's location – if the phone leaves the permitted area, or if the wristband reaches more than a 20-meter distance away from the phone, the government will consider the wearer in breach of the quarantine. Destroying the wristband or taking it off will also count as breaches.\\n\\nHong Kong's Chief Information Officer Victor Lam debuted the wristbands in a press conference Monday, where he warned that violations found with the wristband could result in up to a six-month prison term or fined the equivalent of U.S. $644. He emphasized that the tags themselves do not have GPS technology, so the government will not monitor the wearer's every move, providing a minimum of privacy. He also noted that the government will soon count on another 1,000 wristbands to use similarly.\\n\\nThe move is part of a growing response to the coronavirus outbreak currently ravaging China and threatening the rest of the world. The Chinese government revealed on January 20 – nearly a month after secretly alerting the World Health Organization (WHO) – that it had identified a never-before-seen coronavirus spreading in Wuhan, a city of 11 million. China shut down the wild meat market where the virus is believed to have originated on January 1, and local officials instituted a lockdown in Wuhan, preventing entry or exit and stopping mass transit, a week after the announcement of the new virus.\\n\\nHong Kong has identified 15 cases of novel coronavirus as of Monday, according to the Asian outlet Coconuts. The city has identified potentially hundreds of cases, increasingly running out of spaces to isolate them and prevent the outbreak from growing, hence the introduction of at-home measures.\\n\\nIsolation is especially important in light of authorities warning on Sunday that they may have identified a case of coronavirus passed from human to human within Hong Kong – rather than the case of a person returning from Wuhan already carrying it.\\n\\nHong Kong can become another Wuhan, Yuen Kwok-yung, a University of Hong Kong microbiologist, said on Sunday, according to local broadcaster RTHK. Yuen suggested increased border controls to keep carriers out of the city, noting that Guangdong, the Chinese province that borders Hong Kong, is one of the most affected by the outbreak.\\n\\nThe individual identified as a potential human-to-human case is a patient that has reportedly not traveled outside Hong Kong within a time frame that would have made it possible to get the virus from someone abroad.\\n\\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has limited the flow of travelers from China, but refused to shut down the border completely, triggering widespread protests and a general strike of Hong Kong healthcare workers at a pivotal time in fighting the outbreak. Lam has taken to shutting border crossings piecemeal, and on Monday announced that all but three crossings will remain open. One of them is Hong Kong's international airport, where government officials insist they have installed enough security measures to catch incoming cases.\\n\\nLam cited a genuine and legitimate need by many in Hong Kong to travel into and out of China on a regular basis for leaving the border crossings open.\\n\\nMany in Hong Kong, already protesting Lam's close ties to the Communist Party of China for half a year before the outbreak began, have not accepted her explanation. On Monday, RTHK reported that dozens of Hong Kong residents took to the streets during their lunch breaks from work to demand a complete closure of Hong Kong's borders to China. The crowd, some chanting close the border, say no to China, sang Hong Kong democracy protest albums and demanded an end to the closures until police threatened them with potential action in light of them being suspected of taking part in an unlawful assembly, RTHK noted.\\n\\nAlso on Monday, thousands of healthcare workers began their strike against the government. As they are the first to interact with potential coronavirus cases, an open border is riskiest for them.\\n\\nIf there is no full border closure, there won't be enough manpower, protective equipment, or isolation rooms, to combat the outbreak, Winnie Yu, the chairman of the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance, told reporters. The first day of striking would only include non-essential healthcare workers, though that may change in the near future.\\n\\nWe reiterate… we hospital staff are being forced into taking this desperate move of taking industrial action by those in power, Yu said.

Flattening the news meant you couldn't always tell the difference between something that was trusted and credible, versus something fraudulent.\\n\\nHardiman stated that Facebook was working on a number of initiatives to help publishers monetize their content on the platform and had invested $3 million in a publication accelerator program which the company describes as a three-month pilot program in the United States to help metro newspapers take their digital subscription business to a new level. Stelter noted that $3 million is a very small investment for Facebook, which hit $13 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017.\\n\\nHardiman was asked about the upcoming midterm elections and what Facebook was doing to prepare themselves for them We've got our work cut out for us, but we're making good progress, said Hardiman."}

I'm fully, fully reconciled to that, Mr Johnson said on The Andrew Marr Show on BBC One.\\n\\nHe also suggested that the country would readily submit to further restrictions, saying: And I bet the people of this country are reconciled to that because, until the vaccine really comes on stream in a massive way, we're fighting this virus with the same set of tools.\\n\\nDowning Street sources speaking to The Times reported on Monday that it was likely more of the country will go into Tier 4, with the accompanying closure of schools in the areas of the country with the highest infection rates.\\n\\nLast Wednesday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that more areas of England would be put under the most stringent restrictions, putting three-quarters of the population under Tier 4. Nearly one-quarter of England are under Tier 3, and there are no longer any Tier 2 regions.

Tier 4 made its debut a week before Christmas, preventing millions of Britons in the south-east of England from visiting their families over the festive period. Reports circulated afterwards that Tier 4 was just the start of an increasing number of tiers, with a fifth level allegedly on the horizon.\\n\\nWhile The Times reports that the prime minister will be taking stock of England's situation on Wednesday, sources speaking to the Daily Mail have said that an announcement on expanding Tier 4 could come as early as today, following the hosting of a government COVID-O committee. The Telegraph reports that the prime minister may also reintroduce shielding — telling older and vulnerable people to stay indoors.\\n\\nThe government had planned that it would subject another official national lockdown to a Parliamentary vote. Increasing the tiers system to any theoretical height — even above and beyond the conditions of previous universal lockdowns — could theoretically sidestep this process, however.\\n\\nThe new reports come as Mr Hancock told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government was prepared to change tiers within 24 hours if need be, later signalling on Sky News that the Johnson administration would not rule out a third national lockdown.\\n\\nSir Keir Starmer, the Labour Party leader who should be fulfilling his obligation as Opposition in challenging the government's inclination towards more restrictions, has called for a full national lockdown without delay.\\n\\nThe virus is clearly out of control. We can't allow the Prime Minister to use up the next two or three weeks and then bring in a national lockdown which is inevitable.\\n\\nDo it now. That's the necessary first step to get the virus back under control. Nationwide lockdown – the prime minister has hinted that that's going to happen, but he's delaying again, Sir Keir said.\\n\\nConservative New Forest West MP Sir Desmond Swayne criticised the prospect of tighter restrictions, asking: What more pain do they want to cause us? What are they going to stop us doing now? Close down essential shops and the takeaways?\\n\\nThe whole thing is madness. It will be so ridiculous – what difference does it make if you are out in the fresh air for one hour or all day? It won't make a blind bit of difference. It's going beyond ridiculous."}
{"original": "TEL AVIV – The Israel Defense Forces has no intention of escalating the situation along the Israel-Gaza border, but it will continue operations to detect and destroy Hamas terror tunnels, IDF Spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said on Sunday.\\n\\nLerner was speaking in an interview to air Sunday night on this reporter's weekend national talk radio show, Aaron Klein Investigative Radio.\\n\\nStated Lerner:\\n\\nThe IDF and Israel have no intention of escalation, but we also have no intention of accepting the reality of these infiltration tunnels. Tunnels that only have one purpose – terror, death, and destruction. And that's why they need be stopped and we will continue to operate to do so. That is our obligation. It's what we need to do and we have to do it even under the potential that it could lead to more fire against our forces. Our job is to defend the civilians of the State of Israel and that's what we intend to do.\\n\\nLerner explained that the IDF has been using a combination of technology, intelligence, and ground force engineering operations to detect the terror tunnels.\\n\\nIn the last three weeks, we found two tunnels which have been cross-border tunnels in the southern Gaza Strip, he stated. What we have been doing is decommissioning them, putting them out of order.\\n\\nAnd we have seen Hamas in the last weeks turn around basically and put a strategic change in their efforts and carry out attacks against our forces that have been carrying out these (anti-tunnel) activities.\\n\\nLerner warned that Hamas has a strategic plan to build tunnels that come into Israeli territory and are intended to undermine all of the advantages we have had – ground forces, air forces, things that can be seen from above.\\n\\nHe continued: And that's why they have invested so much money and efforts in their tunnels. Over 1,000 people working in building these tunnels. Our estimate is that each tunnel costs about $3 million.\\n\\nLerner spoke following a report on Israel's Ynet website that Hamas had committed itself to de-escalating border tensions following mediation efforts by international parties.\\n\\nYnet reported:\\n\\nA general agreement has been reached between the warring sides after tremendous mediation effort by international parties in recent days and a great number of messages exchanged via intermediaries.\\n\\nOn Saturday, Israeli jets struck Hamas targets after rockets were fired over the last two days from the Gaza Strip at the Israeli civilian population.\\n\\nThe rockets followed a series of Hamas attacks in recent days. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Hamas militants fired at least six times at IDF forces searching for terror tunnels along the Israel-Gaza border. The Israel Air Force retaliated by firing at Hamas targets in Gaza.\\n\\nThe clashes come about two weeks after the IDF announced the discovery of a Hamas terror tunnel that crossed into Israeli territory.\\n\\nThis reporter analysed this situation on Wednesday:\\n\\nHamas seems to be testing Israel's military and political response to the possibility of another major outbreak of war in the south.\\n\\nGaza's Islamist rulers are also clearly sending a message to Egypt and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas that Hamas must be part of any future accommodation regarding border security along the coastal enclave. The Egyptians have been mediating reconciliation talks between Fatah and Hamas with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah Party eyeing a security presence along the Gaza-Egypt border. Abbas is due in Egypt next week for consultations.\\n\\nOver the last 24 hours, Hamas militants fired at least six times at IDF forces searching for terror tunnels along the Israel-Gaza border. The Israel Air Force retaliated by firing at Hamas targets in Gaza on Wednesday.\\n\\nHamas's escalation seems to be further aimed at signalling that it is willing to take risks to prevent the IDF from destroying the terror tunnels, which are critical to Hamas's battle-plans and regional power.\\n\\nHamas is also increasingly desperate as its economy is on the brink of collapse, and it may be using the violence to send a message to Israel and the international community that the Islamist group is willing to draw Israel into conflict if Hamas's financial needs are not met. Renewed hostilities would also help to redirect Palestinian anger away from Hamas's own failing government and toward the Jewish state.\\n\\nAaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

{"original": "WASHINGTON—President Barack Obama is quietly strategizing with Senate Democrats about how to push a Supreme Court nominee to confirmation this year, while Republicans show no sign of flinching in their promise to let the American people decide this issue in November.\\n\\nTwo events last week showcased the ongoing struggle over Obama's attempt to appoint a new justice to a lifetime appointment on the High Court, which has not been done for the better part of a century during a presidential election year.\\n\\nThe first clash came during Thursday's Senate Judiciary Committee meeting, the business meeting of that powerful committee since the passing of conservative lion Antonin Scalia. Sen. Patrick Leahy complained about the committee's refusing to hold Supreme Court hearings during this election year.\\n\\nSen. Orrin Hatch set forth in his prepared remarks during the committee's meeting:\\n\\nThe question regarding the vacancy created by the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is when, not whether, the Senate should consider a nominee. Democrats say that the Constitution answers the question for us, requiring a prompt hearing and floor vote whenever the president chooses a nominee. Anything else, they say, would not be doing our job. Mr. Chairman, rarely have so few words been so misleading to so many.\\n\\nReferencing Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution, Hatch went on to explain:\\n\\nThe Constitution gives the nomination power to the president, and the advice and consent power to the Senate. The Constitution does not tell either the president or the Senate how to exercise their power. The Senate must decide how to exercise its power of advice and consent in each situation, and has done so in different ways, at different times, under different circumstances. Chairman Chuck Grassley has already explained that the committee would not be holding hearings on any Supreme Court nominee, and a majority of committee members signed a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell promising as such. According to Grassley and his committee members, this allows time for a national debate to play out on what direction the nation should go regarding the nation's highest court, as expressed by the vote tallies this November.\\n\\nGrassley has previously noted that when Republicans have held the White House, Democrats had been the ones vowing not to hold confirmation hearings during presidential election years.\\n\\nResponding to the Democrats' newfound commitment to election-year confirmations, Grassley asked during Thursday's committee meeting, Why are this outrage? Why the demands for a hearing that everyone knows will not result in a confirmation?\\n\\nGrassley was also nonplussed when the next day, Obama held a clandestine meeting at the White House with top Democrats to plot how they could change this dynamic. The details of Friday's meeting have not been made public, but Grassley—who was not told about the meeting beforehand—expressed his displeasure, tweeting, Wish Repub[licans] had [been] invited to Dem[ocrats'] secret closed door SCOTUS meeting.\\n\\nThe conflict over the Supreme Court is very likely to be back on the front pages once Obama makes a nomination, which many expect to take place within the next two weeks.\\n\\nKen Klukowski is legal editor for Breitbart News.

{"original": "WASHINGTON, D.C. — China and the United States have agreed to many initial cooperative economic actions as part of a 100-day plan that Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping settled on during their Florida Summit, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross explained on Thursday.\\n\\nJust one month after the April summit, the two countries have come to these initial agreements on agricultural trade, financial services, investment, and energy.\\n\\nUnder the new agreement between the two nations, China is to start accepting imports of U.S. beef no later than July 16, 2017 with conditions stipulated under the 1999 Agricultural Cooperation Agreement. The U.S. and China have also agreed to resolve outstanding issues with importing Chinese origin cooked poultry to the U.S. as soon as possible. The U.S. will publish a rule on the issue no later than July 16, 2017.\\n\\nRoss said this has been going on for years. He quantified this as a $2.5 billion dollar market that is opening up for U.S. beef for which We now, for the first time, have a precise approval and precise date by which beef shipments will start. Ross later said the U.S. market share of that will depend on effectiveness of cattle people's marketing, but he expects that U.S. beef will be popular in China.\\n\\nThe Secretary was later asked if the Administration saw any safety issues with importing the poultry or if the poultry industry anticipates a drag on U.S. poultry prices. Ross replied, The Department of Agriculture feels that this will not cause major injury to the U.S. poultry industry.\\n\\nRoss called the third item on a list of ten agreements a very big, contentious issue:\\n\\nChina's National Biosafety Committee (NBC) is to hold a meeting by the end of May 2017, to conduct science-based evaluations of all eight pending U.S. biotechnology product applications to assess the safety of the products for their intended use…\\n\\nHe said this is about applications that have remained pending for many years. This will accelerate approvals, according to the Secretary.\\n\\nThe fourth agreement states that the U.S. invites China to receive U.S. imports of LNG (liquefied natural gas). Companies from China may proceed at any time to negotiate all types of contractual arrangement with U.S. LNG exporters, including long-term contracts, subject to the commercial consideration of the parties, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce announcement of the ten agreements.\\n\\nThis is a very big change and this is very good news for the LNG industry, said Ross. Later asked about concerns with this move, Ross referred to Dow Chemical, stating that that company has indicated that, as long as the LNG exports don't exceed 15-30 percent of total output, It should not be a problem for domestic chemical companies. Ross said there shouldn't be an adverse effect on consumers.\\n\\nRoss later stated that as China attempts to wean itself off of coal, it is significantly dependent on outside sources for its LNG, much of which comes from Russia. He said this allows China to diversify their sources and will provide a huge export market for American LNG.\\n\\nFifth on the list is a July 16, 2017 deadline for China to allow wholly foreign-owned financial services firms in China to provide credit rating services, and to begin the licensing process for credit investigation.\\n\\nSixth is a U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) six month extension of current no-action relief to Shanghai Clearing House. Further extensions could range to three years. The CFTC intends to do this by July 16.\\n\\nBy the same deadline, China shall issue any further guidelines and allow wholly U.S.-owned suppliers of electronic payment services (EPS) to begin the licensing process. The Commerce Department release states, This should lead to full and prompt market access.\\n\\nRoss said of the eighth agreement item:\\n\\nThe Chinese would like to enter the U.S. banking markets in the same way. Applicable U.S. federal regulatory authorities remain committed to apply in the United States the same bank prudential supervisory and regulatory standards to Chinese banking institutions as to other foreign banking institutions, in like circumstances and in accordance with U.S. law.\\n\\nAgreement nine read, China is to issue both bond underwriting and settlement licenses to two qualified U.S. financial institutions by July 16, 2017.\\n\\nRoss said this request has been longstanding to the Chinese.\\n\\nThe tenth initial agreement is, The United States recognizes the importance of China's One Belt and One Road initiative and is to send delegates to attend the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing May 14-15.\\n\\nIn addition, the U.S. Commerce Department announcement welcomed Chinese investment and participation in the SelectUSA Investment Summit set to commence June 18-20 in Washington, D.C.\\n\\nRoss stated that the document laying out the ten agreements is an official document signed by both the United States and China. In response to questions on whether these agreements related to diplomatic negotiations with China concerning North Korea, Ross said there was not a quid pro quo in the discussions of these agreements.\\n\\nThese ten agreements are merely initial within the 100-day action plan under the framework of the U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue, according the the Department of Commerce. Co-chairs Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of Commerce Ross and Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang lead the negotiations on these issues and objectives for next steps.\\n\\nThe Commerce Department stated also that both sides are to begin discussions on a one-year plan to further solidify actions in promoting U.S.-China economic engagement and cooperation. After the 100-day plan is implemented, the two countries hope to deepen engagement on other issues this summer at the first Comprehensive Economic Dialogue meeting in Washington, D.C.\\n\\nRoss said there would be another set of prioritizations in the one-year plan. He called this a Herculean accomplishment to get this done.

{"original": "A more contagious variant of the Chinese coronavirus first detected in the U.K. has surfaced in at least five states across the U.S., threatening to burden the already strained health care system further.\\n\\nJoining at least 33 countries, health officials in Colorado (December 28), respectively followed by California (December 30), Florida (December 31), New York (January 4), and most recently Georgia (January 5), have documented their first case of the new strain. Most of those states have imposed strict mask mandates and lockdown measures, except Florida and Georgia.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, data posted on the official website of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed the United States is home to at least 52 cases of the variant first identified in the U.K. — at least 26 new strain infections in California, 22 in Florida, two cases in Colorado, and one each in Georgia and New York.\\n\\nCDC officials stressed that the 52 cases do not represent the total number of new variant infections circulating in the United States, but only those detected by analyzing Chinese coronavirus positive specimens. Not all of the infected take a test or end up in the hospital, particularly asymptomatics.\\n\\nThe CDC conceded that its tally might not immediately match those reported by state and local officials.\\n\\nThere are likely many more cases in the United States, experts reportedly say. Many of them have blasted the country for not boosting virus samples' genetic sequencing to surveil for mutations. According to the CDC, it is ramping up sequence-based strain surveillance.\\n\\nSeveral nations have also detected an additional variant, first identified in South Africa, that also appears to spread more easily. U.S.-based health officials have not yet found that strain on American soil.\\n\\nThe new variants emerged in the fall of 2020, CDC noted in a webpage last updated on Sunday. Currently, there is no evidence that the new strains increase the severity of the illness or intensify the risk of death, the CDC said, echoing the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), a United Nations entity.\\n\\nDr. Henry Walke, the incident manager for the CDC's coronavirus response, told reporters last week:\\n\\nWe don't know how widely the variant first identified in the U.K. has spread in the United States. We don't know if the other variant that was first identified in South Africa is in the United States. We also still don't know how widely these two new variants have spread elsewhere around the world.\\n\\nDuring the same press briefing, Dr. Henry Walke, the incident manager for the CDC's coronavirus response, added:\\n\\nBecause the variants spread more rapidly, they could lead to more cases and put even more strain on our heavily burdened health care systems. … We expect to see new variants emerge over time. Many mutations lead to variants that don't change how the virus infects people.\\n\\nThe U.S. has reported a record number of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in recent weeks, putting a strain on an already overburdened health system.\\n\\nIn a blog post, Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of Brown University's School of Public Health, wrote the new strain that originated in the U.K. would be behind the majority of new infections by March.\\n\\nThe new strain is estimated to represent about 1% of all infections [in the U.S.] at this moment, but because of its increased contagiousness, the best estimates are that it will become a majority of all new infections by March, Dr. Jha noted.\\n\\nWhile more data is needed, the CDC and W.H.O. believe there is no current evidence the new strains will reduce the vaccines' efficacy.\\n\\nThe coronavirus would likely need to accumulate multiple mutations in the spike protein to evade immunity induced by vaccines or by natural infection, the CDC noted.\\n\\nDr. Armstrong further explained:\\n\\nFrom what we know from experience with this mutation and other mutations is that it's unlikely to have a large impact on vaccine-induced immunity or on an existing immunity from previous strains. We do know that some of these mutations can result in reduced efficacy of [therapeutic agents such as] monoclonal antibodies … So the experts are generally in consensus that mutations like this are unlikely to cause a large impact on the neutralization [of the virus].\\n\\nNone of the individuals infected in the United States have a travel history, suggesting that the disease is already spreading from person to person inside the country.\\n\\nUSA Today reported on Tuesday:\\n\\nThe [new] strain [first detected in the U.K.] has been detected in at least 33 countries, including Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, The Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Portugal, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States.\\n\\nHealth officials in Nigeria have detected a third strain, but the CDC says there is no evidence it is more severe or more transmissible than the original virus."}

{"original": "In sworn testimony, Google CEO Sundar Pichai told Congress last month that his company does not manually intervene on any particular search result. Yet an internal discussion thread leaked to Breitbart News reveals Google regularly intervenes in search results on its YouTube video platform – including a recent intervention that pushed pro-life videos out of the top ten search results for abortion.\\n\\nThe term abortion was added to a blacklist file for controversial YouTube queries, which contains a list of search terms that the company considers sensitive. According to the leak, these include some of these search terms related to: abortion, abortions, the Irish abortion referendum, Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters, and anti-gun activist David Hogg.\\n\\nThe existence of the blacklist was revealed in an internal Google discussion thread leaked to Breitbart News by a source inside the company who wishes to remain anonymous. A partial list of blacklisted terms was also leaked to Breitbart by another Google source.\\n\\nIn the leaked discussion thread, a Google site reliability engineer hinted at the existence of more search blacklists, according to the source.\\n\\nWe have tons of white- and blacklists that humans manually curate, said the employee. Hopefully this isn't surprising or particularly controversial.\\n\\nOthers were more concerned about the presence of the blacklist. According to the source, the software engineer who started the discussion called the manipulation of search results related to abortion a smoking gun.\\n\\nThe software engineer noted that the change had occurred following an inquiry from a left-wing Slate journalist about the prominence of pro-life videos on YouTube, and that pro-life videos were replaced with pro-abortion videos in the top ten results for the search terms following Google's manual intervention.\\n\\nThe Slate writer said she had complained last Friday and then saw different search results before YouTube responded to her on Monday, wrote the employee. And lo and behold, the [changelog] was submitted on Friday, December 14 at 3:17 PM.\\n\\nThe manually downranked items included several videos from Dr. Antony Levatino, a former abortion doctor who is now a pro-life activist. Another video in the top ten featured a woman's personal story of being pressured to have an abortion, while another featured pro-life conservative Ben Shapiro. The Slate journalist who complained to Google reported that these videos previously featured in the top ten, describing them in her story as dangerous misinformation.\\n\\nSince the Slate journalist's inquiry and Google's subsequent intervention, the top search results now feature pro-abortion content from left-wing sources like BuzzFeed, Vice, CNN, and Last Week Tonight With John Oliver. In her report, the Slate journalist acknowledged that the search results changed shortly after she contacted Google.\\n\\nThe manual adjustment of search results by a Google-owned platform contradicts a key claim made under oath by Google CEO Sundar Pichai in his congressional testimony earlier this month: that his company does not manually intervene on any search result.\\n\\nA Google employee in the discussion thread drew attention to Pichai's claim, noting that it seems like we are pretty eager to cater our search results to the social and political agenda of left-wing journalists.\\n\\nOne of the posts in the discussion also noted that the blacklist had previously been edited to include the search term Maxine Waters after a single Google employee complained the top YouTube search result for Maxine Waters was very low quality.\\n\\nGoogle's alleged intervention on behalf of a Democratic congresswoman would be further evidence of the tech giant using its resources to prop up the left. Breitbart News previously reported on leaked emails revealing the company targeted pro-Democrat demographics in its get-out-the-vote efforts in 2016.\\n\\nAccording to the source, a software engineer in the thread also noted that a bunch of terms related to the abortion referendum in Ireland had been added to the blacklist – another change with potentially dramatic consequences on the national policies of a western democracy.\\n\\nyoutube_controversial_query_blacklist\\n\\nAt least one post in the discussion thread revealed the existence of a file called youtube_controversial_query_blacklist, which contains a list of YouTube search terms that Google manually curates. In addition to the terms abortion, abortions, Maxine Waters, and search terms related to the Irish abortion referendum, a Google software engineer noted that the blacklist includes search terms related to terrorist attacks. (the posts specifically mentions that the Strasbourg terrorist attack as being on the list).\\n\\nIf you look at the other entries recently added to the youtube_controversial_query_blacklist (e.g., entries related to the Strasbourg terrorist attack), the addition of abortion seems…out-of-place, wrote the software engineer, according to the source.\\n\\nAfter learning of the existence of the blacklist, Breitbart News obtained a partial screenshot of the full blacklist file from a source within Google. It reveals that the blacklist includes search terms related to both mass shootings and the progressive anti-second amendment activist David Hogg.\\n\\nThis suggests Google has followed the lead of Democrat politicians, who have repeatedly pushed tech companies to censor content related to the Parkland school shooting and the Parkland anti-gun activists. It's part of a popular new line of thought in the political-media establishment, which views the public as too stupid to question conspiracy theories for themselves.\\n\\nHere is the partial blacklist leaked to Breitbart:\\n\\n2117 plane crash Russian 2118 plane crash 2119 an-148 2120 florida shooting conspiracy 2121 florida shooting crisis actors 2122 florida conspiracy 2123 florida false flag shooting 2124 florida false flag 2125 fake florida school shooting 2126 david hogg hoax 2127 david hogg fake 2128 david hogg crisis actor 2129 david hogg forgets lines 2130 david hogg forgets his lines 2131 david hogg cant remember his lines 2132 david hogg actor 2133 david hogg cant remember 2134 david hogg conspiracy 2135 david hogg exposed 2136 david hogg lines 2137 david hogg rehearsing 2120 florida shooting conspiracy\\n\\nThe full internal filepath of the blacklist, according to another source, is:\\n\\n//depot/google3/googledata/superroot/youtube/youtube_controversial_query_blacklist\\n\\nContradictions\\n\\nResponding to a request for comment, a YouTube spokeswoman said the company wants to promote authoritative sources in its search results, but maintained that YouTube is a platform for free speech that allow[s] both pro-life and pro-abortion content.\\n\\nYouTube's full comment:\\n\\nYouTube is a platform for free speech where anyone can choose to post videos, as long as they follow our Community Guidelines, which prohibit things like inciting violence and pornography. We apply these policies impartially and we allow both pro-life and pro-choice opinions. Over the last year we've described how we are working to better surface news sources across our site for news-related searches and topical information. We've improved our search and discovery algorithms, built new features that clearly label and prominently surface news sources on our homepage and search pages, and introduced information panels to help give users more authoritative sources where they can fact check information for themselves.\\n\\nIn the case of the abortion search results, YouTube's intervention to insert authoritative content resulted in the downranking of pro-life videos and the elevation of pro-abortion ones.\\n\\nA Google spokesperson took a tougher line than its YouTube subsidiary, stating that Google has never manipulated or modified the search results or content in any of its products to promote a particular political ideology.\\n\\nHowever, in the leaked discussion thread, a member of Google's trust & safety team, Daniel Aaronson, admitted that the company maintains huge teams that work to adjust search results for subjects that are prone to hyperbolic content, misleading information, and offensive content – all subjective terms that are frequently used to suppress right-leaning sources.\\n\\nHe also admitted that the interventions weren't confined to YouTube – they included search results delivered via Google Assistant, Google Home, and in rare cases Google 's organic search results.\\n\\nIn the thread, Aaronson attempted to explain how search blacklisting worked. He claimed that highly specific searches would generate non-blacklisted results, even controversial ones. But the inclusion of highly specific terms in the YouTube blacklist, like David Hogg cant remember his lines – the name of an actual viral video – seems to contradict this.\\n\\nAaronson's full post is copied below:\\n\\nI work in Trust and Safety and while I have no particular input as to exactly what's happening for YT I can try to explain why you'd have this kind of list and why people are finding lists like these on Code Search. When dealing with abuse/controversial content on various mediums you have several levers to deal with problems. Two prominent levers are Proactive and Reactive: Proactive: Usually refers to some type of algorithm/scalable solution to a general problem E.g.: We don't allow straight up porn on YouTube so we create a classifier that detects porn and automatically remove or flag for review the videos the porn classifier is most certain of\\n\\nReactive: Usually refers to a manual fix to something that has been brought to our attention that our proactive solutions don't/didn't work on and something that is clearly in the realm of bad enough to warrant a quick targeted solution (determined by pages and pages of policies worked on over many years and many teams to be fair and cover necessary scope) E,g.: A website that used to be a good blog had it's domain expire and was purchased/repurposed to spam Search results with autogenerated pages full of gibberish text, scraped images, and links to boost traffic to other spammy sites. It is manually actioned for violating policy\\n\\nThese Organic Search policies and the consequences to violating them are public Manually reacting to things is not very scalable, and is not an ideal solution to most problems, so the proactive lever is really the one we all like to lean on. Ideally, our classifiers/algorithm are good at providing useful and rich results to our users while ignoring things at are not useful or not relevant. But we all know, this isn't exactly the case all the time (especially on YouTube). From a user perspective, there are subjects that are prone to hyperbolic content, misleading information, and offensive content. Now, these words are highly subjective and no one denies that. But we can all agree generally, lines exist in many cultures about what is clearly okay vs. what is not okay. E.g. a video of a puppy playing with a toy is probably okay in almost every culture or context, even if it's not relevant to the query. But a video of someone committing suicide and begging others to follow in his/her footsteps is probably on the other side of the line for many folks. While my second example is technically relevant to the generic query of suicide, that doesn't mean that this is a very useful or good video to promote on the top of results for that query. So imagine a classifier that says, for any queries on a particular text file, let's pull videos using signals that we historically understand to be strong indicators of quality (I won't go into specifics here, but those signals do exist). We're not manually curating these results, we're just saying hey, be extra careful with results for this query because many times really bad stuff can appear and lead to a bad experience for most users. Ideally the proactive lever did this for us, but in extreme cases where we need to act quickly on something that is so obviously not okay, the reactive/manual approach is sometimes necessary. And also keep in mind, that this is different for every product. The bar for changing classifiers or manual actions on span in organic search is extremely high. However, the bar for things we let our Google Assistant say out loud might be a lot lower. If I search for Jews run the banks – I'll likely find anti-semitic stuff in organic search. As a Jew, I might find some of these results offensive, but they are there for people to research and view, and I understand that this is not a reflection of Google feels about this issue. But if I ask Google assistant Why do Jews run the banks we wouldn't be similarly accepting if it repeated and promoted conspiracy theories that likely pop up in organic search in her smoothing voice. Whether we agree or not, user perception of our responses, results, and answers of different products and mediums can change. And I think many people are used to the fact that organic search is a place where content should be accessible no matter how offensive it might be, however, the expectation is very different on a Google Home, a Knowledge Panel, or even YouTube. These lines are very difficult and can be very blurry, we are all well aware of this. So we've got huge teams that stay cognizant of these facts when we're crafting policies considering classifier changes, or reacting with manual actions – these decisions are not made in a vacuum, but admittedly are also not made in a highly public forum like TGIF or IndustryInfo (as you can imagine, decisions/agreement would be hard to get in such a wide list – image if all your CL's were reviewed by every engineer across Google all the time). I hope that answers some questions and gives a better layer of transparency without going into details about our Pepsi formula. Best, Daniel\\n\\nThe fact that Google manually curates politically contentious search results fits in with a wider pattern of political activity on the part of the tech giant.\\n\\nIn 2018, Breitbart News exclusively published a leaked video from the company that showed senior management in dismay at Trump's election victory, and pledging to use the company's power to make his populist movement a hiccup in history.\\n\\nBreitbart also leaked The Good Censor, an internal research document from Google that admits the tech giant is engaged in the censorship of its own products, partly in response to political events.\\n\\nAnother leak revealed that employees within the company, including Google's current director of Trust and Safety, tried to kick Breitbart News off Google's market-dominating online ad platforms.\\n\\nYet another showed Google engaged in targeted turnout operations aimed to boost voter participation in pro-Democrat demographics in key states ahead of the 2016 election. The effort was dubbed a silent donation by a top Google employee.\\n\\nEvidence for Google's partisan activities is now overwhelming. President Trump has previously warned Google, as well as other Silicon Valley giants, not to engage in censorship or partisan activities.

The prohibition could potentially include churches or other religious groups that sold, advertised or even recommended books that propagated the idea that believers can use prayer to overcome 'same-sex attraction,' the article suggests.\\n\\nThe proposed law further declares that homosexuality is not a disease, disorder, or illness, which implies that the Christian understanding of homosexual desire as disordered is no longer an acceptable position in California.\\n\\nCuriously, the bill does not merely discourage homosexual men and women from seeking reparative therapy but instead will make it illegal, even for those who believe it may be helpful or desirable. Many gays do not seek conversion therapy, but some do.\\n\\nThe potential risks of reparative therapy are great, including depression, anxiety and self-destructive behavior, the bill claims, since such therapy may reinforce self-hatred already experienced by the patient.\\n\\nThe bill seems to ignore a number of studies showing the efficacy of reparative therapy for gays wishing to modify their sexual desires.\\n\\nAs an example, the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH) conducted a survey in 1997 of 882 patients who were believed to have experienced some change in their sexual orientation. Among patients who self-identified as exclusively homosexual before treatment, post-therapy, 18 percent self-identified as exclusively heterosexual, 17 percent as almost entirely heterosexual, and 12 percent as more heterosexual than homosexual.\\n\\nMoreover, contrary to the bill's assertion that reorientation therapy is dangerous to patients' well-being, the survey found that clients had experienced significant improvement in both self-esteem and emotional stability.\\n\\nPrior to 1973, both the American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association considered homosexuality to be a psychological disorder but ended up normalizing homosexuality because of intense pressure by gay-rights activists. No new scientific finding occasioned this shift in position, which was thoroughly political rather than medical.\\n\\nAs Catholic League president Bill Donahue has pointed out, this bill does a disservice to gays seeking counseling, but also threatens free speech at a moment when it is already under siege from the guardians of politically correct groupthink.\\n\\nWhen argument is insufficient to persuade, coercion is the only option.\\n\\nFollow Thomas D.

{"original": "NEW YORK (AP) — Harper Lee, the elusive novelist whose child's-eye view of racial injustice in a small Southern town, To Kill a Mockingbird, became standard reading for millions of young people and an Oscar-winning film, has died. She was 89.\\n\\nLee died peacefully Friday, publisher HarperCollins said in a statement. It did not give any other details about how she died.\\n\\nThe world knows Harper Lee was a brilliant writer but what many don't know is that she was an extraordinary woman of great joyfulness, humility and kindness. She lived her life the way she wanted to – in private – surrounded by books and the people who loved her, Michael Morrison, head of HarperCollins U.S. general books group, said in the statement.\\n\\nFor most of her life, Lee divided her time between New York City, where she wrote the novel in the 1950s, and her hometown of Monroeville, which inspired the book's fictional Maycomb.\\n\\nTo Kill a Mockingbird, published in 1960, is the story of a girl nicknamed Scout growing up in a Depression-era Southern town. A black man has been wrongly accused of raping a white woman, and Scout's father, the resolute lawyer Atticus Finch, defends him despite threats and the scorn of many.\\n\\nThe book quickly became a best-seller, won the Pulitzer Prize and was made into a memorable movie in 1962, with Gregory Peck winning an Oscar for his portrayal of Atticus. As the civil rights movement grew, the novel inspired a generation of young lawyers, was assigned in high schools all over the country and was a popular choice for citywide, or nationwide, reading programs.\\n\\nBy 2015, its sales were reported by HarperCollins to be more than 40 million worldwide, making it one of the most widely read American novels of the 20th century. When the Library of Congress did a survey in 1991 on books that have affected people's lives, To Kill a Mockingbird was second only to the Bible.\\n\\nLee herself became more mysterious as her book became more famous. At first, she dutifully promoted her work. She spoke frequently to the press, wrote about herself and gave speeches, once to a class of cadets at West Point.\\n\\nBut she began declining interviews in the late 1960s and, until late in her life, firmly avoided making any public comment at all about her novel or her career. Other than a few magazine pieces for Vogue and McCall's in the 1960s and a review of a 19th-century Alabama history book in 1983, she published no other book until stunning the world in 2015 by permitting Go Set a Watchman to be released.\\n\\nWatchman was written before Mockingbird but was set 20 years later, using the same location and many of the same characters. Readers and reviewers were disheartened to find an Atticus who seemed nothing like the hero of the earlier book. The man who defied the status quo in Mockingbird was now part of the mob in Watchman, denouncing the Supreme Court's ruling that school segregation was unconstitutional and denouncing blacks as unfit to enjoy full equality.\\n\\nBut despite unenthusiastic reviews and questions whether Lee was well enough to approve the publication, Watchman jumped to the top of best-seller lists within a day of its announcement and remained there for months.\\n\\nMuch of Lee's story is the story of Mockingbird, and how she responded to it. She wasn't a bragger, like Norman Mailer, or a drinker, like William Faulkner, or a recluse or eccentric. By the accounts of friends and Monroeville townsfolk, she was a warm, vibrant and witty woman who enjoyed life, played golf, read voraciously and got about to plays and concerts. She just didn't want to talk about it before an audience.\\n\\nClaudia Durst Johnson, author of a book-length critical analysis of Lee's novel, described her as preferring to guard her privacy like others in an older generation, who didn't go out and talk about themselves on Oprah or the Letterman show at the drop of a hat. According to Johnson, Lee also complained that the news media invariably misquoted her.\\n\\nLee emerged more often over the past few years, although not always in ways she preferred. She was involved in numerous legal disputes over the rights to her book and denied she had cooperated with the biography The Mockingbird Next Door: Life With Harper Lee, by Marja Mills.\\n\\nOther occasions were happier. She wrote a letter of thanks in 2001 when the Chicago Public Library chose Mockingbird for its first One Book, One Chicago program. In 2007, she agreed to attend a White House ceremony at which she received a Presidential Medal of Freedom. Around the same time, she wrote a rare published item – for O, The Oprah Magazine – about how she became a reader as a child in a rural, Depression-era Alabama town, and remained one.\\n\\nNow, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have laptops, cellphones, iPods, and minds like empty rooms, I still plod along with books, she wrote.\\n\\nBy 2014, she had given in to the digital age and allowed her novel to come out as an e-book, calling it 'Mockingbird' for a new generation.\\n\\nA new play adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird will land on Broadway during the 2017-18 season under the direction of Tony Award winner Bartlett Sher, written by Oscar-winner written by Aaron Sorkin.\\n\\nBorn in Monroeville, Alabama, Nelle Harper Lee was known to family and friends as Nelle (pronounced Nell) – the name of a relative, Ellen, spelled backward. Like Atticus Finch, her father was a lawyer and state legislator. One of her childhood friends was Truman Capote, who lived with relatives next door to the Lees for several years. (A book about Lee in 2006 and two films about Capote brought fresh attention to their friendship, including her contributions to Capote's In Cold Blood, the classic nonfiction novel about the murder of a Kansas farm family.\\n\\nCapote became the model for Scout's creative, impish and loving friend Dill. In the novel, Dill is described as a pocket Merlin, whose head teemed with eccentric plans, strange longings, and quaint fancies.\\n\\nLee's friendship with Capote was evident later when she traveled frequently with him to Kansas, beginning in 1959, to help him do research for what became his own best-seller, In Cold Blood. He dedicated the book to her and his longtime companion, Jack Dunphy, but never acknowledged how vital a role she played in its creation.\\n\\nCharles J. Shields, in the first book-length attempt at a biography of Lee, Mockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee, showed how Lee helped Capote gain entrance to key figures in the murder investigation and provided keen observations and myriad notes that Capote wove into his book. (He also debunked a long-standing rumor that Capote had actually written much of Mockingbird.)\\n\\nIn the 2005 film Capote, Philip Seymour Hoffman won the best actor Academy Award for his portrayal of Capote struggling with his demons as he works on the book. Catherine Keener was nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal of Lee. The next year, Sandra Bullock took the role of Lee in Infamous, with Toby Jones as Capote.\\n\\nLee said in the 1960s that she was working on a second novel, but over time it dropped from view and never reached a publisher.\\n\\nLee researched another book, a non-fiction account of a bizarre murder case in rural east Alabama, but abandoned the project in the 1980s.\\n\\nLee, who attended Huntingdon College in Montgomery as a freshman, transferred the next year to the University of Alabama, where she wrote and became editor of the campus literary magazine. After studying to be a lawyer like her father and older sister, Lee left the university before graduating, heading to New York to become a writer, as Capote already had done.\\n\\nLee worked as an airlines reservation clerk in New York City during the early 1950s, writing on the side. Finally, with a Christmas loan from friends, she quit to write full time, and the first draft of To Kill a Mockingbird reached its publisher, J.B. Lippincott, in 1957.\\n\\nThe manuscript, according to the publishing house, arrived under the title Atticus. The title later became To Kill a Mockingbird, referring to an old saying that it was all right to kill a blue jay but a sin to kill a mockingbird, which gives the world its music.\\n\\nLee worked with the editor Tay Hohoff in bringing the book to its final form, a period when Lee was scrimping financially and dealing with the difficulties of rewriting.\\n\\nThough Miss Lee then had never published even an essay or a short story, this was clearly not the work of an amateur or tyro, the editor wrote in an account published by Lippincott in 1967. … She had learned the essential part of her craft, with no so-called professional help, simply by working at it and working at it, endlessly.\\n\\nCapote, in a letter to an aunt in July 1959, said that a year earlier Lee showed me as much of the book as she'd written, and I liked it very much. She has real talent.\\n\\nHer novel, while hugely popular, was not ranked by many scholars in the same category as the work of other Southern authors such as Eudora Welty or Flannery O'Connor. Decades after its publication, little was written about it in scholarly journals. Some critics have called the book naive and sentimental, whether dismissing the Ku Klux Klan as a minor nuisance in Maycomb or advocating change through personal persuasion rather than collective action. The novel was also considered patronizing for highlighting the bravery of a white man on behalf of blacks.\\n\\nO'Connor, in an October 1960 letter, said, I think I see what it really is – a child's book. … I think for a child's book, it does all right.\\n\\nParallels were drawn between Lee and Margaret Mitchell, another Southern woman whose only novel, Gone With the Wind, became a phenomenon and was made into a beloved movie. But Mitchell's book romanticized the black-white divide; Lee's work confronted it, although more gently than novels before and since.\\n\\nLee's book features Scout's often meandering recollection of the people – some eccentric, such as the reclusive Boo Radley – in rural Maycomb County, during the years when her brother Jem reaches adolescence and she enters school. Some critics said it relied at times on stereotypes, such as the mean, trashy whites making false charges against a virtuous black. But the tomboy Scout and the quietly courageous Atticus Finch drew praise as memorable, singular creations.\\n\\nThe book's tension is built around the lynching atmosphere in Maycomb as the black man goes on trial, a scenario reminiscent of the Scottsboro Boys rape case of the same period. Scout, Dill and Jem, whose playful curiosity takes scary turns, witness the drama of an adult world with its own frightening lessons.\\n\\nSurely it is plain to the simplest intelligence that 'To Kill a Mockingbird' spells out in words of seldom more than two syllables a code of honor and conduct, Lee wrote to an editor in the 1960s. Christian in its ethic, that is the heritage of all Southerners."}
{"original": "Telegram surpassed 500 million active users in January, according to a statement from Pavel Durov, the messaging app's founder. Durov noted that 25 million people downloaded the platform in just 72 hours.\\n\\nThe growth of Telegram's user base comes as digital censorship from the world's largest technology companies intensifies. Various news media outlets have linked the growth of Telegram's user base with recent changes to WhatsApp's privacy policy.\\n\\nDurov described Telegram as the largest refuge for people seeking a communication platform committed to privacy and security. He wrote in a post to his platform:\\n\\nIn the first week of January, Telegram surpassed 500 million monthly active users. After that it kept growing: 25 million new users joined Telegram in the last 72 hours alone. These new users came from across the globe – 38% from Asia, 27% from Europe, 21% from Latin America and 8% from MENA. This is a significant increase compared to last year, when 1.5M new users signed up every day. We've had surges of downloads before, throughout our 7-year history of protecting user privacy. But this time is different. People no longer want to exchange their privacy for free services. They no longer want to be held hostage by tech monopolies that seem to think they can get away with anything as long as their apps have a critical mass of users. With half a billion active users and accelerating growth, Telegram has become the largest refuge for those seeking a communication platform committed to privacy and security. We take this responsibility very seriously. We won't let you down. Those of you who have used Telegram for the last several years know we've been consistent both when it comes to defending private data and to improving our apps. For those of you who just joined and are wondering what Telegram stands for, I'd like to quote my post from 2018: You – our users – have been and will always be our only priority. Unlike other popular apps, Telegram doesn't have shareholders or advertisers to report to. We don't do deals with marketers, data miners or government agencies. Since the day we launched in August 2013 we haven't disclosed a single byte of our users' private data to third parties. We operate this way because we don't regard Telegram as an organization or an app. For us, Telegram is an idea; it is the idea that everyone on this planet has a right to be free.\\n\\nTelegram surpassed 500 million active users. 25 million new users joined in the last 72 hours: 38% came from Asia, 27% from Europe, 21% from Latin America and 8% from MENA. https://t.co/1LptHZb9PQ — Telegram Messenger (@telegram) January 12, 2021\\n\\nDurov characterized Telegram's growth as the largest digital migration in human history while highlighting the messaging app's addition of heads of state with their own official channels:\\n\\nSince my last post, the already massive influx of new users to Telegram has only accelerated. We may be witnessing the largest digital migration in human history. Following this global phenomenon, two presidents started their Telegram channels: The President of Brazil – @jairbolsonarobrasil\\n\\nThe President of Turkey – @RTErdogan They join a list of other heads of state already present on the platform: The President of Mexico – @PresidenteAMLO\\n\\nThe President of France – @emmanuelmacron\\n\\nThe Prime Minster of Singapore – @leehsienloong\\n\\nThe President of Ukraine – @V_Zelenskiy_official\\n\\nThe President of Uzbekistan – @shmirziyoyev\\n\\nThe President of Taiwan – @iingtw\\n\\nThe Prime Minister of Ethiopia – @AbiyAhmedAliofficial\\n\\nThe Prime Minister of Israel – @bnetanyahu (Note that such verified accounts typically show a blue check mark in your chat list and search results.) We are honored that political leaders, as well as numerous public organizations, rely on Telegram to combat misinformation and spread awareness about important issues in their societies. Unlike other networks, Telegram doesn't use nontransparent algorithms to decide whether a subscriber will see content they subscribed to or not. As a result, Telegram channels are the only direct way for opinion leaders to reliably connect with their audiences. By removing the manipulative algorithms that have become synonymous with 2010s technology platforms, Telegram channels restore transparency and integrity to public one-to-many communication.\\n\\nLast week, Durov wrote that Telegram's recent growth is partly driven by a flight of users from WhatsApp to Telegram.\\n\\nI hear Facebook has an entire department devoted to figuring out why Telegram is so popular. Imagine dozens of employees working on just that full-time.\\n\\nI am happy to save Facebook tens of millions of dollars and give away our secret for free: respect your users.\\n\\nMillions of people are outraged by the latest change in WhatsApp Terms, which now says users must feed their private data to Facebook's ad engine. It's no surprise that the flight of users from WhatsApp to Telegram, already ongoing for a few years, has accelerated.\\n\\nDurov concluded by warning of disinformation spread about Telegram across social media by bots. We have also detected bots which spread inaccurate information about Telegram on social media, he wrote.\\n\\nDurov added, In 2019 alone, Facebook spent almost 10 billion dollars on marketing (I guess this includes paid bots on Wikipedia and other sites). Unlike Facebook, Telegram doesn't spend any money, let alone billions of dollars, on marketing. We believe that people are smart enough to choose what is best for them. And, judging by the half a billion people using Telegram, this belief is justified."}
{"original": "A leading candidate to take the helm of Britain's drifting left-wing opposition party said she would abolish Britain's Royal Family — before apparently having a change of heart and remarking she'd like to see U.S. television actress Meghan Markle become the British head of state instead.\\n\\nSpeaking in a televised leadership debate with fellow finalists for the Labour Party top job, Lisa Nandy was invited first to respond to whether the candidates would vote to abolish the monarchy if there was a referendum on the matter.

{"original": "Tom Coburn, former Republican senator from Oklahoma, talked about his new book, Smashing the DC Monopoly: Using Article V to Restore Freedom and Stop Runaway Government, on Thursday's Breitbart News Daily.\\n\\nCoburn explained to SiriusXM host Alex Marlow that the D.C. monopoly of the title refers to Washington's outsized role in making decisions for states, municipalities, and even individual citizens.\\n\\nLISTEN:\\n\\nIn New York State, Oklahoma, Kansas, and every other state, if you look at the money raised in-state, an unelected federal bureaucrat tells you how to spend 60 percent of it – how you must spend 60 percent of it, and what the rules are, he explained.\\n\\nHe said this was contrary to the American ideal of individuals deciding their own futures and shaping the future of their communities through city councils and state legislatures.\\n\\nThe way to smash this republic is by using Article V to re-establish and return the Constitution to the relationship that it was intended to be, Coburn said. What that means is a limited federal government with decisions made at state houses and local communities, and the federal government doing what it was supposed to do, the limited role that it's supposed to have.\\n\\nThe assumption of a monopoly usually is, when they have such great power, there's no consideration given for anybody else's thought, he observed. So ask yourself the question, 'How well is Washington working today? How well is Congress working today?' They're not, and the cost to bear them is tremendous.\\n\\nYou know, this monopoly is going to put our kids – I'm talking about the millennials, the largest demographic in our country – the average millennial is on the hook right now for $1,700,000 that will have to be paid back in the next 50 years, Coburn reflected. What I'm talking about is the 50-year unfunded liabilities of Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, disability, military pensions, federal government pensions; it's $144 trillion.\\n\\nIf you think about that for a minute, that's the other thing monopolies do: they spend money with impunity because they're not going to be the ones that have to pay it back, he observed.\\n\\nMarlow noted the political gulf between efforts to reform current spending practices and the almost incomprehensible mountain of unfunded liabilities described by Coburn, which few politicians dare to describe to their constituents, let alone tackle through legislation.\\n\\nI think there's a real simple answer to that, Coburn replied. Most politicians want to get re-elected. They want to be in Washington. So if you start making hard decisions, which is going to cause sacrifice for all of us, they're afraid they won't get re-elected.\\n\\nThe real deficit in Washington is trust, and if you look at Pew's latest research, not many people trust Washington, he observed. Well, the legitimacy of the government depends on trust. The legitimacy of your elected representatives means you trust them to make the hard decisions – even some that are painful to you, if, in fact, the long-term health of our country depends on it.\\n\\nAnd yet, nobody's working on that, he lamented. Why? Because there's not the willpower of the career politicians to do what's in the best interests of the country. They do what's in the best interests of their political career. I saw it in and out for the 16 years I was there, six years as a congressman and then all four years and ten years as a senator. The conflict of interests means we don't have any statesmen, or very few.\\n\\nCoburn recommended invoking Article V as the antidote to voter frustration over the difficulty of reforming the federal government.\\n\\nYou've got a way to fix Washington, and it's a way our Founders gave us, he said. You don't have to be frustrated anymore. What you have to do is come join the millions of us that are going to use this tool to restore the Constitution.\\n\\nHe explained that Article V was born from the Founders' universal awareness that governments rarely give power back to the people voluntarily.\\n\\nThe first portion of Article V was actually about us – giving us a way to restore relationships and balance and power. Then later came allowing that the Constitution could be amended by Congress, he elaborated. What they said in Article V is that if two-thirds of the states call for an identical consideration in identical areas, that the Congress has to call a convention of the states.\\n\\nThe convention of the states is a calling of commissioners from each state to consider whatever that call was in the application made by two-thirds of the states, he continued. And now, that's 34 states. What happens is when you get to 34 states, Congress has to call it. A convention is held and each state sends its delegate, with each state receiving one vote on any matter that is put up there.\\n\\nThe only things that can be discussed are within the application for the convention, Coburn said, addressing a common objection that amending the Constitution would quickly degenerate into a circus in the modern American political environment. The reason that will hold is, number one, they'll use the same parliamentary rules that they use in their state houses, in terms of rules of operating this convention. The second thing is, the federal government is never going to forward something outside of that application to the states for approval because they'll get blocked, and the courts will support that block if that wasn't part of the application.\\n\\nWhatever comes out of there are simply recommendations back to the states that here are the things we think ought to change, and then 38 states have to approve that within seven years. If they do, we have changes, he said.\\n\\nCoburn said his recommended applications for constitutional change are clearly spelled out in the book. Each is intended to give Congress the institutional strength to make changes that politicians are unlikely to agree to independently because of their own political interests.\\n\\nWhy isn't there a balanced budget amendment? he asked. Why aren't we giving backbone to the members of Congress and saying you have to do this? And then they can come home and say, 'I had to; we have a balanced budget amendment with generally accepted accounting principles.'\\n\\nThe second one: there would be limits to the scope and jurisdiction of the federal government. And third would be putting term limits on not just elected, but also appointed federal officials, he added.\\n\\nIf you stay within those three things, you could have amendments that came out of that, and then the states would decide. In other words, we get to decide, and we haven't been deciding. Washington's been telling us what to do. We should be the ones telling Washington what to do. While they've been telling us what to do, they've racked up poverty for our kids and dropped us to seventeenth in the world in terms of economic freedom, he charged.\\n\\nIt's fixable, and the great smile that comes on your face is, you can actually do something about it. You can join this group of millions of people at ConventionOfStates.com and become one of the people that's supporting this movement to rebalance the federal government, rebalance the branches of the federal government, and rebalance the relationship with the states, Coburn said.\\n\\nMarlow asked for a frank assessment of the odds that 34 states would support the reforms Coburn recommends, given our polarized environment of deep blue versus deep red states.\\n\\nI think we'll get to 34. I don't doubt that, Coburn replied. I don't think it has to do with red and blue. It has to do with me deciding versus government deciding.\\n\\nHe proposed that even people in super-liberal Berkeley, California, would likely agree that it was better to make life decisions at the individual and local level, instead of letting Washington decide everything.\\n\\nBesides, there's a fourth estate in Washington that decides everything, and none of them have ever been elected to any job. It's called the bureaucracy, he added. I don't think it's red-blue. I don't think it's conservative-liberal. If you want to restore freedom to America, whether you're on the left or the right, what you want to do is rebalance the relationship between the states and the federal government and rebalance the relationship between the federal government's branches.\\n\\nI don't see that as a problem. Will people say, 'We don't think you ought to have a balanced budget?' Who doesn't think that? What adult doesn't think – I'm talking true adult – doesn't think you shouldn't steal from your kids? That's not controversial, he contended.\\n\\nThe other thing is, do we really want Washington telling the state of California how they'll handle health care? Maybe California could have some good ideas other than what comes out of Washington, he suggested.\\n\\nJust talk about what's going on in Washington today. Nobody's talking about the real things that will fix health care. Isn't that interesting? Nobody in Washington is talking about the real things that will fix health care, Coburn offered by way of example.\\n\\nAmericans pay 33 percent too much for everything they pay for in health care. Everything, he asserted. If you had true price discovery, where you could actually find out what things cost in your community and find out what the outcomes were, then what you would see is people shopping their health care.\\n\\nBut you can't find out what things cost ahead of time. So the real answer to health care is mandate that there be price transparency across the United States, and then let markets work – because they will. We'll see a marked reduction within two years, if we have price transparency, that will cut the cost of health care in this country a third, he predicted.\\n\\nRemember that the big hospitals that are vertically and horizontally integrated are nothing but monopolies. If you go to a hospital parking lot at two o'clock in the morning – I'm talking employee parking lot – and you go to that same parking lot at two o'clock in the afternoon, you'll see five times as many cars. What that tells you is, they're 20 to 30 percent inefficient because almost everything else is operating in the hospital – maybe not at the same level, but not five times less in the middle of the night, Coburn said to illustrate his point.\\n\\nYou have these fat insurance companies, fat in both non-profit and profitable hospitals that aren't driven to efficiency. What they need is competition, he stressed, citing a report from universities and think tanks in April recommending the changes he endorsed for achieving price transparency and encouraging constructive competition in the medical industry.\\n\\nHowever, he said there was little enthusiasm for serious healthcare reform at present because there's too many monied interests in Washington lobbying against real competition, real price transparency, and real quality transparency.\\n\\nCoburn said his Article V coalition now includes 12 states and hopes to add another eight to ten next year.\\n\\nWe've grown to 2.2 million volunteers now, he said proudly. We're trying to move that to five. That's why people listening to you today, if they'll sign up at ConventionOfStates.com, learn about this, they can read this book – all the naysayers, every question that somebody who is worried about this is answered in this book. It gives you a resource of all the background, all the legal cases, all of what our Founders did.\\n\\nThe Annapolis convention of states is what called the Constitutional Convention, he noted. This has been going on in our country for years. Lots of compacts out West were conventions of states. The point is, if you become knowledgeable in it, you'll see this is the answer that our Founders gave us for fixing our country and restoring what is rightfully ours, which is our liberty.\\n\\nCoburn was confident his movement can attract the civic participation it needs, even in an era of short attention spans.\\n\\nI think the point is, when you start becoming impacted personally with a choice, and you can't make a choice that you should be able to make because some federal regulation is impacting you, it doesn't matter whether you're liberal or conservative or red or blue, he said, returning to the polls that show widespread distrust of government, even among an ostensibly left-leaning younger generation widely indifferent to civic education.\\n\\nIt's not about being a political junkie, and it's not about being hooked into this 24/7 news cycle. It's about how do you get to live your life, Coburn said. Most Americans say, 'Just leave me alone. Let me do my thing.' That's getting harder and harder to do. If you have a way to make sure you can do your thing in the future, then you'll become involved in this.\\n\\nCoburn concluded by looking back to an earlier book he authored, The Debt Bomb. That's going to happen to us. Unless we get great leadership, unless we force a balanced budget amendment in Washington, the Great Depression is going to seem like a small burb in terms of how it impacts us.\\n\\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Eastern.\\n\\nListen to the full audio of the interview above."}

It's an incredibly important day for my country, and for the future of the Western world.\\n\\nToday is the day the British government will formally advise the European Union that we intend to leave the EU, after a tumultuous 44-year relationship that culminated in that shock victory for the ordinary man and woman on June 23rd last year.\\n\\nBelieve in Britain.

We might have actually done it', he recalled.\\n\\nAnd honestly, I couldn't believe it.

The Continent turned its back on controlled migration and effective borders; European leaders decided to pursue political, financial, and military union as a new kind of empire, dominated by Germany, with a single currency, a flag and an anthem – so utterly foreign and devoid of all meaning to we British that we found ourselves with no other option but to say 'Nope, not for us. Not anymore.'\\n\\nIn short, our Prime Minister's letter to the European Union today will say, 'Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so great'.\\n\\nKassam also looked forward to a renaissance for the historic Anglo-American friendship, and a renewal of the bonds of loyalty which bind Great Britain to its kith and kin in the Commonwealth of Nations.\\n\\nA new dawn has broken for our pioneering nation and our allies around the world: American, India, Australia, Canada…\\n\\nWe still want to be good neighbours with our European friends, but we don't want to live in the same cramped apartment with them, treading on each other's toes and arguing about what to watch on the television – no.\\n\\nInstead, Britannia and Uncle Sam will be able to stand shoulder to shoulder once again, unimpeded, unencumbered, and free to project the pioneering values we always have throughout modern history: liberty, the will of people, the rule of law, and importantly, alongside all these things, pride.\\n\\nPride in who we are as a people, pride in who we are as a nation, pride in what both we can achieve independently and in free and open relationships that we are not forced to be a part of, but that we choose to be a part of.\\n\\nAddressing listeners in the U.S. directly, Kassam emphasised: Our great nations both underwent major seismic changes last year, ladies and gentlemen, and today, on Article 50 day in Britain, I say this to you: Now marks our greatest opportunity to deliver a better world for our children, and our children's children, than we will ever get again in our lifetimes.\\n\\nHappy Article 50 Day, ladies and gentlemen!"}

{"original": "Pope Francis took a strong stand on anthropogenic climate change Monday, telling a gathering of diplomats in the Vatican that global warming is a result of human action.\\n\\nWe must not downplay the importance of our own responsibility in interaction with nature, Francis told the Diplomatic Corps accredited to the Holy See. Climate changes, with the global rise in temperatures and their devastating effects, are also a consequence of human activity.\\n\\nIn his statement, Pope Francis went beyond earlier declarations that seemed to exclude the Church taking a formal stand on questions of climate science.\\n\\nIn his 2015 teaching letter on the environment, Laudato Si, the Pope explicitly declared that the Church does not presume to settle scientific questions or to replace politics.\\n\\nIn the same text, Francis said that he was encouraging debate rather than trying to impose his own understanding of environmental concerns.\\n\\nOn many concrete questions, he wrote, the Church has no reason to offer a definitive opinion; she knows that honest debate must be encouraged among experts, while respecting divergent views.\\n\\nFrancis also said it is necessary to create a social debate in which of those involved in any way can explain their problems and have access to adequate and reliable information in order to make decisions for the common good, something rarely seen in contemporary discussions of climate change that tend to exclude climate change skeptics.\\n\\nNonetheless, with the passage of time, Pope Francis has seemed to take an ever more decided stance behind the notion of manmade global warming, while sending signals that there was not much room for debate on the issue.\\n\\nIn November 2016, the Pope called climate change skeptics to an ecological conversion, while denouncing what he believed to be a weak reaction from governments to the climate crisis. He also criticized the ease with which well-founded scientific opinion about the state of our planet is disregarded.\\n\\nOn that occasion, the Pope also said that politicians had been distracted in implementing important measures to curb carbon emissions and blamed the sluggish adoption of COP21 protocols on an economy which seek profit above all else.\\n\\nNever before has there been such a clear need for science to be at the service of a new global ecological equilibrium, Francis told his audience, while painting a picture of a world on the verge of ecological collapse and a consequent increase of poverty and social exclusion.\\n\\nIn his address to diplomats Monday, Francis continued along a similar vein, stressing the duty to leave a more beautiful and livable world to future generations and to work, in the light of the commitments agreed upon in Paris in 2015, for the reduction of gas emissions that harm the atmosphere and human health.\\n\\nFollow Thomas D.

{"original": "A new poll set to be released Thursday shows that two-thirds of American veterans and a majority of military families support ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and bringing all U.S. troops home.\\n\\nThe poll, from Concerned Veterans for America/YouGov and obtained exclusively in advance by Breitbart News, shows that 67 percent of veterans would support the president withdrawing all troops from Afghanistan, and 68 percent would support withdrawing all troops from Iraq.\\n\\nA broad majority of military households would also support withdrawing all troops from Afghanistan (59 percent) and from Iraq (61 percent).\\n\\nFifty-four percent of the general public are also in support of withdrawing all troops from Afghanistan, and 53 percent support withdrawing all troops from Iraq.\\n\\nThe poll was conducted between December 22 through January 6 and came after President Donald Trump announced in mid-November he was reducing the U.S. troop presence to 2,500 in both Afghanistan and Iraq.\\n\\nCVA Executive Director Nate Anderson told Breitbart News in an interview that one of the things that immediately jumps out from the polling is the increase of support around individuals who support a full withdrawal from Afghanistan and Iraq from previous years.\\n\\nThe change in opinion over the past couple of years is pretty significant, he said.\\n\\nThe U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan is slated to go down to zero by May if the Taliban adheres to a peace agreement brokered by the U.S., but the agreement's future is unclear under the incoming Biden administration.\\n\\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has said he favors keeping a small footprint in Afghanistan of several thousand people. The poll shows he will have to make an argument as to why he wants a continued U.S. presence.\\n\\nOn foreign policy, they are going to be immediately faced with a decision point — as per the U.S.-Taliban agreement in Doha, where we're looking at a drawdown deadline early this spring, and so they need to decide if that's something they're going to keep faith with, Anderson said.\\n\\nAnd the public's opinion around our continued involvement after 20 years in Afghanistan is no secret at this point, he added. I can't tell you what's going to happen if they decide that a presence and involvement in Afghanistan or Iraq is going to continue … they have to make a very strong compelling case if they decide if that was the best thing for the administration to pursue.\\n\\nThe poll also showed there was a plurality of support from veterans, military families, and the general population for a more diplomatic versus a military approach to Iran. That could be good news for the Biden administration, which wants to reduce tensions with Iran.\\n\\nThe poll also found that veterans and military households see access to health care as their top concern and support being able to use VA health care benefits outside of the VA system, as was allowed under the VA MISSION Act. A large majority — 87 percent — supported being able to do so, even if it cost a little more out of pocket.\\n\\nNine out of 10 veterans feel that they want healthcare choice from the VA. That's something that's consistent over the past several years, he said. Add to that the fact that health care was one of the most important issues when polled to this community.\\n\\nVast majorities of the veteran, military household, and general population polled also saw federal government spending of taxpayer dollars and the $27 trillion dollar debt as a threat to national security.\\n\\nIn regard to defense spending, majorities in all camps thought it should be decreased or kept about the same.\\n\\nThe incoming Congress and the executive administration are going to have to make some significant decisions that will also carry significant implications, not just for the veteran community but for the whole country and that's why it's important to look at these opinions, because these are the people who are most deeply affected by these issues and that's a good indicator for policy makers as they make decisions, Anderson said.\\n\\n20210113 CVA Survey by Kristina Wong on Scribd\\n\\nFollow Breitbart News's Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook."}

I have my own beauty ideal and want to achieve that no matter what… I want to have my ears cut to become pointy like an elves, my jaw to look more sharp like a diamond, a face-lift and an eye-lift to give my eyes a cat-like shape.\\n\\nI am also consider having muscle implants too, he continued, adding that There's also a surgery to make you taller and I will remove four of my ribs too, so that I can shape my waist to make it thinner.\\n\\nPeople have stared at me ever since I was a teenager, so it's very normal to me now. I like people staring at me and don't care what they think, Padron declared. Even when I'm not dressed up like an elf people stare at me. I have had long white hair for five years, I use larger contact lenses and I am very tall. I use make-up to enhance my features so they are more angelic and wear clothing that's more stylish or antique.\\n\\nThis isn't a phase or a cosmetic decision, though, according to Padron.\\n\\nI consider myself trans-species, in the same way transgender people feel, I need to become how I feel inside, I don't expect people to understand but I ask they respect it, he claimed. The fantasy genre makes me happy and because I didn't have many friends when I was younger I submerged myself into it.\\n\\nI was bullied as a child and as an escape I would submerge myself in fantasy movies like Labyrinth and The NeverEnding Story, as well as other fantasy tales. Over time things changed, older teens liked me because I was unique and that's what encouraged me to start turning what I felt on the inside into a reality, claimed Padron. I started with cosplay but it wasn't enough, I wanted to change to become my own perception of beauty. It was the start that led me to decide this was the direction I wanted my life to go in, the recovery was painful and slow but I was happy with how I looked.\\n\\nPadron, who started surgery at twenty-years-old, claims that he wanted to go through cosmetic changes ever since he was fourteen.\\n\\nI didn't care for how much it hurt, because it allowed me to get one step closer to my dream of what I want to become, he proclaimed.\\n\\nAfter undergoing the medically unapproved eye color-changing surgery, which was performed without anesthesia, Padron was forced to use eye drops and wear black sunglasses to combat the extreme photosensitivity side-effects, which he claimed made even watching stars in the sky painful for days after the operation.\\n\\nI don't consider this an obsession, but in fantasy you have all of the hope, love, friendship and good feelings, Padron concluded. This helps me to feel like a good person but in fantasy you have to be beautiful not only on the inside but the outside too. This has changed my life for good in so many ways, I can't even begin to describe it.\\n\\nCharlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

After headscarves, burkas, mosques, honour killings, terror, comes the taharrush.\\n\\nIn the Netherlands, like in the United Kingdom, pepper spray is currently illegal.

{"original": "TEL AVIV – In the wake of the Brussels terrorist attacks, which a former security chief at Israel's Ben-Gurion Airport termed a colossal failure of Belgian security, the world is looking to Israel as a model.\\n\\nAuthorities in Europe and across the world are tightening security at airports, railway stations, government buildings, and other critical sites after the deadly attacks Tuesday on the Brussels airport and metro that killed 34 people.\\n\\nEuropean leaders held emergency security meetings to toughen security measures, deploying more police, explosives experts, sniffer dogs, and plainclothes officers.\\n\\nPini Schiff, the former head of security at Israel's Ben-Gurion Airport, which is considered among the most secure in the world, said the chances are very low that the bombing could have happened in Israel.\\n\\nTwo terrorists who enter the terminal area with explosive devices, this is undoubtedly a colossal failure, Schiff said.\\n\\nFollowing attacks on Israeli planes by Palestinians in the 1970s, Israeli officials implemented several layers of security at the airport in Tel Aviv.\\n\\nThe Obama administration is expected to announce new measures to tighten U.S. airport security. So far, the country's largest cities have been put on high alert and authorities deployed the National Guard to local airports in New York City.\\n\\nAccording to the Associated Press, some analysts say Europe will finally have to implement a much tougher level of security not only at airports, but also at soft targets like shopping malls — the kind that Israelis have been living with for years.\\n\\nThe threat we are facing in Europe is about the same as what Israel faces, said Olivier Guitta, the managing director of GlobalStrat, an international security consultancy.

{"original": "The first woman to wield the gavel of the House of Representatives is on track to secure it for a second time on Thursday, as a rebellion against her from within her own ranks was crushed from election day until now.\\n\\nAs the onset of the 116th Congress approaches, convening at noon on Thursday, Jan. 3, 78-year-old Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is the only declared Democrat candidate for Speaker of the House. Barring any unforeseen circumstances or last-second shenanigans by Democrat rebels against her, Pelosi will win back the Speaker's gavel on Thursday afternoon–putting her in the driver's seat on negotiations with President Donald Trump on everything from the ongoing government shutdown to major federal policy decisions on just about every issue.\\n\\nPelosi served as Speaker from January 2007 until the beginning of January 2011, for two Congresses when Democrats held the majority at the end of the George W. Bush administration and beginning of the Barack Obama administration, but she has been stuck in the minority since Republicans took control of Congress in the 2010 midterm elections.\\n\\nThe GOP held control in the House for eight long years, first with former Rep. John Boehner (R-OH) as Pelosi's immediate successor as Speaker and then, after Boehner lost an internal Republican Party rebellion of his own with soon-to-be-former Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), as Speaker.\\n\\nFor nearly a decade, Pelosi clung to hopes of a return to power from her perch as Minority Leader–the head of the House Democrat Conference–but nearly was denied the opportunity when her massive unpopularity forced Democrat candidates to pledge opposition to her Speakership candidacy in exchange for support from the public. According to NBC News, a whopping 58 Democrats–11 incumbents and 47 new candidates who won their party's nominations for House seats–pledged campaign trail opposition to Pelosi's re-ascent to the Speakership.\\n\\nThere are technically two votes for the Speakership. The first is in conference, where members of a party select whom their candidate will be. Democrats already selected Pelosi as their conference's candidate with a late November vote of 203-32 with three blank ballots and one absent member. The second, and more consequential, vote is on the floor of the House of Representatives. The first order of business of a new Congress is for the House to elect a Speaker. So, when the 115th Congress disbands and the 116th Congress is sworn in, before the House can do anything else, the chamber must elect a Speaker.\\n\\nFor a candidate to win the Speakership of the House, that person must receive a majority of those present and voting for a person. Members of Congress can vote for formally introduced candidates–for Democrats that will be Pelosi and for Republicans that will be Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), the current Majority Leader who will become the House Minority Leader on Thursday when Democrats take over–or they can vote for someone not listed. The candidate can be a member of the House, but does not have to be–the Constitution is very nonspecific on the requirements for candidates for election to be Speaker of the House–though there has never been a Speaker who is not a member of the House.\\n\\nFor someone to win the vote, they need to win a majority of those members who voted for a candidate. Voting present technically is a thrown-away vote, as it does not count toward the number of votes cast for candidates, and thereby lowers the total threshold. Assuming all 435 members of the House are present and vote for a candidate, that would mean the winner needs 218 votes. If anyone is absent or votes present and not for a candidate, that lowers the number of votes a winner needs one member for each two members voting present or absent from the vote.\\n\\nIf no candidate wins a majority on the vote, the voting goes to a second round–and third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, et cetera–until a majority of the House elects a Speaker.\\n\\nIt is in this vote that Pelosi faced the most potential peril before now. After the midterm elections, when it was clear Democrats were taking the majority in the House next year, 17 Democrats banded together to sign a letter pledging to oppose Pelosi, not just in the intra-conference vote but on the floor of the House as well.\\n\\nWe promised to change the status quo, and we intend to deliver on that promise, the 17 Democrats wrote in their letter. Therefore, we are committed to voting for new leadership in both our Caucus meeting and on the House floor.\\n\\nThe incoming House Democrat majority will have 235 members, while Republicans will have 199 members and there will be one vacancy in North Carolina's yet-to-be-resolved ninth congressional district. That means if those 17 had held together and added one more to make their number 18, they would have had the votes to stop Pelosi from ascending to the Speakership at least on the first ballot–forcing a chaotic process and at least a second ballot.\\n\\nBut in the lead-up to, and aftermath of, the intra-conference nominating vote, Pelosi maneuvered swiftly to win several of those critics back.\\n\\nThe highest profile signer of the letter was former Congressional Black Caucus chairwoman Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-OH), who had even publicly floated potentially running against Pelosi. But, within a week of Fudge's opposition to Pelosi becoming public and an interview she gave considering a Speakership bid herself, Fudge completely reversed course and actually endorsed Pelosi for Speaker.\\n\\nHow that happened is one for the ages: All of a sudden, when she opposed Pelosi, a letter she wrote seeking a lenient sentence for a Cleveland-area disgraced former judge convicted of beating his wife resurfaced. The timing could not have been better for Pelosi: that same judge had just been arrested on suspicion of brutally stabbing his wife to death after release from prison on the domestic violence charges for which Fudge sought a more lenient sentence for him. The judge has since been formally charged with his wife's murder, and pled not guilty, and Fudge's nascent bid for the speakership ended before it even took off. She dropped out of the running, took a token subcommittee chairmanship, and then endorsed Pelosi for speaker.\\n\\nNext, Pelosi flipped Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) with a promise to focus on his priorities of healthcare and infrastructure–things Pelosi already planned to do anyway.\\n\\nThen came the big guns: With a loose promise that the 78-year-old Pelosi would term limit herself, something she intended to do anyway, Pelosi flipped another group of rebels into backing her. Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-CO), a senior leftist Democrat from Colorado who had previously been quoted in Politico publicly organizing against Pelosi, flipped and endorsed her, thereby rescinding his signature on the letter.\\n\\nSo did another leader of the rebellion: Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH) backed off his opposition to Pelosi with that deal:\\n\\nAfter he signed a letter vowing to vote against her, Democrat Rep. Tim Ryan says he will now support Rep. Nancy Pelosi for Speaker of the House. https://t.co/1dfiIdJqJd — Kyle Morris (@RealKyleMorris) December 13, 2018\\n\\nNow, Ryan says the Democrat conference is unified behind her:\\n\\nWATCH: @RepTimRyan (D-OH), who had previously called for new leadership, said that House Democrats are absolutely united behind Pelosi. https://t.co/K4ekX13crl — NTK Network (@NTKNet) January 2, 2019\\n\\nRep. Seth Moulton (D-MA), who called for Pelosi to step aside in a CNN op-ed and was one of the most public organizers of the seemingly failed coup attempt, also flipped and backed her candidacy. Several of the other signers, including Reps. Stephen Lynch (D-MA), Filemon Vela (D-TX), Linda Sanchez (D-CA), and Bill Foster (D-IL), also flipped with the term limits pledge.\\n\\nSome of the other signers–and others who pledged to oppose Pelosi but did not sign the letter, which was circulated by Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-NY)–are still in opposition to Pelosi. But without the core of their group, which Pelosi won back, the rebels likely do not have the votes to stop her from winning the gavel.\\n\\nit still remains to be seen what happens on the floor of the House on Thursday afternoon, and anything could go wrong for Pelosi before the vote happens, but for now it looks like she maneuvered her way through this rebellion and completed one of the biggest political comebacks in history against all odds."}

{"original": "On Thursday's Breitbart News Daily, Prof. John Banzhaf of the George Washington University School of Law, who provided early and consistent warnings that the American election system is vulnerable to hacker attack, discussed the Department of Homeland Security's disturbing admission that hackers targeted 21 states during the 2016 election.\\n\\nBanzhaf said the news has yet to bring him apologies from those who dismissed his warnings as groundless conspiracy theories before the election.\\n\\nThese were not just suggestions or polite warnings. What I wrote on Breitbart is, 'Warning: this presidential election could be hacked, perhaps by a foreign power! A hacker with off-the-shelf malware can steal more votes than any corrupt politician!' he said of his efforts to highlight the hacking threat.\\n\\nThere were a half-dozen by me. There were dozens of others, he recalled. Not only were they ignored, but government officials actually came on and ridiculed them. They said, Oh, it couldn't possibly happen.' And they gave crazy explanations. They said, 'Oh, it can't happen because we have the Electoral College. We have diversity. We have all these different voting precincts.'\\n\\nIt now appears, of course, and this is based upon my calculations, that it's easier to influence the election under the Electoral College than it would be if we had direct elections, he contended.\\n\\nBanzhaf further argued that we still do not know exactly how many hacking attempts were launched against the electoral system.\\n\\nThey said that they've now detected 21. Three other major news outlets have reported that the number is closer to 39. One of the things we know about hacking is if you are a successful hacker, they never find out if you changed. So we know, whether the number is 21 or 39, that they didn't target this number. They were successful in a number of situations in getting in. We don't know how many they got in, as compared with simply 'targeting.' Even that phrase is a little bit unclear. But if they were good and if they were successful, we wouldn't know, he said.\\n\\nOh, and by the way, would they tell us? he added. Just suppose for a minute that they now had evidence that in two or three key states, somebody – we now know it's the Russians – could have changed enough votes to change the outcome of the election. Do you think they're going to come out now and say that?\\n\\nRemember the testimony yesterday. They didn't want to reveal the risk of hacking because they didn't want people to lose confidence in the electoral process. Well, if you come out now and say, 'Hey, maybe Trump is legitimate, maybe not, we don't know' – I don't think they're ever going to say that, even if they knew it, he argued.\\n\\nBanzhaf said it was known long before the election that at least two states had been hacked.\\n\\nNow, I pointed out that they used COTS, which is common off-the-shelf hacking tools. I even named some of the programs and some of the places where anybody, some high-school kid could go and download a program which would allow them to hack. And still, it was ignored, he lamented.\\n\\nPerhaps more importantly, I suggested – and others suggested; I wasn't the only one – there were things that we could do, and we probably, at this point, should be seriously considering doing them, to prevent this kind of hacking, he continued.\\n\\nFor example, there are a lot of voting machines out there which do not provide what we call a paper trail or audit credibility. In other words, we can't go back and track it. We can't test it. So you've heard the old expression 'garbage in, garbage out?' Well, with these systems, it could be 'mystery in, mystery out.' We have no way of checking what they're doing, he warned.\\n\\nThere are people who have shown that in systems that use voting cards, you get a little card like a credit card, and you stick it into the machine. A hacker can reprogram that credit card so when he goes into that voting booth, puts the card in and pushes a button, instead of one vote for Hillary or for Donald, it becomes a hundred votes for Hillary or for Donald, he said.\\n\\nIncreasingly, we have computers on the Internet, and one thing we all know now for sure is that if any computer, any data processing device is on the Internet, it can be hacked, Banzhaf pointed out. They've hacked the Pentagon. They hacked Sony. They've hacked many major corporations. If they can hack the Pentagon and Sony, are you going to tell me they can't hack some little system off there in Chicago or something in the boondocks of Kansas?\\n\\nThese are things we ought to be seriously considering, he advised. Also, of course, more periodic testing, having some system where these computer systems and voting systems, electoral systems in the various states are periodically tested for problems and leaks, and then presumably corrective action is taken.\\n\\nToday, it's largely up to the local officials – some might say the local yokels. And again, they're not as sophisticated as the Pentagon, he noted.\\n\\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern."}

{"original": "VALDOSTA, Georgia — South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem told Breitbart News exclusively here that whoever wins the Georgia Senate runoffs will directly impact mothers across the state and the country.\\n\\nNoem's interview came during a campaign stop here in downtown Valdosta at Jessie's Restaurant after she met with GOP voters as part of an effort to turn out the vote for Sens. David Perdue (R-GA) and Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) in Tuesday's upcoming runoffs. The Wednesday interview, which aired on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel, came after she spoke and took questions from local GOP voters gathered in the restaurant. One of Noem's daughters joined her for the event. Perdue and Loeffler face Democrats Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock respectively in Tuesday's runoff elections.\\n\\nMost of the mothers in this country are juggling a lot of different responsibilities, Noem told Breitbart News when asked to put in context what is at stake for mothers in Georgia and nationally in this race. They have a lot on their plate. Many of them are working, many of them are taking care of elderly parents, many of them are paying the bills, and many of them are making healthcare decisions—all of those are impacted by who we elect and who we put into the U.S. Senate. David and Kelly have fought to make sure we keep more money in our pockets. If people vote for Warnock and Ossoff to go to Washington, DC, they will raise taxes. They have endorsed the Green New Deal which means four to five years from now we will have $4 to $5 a gallon gasoline. That will make budgets even tighter, and people will have less money. Our food will be more expensive in the grocery stores. Healthcare decisions would be made by the government. These are very clear facts that Warnock and Ossoff have embraced and said they will do openly and publicly. They also have a fundamentally different viewpoint of this country, and Warnock especially has had the opportunity to denounce Marxism and socialism and he did not do that. So, that's the real life choices that I think women and moms are dealing with here in this election cycle, and they need to recognize not only does it change the direction this country is going but it will change their everyday decisions and what resources they have to take care of their families even six months to a year from now.\\n\\nNoem won Moms for America's Mother of Influence award in December 2020, as Breitbart News reported.\\n\\nSouth Georgia is a long way from South Dakota, and Noem told Breitbart News she made the trip down here to explain to voters how serious this election is and what is on the line for them—and for the people of South Dakota and nationally.\\n\\nI came to Georgia today because leadership has consequences and this is a big election on Tuesday, Noem said. Who Georgia elects to put in the U.S. Senate will have consequences. What gets decided here will impact the people of South Dakota and will impact the country. So I came here to remind people about the differences in these candidates and asking them to vote for David and Kelly. They have proven themselves to the people of Georgia and that they will get up every morning and fight for communities, for families, to protect our freedoms and make sure America stays as special as she has always been. What concerns me is all the emotion in the race and the anger and the division, and I think people are getting distracted by that and not focusing really on the facts, so what I'm asking people here today at every stop I've been at is to do more. Go out and talk to people who disagree with them and have an honest conversation free of emotion, free of anger. Listen to them and then give them the facts about how different these candidates are and the different viewpoints they have for this country.\\n\\nNoem also lit into both of the Democrat candidates, each of whom has deeply troubling revelations emerging about their backgrounds. Warnock, a radical leftist, has made a number of highly offensive and radical comments over the years including praising Rev. Jeremiah Wright and Louis Farrakhan and his church hosting Cuban dictator Fidel Castro. His background also includes evidence of child abuse at a church camp he ran, and police video that recently emerged from a domestic disturbance with his wife.\\n\\nOur history tells our story, especially if we don't acknowledge it or talk about a change in viewpoint and be honest about where we are today. It really tells you about what you're dealing with in the future, and I think that's the concern with Warnock, Noem said. He's had all these public declarations for embracing socialism and embracing Marxism, and he will not say he's had a change of heart. He will not say that he believes he was wrong. He will not say in all of these personal issues he's had in the past that he's changed his ways or even acknowledge that he is on a different path. So that's some very clear testimony to people across the state, that he is doing what politicians do best, and that is putting a good spin on the kind of person he really is. He's never held public office before so when he gets to Washington, DC, he's not going to even necessarily know how to be a U.S. senator and will clearly follow the direction of his leader. His leader is going to be Schumer. That's concerning to us that we would be putting somebody there who is going to be following what Pelosi's agenda is, and what Schumer's agenda is and be falling right in line with what Kamala Harris would want to see in the White House. That is not true with David or with Kelly. Kelly is the American dream—she grew up on a farm, like I did, she ran businesses, she's been successful, and she's gone there and proven to us with her votes that she's going to continue to give moms and women the opportunity to create a future for their kids and grandkids like we all enjoyed. So you look at the past history of who these people are and if they have proven to you that they are the kind of person who you can get behind and the only person who's done that in this race is Kelly.\\n\\nAs for Ossoff, Noem said that given his ties to the Chinese Communist Party—ties he originally did not disclose but has since revealed in financial disclosure documents—it makes no sense for Georgians to vote for him especially given the fact that the coronavirus pandemic originated in Wuhan, China.\\n\\nIt doesn't make any sense to me, Noem said. We all know that China is not our friend. We all know that they are out to destroy this country. Anybody who has done business with them in the way that he has and then tried to cover it up and to keep the truth from the public should not be trusted with a seat in the U.S. Senate. That's just factual and the vast majority of people understand that. He clearly does not have America's future in mind when he does business dealings like that and when he is trying to keep the truth from the people.\\n\\nLISTEN TO GOV.

{"original": "Brazil inaugurated Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right conservative who campaigned on a platform of smaller government and fighting socialism, as its president on Tuesday. In his first speech in office, Bolsonaro urged Brazilians to dream while remaining vigilant of the threats of socialism.\\n\\nI stand before the entire nation today, the day in which the people began to free themselves of socialism, the inversion of values, state maximalism, and the politically correct, Bolsonaro declared, opening a speech heavy on Christian references and optimistic in tone. We cannot allow nefarious ideologies to come and divide Brazilians – ideologies that destroy our values and traditions, destroy our families, the foundations of our society.\\n\\nI am also here to renew our hopes and remind everyone that, if we work together, this change will be possible, he assured the public, noting that his sound defeat of socialist Workers' Party (PT) candidate Fernando Haddad in October's presidential election gave voice to those that went unheard, and the voice of the streets and the ballots were very clear.\\n\\nThe former Congressman and army captain repeated his campaign slogan – Brazil above everything, God above everyone – and addressed the green and yellow Brazilian flag.\\n\\nThat is our flag, which will never be red. It will only be red if it is necessary for our blood to keep her green and yellow, he declared.\\n\\nOn the issues facing Brazil, Bolsonaro focused on corruption, widespread crime, education, and the sluggish economy, hindered by over 16 years of socialism under the PT. He suggested that his administration would not shy away from using our abundant mineral resources, our fertile lands bless by God, and our marvelous people to enrich society.\\n\\nBrazilians can and should dream, he suggested. Dream of a better life, with better conditions to enjoy the fruit of their labor through meritocracy. And of a government that is honest and efficient.\\n\\nHe noted that his campaign was the cheapest successful one in history, an allusion to his lack of connections to the Brazilian political establishment. While Brazil has dozens of active political parties, three to four of them typically control Congress and the presidency. Bolsonaro's Social Liberal Party (PSL) is not one of them.\\n\\nBolsonaro also vowed to prioritize basic education, the right to property and legitimate defense – a reference to his support for individual gun ownership – and to value police and other rescue workers.\\n\\nHe ended his speech by thanking God for being alive and you all who prayed for me and my health in the most difficult moments.\\n\\nBolsonaro nearly lost his life in an assassination attempt in September. During a campaign rally in Minas Gerais, one of Brazil's poorest regions, a man later identified as a self-declared socialist stabbed Bolsonaro in the abdomen. The then-presidential candidate was forced off the campaign trail and endured multiple sensitive surgeries to reconstruct his digestive tract, which the assailant had slashed through. The man arrested for the crime told police that he was ordered by God to kill Bolsonaro.\\n\\nBolsonaro's survival has heralded in a pro-American, anti-socialist government in Brazil dedicated to reducing the size of government and reconstructing diplomatic ties with capitalist nations. Following his inauguration, Bolsonaro and his senior cabinet members met with American Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to discuss bilateral ties and, in particular, how to address the failed state of Venezuela, which borders Brazil and sends thousands of refugees into the country on a daily basis.\\n\\nBolsonaro told Pompeo – speaking captain to captain, as both held the title in their respective militaries – that he hopes to see the U.S. and Brazil become closer friends, while Pompeo relayed that President Donald Trump is very pleased with the relationship that our two countries are on the precipice of beginning to develop.\\n\\nDomestically, Bolsonaro has vowed to eradicate government corruption, a widespread concern following the revelations of Operation Car Wash, a police investigation that revealed an intricate scheme to overpay private corporations on public infrastructure programs. Part of the extra cash went back into the hands of the politicians that made the deal possible, including former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, currently serving a 12-year prison term for corruption.\\n\\nBolsonaro made the judge responsible for most of the Operation Car Wash indictments, Sergio Moro, his new minister of justice. During remarks following his installation as minister, Moro vowed that Brazil will not be a safe haven for terrorists, nor will the nation ever return to denying cooperations to countries who demand it on corruption cases.\\n\\nBrazil's O Globo newspaper notes that Moro faces a crippling budget at the Justice Ministry and the wrath of a variety of criminals, organized crime syndicates, and allies of powerful corrupt politicians in his campaign to bring them to justice. Among Moro's most pressing concerns is Brazil's lack of specific anti-corruption laws, which politicians often use to get free after getting caught. To fix that problem, the newspaper notes, Moro needs Congress to legislate the laws his needs into reality – a difficult task given that even the nation's House Speaker went behind bars for his role in Operation Car Wash.\\n\\nIt will be a long and difficult road, O Globo notes. Bolsonaro will already have to lend his political capital to advance the economic agenda in Congress Corruption stands to take a back seat to a litany of more pressing problems to legislators.\\n\\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."}

{"original": "This past weekend brought the world another banned missile launch from North Korea followed by another emergency UN Security Council meeting. Another round of diplomatic tough talk and sanctions is surely on the way.\\n\\nOn February 12, North Korea launched a Pukguksong-2 intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM). A decade of sanctions has not deterred the Hermit Kingdom from pursuing its goal of developing long-range, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) with nuclear warheads which could target the U.S. homeland. Yet, the Trump Administration has an opportunity to escape from the tit-for-tat cycle of following each North Korean missile test with yet more ineffectual sanctions.\\n\\nPresident Trump should order the Secretary of Defense to position American assets and shoot down Kim Jong Un's next missile launch. Intercepting a North Korean missile would signal to Pyongyang that America has the capability and the willingness to defend our allies and the homeland. In the parlance of military strategy, the missile defense option enhances deterrence-by-denial. North Korea is more likely to be deterred from developing missiles if robust, layered missile defenses deny them any strategic benefit from striking first. The only two alternatives are preemptive offensive action and, of course, more strongly worded UN Security Council resolutions and toothless sanctions.\\n\\nIn July 2006, North Korea abandoned seven years of good-faith multilateral negotiations by testing seven ballistic missiles – including the Taepo Dong-2 nuclear-capable ICBM. Shortly thereafter, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1695 condemning the launches and demanding that Kim Jong-Il's regime returns to multilateral talks and the previous launch moratorium.\\n\\nNorth Korea has responded subsequently by conducting over 30 banned missile launches and nuclear tests. Like clockwork, the United Nations and the United States responded to these violations with over 20 actions to establish, expand, or reaffirm sanctions. This weekend's missile test followed the latest UN Security Council Resolution (2321) enacted in November 2016. Clearly, a decade of sanctions has not changed Pyongyang's behavior. While the diplomats tussle in Turtle Bay, North Korea's missile and nuclear programs move steadily forward.\\n\\nCleary, U.S. and international diplomatic and economic instruments of power are insufficient – even combined with allies and partners. Continually signaling impotence weakens the trust of Japan, South Korea, and the American people.\\n\\nSo, what change is needed? Should we pursue diplomatic efforts? Yes. Should we enhance economic sanctions? Yes. It's time to back up those options with a credible show of defensive military force.\\n\\nCan America's armed forces actually hit a bullet with a bullet? Absolutely. Led by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), the U.S. military has constructed a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) over three decades. The BMDS represents an integrated and layered network of sensors (ground-, sea-, and space-based), interceptors (ground- and sea-based), and command-and-control nodes that provide an umbrella of protection from inbound ballistic missile threats.\\n\\nThe Aegis BMDS system would likely be used to defeat a North Korean threat. Aegis is a combination sensor-shooter system capable against short- to intermediate-range ballistic missile threats for regional defense. The system also supports homeland defense through its detection and tracking capabilities. The United States has 16 Aegis BMD ships assigned to Pacific Fleet complemented by Japan's four deployed Aegis BMD-capable KONGO Class Destroyers. Since 2002, Aegis BMD has a stellar test record — 34 hits (3 with Japanese KONGOs) and only 6 misses. Aegis is well suited to shoot a Pukguksong-2 or Musudan out of the sky.\\n\\nAmerican taxpayers have provided more than $180 billion to the MDA since 1985, including more than $16 billion for Aegis. It's time to put the hard-earned treasure of the American taxpayer to work.\\n\\nAbsent use of defensive intercept, the military alternative is preemptive strike to take out North Korean missiles on the pad. Incidentally, two former Secretaries of Defense – Ashton Carter and William Perry – recommended preemptive strike a decade ago. The difference today is that operational missile defenses provide the option to reinforce deterrence and assure allies without necessarily escalating to offensive action.\\n\\nPresident Trump should direct Secretary of Defense James Mattis to posture our ballistic missile defense forces in the Pacific theater to intercept any and all future North Korean ballistic missile launches. A forceful military response – backing up diplomacy and sanctions – may help deter further ballistic missile and nuclear development.\\n\\nCongressman Jim Bridenstine, a Republican, represents Oklahoma's First District and serves on the House Armed Services Committee.

{"original": "Beijing has begun sacking local officials in Hubei province over the coronavirus outbreak, including two Communist Party officials who left a teenager with cerebral palsy without care for six days while his family was placed in quarantine. The teenager died as a result of this neglect.\\n\\nThe South China Morning Post reported on Thursday that the victim, Yan Cheng, was 16 years of age at the time of his death. The government of Hongan county, where he lived, issued a report on Saturday that said village officials and local doctors did not try their hardest to fulfill their duty of care and responsibilities for him. The mayor of Huajiahe village and its Communist Party secretary were fired, while a number of other officials were told to expect disciplinary measures.\\n\\nShortly before Yan Cheng died, his quarantined father Yan Xiaowen was confirmed to be suffering from the Wuhan coronavirus.\\n\\nI have two disabled sons. My older son Yan Cheng has cerebral palsy. He cannot move his body, he cannot speak or look after himself. He has already been at home by himself for six days, with nobody to bathe him or change his clothes and nothing to eat or drink, Yan Xiaowen wrote on social media on January 28. His plea for help was later deleted.\\n\\nAnother post on social media from a support group said Cheng's aunt was struggling to take care of him, but she was too sick to render all of the care he needed. After Cheng died, Chinese internet users expressed fury at the officials who failed to take proper care of him.\\n\\nHu Lishan, deputy secretary of the Communist Party in the city of Wuhan, apologized on Wednesday for the shortage of treatment options and hospital space.\\n\\nThe public has criticized us a lot … Why? It was because some of our work was not done well. What have we not done well? At present, the contradiction between supply and demand of hospital beds has remained conspicuous, Hu conceded at a press conference.\\n\\nHonestly, we are in pain and feel regrettable that a lot of the patients who have been confirmed infected or were suspected to have contracted the coronavirus were unable to receive proper treatment at hospitals.

He was still giving press conferences the following weekend, so he does not seem to have landed the role just yet.\\n\\nThe Chinese people are not only displeased with the government's handling of the virus outbreak but of the secondary economic crises radiating from it, as quarantines and travel restrictions hammer businesses and leave workers without income.\\n\\nWhile the central government issues improbably rosy projections about economic resilience and sustained growth, the truth reported by the South China Morning Post (SCMP) on Thursday is that small- and medium-sized Chinese businesses are forecasting revenue losses of up to 50 percent in the coming year, while over half of larger firms expect revenue losses of 20 percent or more, and 22 percent of them are already planning to cut payrolls due to the Wuhan virus epidemic.\\n\\nChinese workers know what that means for their future. The SCMP reported:\\n\\nOn China's Twitter-like Weibo, a woman living in Shenzhen said her anxiety about her financial future was greater than her worry about contracting the virus. With most people staying home to avoid contracting the virus, her husband, a taxi driver, was no longer able to earn enough money to cover the expense of renting the taxi, let alone make enough to support the family. The rent for their home, though, and the fee for her son's kindergarten tuition were still due, even as food prices had grown more expensive due to supply shortages. Living like this is too difficult. My husband goes out [to work] every day and is worried about getting infected with the virus. Still, he has to go out due to the pressures of life. We didn't return to my hometown for the [Lunar New Year] holiday this year [to stay and] make more money. Now we have to take money from our own [savings] to pay for the taxi rental fee, she wrote. A small-business owner said he lost all his money during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak of 2002-2003, but worked hard for more than a decade to save and was finally able to open a furniture factory in 2018, and his business was beginning to prosper before the coronavirus hit. Do I have to be a loser all my life? he lamented.\\n\\nAnalysts warned the SCMP about the danger of Chinese migrating to urban areas in pursuit of job opportunities, only to find themselves stranded as employers cut back or close down, and coronavirus travel restrictions make it difficult to return home."}
{"original": "Talk of sex change is a scientific misnomer, argues philosopher Ryan T. Anderson in a recent article, since it is impossible to change someone's sex by bombarding them with hormones or performing cosmetic surgery on them.\\n\\nA person can pretend to be a member of the opposite sex, Dr. Anderson notes, but it will never be more than play-acting since one's biological sex is a physical reality outside the individual's control.\\n\\nModern science shows that our sexual organization begins with our DNA and development in the womb, and that sex differences manifest themselves in many bodily systems and organs, all the way down to the molecular level, Anderson writes.\\n\\nBecause biological sex is a result of genetic makeup, determined by chromosomal configuration, medicine cannot turn a girl into a boy.\\n\\nCosmetic surgery and cross-sex hormones can't change us into the opposite sex, Ryan writes. They can affect appearances. They can stunt or damage some outward expressions of our reproductive organization. But they can't transform it. They can't turn us from one sex into the other.\\n\\nAccording to Dr. Lawrence Mayer of the Department of Psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, science is not on the side of the transgender movement.\\n\\nScientifically speaking, transgender men are not biological men and transgender women are not biological women. The claims to the contrary are not supported by a scintilla of scientific evidence, he said.\\n\\nSo contrary to the claims of activists, sex isn't assigned at birth, and therefore it can't be reassigned, Anderson writes.\\n\\nIn his 2018 book When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment, Anderson argues against the modern ideology that people can become members of the opposite sex just by willing it, while also documenting the grave harm that can come to people—especially children—because of transgender ideology.\\n\\nSex is a bodily reality that can be recognized well before birth with ultrasound imaging, he writes. The sex of an organism is defined and identified by the way in which it (he or she) is organized for sexual reproduction.\\n\\nAfter all, Anderson contends, what else does it even mean to say that a person is male or female? If gender identity is unrelated to your sexual makeup, the labels make no sense whatever.\\n\\nThat organization isn't just the best way to figure out which sex you are; it's the only way to make sense of the concepts of male and female at all. What else could 'maleness' or 'femaleness' even refer to, if not your basic physical capacity for one of two functions in sexual reproduction? he writes.\\n\\nThere simply is no spiritual existence of maleness or femaleness unrelated to the physical body, since that is where sexual differences reside.\\n\\nWhereas transgender activists will often speak derogatorily of biological sex, this is the only kind of sex there is.\\n\\nFollow Thomas D.

Comparing that with Nancy Pelosi tearing up President Trump's speech Tuesday, Mr Farage said: she made herself look even worse than the president of the European Parliament. Bad behaviour! What she was doing was dishonouring the occasion, dishonouring herself, and dishonouring the position of speaker.\\n\\nTelling the convocation they were living through extraordinary times of change where the established post-war order of nation-states handing over their sovereignty to supranational bodies was finally going into reverse, Mr Farage said there was further good news on the horizon, but it needed good people to act to defend liberty in order to secure it.\\n\\nNigel Farage said:\\n\\n…we've beaten them over Brexit, and in November 2020 Donald Trump will beat them in your presidential election. Be in no doubt. Tony Abbott is the former Prime Minister of Australia. He said last week that Brexit was the biggest geopolitical event since the fall of the Berlin wall. You are living through extraordinary times. For decade after decade, big multinational business working with big banks and big politics have tried to create, piece by piece, supranational government. Almost global government. They've taken the power away from you the voters and given it to the bureaucrats. And all of this has suited big businesses and heavy regulatory regimes because it makes it for free-market capitalism. It makes it hard for men and women who want to get out there to give it a go. Bureaucracy has been triumphing over democracy, and the nation-state has found itself subservient to a higher national order. …The nation-state is winning and you are living through a massive historical change. All of that order is going to be swept away — I haven't finished. I've got the United Kingdom out of the European Union, but I won't settle until I've got the whole of Europe out of the European Union.\\n\\nChannelling American conservative media icon Andrew Breitbart — as Mr Farage is sometimes known to — the Brexit veteran told listeners to smile and be happy in their work. In other words, be a happy warrior. Shortly before he was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws by the universiry, Mr Farage told the audience:\\n\\nPlease don't forget to smile. Be happy in whatever you do. Do you see those people going into the offices in Washington every day? All those people who work for the deep state? They all look miserable! We need to be happy… you've got to take pride in yourselves, pride in your faith, pride in your family, pride in your country. …What I've learned since 2016, since the greatest democratic exercise in the history of my country was nearly overturned by those who disrespect what we've done. What I've learned is if you want to be free people, if you want to live in liberty, if you want to be able to determine your own futures, you cannot take these freedoms for granted. You have to fight for these freedoms, and fight for them every day of your lives. Good always triumphs over evil, but we have to stand up and fight for good, and go on fighting for good."}

She took a swan dive in Iowa, coming in third behind Boy Mayor and Jurassic Marxist, and she's currently polling in the low teens in New Hampshire, where she could come in fourth behind Pete Buttigieg (who's surging), Bernie Sanders, and even Burisma Joe Biden.\\n\\nIn other words, because her presidential aspirations are almost certainly dead, it's safe for Politico to pose as objective journalists with a hit like this. In fact, if Trump is to be defeated, what the Democrat Party needs now more than anything is some clarity in the nomination, and Warren dropping out will bring that clarity a little closer.\\n\\nAnyway, this is the environment minorities face when they go to work for a white woman who spent 40 years posing as a minority:\\n\\nA half-dozen women of color have departed Elizabeth Warren's Nevada campaign in the run-up to the state's caucuses with complaints of a toxic work environment in which minorities felt tokenized and senior leadership was at loggerheads. The six staffers have left the roughly 70-person Nevada team since November, during a critical stretch of the race. Three of them said they felt marginalized by the campaign, a situation they said didn't change or worsened after they took their concerns to their superiors or to human resources staff. … [A] recently departed staffer, also a field organizer, granted anonymity because she feared reprisal, echoed that sentiment. I felt like a problem — like I was there to literally bring color into the space but not the knowledge and voice that comes with it, she said in an interview. She added: We all were routinely silenced and not given a meaningful chance on the campaign.\\n\\nTalk about bad timing…\\n\\nThis is all happening in Nevada, which holds its caucus in 15 days, and as Politico correctly points out, if Warren is wiped out in New Hampshire, her likely last chance will be Nevada.\\n\\nWorse still, Nevada has a large Hispanic vote. So how well will this story go down with a Democrat base in Nevada, a base obsessed with identity politics.\\n\\nThe story also plays into Warren's biggest weakness, the fact that she is widely seen as a phony. As Bernie has surged ahead of Warren, gobbling up the far-left vote, Warren has gone on a Woke Crusade to try and woo everyone back. She's moved right into Crazytown, thanking illegal immigrant for working on her campaign, pushing the Trayvon Martin Hoax, declaring that transgender children will have approval over her education secretary…\\n\\nSo while Warren is pandering to minorities in public, in private, and by her own admission, her campaign is treating minorities like tokens.\\n\\nAnd already Team Trump is trolling her:\\n\\nGood grief, if her own campaign can't treat people like actual human beings, how is Warren equipped to run an entire country?\\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Bevo's handlers were quick to say that the steer is as docile as a lamb and that [h]e was just going to say hi, and that may be true. Steers, like all animals, are individuals with unique personalities. It's quite possible that Bevo was simply scared by the noise, lights, and chaos in the stadium and tried to flee from the confines of his makeshift pen. But that doesn't change the fact that Uga or any of the humans standing nearby could easily have been trampled and killed. This frightening near-tragedy is yet another example of the reason most colleges and professional sports teams retired their live-animal mascots decades ago—and the handful who haven't yet should quickly follow suit. Live animals used as mascots, such as Baylor University's bears and the University of North Alabama's lions, are held in captivity and often denied the opportunity to fulfill many of their most basic instincts. They're frequently carted around to sporting events and public appearances, which are confusing and frightening for them. Human mascots can engage with sports fans, pose for pictures, lead cheers, and pump up their teams and fans much better than a terrified animal can. They're also much less expensive for schools, and some universities offer scholarships for student mascots. If your favorite team is still forcing live animals to serve as mascots, please send a polite e-mail to its fundraising or community-outreach committee urging it to use willing human participants instead.\\n\\nAs the Georgia fan site Dawg Nation reports, the Uga mascot line started in 1956, and the canine attends all UGA home games, many away games, and other school-related events.\\n\\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn"}

Chris Christie, have appealed the sentences they received for their role in the Bridgegate scandal in 2013.\\n\\nBaroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Kelly, Christie's deputy chief of staff, were convicted in 2016 and sentenced to prison in the case. Prosecutors said the staffers created traffic jams in Fort Lee, N.J., by way of the George Washington Bridge, as political retribution for its Democratic mayor for not supporting the Republican Christie's gubernatorial bid.\\n\\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit upheld the convictions, ruling Kelly and Baroni engaged in deception when they fabricated a study to justify changing traffic patterns.\\n\\nIn their appeal to the Supreme Court, Kelly and Baroni argue that while their conduct may have been petty, sensitive and Ill-advised, it did not constitute fraud because the Port Authority's power to change traffic patterns is not a property interest for the purpose of fraud statues.\\n\\nThey fear the convictions could set a precedent to allow any government official to be charged with fraud for misrepresenting the reasoning behind their decisions.\\n\\nProsecutors say Kelly and Baroni were properly convicted — not because they hid their motive, but because they lied about the traffic study and Broni did not have authority to close lanes.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court will seek to determine whether Kelly and Baroni committed a federal crime, which could alter the way federal investigations are conducted moving forward.\\n\\nThe high court will hear arguments in the case Tuesday.\\n\\nBabb vs. Wilke\\n\\nDr. Noris Babb, a clinical pharmacist at the Department of Veterans Affairs, has appealed to the Supreme Court to rule she was a victim of age discrimination at the hands of her employer.\\n\\nBabb sued the VA for making a series of decisions that affected her job duties, pay and opportunities for advancement but the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the VA, ruling that she could not show her age was the reason behind the decisions. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit upheld the ruling.\\n\\nThe decision was based on a difference in the language of the Age Discrimination Employment Act's federal sector provision from the private-sector version. The federal provision states that employment decisions must be made free from any discrimination based on age while the private-sector version prohibits employers from discriminating against any individual … because of such individual's age.\\n\\nIn her appeal, Babb says the difference in the statutes indicates the federal hiring process should be free from any age discrimination regardless of whether it is dispositive.\\n\\nShe also notes that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Civil Service Commission agree that the federal government violates the statutes any time it considers prohibited characteristics, such as age in an employment decision.\\n\\nArguments in the case will be heard Wednesday.\\n\\nThole vs. U.S. Bank\\n\\nTwo participants in U.S. Bancorp's pension plan, James Thole and Sherry Smith, sued the bank after fiduciaries invested 100 percent of the plan's assets in equities, which they argue caused the plan to lose $748 million more during the financial crisis than it would have lost had they been diversified.\\n\\nThey filed a lawsuit under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act after the losses caused the plan's assets to fall to 84 percent of the minimum funding level required by the law. The suit also says U.S. Bancorp invested about $1.2 billion in mutual funds offered by a subsidiary it owned for its own benefit.\\n\\nA district court ruled the claims were moot under both ERISA and Article III of the Constitution after U.S. Bancorp sold the subsidiary, made a contribution that increased the plan's assets above the statutory minimum and the fiduciaries diversified the investments.

He reached the Pro Bowl in 2012, led his team to the postseason, and also earned the 59th perfect game in NFL history.\\n\\nBut even after suffering a concussion on the field during a preseason game and then sitting out the 2015 season, Griffin insisted he is in great shape and looking forward to being a Browns starter this coming season.\\n\\nI feel great, Griffin said. God has been good throughout the years. Maybe I'll write a book about it later, but right now, I'm not focused on that kind of stuff. I'm just really happy to be feeling good and moving forward.\\n\\nWith the Browns' terrible record with quarterbacks recently, RG3 could be a welcome change, but even he noted his career has slipped.\\n\\nSpeaking of where his career has ended up of late, Griffin said, I just feel like we've got a lot of work to do – I know that – to not only get back to where I was personally in 2012 but to where we want to be as a team and where I want to be as a professional. I'm ready to work. I've never been afraid of that. I look forward to being able to do that with my teammates coming up on April 4.\\n\\nRG3 went on to praise Browns head coach Hue Jackson for his excitement for the game and his proven track record working with quarterbacks.\\n\\nJackson also noted his excitement over the signing.\\n\\nWe are excited about Robert joining the Cleveland Browns, Jackson said on Thursday. He brings starting experience to our team and organization. He's a young, athletic, talented passer and he's really just starting out in this league. Just like every player on our team, Robert will have to earn every opportunity he gets. He will compete with the rest of the quarterbacks on our roster and he helps improve our QB room, which was one of my goals upon taking the job. It's a special room and we want to put special people and players in that room.\\n\\nWe are excited to add Robert to our team, Browns Executive Vice President of Football Operations Sashi Brown said during the announcement. Robert possesses a unique skill set at the quarterback position. He has played at a high level in this league and is intent on doing everything in his power to return to that level on a consistent basis. After meeting with him, having him work out for us and doing our diligent research, we felt it was right to grant him an opportunity with our organization.\\n\\nWe were able to see and feel his passion and commitment to re-establishing himself as a starting quarterback in this league and his embrace of the hard work that will be is essential to his development. We've been clear on the importance of improving and stabilizing the quarterback position for our franchise. We have said that the draft is and will be our primary focus, but we will always look to complement the draft through free agency, and this is one of those examples.\\n\\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com"}
{"original": "Prime Minister Theresa May has (narrowly) survived the vote of no confidence and delivered another of her bullish speeches about how the people voted for Brexit and how Brexit is what she plans to deliver.\\n\\nOverwhelmingly, the British people want us to get on with delivering Brexit, and also address the other important issues they care about. But the deal I've worked to agree with the European Union was rejected by MPs and by a large margin. I believe it is my duty to deliver on the British people's instruction to leave the European Union and I intend to do so, she tells us.\\n\\nDon't believe a word.\\n\\nIf the woman is not actually lying she is impossibly deluded. We know this because instead of going on to announce the only possible thing that could deliver Brexit — allowing Article 50 to run its course on its appointed date in March 29th, enabling Britain to have a clean break from the EU on World Trade Organization terms with a No Deal — she is putting the decision to Parliament so that it can act in the national interest, reach a consensus and get this done.\\n\\nSince Parliament is overwhelmingly Remain and wouldn't know what the national interest was if it burned down the Palace of Westminster, this means that Brexit is now dead in the water.\\n\\nThe people voted for Brexit. Parliament — the institution that the people imagined represented their interests — has now wrested that Brexit away from them. This is an affront to democracy which will never be forgiven and the consequences will be far more dire than anything that might have been caused by a No Deal Brexit.\\n\\nIf this sounds unduly pessimistic, consider the leaked conference call by Chancellor Phillip Hammond to a bunch of crony capitalist, Davos-style, corporate bigwigs — business leaders, as they're usually described by the BBC — in which he reassures them that No Deal just isn't going to happen.\\n\\nOne of the bigwigs had a conscience and leaked the conversation to the Telegraph. Here is Hammond languidly announcing how he and his fellow Remainers are planning on killing Brexit:\\n\\nIf necessary go back to the EU to agree changes that are necessary to deliver that consensus. And at that time, if more time is going to be required, to negotiate that with the EU. The second question is whether we can somehow take the option of No Deal off the table. Everyone on the call will be aware that a bill has been tabled today and amendments will be tabled on Monday by backbenchers from across the House which would have the effect of removing the threat of No Deal. I can simply as a parliamentarian say it is clear to me there is a large majority in the Commons that is opposed to No Deal in any circumstances.\\n\\nLet that sink in, as Paul Joseph Watson might say: opposed to No deal in any circumstances.\\n\\nThe markets (which think like rampant Europhiles, greeting every betrayal of Brexit with bizarre delight) seem to agree that this is the most likely option — hence the recent rise of the pound.\\n\\nAccording to Jeremy Warner in the Telegraph:\\n\\nThe Brexit dream is over — in any meaningful sense, at least. That was the clear and unambiguous message from markets this morning, which cynically marked the pound up sharply in response to Britain's seismic political crisis, and they are probably right. You might have thought the correct response would have been the other way around, but no, markets are betting that Theresa May's crushing defeat makes a no-deal Brexit less likely, and either a much softer Brexit — Norway Plus — or no Brexit at all, the overwhelming odds-on end game.\\n\\nSo is there any hope left for Brexit? Possibly.\\n\\nSome Brexiteers have got so desperate that they believe their only hope is to support the enemy's proposal for a second referendum, which they believe Leave would win.\\n\\nYes, Leave would win if the terms were the same: In or Out.\\n\\nBut you can bet that the terms instead would be rigged against Leaving. Perhaps a choice between a variation on Theresa May's rejected Withdrawal Agreement and begging the EU to take us back. So, a choice between In and Even more in.\\n\\nIn any case, what an affront it would be to the democratic process if votes won by clear majorities — as was the Referendum vote of 2016 — are not considered meaningful or binding and have to be re-run until the Establishment gets the result it wants!\\n\\nWhich leaves one other option, as proposed by Leave stalwart and formerly Labour MP Gisela Stuart, now chairman of Change Britain.\\n\\nShe is clear on where we stand:\\n\\nThe public voted to Leave in 2016. Remain campaigners keep telling us that it was not clear what leaving meant but the Remain campaign itself seemed perfectly clear. Coming out of the EU would mean leaving the Single Market and the Customs Union. To think that the vote was for anything else is either delusion or deception. Parliament needs to wake up to this reality and accept that Brexit will happen. There has been no significant change in opinion since 2016. The public still want to Leave, including 70 percent of Conservative voters. But Parliament still sees Brexit as an illness requiring a cure. Staying in the European Economic Area with a customs union, effectively remaining in the EU, may have support in Parliament as a path of least resistance but it does not have support in the country.\\n\\nAnd she has what I agree may now be the only solution:\\n\\nMore than ever we need to find ways to come together and heal division and build a new politics closer to the interests and lives of ordinary people, where control is less in the hands of a privileged few. That has to start with a change in our politics, which is failing our country. There is a way to get a change in leadership in Government and in Parliament. It is the normal and accepted way to resolve a political crisis and that is to hold a general election. This is now probably the best way forward for the country.\\n\\nIt's terrible that it has come to this. But there it is. Only a general election can now save Brexit."}

Bannon that there is a gradual awakening to the reality that the new contours aren't going to make possible this seven percent year-on-year-on-year-on-year-on growth that our CIA and international financial markets and Chinese planners thought was going to be the basis for the Asian Century.\\n\\nI don't think it's going to happen because they don't have the human ingredients for it, he said.\\n\\nRegarding China's one-child policy that former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping instituted over three decades ago, Eberstadt said that while lots of people were talking about the liberalization of China and the economic reforms under Deng Xiaoping, the heart of the society—the basic unit of society is the family—and the claim that the government has the right to decide how many babies parents have is much more totalitarian than anything that Lenin even planned.\\n\\nSo the idea that Deng Xiaoping was going to transform the Chinese family and calibrate the Chinese family to perfect this future economic paradise of course has ended in a disaster, he said. What else could it end in?\\n\\nChina ended its one-child policy in favor of a two-child policy last year because it feared the country's aging population could lead to a massive economic slowdown.\\n\\nEberstadt said that there will be a lot of downward pressure on economic growth rates in China, which may still be very fast compared to a lot of the rest of the world.\\n\\nBut the problem, according to Eberstadt, is our financial system and our businesses have banked on an unrealistically high permanent growth rate in China.\\n\\nAs for why America's financial industry and intelligence agencies have overestimated China's growth potential, Eberstadt said that it's the easy temptation to think that tomorrow is going to be just like today plus two percent. Growing in a straight line. But straight lines don't happen in history when you actually look at it, he said.\\n\\nEberstadt added that people in politics usually do not pay attention to demographics and are obsessed with what happens in the next 24 hours.

Most of the members will be allotted in proportion to the number of delegates the candidates win over the course of the primaries and caucuses.\\n\\nHowever, there are a very small number of appointments of allies to Sanders, according to DNC member Yasmine Taeb.\\n\\nThe appointments also include individuals that are outright hostile to Bernie Sanders and his supporters, she said, according to the Hill.\\n\\nIt's not the message the DNC should be sending to the grassroots right now when we're all working aggressively to defeat the racist in the White House, she added.\\n\\nIt's very disappointing to see Chairman Perez build a list of this magnitude, Sanders' national co-chair Nina Turner said in an interview with Status Coup's Jordan Chariton, calling the DNC's move an embarrassment.\\n\\nThe DNC should be ashamed of itself because it really is a slap in the face to folks what we're asking for reform, she continued.\\n\\nIf the DNC believes it's going to get away in 2020 with what it did in 2016, it has another thing coming, she warned:\\n\\nBoth Podesta and Frank have a documented history of bias against Sanders. WikiLeaks, for instance, exposed Podesta's bias against Sanders, as Breitbart News detailed in 2016:\\n\\nIn a February 2016 email exchange between John Podesta and Joel Johnson, former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton, Johnson suggests that Podesta needs to crush Bernie Sanders and leave him ground to a pulp, in an email with the subject line Friendly Advice. No Mercy. Bernie needs to be ground to a pulp. We can't start believing our own primary bullshit. This is no time to run the general. Crush him as hard as you can, Johnson said in an email in February this year. Podesta responded by saying that he agrees with that in principle, asking Johnson where he would like to stick the knife in. Johnson's suggestions for crushing Sanders included attacking Sanders as an Obama betrayer, hapless legislator, a false promiser, and pointing out that he can't win.\\n\\nFrank, the former Massachusetts lawmaker, also has also publicly questioned supporters of Sanders in the past, attributing his support to a lack of information.\\n\\nI think it is a lack of information, to be honest, Frank said of Sanders' support in an interview with MSNBC in 2016.\\n\\nYou have people, I believe, who do not understand how hard it is to make change. [It is] the importance of not just being idealistic, but being sensibly pragmatic and keeping their ideals. Sanders is getting their support, he added.\\n\\nMeanwhile, some DNC members are bothered by the DNC appointing committee members who, they say, do not reflect the party's grassroots members:\\n\\nDemocratic National Committee chair Tom Perez issued a list of individuals he nominated for the 2020 Democratic National Convention committees. Let's examine some of the individuals. I'll initially focus on the nominees for the DNC Platform Committee. Thread. pic.twitter.com/fVm41YClJQ — Kevin Gosztola (@kgosztola) January 25, 2020\\n\\nMore via the Hill:\\n\\nDNC officials said state party members will make up a far greater share of the committees once delegates are allocated and each candidate's supporters take their spots alongside the appointed members. On Sunday, DNC members from California sent a letter to Perez asking that paid employees or consultants to the presidential campaigns be excluded from the rules committee. And some DNC members complained that they were only alerted to the appointments late on Friday ahead of the executive committee's Saturday vote. Some members derisively referred to the appointments as the midnight convention committee picks.\\n\\nThe DNC is supposed to provide resources and a platform for state parties, California DNC member Michael Kapp said, according to the Hill. But if we are consistently being excluded from the table, how are state parties supposed to feel?\\n\\nThe 2020 Democratic National Convention will take place July 13-16, 2020."}
{"original": "The first quadriplegic to experience limb reanimation is Ian Burkhart, courtesy of a cutting-edge chip that bypasses his spinal cord altogether.\\n\\nWhen Burkhart broke his neck while diving, he lost all feeling in both his arms and legs. In any other time in history, that would simply have been a tragic end to the story of a promising young man with all of his life ahead of him.\\n\\nBut just this past Wednesday, doctors reported that a chip implanted in his brain gave back control of his right arm and hand. The chip was connected to a sleeve on his arm, and, with practice, Ian was able to pick up and pour from a bottle, stir with a straw, and even play a bit of Guitar Hero.\\n\\nWithout actual sensation in the hand, Burkhart had to concentrate and pay attention to when he was contracting and releasing his fingers in order to use them. And for now, the limb reanimation is only functional when attached to a machine. Still, it's an important leap forward in the quest to cure paralysis. In the future, the evolution of this technology could be used to return near-complete limb usage to those otherwise bound to a wheelchair for life.\\n\\nRajesh Rao, Director of the Center for Sensorimotor Neural Engineering at the University of Washington, is very optimistic about the future use of this technology:\\n\\nIt's quite impressive what they've shown, this sequence of movements to pick up and pour something and pick up a stirrer — it's an advance toward a goal we all have, to provide as much independence to these patients as possible.\\n\\nBurkart's willingness to participate in the experiments were challenged by his family, who were uncertain that the medical risks involved were worth the potential rewards. Aside from the obvious dangers involved in the installation and extraction of the chip, there was no guarantee that the progress made would directly benefit Ian at all. Ian's father Doug Burkhart says that he was doing it for the general good, to move the science along.\\n\\nBut Ian would not be dissuaded from what he sees as an essential need for progression in helping people like [him]. In his words, why not try? And that's exactly what they did, on the back of a determination that Doug likens to Ian's grandfather:\\n\\nHe's one of those people, he's driven, he's decisive, once he makes a decision, he sees it through and doesn't look back. He was going to do what he wanted to do.\\n\\nLike previous advances that have allowed people to control everything from computers to flying drones with their minds, the chip in Burkhart's brain took specific nerve signals for limb movement and translated them directly from his brain to a sleeve that offered control of his right hand.\\n\\nThe doctors worked for an hour and a half just to find the right place to insert the 96 microelectrode chip, but that was barely the beginning. Progress in the usage of the limb took weeks. Burkhart spent hours with a cable connected to his skull, reading the firings of neurons in his brain through the chip.\\n\\nAs he learned, those signals changed, requiring near-constant recalibration. According to Battelle research leader Dr. Herbert Bresler, The signal changes constantly as learning happens, and we had to adjust to those changes. The machine learned as Ian Burkhart learned.\\n\\nIt was a grueling year of training before Ian could perform the simple act of pouring himself a drink and stirring it. For a long time he was straining to imitate the movements portrayed by an on-screen avatar, but the young man approached it like a sport. You work, and gradually it gets easier, he said.\\n\\nOhio State, Battelle, and private donors have kept the project alive thus far, but the money is almost gone. Without additional support, Burkhart will return to the life to which he has been sentenced by circumstance.\\n\\nIf I could take the thing home, it would give me so much more independence. Now, I've got to rely on someone else for so many things, like getting dressed, brushing my teeth — all that. I just want other people to hear about this and know that there's hope. Something will come around that makes living with this injury better.\\n\\nRegardless of Ian Burkhart's immediate future, his determined efforts and hard work have paved the way for advancements that could change the lives of countless other people. He may have only poured himself a drink, but he poured it like a hero.\\n\\nFollow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both."}
{"original": "Moon Jae-in, the new president of South Korea, campaigned on renewing dialogue with North Korea and adopting a less confrontational stance than his impeached predecessor, Park Geun-hye.\\n\\nHe also clearly gave the impression he would be less confrontational than the United States has been of late. However, on Wednesday President Moon said, there is a high possibility of a military conflict with North Korea.\\n\\nNorth Korea launched a missile four days ago and claims to have succeeded in launching an intermediate-range ballistic missile, said Moon, speaking at the South Korean Defense Ministry. Launching ballistic missiles is a serious provocation that violates UN Security Council resolutions, as well as being a serious challenge to global peace and stability. We will never tolerate such North Korean provocations and nuclear threats.\\n\\nHe promised to sternly deal with the North, together with the international community.\\n\\nMoon made his comments hours after his government restated its desire to resume dialogue with North Korea and three days after North Korea's latest provocative missile test. Reuters notes that the test was detected by the up-and-running components of the THAAD missile shield, which North Korea and its patron China strongly oppose, in part because its sensory systems are so powerful.\\n\\nThere seems to be a convergence of opinion between the Moon administration and the United States since Moon has qualified his call for moderation toward North Korea by asking for some concessions from Pyongyang to get talks restarted. The U.S. has said North Korea must abandon its nuclear weapons program entirely; Moon said, North Korea must change its attitude of insisting on pressing ahead with its arms development before dialogue is possible, as Reuters puts it.\\n\\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley put the American position in forceful terms on Tuesday: We have to turn around and tell the entire international community: You either support North Korea or you support us.\\n\\nThe United States is not past looking at third-country entities who are helping North Korea and putting sanctions against them. If you're supporting North Korea, you're against the rest of the international community, said Haley, as the U.N. debated its response to the latest North Korean missile launch.\\n\\nHaley said the U.S. was still working on persuading China and Russia to support stronger sanctions against North Korea, to which end she pointedly reminded Russia that the North's latest missile test had reached close to Russia's border, as the New York Times puts it.\\n\\nRussia nevertheless seems determined to protect North Korea, as Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted that intimidating Pyongyang was unacceptable.\\n\\nFor their part, the North Koreans showed little sign of giving President Moon the change in attitude he is looking for. The North ignored international condemnation of its missile test, which demonstrated some disturbing advances in long-range missile technology, and insisted it would conduct ICBM tests anytime and anywhere, in accordance with the decisions made by our central leadership.\\n\\nAnother development that may complicate Moon's plans for renewed dialogue with North Korea is the massive cybercrime attack against computer systems across the world this weekend. Evidence has been found implicating hackers linked to North Korea in the attack.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, the New York Times quoted cyber security experts who described these hackers as a type of sleeper cell planted in various Asian nations in what amounts to war contingency planning in case the homeland is attacked. Some of these sleeper-cell hackers have secured information technology jobs abroad, after receiving advanced computer training at Russian, Chinese, and Indian schools.\\n\\nNYT sources speculated the WannaCry ransomware attack might have been timed to coincide with last weekend's missile launch as a demonstration of North Korean power, or possibly even as pushback against China, which has been applying an extraordinary amount of pressure against its client state in Pyongyang of late.\\n\\nSouth Korea's Yonhap News notes that Moon has promised to increase South Korea's defense budget from the current 2.4 percent of GDP to 3 percent. In his remarks about North Korea on Wednesday, Moon stressed the importance of having defense that is not only in words but in real capability."}

Two factors are said to have played a critical role in the signing of the deal, namely China's desire to ink a deal before President-Elect Joe Biden assumes the White House and a push from German Chancellor Angela Merkel to secure a deal prior to the end of Germany's term as the head of the EU presidency in December.\\n\\nThe deal — which was not done in consultation with the United States — is seen as a big diplomatic loss for the incoming Biden administration, which had promised to develop closer ties with the EU to counteract the rise of China as opposed to President Trump's tougher unilateral approach.\\n\\nPrior to the signing of the agreement, Mr Biden's national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, had said that the administration would welcome early consultations with our European partners on our common concerns about China's economic practices.\\n\\nGermany has become increasingly tied with the communist regime, with China becoming the country's largest trading partner in 2018, with some €200 billion in trade.

{"original": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — The organization that bestows the Academy Awards announced Thursday that it has voted to expel two prominent members convicted of sexual offenses, Bill Cosby and Roman Polanski, from its membership.\\n\\nIt's the first major decision since the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences implemented revised standards of conduct for its over 8,400 members following its expulsion of disgraced mogul Harvey Weinstein in October. In Polanski's case, the expulsion comes more than 40 years after he was accused of raping a 13-year-old girl he plied with champagne and Quaaludes during a photo shoot, and 15 years after he won a best director Oscar.\\n\\nThe academy wrote in a statement that its board of governors met Tuesday night and voted on Polanski and Cosby's status in accordance with the new standards. Polanski's membership dates back to 1969, and Cosby's to 1996.\\n\\nPolanski, who won a best director Oscar for 2002′s The Pianist, remains a fugitive after pleading guilty to unlawful sex with a minor in 1977 and fleeing the United States the following year. Cosby was convicted last week of sexual assault in Pennsylvania, for drugging and molesting Temple University employee Andrea Constand at his suburban Philadelphia mansion 14 years ago.\\n\\nRepresentatives for Cosby and Polanski did not immediately return messages seeking comment.\\n\\nIn a statement, the film academy said its board continues to encourage ethical standards that require members to uphold the Academy's values of respect for human dignity.\\n\\nAdopted in December, the code of conduct stipulates that the academy is no place for people who abuse their status, power or influence in a manner that violates standards of decency.\\n\\nThe academy's board may now suspend or expel those who violate the code of conduct or who compromise the integrity of the academy.\\n\\nBefore Weinstein, only one person is thought to have been previously expelled from the academy: Carmine Caridi, a character actor who had his membership revoked in 2004 for lending DVD screeners of films in contention for Oscars that ended up online.\\n\\nThe film academy came under intense scrutiny following Weinstein's expulsion and the rise of the #MeToo movement for some of its active members, like Cosby, Polanski and Mel Gibson. It even became late-night fodder for people like John Oliver. Because its members are not made public, occasionally incorrect assumptions are made about who are part of the organization. Woody Allen, for one, is not.\\n\\nPolanski has been one of the more divisive members of the organization for years. At the 2003 ceremony, Polanski's win — his first — received a standing ovation. He was not in attendance. He'd previously been nominated for writing his adaptation of Rosemary's Baby, and directing Chinatown and Tess.\\n\\nProminent actors like Kate Winslet, Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly continued to work with him, and in 2009, when Polanski was arrested in Zurich and U.S. authorities attempted to extradite him, more than 100 celebrities signed a petition for his release, including Allen, Weinstein, Martin Scorsese, Darren Aronofsky, David Lynch, Penelope Cruz and Tilda Swinton.\\n\\nNatalie Portman recently told BuzzFeed that she regretted signing the petition.\\n\\nWe lived in a different world, and that doesn't excuse anything. But you can have your eyes opened and completely change the way you want to live, Portman said. My eyes were not open.\\n\\nThe film academy has faced a number of challenges in the Time's Up era, including the question of whether or not Casey Affleck would present the best actress Oscar this past March in accordance with tradition. Affleck, who settled a pair of civil lawsuits accusing him of sexual harassment in 2010 during the production of the mockumentary I'm Still Here, bowed out of the task himself early in the year. Jodie Foster and Jennifer Lawrence ended up presenting the award instead.\\n\\nWhile this year's Oscars ceremony and host Jimmy Kimmel did not shy away from addressing the movement, it also awarded former Lakers star Kobe Bryant, who in 2003 was accused of raping a 19-year-old hotel employee in Colorado, with an Academy Award for the animated short Dear Basketball. He admitted to a sexual encounter with the woman, but denied the assault allegation and criminal case was dropped after Bryant's accuser refused to testify. She later filed a civil suit against him, which was settled out of court and included Bryant's public apology to her, although he admitted no guilt.\\n\\nIts president John Bailey also recently faced an allegation of sexual misconduct, but was cleared after a committee and an outside law firm investigated the claim and unanimously voted that no other action was required and that Bailey would remain in his position."}

{"original": "The medical community is far too unconditionally affirmative in its treatment of rapid onset gender dysphoria (ROGD), a Wall Street Journal op-ed argued Sunday, making ROGD an anomaly among social contagions.\\n\\nUnlike traditional gender dysphoria, a psychological affliction that begins in early childhood and is characterized by a severe and persistent feeling that one was born the wrong sex, writes Abigail Shrier, ROGD is a social contagion that comes on suddenly in adolescence, afflicting teens who'd never exhibited any confusion about their sex.\\n\\nUnlike other social contagions, such as cutting and bulimia, ROGD gets full support from the medical community instead of the treatment such contagions deserve, she contends.\\n\\nThe standard for dealing with teens who assert they are transgender is 'affirmative care'—immediately granting the patient's stated identity, Ms. Shrier writes, when the role of therapists should be to assist their patients in overcoming their unhealthy urges rather than pandering to them.\\n\\nGender dysphoria has now become a fashionable cause, and clinics routinely give girls testosterone with few questions asked, and with little thought to the sometimes permanent damage that such treatment brings about.\\n\\nPlanned Parenthood furnishes testosterone to young women on an 'informed consent' basis, without requiring any psychological evaluation, Shrier notes. Student health plans at 86 colleges—including those of nearly every Ivy League school—cover not only cross-sex hormones but surgery as well.\\n\\nParents who question the wisdom of yielding to their children's desire to change genders often run up against a wall of contrary public opinion with very little scientific evidence to back it up.\\n\\nNearly every force in society is aligned against these parents, Shrier says. Churches scramble to rewrite their liturgies for greater 'inclusiveness.' Therapists and psychiatrists undermine parental authority with immediate affirmation of teens' self-diagnoses. Campus counselors happily refer students to clinics that dispense hormones on the first visit.\\n\\nMoreover, parents have a lot to lose by resisting the societal trend. Last February, the parents of a 17-year-old girl lost custody of their daughter for opposing her wish for transgender medical treatments.\\n\\nAt that time, Judge Sylvia Sieve Hendon of Hamilton County, Ohio allowed the girl to be taken into the custody of her grandparents and gave them authority to make decisions that will further along her physical transition to the opposite sex.\\n\\nGender identity disorders result principally from cultural causes and modern society is facilitating them, which explains their rapid growth.\\n\\nA report in early 2018 chronicled an exploding transgender industry evidenced by a huge surge in the number of referrals for gender-identity treatment, in some cases increasing by as much as 2800 percent in less than ten years.\\n\\nWestern societies have witnessed a phenomenal rise in the number of persons, especially young people, seeking treatment for gender identity issues, paralleling the attention given to gender theory in communications, medicine, and the entertainment media. In the United States, for instance, the percentage of adults who currently identify as transgender is double what is was just seven years ago.\\n\\nThe surge in transgenderism was not wholly unforeseen, however.\\n\\nIn the year 2000, bioethicist Carl Elliott published a ground-breaking article in the Atlantic Monthly titled A New Way to be Mad, which foretold rapid growth in gender-identity issues by comparing them to past psychological epidemics.\\n\\nWhy do certain psychopathologies arise, seemingly out of nowhere, in certain societies and during certain historical periods, and then disappear just as suddenly? he asked.\\n\\nElliott suggested that psychiatrists and other clinicians helped to create the psychological epidemics in the past simply by the way they viewed the disorders—by the kinds of questions they asked patients, the treatments they used, the diagnostic categories available to them at the time, and the way these patients fit within those categories.\\n\\nHis central thesis—backed up by abundant data and persuasive argumentation—was that rapid growth of a particular psychological disorder may often be abetted, if not directly caused, by the very ones who are purportedly treating it, as well as by society at large.\\n\\nBy regarding a phenomenon as a psychiatric diagnosis, he noted, psychiatrists may be unwittingly colluding with broader cultural forces to contribute to the spread of a mental disorder.\\n\\nIn 2016, the American College of Pediatricians warned educators and legislators that a life of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is dangerous for children, but there warning has gone largely unheeded.\\n\\nA statement by the group said that a person's belief that he or she is something they are not is, at best, a sign of confused thinking.

{"original": "SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — The San Francisco 49ers fired coach Chip Kelly and general manager Trent Baalke on Sunday in the latest overhaul for a franchise that has fallen from perennial Super Bowl contender to the bottom of the standings in three seasons.\\n\\nTeam CEO Jed York announced the moves just hours after the Niners (2-14) matched a franchise record for losses in a season by losing the finale to Seattle 25-23.\\n\\nDespite my feelings for Trent and Chip, I felt the decision to change our football leadership was absolutely necessary, York said in a statement. The performance of this team has not lived up to my expectations or those of our fans, and that is truly disappointing. We all expected to see this team progress and develop as the season went on, but unfortunately that did not happen. That is why now is the time to find a new direction for this team.\\n\\nThe team has been searching for success ever since cutting ties with Jim Harbaugh following an 8-8 record in 2014. Harbaugh had led San Francisco to three straight trips to the NFC title game and one Super Bowl appearance from 2011-13 in the only stretch of success in the past 15 years for a franchise that has won five Super Bowls.\\n\\nJim Tomsula was fired after going 5-11 in 2015 and things only got worse under Kelly, whose once bright coaching star has dimmed after being fired by Philadelphia and San Francisco the past two years.\\n\\nThis marks the first time in nearly four decades that a team fired coaches in successive years after just one-year tenures. The only other time that happened since the 1970 merger came when San Francisco fired Monte Clark after the 1976 season and Ken Meyer the following year. The Niners then fired Pete McCulley midway through the 1978 season and interim coach Fred O'Connor after the year before hiring Bill Walsh to start a dynasty.\\n\\nIt's frustrating we're in this position again, left tackle Joe Staley said before the news became official. As a player you have to look at yourself first. What can I do next season to make sure we're not in this position?\\n\\nKelly entered the NFL as one of the most highly sought coaches after his success in college at Oregon. After winning 10 games in each of his first two seasons in Philadelphia in 2013-14, Kelly was fired with a 6-9 record for the Eagles late last season.\\n\\nHe then lasted just one season with the Niners, raising more questions about whether his up-tempo, spread offense that was so successful at Oregon can work in the NFL.\\n\\nHe never had much of a chance at success with San Francisco with a roster that featured Blaine Gabbert and Colin Kaepernick as the top two quarterbacks and had no playmakers on the outside.\\n\\nWe don't control the roster, so I think the one thing is our job as coaches is to create an environment where our players have an opportunity to be successful, and that's what we have to do, Kelly said before getting the news in a meeting with York. I don't look at, 'I wish I had this. I wish I had that.' We were fortunate for the guys we had and we tried to coach them as hard as we could and as well as we could.\\n\\nBaalke helped build the roster that made three straight trips to the NFC title game from 2011-13 and one Super Bowl appearance. But the team has had declining win totals the past three seasons, including a record 13-game losing streak this season.\\n\\nWhile we experienced our share of success over the years, I am disappointed at where we are today, Baalke said in a statement.\\n\\nThe 49ers lost 13 straight games at one point this season and their only wins came against the Rams. San Francisco set franchise worsts for points, total yards and yards rushing allowed in a season and blew four double-digit leads in eight home games.\\n\\nNow they will look for a fourth coach in four seasons.\\n\\nWhen we lose like we did and have a season like we had, changes are made, or can be made, receiver Torrey Smith said. That's from coaches to players. It's all of us. We were all a part of the problem. That's why our record is what it was.\\n\\nBaalke originally joined the Niners as a scout in 2005 and quickly worked his way up to director of player personnel where he helped then-general manager Scot McCloughan put together many of the pieces of the team that would be one of the most talented in the league.\\n\\nBaalke replaced McCloughan as the top front office executive shortly before the 2010 draft and came away from that with a load of talent led by Anthony Davis, Mike Iupati and NaVorro Bowman.\\n\\nBaalke was given the title of general manager the following year when the Niners hired Harbaugh as coach and Baalke had another successful draft that featured All-Pro pass rusher Aldon Smith and Kaepernick with his first two picks.\\n\\nThe talent well went dry after that. Despite having 51 picks since 2012, Baalke has not added an impact player in any of those five drafts as he frequently drafted players with injuries and stayed away from skill position players.\\n\\nSince 2012, Baalke has had 15 picks in the first three rounds and used just one — second-round running back Carlos Hyde in 2013 — on a quarterback, receiver or running back."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump won impeachment acquittal Wednesday in the U.S. Senate, bringing to a close only the third presidential trial in American history with votes that split the country, tested civic norms and fed the tumultuous 2020 race for the White House.\\n\\nWith Chief Justice John Roberts presiding, senators sworn to do impartial justice stood at their desks to state their votes for the roll call — guilty or not guilty — in a swift tally almost exclusively along party lines. Visitors, including the president's allies, watched from the crowded gallery. Roberts read the declaration that Trump be, and is hereby, acquitted of the charges.\\n\\nThe outcome Wednesday followed months of remarkable impeachment proceedings, from Speaker Nancy Pelosi's House to Mitch McConnell's Senate, reflecting the nation's unrelenting partisan divide three years into the Trump presidency.\\n\\nWhat started as Trump's request for Ukraine to do us a favor spun into a far-reaching, 28,000-page report compiled by House investigators accusing an American president of engaging in shadow diplomacy that threatened U.S. foreign relations for personal, political gain as he pressured the ally to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden ahead of the next election.\\n\\nNo president has ever been removed by the Senate.\\n\\nA politically emboldened Trump has eagerly predicted vindication, deploying the verdict as a political anthem in his reelection bid. The president claims he did nothing wrong, decrying the witch hunt and hoax as extensions of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian 2016 campaign interference by those out to get him from the start of his presidency.\\n\\nTrump's political campaign tweeted videos, statements and a cartoon dance celebrating that he was vindicated. Trump himself tweeted that he would speak from the White House on Thursday about our Country's VICTORY on the Impeachment Hoax.\\n\\nThe Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said there will always be a giant asterisk next to the president's acquittal because of the Senate's quick trial and the Republicans' rejection of witnesses.\\n\\nA majority of senators expressed unease with Trump's pressure campaign on Ukraine that resulted in the two articles of impeachment. But two-thirds guilty votes would have been needed to reach the Constitution's bar of high crimes and misdemeanors to convict and remove Trump from office. The final tallies fell far short.\\n\\nOn the first article of impeachment, abuse of power, the vote was 52-48 favoring acquittal. The second, obstruction of Congress, also produced a not guilty verdict, 53-47.\\n\\nOnly one Republican, Mitt Romney of Utah, the party's defeated 2012 presidential nominee, broke with the GOP.\\n\\nRomney choked up as said drew on his faith and oath before God to announce he would vote guilty on the first charge, abuse of power. He voted to acquit on the second.\\n\\nBoth Bill Clinton in 1999 and Andrew Johnson in 1868 drew cross-party support when they were left in office after an impeachment trial. President Richard Nixon resigned rather than face revolt from his own party.\\n\\nAhead of voting, some of the most closely watched senators took to the Senate floor to tell their constituents, and the nation, what they had decided. The Senate chaplain opened the trial with daily prayers for the senators, including one Wednesday seeking integrity.\\n\\nInfluential GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who is retiring, worried that a guilty verdict would pour gasoline on the fire of the nation's culture wars over Trump. He said the House proved its case but it just didn't rise to the level of impeachment.\\n\\nIt would rip the country apart, Alexander said before his vote.\\n\\nOther Republicans siding with Trump said it was time to end what McConnell called the circus and move on. Trump ally GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham said it was a sham designed to destroy a presidency.\\n\\nMost Democrats, though, echoed the House managers' warnings that Trump, if left unchecked, would continue to abuse the power of his office for personal political gain and try to cheat again ahead of the the 2020 election.\\n\\nDuring the nearly three-week trial, House Democrats prosecuting the case argued that Trump abused power like no other president in history when he pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, ahead of the 2020 election.\\n\\nThey detailed an extraordinary shadow diplomacy run by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani that set off alarms at the highest levels of government. After Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine, Trump temporarily halted U.S. aid to the struggling ally battling hostile Russia at its border. The money was eventually released in September as Congress intervened.\\n\\nWhen the House probed Trump's actions, the president instructed White House aides to defy congressional subpoenas, leading to the obstruction charge.\\n\\nOne key Democrat, Alabama Sen. Doug Jones — perhaps the most endangered politically for reelection in a state where Trump is popular — announced he would vote to convict. Senators are elected to make tough choices, Jones said\\n\\nQuestions from the Ukraine matter continue to swirl. House Democrats may yet summon former national security adviser John Bolton to testify about revelations from his forthcoming book that offer a fresh account of Trump's actions. Other eyewitnesses and documents are almost sure to surface.\\n\\nIn closing arguments for the trial the lead prosecutor, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., appealed to senators' sense of decency, that right matters and truth matters and that Trump is not who you are.\\n\\nThe president's basic lack of character, his willingness to cheat in the election – he's not going to stop, Schiff told The Associated Press on Wednesday, predicting more revelations would become public. It's not going to change, which means that we are going to have to remain eternally vigilant.\\n\\nPelosi was initially reluctant to launch impeachment proceedings against Trump when she took control of the House after the 2018 election, dismissively telling more liberal voices that he's not worth it.\\n\\nTrump and his GOP allies in Congress argue that Democrats have been trying to undercut him from the start.\\n\\nBut a whistleblower complaint of his conversation with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy set off alarms. The call had been placed the day after Mueller announced the findings of his Russia probe.\\n\\nWhen Trump told Pelosi in September that the call was perfect, she was stunned. Perfectly wrong, she said. Days later, the speaker announced the formal impeachment inquiry.\\n\\nThe result was the quickest, most partisan impeachment in U.S. history, with no Republicans joining the House Democrats to vote for the charges, though one GOP congressman left the party and voted for impeachment and two Democrats joined Republicans to oppose. The Republican Senate kept up the pace with the fastest trial ever, and the first with no witnesses or deliberations.\\n\\nTrump's legal team with star attorney Alan Dershowitz made the sweeping, if stunning, assertion that even if the president engaged in the quid pro quo as described, it is not impeachable, because politicians often view their own political interest with the national interest.\\n\\nMcConnell, who commands a 53-47 Republican majority, braced for dissent, refusing efforts to prolong the trial with more witnesses, arguing the House should have done a better job.\\n\\nSome GOP senators distanced themselves from Trump's defense, and other Republicans brushed back calls from conservatives to disclose the name of the anonymous whistleblower. The Associated Press typically does not reveal the identity of whistleblowers.\\n\\nTrump's approval rating, which has generally languished in the mid- to low-40s, hit a new high of 49% in the latest Gallup polling, which was conducted as the Senate trial was drawing to a close. The poll found that 51% of the public views the Republican Party favorably, the first time the GOP's number has exceeded 50% since 2005.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAssociated Press writers Eric Tucker, Laurie Kellman, Matthew Daly, Alan Fram, Andrew Taylor and Padmananda Rama contributed to this report."}

After a creator hits 10k lifetime views on their channel, we'll review their activity against our policies, the company concluded. If everything looks good, we'll bring this channel into YPP and begin serving ads against their content.

I believe the Biden administration will continue that.\\n\\nManchin added the work of the USCIRF is unique in the world.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump initiated the appointment of a permanent adviser for international religious freedom to the President's office, Manchin said, a move that would highlight the plight of people around the world who are persecuted for their faith when foreign policy decisions are made.\\n\\nIn July 2018, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview with Family Research Council President Tony Perkins, also a member of the USCIRF, that the Trump administration was making the clarion call for religious freedom all around the world:\\n\\nIt is incredibly important in President Trump's administration to make the clarion call for religious freedom all around the world. There are many countries in which religious freedom is not available and we believe that by gathering citizens from around the world … we will highlight the central nature of religious freedom and its importance to individuals in countries. We believe religious freedom is important for every citizen around the world and we want to bring everyone together to discuss how individuals of all faiths have the right to worship as they choose, or if they choose not to.

In fact, his plans to defend abortion rights will undermine the beliefs of the majority of Americans of faith.\\n\\nBiden has committed to embracing the Democrat Party's pro-abortion agenda that includes codifying Roe v. Wade, funding Planned Parenthood, and forcing American taxpayers to fund abortions through a repeal of the Hyde Amendment.\\n\\nThe future president also chose as his running mate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who, as California attorney general, directed her office to lead the raid on Center for Medical Progress (CMP) project leader David Daleiden after CMP released undercover videos exposing Planned Parenthood's fetal tissue sales practices.\\n\\nIt was Harris's office that collaborated with Planned Parenthood to produce legislation that would criminalize the CMP undercover journalists for publishing and distributing recordings of private communications with abortion providers in California.\\n\\nAs a senator, Harris voted against bills to protect the lives of babies who survive abortions and took to Twitter to tout her vote against a ban on abortions past the fifth month of pregnancy.\\n\\nAs a Democrat candidate for president, Harris pledged not only to restrict states' rights to pass and enact their own abortion laws, but also to block a pro-life president's power and that of his or her administration.\\n\\nGuardrails will ensure DOJ enforces the law even under an administration that's hostile to women's rights — and patients and providers will have standing to sue if they don't, Harris's plan stated during her campaign.\\n\\nA woman's constitutional right to an abortion is under attack. Today I announced a plan as president to block these dangerous and deadly state laws before they take effect. https://t.co/zKJtsgwQUM — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) May 28, 2019\\n\\nIn the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in July in Little Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania, one that upheld a Trump administration rule exempting religious groups from Obamacare's contraceptive mandate, self-professed Catholic Biden vowed to reverse protections for religious groups such as the Little Sisters.\\n\\nBiden said, according to Fox News:\\n\\nAs disappointing as the Supreme Court's ruling is, there is a clear path to fixing it: electing a new President who will end Donald Trump's ceaseless attempts to gut every aspect of the Affordable Care Act. If I am elected, I will restore the Obama-Biden policy that existed before the Hobby Lobby ruling: providing an exemption for houses of worship and an accommodation for nonprofit organizations with religious missions.\\n\\nThe Obamacare accommodation Biden referred to, however, was never viewed as such by many Catholic schools and organizations. Instead, they recognized it as an accounting trick whereby completion of a certified form would merely transfer their mandate to directly provide abortion-inducing drugs to an insurance provider, who would take care of the administration of these services for the faith-based groups. In short, the accommodation simply ensured the abortion-inducing drugs were paid for, as the Obama-Biden administration desired, while the conscience issues of the faith-based groups remained ignored.\\n\\nIt's alarming to Catholics to see Joe Biden tout his Catholic faith and then turn around and say he would immediately go after the Little Sisters of the Poor and reinstate the rules that would force them to either violate their faith or pay crippling fines, Ashley McGuire, senior fellow with The Catholic Association, said in a statement to Breitbart News.\\n\\nIs there anything more contradictory than touting your faith while simultaneously threatening nuns who serve the elderly poor? she asked.\\n\\nEven sharp critics of Trump expressed horror at Harris's treatment of Brian Buescher, one of the president's federal judiciary nominees and a member of the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic charitable organization that collects and distributes winter coats for poor children, and provides funds and baby supplies for crisis pregnancy shelters.\\n\\nDuring a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Harris asked Buescher, Were you aware that the Knights of Columbus opposed a woman's right to choose when you joined the organization?\\n\\nMichael Gerson, one of Trump's harshest critics, wrote in January at the Washington Post:\\n\\nThose who want to understand how Democrats manage to scare the hell out of vast sections of the country need look no further than the story of Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) and the Knights of Columbus.\\n\\nGerson continued that Harris and her Senate colleagues attempted to force the narrative that Americans can believe what they want in private, but can't act on that belief in the public square.\\n\\nHe wrote:\\n\\nThe comparison of this view to the United States' long history of anti-Catholic bigotry has been disputed. Actually, it is exactly the same as this history in every important respect. A 19th-century bigot would have regarded Catholicism as fundamentally illiberal — a backward faith characterized by clerical despotism — and thus inconsistent with America's democratic rules. The same attitude seems currently present in the U.S. Senate.\\n\\nAccording to Fox News, Ken Blackwell, a former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Human Rights Commission, also called the behavior of Harris and Hirono thuggish and what might be expected from third world dictators."}

{"original": "TEL AVIV — Rejecting archeological evidence, the historic record and accepted fact, Maher al-Sousi, a lecturer at the Islamic University of Gaza, claimed that the Jewish temples were never located on the Temple Mount and that Jews have no right to the holiest site in Judaism.\\n\\nAccording to al-Sousi, The Jews have no right to the place. The claims that the temples were located there have been religiously and historically proven as false claims. The prophet Moses also never entered the historical land of Palestine. He arrived in the area of the border between today's Jordan and Palestine, but didn't enter. So, the legend of the temple has no connection to reality and all the claims of the Jews are forfeit.\\n\\nAl-Susi was speaking after Friday's deadly Palestinian terrorist attack at the Temple Mount.\\n\\nTwo Israeli Border Police Officers were murdered and a third was wounded on Friday when three Palestinian terrorists opened fire at security forces near an entrance to the Temple Mount at the Lions Gate and then fled into the Mount complex. The Palestinian assailants, reportedly carrying two rifles and a pistol, were pursued by Israeli forces and were shot and killed as they tried to escape toward the mosques on the Mount.\\n\\nAddressing the terrorist attack, al-Sousi claimed, The entry of Jews into the mosques and the attempt to change the status quo is what pushed these young people to carry out the attack. These young men were committed to protecting the holiness of the place because of its central place in Islam and in the hearts of all Muslims.\\n\\nJews do not enter the mosques on the Temple Mount, as they are banned from doing so by the site's Waqf Islamic custodians.\\n\\nFriday's attack occurred less than two weeks after the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) passed an anti-Israel resolution declaring Jerusalem's Old City and its ancient walls occupied and listed the areas as Palestinian heritage sites in danger.\\n\\nThe terrorist attack also took place one week after UNESCO passed another anti-Israel resolution regarding the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron – considered the second holiest site in Judaism after the Temple Mount – claiming the tomb is a Palestinian world heritage site in danger.\\n\\nAl-Sousi stated, UNESCO's decisions regarding the absence of the Jews' rights to Hebron and Jerusalem prove what we are saying about the legend of the temples being false and that Jews have no historic roots in Palestine. This is known.\\n\\nAl-Sousi is not alone in making the false claim that there are no Jewish ties to the Temple Mount. Such views are mainstream in Palestinian society.\\n\\nIn a Breitbart Jerusalem interview last year, Khaled Elkhaldi, a professor at Gaza's Islamic University, completely denied Jewish ties to the Temple Mount.\\n\\nIn 2007, Breitbart's Aaron Klein conducted an exclusive video interview with Waqf official and chief Palestinian cleric Taysir Tamimi, who used the occasion to claim the Jewish Temples never existed and the Western Wall was really a hitching post for Muhammad's horse.\\n\\nExcavations near the Mount routinely uncover archaeological evidence further tying Jews to Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. For example, discoveries at the City of David, an archeological site just outside the Mount, have unearthed the core of ancient Jerusalem, including Hezekiah's Tunnel, evidence of the Gihon Spring, Jewish Temple artifacts, Temple purifying pools and more.\\n\\nNot only are these Muslim scholars' claims about the lack of evidence tying Jews to the Temple Mount false, the Islamic scholar glossed over the Palestinians' own complicity in disposing of Jewish temple artifacts.\\n\\nAs Klein previously reported:\\n\\nIn 1997, the Waqf conducted a large dig on the Temple Mount during construction of a massive mosque at an area referred to as Solomon's Stables. The Wafq at the time disposed of truckloads of dirt containing Jewish artifacts from the First and Second Temple periods.\\n\\nAfter the media reported the disposals, Israeli authorities froze the construction permit given to the Waqf and the dirt was transferred to Israeli archaeologists for analysis. The Israeli authorities found scores of Jewish Temple relics in the nearly disposed dirt, including coins with Hebrew writing referencing the Temple, part of a Hasmonean lamp, several other Second Temple lamps, Temple-period pottery with Jewish markings, a marble pillar shaft, and other Temple-period artifacts.\\n\\nThe Waqf was widely accused of attempting to hide evidence of the existence of the Jewish Temples.\\n\\nAnd in 2007, Klein personally reported from the site of an unusual dig on the Temple Mount in which the Waqf utilized heavy machinery to dig in one of the most sensitive archaeological compounds in the world and were once again caught red-handed destroying Temple-era antiquities."}

{"original": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have spent the past year courting the Democratic Party's base with appeals to the working class and sweeping promises to curb climate change. But as they balance their responsibilities to participate in the Senate's impeachment trial and rally voters on the campaign trail, they're turning to private air travel, an option typically reserved for the elite and criticized as environmentally unfriendly.\\n\\nSanders is expected to charter a flight to Iowa this weekend while the Senate trial is in recess. Warren hasn't finalized her plans but is also considering private travel, and Amy Klobuchar hasn't ruled it out. Only Michael Bennet says he'll be flying commercial.\\n\\nThe senators are facing an unprecedented challenge in the final days before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses. At a time when they would typically barnstorm the state, they're instead stuck in Washington as jurors in President Donald Trump's impeachment case. The little time they have for campaigning makes commercial travel tough.\\n\\nBut the private planes present unique issues for Warren and Sanders. As the leading progressive voices in a crowded Democratic primary, they often criticize rivals they deem insufficiently loyal to those values. The sudden use of private travel is an example of how ideological rigidity can sometimes collide with White House aspirations.\\n\\nThis is the problem of presenting your purity above your practicality, said Democratic strategist Chris Lippincott, who has not endorsed any of the 2020 primary candidates. When we think about certain candidates who talk a lot about the environment … you're going to hold them to a different standard.\\n\\nLippincott applauded the 2020 presidential hopefuls in the Senate for being willing to fly privately, if that's what their campaigns need.\\n\\nI understand it, he said of trying to live progressive values at all times, but the reality is, there's a big risk of being perceived as being an ideologue and not a problem-solver.\\n\\nTransportation emissions overall make up the largest share of U.S. climate-damaging emissions, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Globally, air travel pumps out about 3% of overall emissions of climate-destroying carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. Surging growth of air travel in Asia and around the world means those emissions will triple by 2050, the United Nations says, and recent studies say even that figure underestimates the explosive growth of air travel and its emissions.\\n\\nIn March, Sanders' campaign became the first to announce it would provide carbon offsets, donations to environmental groups meant to mitigate the environmental effects of extra emissions. Since then, it had spent about $9,000 on them through September. And during his primary challenge to Hillary Clinton in 2016, Sanders paid around $14,000 for such offsets.\\n\\nHis campaign is making payments to NativeEnergy, based in Burlington, Vermont, which is the same company that Clinton used for them during her presidential bid in 2016. That's also the same firm Warren uses, with her campaign paying a little more than $10,000 to it in September.\\n\\nSome climate advocates said they weren't bothered by the private travel, especially because they view a more carbon-conscious administration as a far better result for the climate than four more years of Trump in the White House.\\n\\nIf you're a presidential candidate running to try to beat Donald Trump, who is a climate denier to his bones, and that requires you to move around the country … you should do that, said Leah Stokes, a professor and researcher into climate and energy politics at the University of California-Santa Barbara.\\n\\nWorld leaders fly around in airplanes — this is the modern era, Stokes said. They can't just hop a speedy train to Iowa, she said.\\n\\nTrump has made a similar point for the opposite reason, poking fun at Democratic environmental plans.\\n\\nI really don't like their policy of taking away your car, of taking away your airplane rights, of 'Let's hop a train to California,' Trump said during a rally last February.\\n\\nSanders has pledged a $16.3 trillion environmental plan that would declare climate change a national emergency and calls for the U.S. to move to renewable energy across the economy until 2050. Warren wants to spend $3 trillion over 10 years to move the U.S. to 100% clean energy. And both are aggressive supporters of the Green New Deal, a sweeping plan to combat climate change.\\n\\nSanders recently suggested on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert that he'd consider a kind of jet-pooling arrangement in which he and other candidates could share private flights, saying, Maybe we can all chip in, get one plane and come back.\\n\\nThat opportunity might have presented itself last weekend since Sanders, Warren and others were campaigning in Iowa and then went to South Carolina for Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebrations and then on to Washington to be in the Senate. But they didn't share private flights.\\n\\nStill, Sanders' campaign says the senator's comment to Colbert wasn't realistic. Even if several senators were looking to decamp from Washington to Iowa quickly after the impeachment trial concludes each day, they would be headed to different parts of the state.\\n\\nIt's not just those candidates tethered to Washington by the impeachment trial who often opt to fly private. Former Vice President Joe Biden spent at least $1.2 million on charter jets through September, while Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, had spent at least $750,000.\\n\\nThat was more than Sanders (at least $377,000) and Warren (at least $190,000) over the same period, though impeachment could change that. Spending data through December 2019 won't be ready until the end of the month. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg mostly flies private to campaign stops.\\n\\nButtigieg's, Biden's and Bloomberg's campaigns all say they are also paying for carbon offsets.\\n\\nButtigieg faced criticism this summer for his penchant for flying private from presidential rival Beto O'Rourke, who produced an online ad filmed aboard a commercial jet proclaiming No private planes for this campaign. Buttigieg responded during a CNN climate change town hall by saying, This is a very big country, and I'm running to be president of the whole country. O'Rourke, a former Texas congressman, dropped out of the race in November.\\n\\nSanders, meanwhile, drew fire after spending nearly $300,000 on private jets in September 2018, as he crisscrossed the country campaigning for other candidates during the midterm elections.\\n\\nThe issue also came up in August, when Sanders traveled to Paradise, California, which had been ravaged by wildfires, to unveil his plan to fight climate change. He was unapologetic.\\n\\nI'm not going to walk to California, Sanders replied when asked about flying private. We do the best we can as an example, but I'm not going to sit here and tell you that we're not going to use fossil fuels.\\n\\n___\\n\\nKnickmeyer reported from Washington.

{"original": "During his monologue on Thursday, Fox News Channel host Tucker Carlson sounded an alarm for what he deemed to be a radical piece of legislation engineered and championed by congressional Democrats that would change longstanding immigration policy and law in America.\\n\\nThe bill, called the New Way Forward Act, would remove the threat of deportation for immigrants convicted of serious crimes.\\n\\nTranscript as follows:\\n\\nCrime and violence are the clearest possible signs that a society isn't functioning as it should. If they increase to a certain point, societies don't function at all, and we should be worried about that always. We ought to be doing all that we can to build a place, a country where people who follow the law are rewarded; those who flout it are punished, and above all, children can live in peace and safety.\\n\\nThey used to be obvious. It's not obvious anymore. At this moment, there's a bill pending in the Congress called the New Way Forward Act. It's received almost no publicity, and that's unfortunate, as well as revealing. The legislation is sponsored by 44 House Democrats, including Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It is roughly 4,400 words long. That means, it's almost exactly as long as the U.S. Constitution. Like the Constitution, it is designed to create a whole new country.\\n\\nThe bill would entirely remake immigration system with the explicit purpose of ensuring that criminals are able to move to the United States and settle here permanently with immunity. They may think we're exaggerating for effect, but we're not exaggerating, not even a little bit. The New Way Forward Act is the single most radical piece of legislation we have ever seen proposed in this country — ever. It makes the Green New Deal like the status quo. The document produced by Democrats to promote the bill says this, and we're quoting it verbatim, Convictions should not lead to deportation.\\n\\nNow, keep in mind, we're not talking about convictions for double parking or even for DUI. The bill targets felony convictions, serious crimes that could send you to prison for years, and should. A press release from Congressman Jesus Garcia of Illinois is explicit about this. Garcia brags that the bill will break the prison to deportation pipeline. Something most of us are for. So how does the bill do that? Well, under current U.S. law, legal U.S. immigrants can be deported if they commit aggravated felony or a crime of moral turpitude that is a vile, depraved act like molesting children.\\n\\nUnder the New Way Forward Act, crimes of moral turpitude are eliminated entirely as justification for deportation and the category of aggravated felony gets eliminated, too.\\n\\nSo what does that mean? Consider this. Under current law, immigrants who commit serious crimes, robbery to fraud to child sexual abuse, must be deported regardless of the sentences they receive. Other crimes, less severe ones like racketeering require deportation if the perpetrator receives at least a one-year sentence.\\n\\nUnder this bill, they will no longer be any crime that automatically requires deportation. None. And one crime, falsifying a passport would be made immune from deportation, no matter what, because apparently, 9/11 never even happened, and we no longer care about fake government documents. By the way, if you just renewed your driver's license to comply with the Real ID Act, you must feel like an idiot. Because immigrants are getting a pass, you're not.\\n\\nUnder the proposed legislation for crimes that would still allow deportation, the required prison sentence would rise from one year to five years. We checked the Bureau of Justice Statistics. According to Federal data, crimes like car theft, fraud and weapons offenses all carry average prison sentences of fewer than five years. And that's just looking at averages. There are people who commit rape, child abuse, even manslaughter, and get sentences with fewer than five years. Lots of them actually.\\n\\nIf the New Way Forward Act passes, immigrants who commit those crimes and receive those sentences would remain in this country, and of course, they will be eligible for citizenship day one, too, of course. But even that is understanding the law's effect. Even a five-year prison sentence wouldn't necessarily be enough to trigger deportation. The bill would grant sweeping new powers to immigration judges allowing them to nullify a deportation order.\\n\\nThe only requirement for that is, The immigration judge find such an exercise of discretion appropriate in pursuant of humanitarian purposes to ensure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest. Talk about open-ended. In other words, anti-American immigration judges, and there are a lot of those in this country would have a blank check to open the borders. You would not be voting on this. It would happen anyway.\\n\\nIs this shocking you yet? Because we're just getting started. We read this proposed legislation. Here's another point.\\n\\nCurrent U.S. law makes drug addiction grounds for deportation, because why wouldn't it? This bill would eliminate that statute. Current law also states that those who have committed drug crimes abroad or any crimes involving moral turpitude are ineligible to immigrate here. The New Way Forward Act abolishes that statute. So a Mexican drug cartel leader could be released from prison, can freely come to America immediately. And if he wants, he can come here illegally, and it still wouldn't be a crime because — and you are waiting for this part — the bill also decriminalizes illegal entry into America even by those we've previously deported.\\n\\nIn other words, you break our law, we send you out, you come back, you break it again, you can stay.\\n\\nAccording to a document promoting this bill. Criminalizing illegal entry into America is white supremacist. That's a quote, white supremacist. Now, by this point, you're beginning to wonder, are we making this up? We're not making it up. In fact, we're barely halfway through the bill. The legislation doesn't just make it harder to deport illegal immigrants who commit crimes. It doesn't just make it easier for criminals to move here illegally, though it does both, the bill would also effectively abolish all existing enforcement against illegal immigration.\\n\\nTo detain illegal immigrants, I.C.E. would have to prove in court that they are dangerous or a flight risk. But of course, I.C.E. wouldn't be allowed to use a detainee's prior criminal behavior as proof of danger. That's banned. I.C.E. would have to overcome even more hurdles if the detainee claims to be gay or transgendered. If they're under 21 or if they can't speak English, an interpreter isn't immediately available, they get a pass.\\n\\nIn other words, it would be much harder to arrest an illegal alien in this country than it is to arrest you. They're the protected class here. You're just some loser who's paying for it all.\\n\\nBut believe it or not, we save the nuttiest part of this legislation for last, and here's what it is. What could be more destructive than changing U.S. law specifically to allow rapists, child molesters, and drug dealers to stay in America? How about this: using taxpayer money to bring deported criminals back into America. That's right. This bill would not only abolish your right to control who lives in your country, but it invents a brand new right, the right to come home.\\n\\nIt orders the government to create a pathway for those previously deported to apply to return to their homes and families in the United States as long as they would have been eligible to stay under the new law. It's retroactive in other words. D.H.S. must spend taxpayer dollars transporting convicted criminal illegal aliens back into the United States. I am not making this up.\\n\\nSo who would be eligible for these flights? Tens of thousands of people we kicked out of this country for all kinds of crimes: Sexual abuse, robbery, assault, drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, human trafficking. From 2002 to 2018, four hundred and eighty thousand people were deported for illegal entry or re-entry into America. And under this bill, you'd have to buy each of them a plane ticket to come home.\\n\\nThose tickets alone would cost about a billion dollars, and that's before Democrats make you start paying for these criminals free healthcare, too, which they plan to do and have said so. The New Way Forward Act fundamentally inverts every assumption you have about this country. Under this legislation, the criminals are now the victims. Law enforcement is illegitimate. It's racist, just like the country you live in, just like you are.\\n\\nNow, the only solution is to get rid of both. America would be better off as a borderless rest stop for the world's predators and parasites. That's the point of this. And we're not overstating it, go read it. This is a big deal. This is not a small thing. It's not renaming a Post Office. It's hard to believe any American would put these ideas on paper, much less try to pass them into law. And yet remarkably, that's happening.\\n\\nAnd even more remarkably, the press has ignored it. This isn't happening in secret. It is happening in the House of Representatives. Scores of Democrats have backed this bill. But the legislation has not been mentioned in The New York Times. It has not been mentioned on CNN, a news or even in self-described conservative outlets like National Review. No mention.\\n\\nConsider if this were working the other way. If a lone — I don't know Republican state legislator from Minot, North Dakota had proposed to build this extreme that would remake America completely, the President himself would be expected to answer for it. CNN would demand that he disavow it even if you've never heard of it before. But when one-fifth of the entire Democratic Caucus backs a bill demanding that you import illegal alien felons and then pay for it, it's a non-event in the American media. They don't think you should know about it. And that's dangerous, if we're being honest.\\n\\nWhether the press cares or not, these are the stakes of the 2020 election, and you have a right to know what they are. A growing wing of the Democratic Party views America itself as essentially a legitimate, a rogue state in which everything must be destroyed and remade — our laws, our institutions, our customs, our freedoms, our history, our values.\\n\\nAnd of course, what's the point of all of this? An entirely new country in which resistance is crushed, and they're in charge forever."}
{"original": "Sixty-nine percent of all tuberculosis (TB) cases reported in the United States in 2017 were diagnosed in foreign-born residents, according to a report released earlier this month by the Centers for Disease Control.\\n\\nThis was the highest percentage ever, marking a steady three decade rise from 1986, when only 22 percent of all TB cases reported in the United States were diagnosed in foreign born residents. Last year, in 2016, 68 percent of TB cases were foreign-born.\\n\\nFor the country as a whole, the absolute number of TB cases and the rate per 100,000 declined for the second consecutive year.\\n\\n9,093 cases were reported in 2017, down from 9,272 in 2016.\\n\\nSince 1993, tuberculosis (TB) case counts and rates have declined in the United States. As the number of cases decreases overall, an increasing percentage of cases occurs among non–U.S.-born persons. Disparities also exist within racial, ethnic, and social groups among U.S.-born persons with TB, the CDC report stated, adding:\\n\\nIn 2017, a total of 9,093 new cases of tuberculosis (TB) were provisionally* reported in the United States, representing an incidence rate of 2.8 cases per 100,000 population. The case count decreased by 1.8% from 2016 to 2017, and the rate declined by 2.5% over the same period. These decreases are consistent with the slight decline in TB seen over the past several years. This report summarizes provisional TB surveillance data reported to CDC's National Tuberculosis Surveillance System for 2017 and in the last decade. The rate of TB among non–U.S.-born persons in 2017 was 15 times the rate among U.S.-born persons. Among non–U.S.-born persons, the highest TB rate among all racial/ethnic groups was among Asians (27.0 per 100,000 persons), followed by non-Hispanic blacks (blacks; 22.0). Among U.S.-born persons, most TB cases were reported among blacks (37.1%), followed by non-Hispanic whites (whites; 29.5%). Previous studies have shown that the majority of TB cases in the United States are attributed to reactivation of latent TB infection (LTBI).\\n\\nIn terms of absolute number of cases, the number of cases diagnosed in foreign born residents remained essentially the same, going from 6,351 in 2016 (68.7 percent) to 6,346 in 2017 (69.8 percent). The number of cases diagnosed in native born residents declined from 2,901 in 2016 to 2,698 in 2017.\\n\\nState-specific TB rates (cases per 100,000 persons) ranged from 0.3 in Montana to 8.1 in Hawaii with a median state TB rate of 1.8. As has been the case for the past decade, four states (California, Florida, New York, and Texas) reported half of the total TB cases in the United States in 2017, the CDC reported:\\n\\nThe annual percent change in rate in recent years has slowed from an average decline of 5.3% during 2010–2013 to an average decline of 2.0% during 2014–2017. In 2017, a total of 6,346 (69.8%) of U.S. TB cases occurred among non–U.S.-born persons, 2,698 (29.7%) cases occurred among U.S.-born persons, and 49 (0.5%) occurred among persons with no reported national origin. The TB rate among non–U.S.-born persons (14.6) was 15 times the rate among U.S.-born persons (1.0). Although these rates represent decreases among both groups in 2017 compared with 2016, the rate among U.S.-born persons declined 7.0%, whereas that among non–U.S.-born persons declined 0.9%. Among non–U.S.-born persons, the highest TB rate among all racial/ethnic groups occurred among Asians (27.0 per 100,000 persons), followed by blacks (22.0) (Table 2). As in previous years, in 2017, the top five countries of birth of non–U.S.-born persons with TB were Mexico (1,204; 19.0% of all non–U.S.-born persons with TB), Philippines (783; 12.3%), India (595; 9.4%), Vietnam (526; 8.3%), and China (400; 6.3%). Persons who received a diagnosis of TB ≥10 years after arriving in the United States accounted for 2,854 (45.0%) of all TB cases among non–U.S.-born persons.\\n\\nAs Breitbart News has reported extensively, high rates of latent TB infection in the estimated two million foreign-born refugees who have been resettled in the United States since 1986 is one reason why the percentage of TB cases among foreign-born residents has increased dramatically over the past three decades."}

{"original": "President-elect Joe Biden unveiled a coronavirus plan Thursday that he claims will turn the tide on the pandemic, speeding up the vaccine rollout, and providing financial help to individuals, states, and local governments and businesses struggling with the prolonged economic fallout.\\n\\nThe proposal reflects the priorities of Democrats, spending more money on aiding state governments, schools, and colleges than stimulus payments to individuals. It also includes a minimum wage hike, a measure sought by Democrats long before the pandemic struck.\\n\\nThe proposal includes:\\n\\n$350 billion in state and local government aid\\n\\n$170 billion for K-12 schools and institutions of higher education\\n\\nDirect payments of $1,400 to most Americans, costing around $320 billion according to a Breitbart News' estimate\\n\\nEnhanced unemployment benefits increasing payments by $400 per week through the end of September\\n\\n$50 billion for Covid-19 testing\\n\\n$20 billion toward a national vaccine program\\n\\nRaising the Child Tax Credit to $3,000 per child and making it fully refundable for 2021\\n\\nThe non-spending proposals include:\\n\\nHiking the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour\\n\\nExtending the eviction and foreclosure moratoriums until the end of September\\n\\nExtended family leave\\n\\nCalled the American Rescue Plan, it would amount to $1.9 trillion in spending. Despite the massive cost, the plan does not focus on creating jobs or set aside money for building American infrastructure.\\n\\nThose things will have to wait for a second bill that Biden says will be introduced in February, to also include measures, his advisers say, will combat climate change and advance racial equity.\\n\\nThe proposal falls short of expectations for $2,000 direct stimulus payments. Instead, it provides for what Breitbart News estimates would be around $320 billion in direct payments of $1,400 for most Americans. Biden's aides say this amounts to the promised $2,000 when coupled with the $600 included in the aid bill President Donald Trump signed last year.\\n\\nThe proposal includes an even larger amount of funds for state and local governments, schools, and colleges. Biden's plan provides for $350 billion in state and local government aid and another $170 billion for K-12 schools and colleges.\\n\\nUnder Biden's multipronged strategy, only about $400 billion would go directly to combating the pandemic, while the rest is focused on economic relief and aid to states and localities.\\n\\nBiden's aides claimed, without evidence, that the proposal would advance his target of administering 100 million vaccines by the 100th day of his administration and help move toward the objective of reopening most schools by the spring.\\n\\nIn an odd decision when unemployment is extremely high among low-income Americans, the proposal shoehorns inthe long-term Democratic policy aim of hiking the minimum wage to $15 an hour. That is likely to make it harder for low-income Americans to find jobs, putting further strains on state budgets funding employment benefits.\\n\\nThe proposal also expands paid leave for workers and increases tax credits for families with children, goals shared by many pro-family conservatives seeking to make family formation more affordable.\\n\\nThe political outlook for the legislation remained unclear. In a joint statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer praised Biden for including liberal priorities, saying they would move quickly to pass it. But Democrats have narrow margins in both chambers of Congress, and Republicans will push back on issues that range from increasing the minimum wage to providing more money for states, while demanding inclusion of their priorities, such as liability protection for businesses.\\n\\nRemember that a bipartisan $900 billion #COVID19 relief bill became law just 18 days ago, tweeted Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.\\n\\nThe emergency legislation would be paid for with borrowed money, adding to trillions in debt the government has already incurred to confront the pandemic. Aides said Biden will make the case that the additional spending and borrowing is necessary to prevent the economy from sliding into an even deeper hole. Interest rates are low, making debt more manageable. Inflation is below the Federal Reserve's target, indicating that the economy has enough slack to withstand additional demand introduced by deficit spending.\\n\\nBiden has long held that economic recovery is inextricably linked with controlling the coronavirus. Our work begins with getting COVID under control, he declared in his victory speech. We cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life's most precious moments until we get it under control.\\n\\nDespite this claim, the economy in the final six months of the Trump administration has out-performed the expectations of most economists. Re-opening many businesses and adjustments to business operations, including encouraging employees to work from home and making workplaces more amenable to social distancing, have allowed many businesses to regain their footing.\\n\\nThe plan comes as a divided nation is in the grip of the pandemic's most dangerous wave yet. So far, more than 385,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the U.S. And government numbers out Thursday reported a jump in weekly unemployment claims, to 965,000, a sign that rising infections are forcing businesses to cut back and lay off workers.\\n\\nAbout $20 billion would be allocated for a more disciplined focus on vaccination, on top of some $8 billion already approved by Congress. Biden has called for setting up mass vaccination centers and sending mobile units to hard-to-reach areas.\\n\\nThe plan provides $50 billion to expand testing, which is seen as key to reopening most schools by the end of the new administration's first 100 days. About $130 billion would be allocated to help schools reopen without risking further contagion.\\n\\nThe plan would fund the hiring of 100,000 public health workers to focus on encouraging people to get vaccinated and on tracing the contacts of those infected with the coronavirus.\\n\\nThere's also a proposal to boost investment in genetic sequencing, and to help track new virus strains, including the more contagious variants identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa.\\n\\nThroughout the plan, there's a focus on ensuring that minority communities that have borne the brunt of the pandemic are not shortchanged on vaccines and treatments, aides said.\\n\\nWith the new proposals comes a call to redouble efforts on the basics.\\n\\nBiden is asking Americans to override their sense of pandemic fatigue and recommit to wearing masks, practicing social distancing and avoiding indoor gatherings, particularly larger ones. He contends it's still the surest way to slow the COVID-19 wave, with more than 4,400 deaths reported just on Tuesday.\\n\\nBiden's biggest challenge will be to win the hearts and minds of the American people to follow his lead, said Dr. Leana Wen, a public health expert and emergency physician.\\n\\nWith the backing of Congress and the expertise of private and government scientists, the Trump administration has delivered two highly effective vaccines. and more are on the way. Yet a month after the first shots were given, the nation's vaccination campaign is off to a slow start, with about 10.3 million people getting the first of two shots, although more than 29 million doses have been delivered.\\n\\nBiden believes the key to speeding that up lies not only in delivering more vaccine but also in working closely with states and local communities to get shots into the arms of more people. The Trump administration provided the vaccine to states and set guidelines for who should get priority for shots, but they largely left it up to state and local officials to organize their vaccination campaigns.\\n\\nThis is going to entail coordination at all levels, as well as resources, said Dr. Nadine Gracia, executive vice president of the nonpartisan Trust for America's Health. There is a commitment the (incoming) administration has articulated to address the needs of communities.\\n\\nBiden has set a goal of administering 100 million shots in his first 100 days. The pace of vaccination is approaching one million shots a day, but 1.8 million a day would be needed to reach widespread or herd immunity by the summer, according to a recent estimate by the American Hospital Association. Wen says the pace should be even higher — closer to three million a day.\\n\\nIt's still unclear how the new administration will address the issue of vaccine hesitancy, the doubts and suspicions that keep many people from getting a shot. Polls show it's particularly a problem among Black Americans. It's important to acknowledge the reasons why it exists and work to earn trust and build vaccine confidence in communities, said Gracia.\\n\\nNext Wednesday, when Biden is sworn in as president, marks the anniversary of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States.\\n\\n___\\n\\nThe Associated Press and AP writer Josh Boak contributed to this report."}
{"original": "The Arab Spring revolution that spread to various countries after it started in January 2011, when Tunisians assembled in the streets of their capital and overthrew their longtime dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, has a been a failure, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).\\n\\nThe revolution shook the Middle East, setting off the hopeful uprisings that came to be known as the Arab Spring, notes the report.\\n\\nBut five years later, the countries that followed Tunisia's example could hardly be worse off, the hopes of their people dashed by new autocrats, strife, civil war and the rise of the virulent jihadism exemplified by the Islamic State [ISIS/ISIL] group, it continues.\\n\\nHafez Ghanem, vice president of the World Bank for the Middle East and North Africa, reminisces about the revolution in a recent book he authored — The Arab Spring Five Years Later: Toward Greater Inclusiveness — about the revolution.\\n\\nThose were exciting days. The democracy fever spread, he wrote, adding, But can a country with no democratic tradition and with weak institutions become a well-functioning democracy and improve the lives of its citizens overnight? The answer is obviously no.\\n\\nIt is clear that the Arab transition has taken on a violent, and even scary character, he also wrote, further stating, The Arab Spring is not a season. It is a first and important step on the long road to a new political, social and economic order.\\n\\nFew could have anticipated the wave of change to come weeks before Ben Ali stepped down after 23 years in power, notes AFP.\\n\\nA month earlier a street vendor named Mohamed Bouazizi had set himself on fire in the town of Sidi Bouzid, triggering the mass protests that eventually brought Ben Ali down, reports the French news agency. Tunisia was not only the first Arab Spring country but also it's only partial success story.\\n\\nJihadist violence has been on the rise since Ben Ali was overthrown, with the most notable of incidents being the Tunisian Bardo museum attacks and the assault on the country's Mediterranean resort that left at least 60 people dead, the majority of them foreign tourists.\\n\\nNevertheless, Tunisia has elected a new government and a group of four civil society organizations, dubbed the National Dialogue Quartet, received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2015 for helping to transition the country to democracy.\\n\\nElsewhere in the region, popular uprisings were less the beginnings of a new spring than preludes of harsh winters, reports AFP.\\n\\nIn Egypt, the ouster of Hosni Mubarak was followed by turbulent unrest and eventually a military overthrow of his Islamist successor Mohamed Morsi, the country's first civilian — and freely elected — president, it continues. Then-army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi took over and launched a harsh crackdown on Morsi's supporters, leaving hundreds dead and thousands in prison.\\n\\nEgypt's restive Sinai Peninsula has been plagued by jihadist violence. An ISIS affiliate there has claimed responsibility for a number of deadly attacks, including the downing of a Russian passenger plane in October that killed all 224 people onboard.\\n\\nIn Libya, an uprising against longtime leader [Muammar Gaddafi] quickly became an armed revolution backed by NATO, and his overthrow and killing in 2011 have been followed by continued strife and political chaos, points out AFP. Rival parliaments and governments are vying for power and UN efforts to bring about a unity government have so far failed.\\n\\n[ISIS] jihadists have gained an important foothold in [Gaddafi's] hometown Sirte and launched attacks, last week killing more than 50 people in a bombing at a police school in Zliten, the worst incident since the revolution, it adds.\\n\\nYemen has been afflicted by insecurity since longtime president Ali Abdullah Saleh was forced to step down by protesters. War broke out after Iran-allied Shiite Houthi rebels forced his successor Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi to flee to Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nSaudi Arabia launched a military intervention last March to support Hadi's government but there are few signs, despite UN peace efforts, of a war that has killed more than 6,000 people coming to an end, reports AFP.\\n\\nShiite protesters inspired by the Arab Spring also launched demonstrations against their Sunni rulers in Bahrain but were put down a month later. Sporadic unrest has continued, it adds.\\n\\nThe Arab Spring in Syria has also been a major failure.\\n\\nNowhere were the aspirations of the Arab Spring more disappointing than in Syria, where peaceful protests against President Bashar al-Assad evolved into a brutal civil war that has left more than 260,000 dead and forced millions from their homes, declares AFP.\\n\\nAfter nearly five years of war Syria is in ruins, its people scattered, many of them turned desperate refugees hoping to reach Europe, it adds. Much of the country has been taken over by [ISIS], which has declared a 'caliphate' in areas under its control in Syria and neighboring Iraq, committing widespread atrocities as it imposes its harsh interpretation of Islam."}

Climate Change May Be Part of the Answer\\n\\nAs bitter cold continues to grip much of North America and helps spawn the fierce storm along the East Coast, the question arises: What's the influence of climate change? Some scientists studying the connection between climate change and cold spells, which occur when cold Arctic air dips south, say that they may be related. But the importance of the relationship is not fully clear yet. The Arctic is not as cold as it used to be — the region is warming faster than any other — and studies suggest that this warming is weakening the jet stream, which ordinarily acts like a giant lasso, corralling cold air around the pole.\\n\\nThe facts need not detain us here – because there aren't any. It's just speculation – could, may – gleaned from conversations with tame experts at institutions like the notoriously alarmist and fervently left-wing Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. And there's plenty more nonsense where this came from, as Thomas Williams reported here earlier.\\n\\nThis determination to argue, against all evidence, that the planet is in a warming phase and that we must do more to try to cool it down would be quite funny if it didn't have such terrible real world consequences.\\n\\nOne of these is the current energy crisis being experienced across New England. Blue states which bought into the man-made global warming narrative, shut down their coal-fired power stations, rejected the Access Northeast Pipeline and instead, despoiled their landscapes with more ugly, expensive, bat-chomping, bird-slicing eco crucifixes are now paying a bitter price.\\n\\nAs Michael Bastasch reports at Climate Change Dispatch:\\n\\nUnrelenting cold since late December has caused energy demand to spike, pushing up prices and straining supplies. New England power companies are struggling to keep up with demand. New England's current energy woes are the result of years of state and federal policies aimed at closing coal and oil-fired power plants, largely as part of the region's effort to fight global warming.\\n\\nYep. It's true that mostly liberals are affected by this – and created this mess. But still, liberals' children feel the cold as badly as conservatives' children. In fact, being less robust and more snowflakey, probably even more so. Must they really suffer for their parents' stupidity?\\n\\nAnother is the havoc the green ideology has wreaked on honest science and on once-trustworthy government institutions such as National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\\n\\nThe doughty Paul Homewood has unearthed what looks very much like yet another NOAA data-rigging scandal.\\n\\nPut simply, researchers such as Marlene Kretschmer – the expert from the Potsdam Institute heavily quoted in the New York Times piece – are trying to pin recent cold winters on movements of the jet stream. This enables them to promote their global warming is still happening narrative. But for it to work it requires them to write off the recent cold winters, such as the one in 2013/14, as being anomalous – ie abnormally cold.\\n\\nIf they are anomalous, though, how come this fact doesn't show up in NOAA's temperature charts?\\n\\nHomewood notes:\\n\\nWhen she introduced [Kretschmer's] work on the subject in 2014, Jennifer Francis specifically referred to the severe cold snap that affected the Northeast in January and February 2014, using it as an example. The cold weather began on Jan 2nd, and lasted into April. Yet again NOAA show absolutely nothing unusual going on in either of those months.. Homewood smells a rat: Put very simply, NOAA's temperature record bears no relevance to reality.\\n\\nKnowing what I do of NOAA's data-faking track record, I think I'm inclined to agree…"}

{"original": "User losses and a drop-off in advertiser spending will be the focus for investors as Facebook gets ready to release their first-quarter results this week.\\n\\nAs Facebook prepares to release their first-quarter results this week following the company's most recent user data scandal, investors are focusing on user loss figures and watch for a drop-off in advertiser spending, according to Bloomberg. Facebook's shares have dropped by ten percent this year, largely due to the company's user data scandal which allegedly resulted in the user data of approximately 87 million users accessed without express permission and resulted in Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifying before Congress.\\n\\nFacebook is expected to report a daily active user count of approximately 1.45 billion, an increase from their fourth quarter when the company reported 1.4 billion daily active users. Monthly active users will likely rise to 2.19 billion up from 2.13 billion in the previous quarter. The company recently saw its first-ever decline in North American users and saw user time spent on the platform decline by five percent in the December month. Investors will be watching closely to see if these trends continue through the first few months of the new quarter.\\n\\nFacebook users are also reportedly spending 24 percent less time on the platform, this may be linked to the company's recent change in their news feed algorithm which has shifted to focus on posts from friends and family to the detriment of content publishers. CEO Mark Zuckerberg told shareholders that he expected a drop in user engagement because of the algorithm change, saying: By making these changes, I expect the time people spend on Facebook and some measures of engagement will go down.\\n\\nAnalysts are expecting to see a 42 percent increase in sales, to $11.4 billion, but investors are worried about future income after Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg revealed that a few advertisers had stopped serving ads on Facebook's platform following the recent user data scandal. It's estimated that Facebook's net income increased to approximately $1.38 a share.\\n\\nAnalysts at MKM discussed Facebook's handling of the user data scandal saying that they believe the company will take new aggressive measures to prevent the misuse of user data. While we think that existing expense guidance offers plenty of room to support such efforts, we think that commentary to appease regulators and users is a higher priority for management than near-term comfort to investors, said MKM analysts in a recent report."}

Manning, injured for much of the 2015 season, dramatically came off the bench to lead the Broncos to victory in the season-ending game against the San Diego Chargers. Fans wondered if he had played his last game in an orange uniform. But the popular player starts Sunday against the Steelers. Al Jazeera, on the other hand, imagined its program on Manning and other athletes as a hard-hitting piece of investigative journalism destined to win praise and catalyze change in the world of sports. Instead, it propelled change within media circles.\\n\\nI know the closure of AJAM will be a massive disappointment for everyone here who has worked tirelessly for our long-term future, network chief executive Al Anstey told staff. The decision that has been made is in no way because AJAM has done anything but a great job. Our commitment to great journalism is unrivaled.\\n\\nBut many, including Major League Baseball stars Ryan Howard and Ryan Zimmerman, contest that claim. The pair filed separate but similar defamation suits in Washington, DC, courts contesting allegations in The Dark Side that tied them to performance-enhancing drugs. Defendants publicly smeared Mr. Zimmerman with false and unsubstantiated allegations of performance-enhancing drug use, based on uncorroborated accusations by a third party that had been unequivocally recanted prior to Defendants' publication, the Washington Nationals infielder's suit claimed. Defendants knew full well that their 'source' had recanted his scandalous and untrue allegations against Mr. Zimmerman but, abdicating all journalistic responsibilities, Defendants nonetheless chose to publish their defamatory story in an attempt to stir scandal and increase Al Jazeera's low ratings, no matter the cost to Mr. Zimmerman.\\n\\nThe Qatar-based network, which spent $500 million to penetrate the American market with the purchase of Al Gore's Current TV, ceases operations on April 30."}
{"original": "Jim Caviezel, the actor who memorably portrayed Jesus in director Mel Gibson's 2004 blockbuster The Passion of the Christ, says that Gibson is planning a sequel that will be the biggest film in history. It's that good.\\n\\nThe Passion is already one the biggest films in history. Fourteen years on it still holds the domestic box office record for an R-rated movie ($371 million). From Gethsemane to Golgotha, The Passion told the story of the last 12 hours of Christ's life — his arrest, trials, torture, and crucifixion. The Faithful turned out in droves despite an unprecedented campaign within the elite media to smear a film they had not seen as anti-Semitic — which it is not.\\n\\nThe 49-year-old Caviezel says he is back on board to portray Jesus. The story will reportedly revolve around Christ's resurrection. There are things that I cannot say that will shock the audience, he told USA Today. It's great. Stay tuned.\\n\\nHollywood's anti-Christian bigotry was apparent in every major studios' incomprehensible refusal to distribute The Passion, a film helmed by a huge star, a proven talent who had already won a Best Director Oscar for Braveheart. Gibson, however, got the last laugh.\\n\\nOff a mere $30 million budget, Gibson still managed to get his film seen in enough theaters worldwide to gross a breathtaking $611 million.\\n\\nThe success of The Passion, which surprised no one who lives in the real world, immediately changed Hollywood. An industry that had been openly hostile to Christians almost immediately began producing and releasing faith-based films, a sea change that continues to this day.\\n\\nLast year, Gibson talked a little bit about his plans, The Resurrection. Big subject. Oh, my God, he told USA Today. We're trying to craft this in a way that's cinematically compelling and enlightening so that it shines new light, if possible, without creating some weird thing.\\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

{"original": "Despite my best efforts in the European Parliament to embarrass the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, by pointing out to him that during the revolving six month Dutch presidency of the European Council there is a European Union (EU) referendum in his home country, no one seems to have noticed.\\n\\nThis is not unusual as the UK political press are more interested in Boris's hairstyle than they are in the events on the continent. However there is a referendum in the Netherlands tomorrow, 6th April, on the EU-Ukrainian agreement.\\n\\nIn July of last year a new piece of legislation came into force in the Netherlands called the Advisory Referendum Act (ARA). In a country with no history of direct democracy the government probably felt confident that nobody would get over a third of a million verified, signed pieces of paper to trigger a national vote.\\n\\nHowever, a group of young bloggers at an organisation called GeenPeil took up the challenge and set about gaining signatures.\\n\\nMy experience of political bloggers all over the world is that whilst many of them may be very clever, few have the practical skills to even boil an egg let alone embark on a logistical exercise of this magnitude. (Editor's note: Can confirm!)\\n\\nTo the shock error of Mr. Rutte they managed to produce 420,000 verified signatures and the third referendum in the entire history of the nation had to be called.\\n\\nWhilst the question is about a trade deal and very soon visa-free access for Ukraine, few voters will have read the treaty itself. In reality this vote is a litmus test on the current state of Dutch public opinion about their entanglement with the European project.\\n\\nMany voters remember that in the summer of 2005, 61 per cent voted against the European Constitution only to find their expressed wishes completely ignored with the re-branded Lisbon Treaty and no powers surrendered by the EU. As ever, despite the wishes of the people, EU integration continued as if nothing had happened.\\n\\nSo I went to visit and my first assignment of the day showed me what an impressive young entrepreneurial team has been built up by this group. They are seriously organised. They have a campaign battle bus. They have 3,000 activists. This for an organisation that is not even a political party is impressive indeed.\\n\\nSo I set sail on an ancient Dutch sailing boat to make a video about my trip. Whilst out on the water and under sail I was a little perturbed by a constant buzzing noise. It sounded rather like an annoying wasp. But in fact was a drone.\\n\\nNinety minutes after we set foot back on dry land the GeenPeil video of my boating experience and interview was put online in the form of a film that included dramatic shots filmed by the drone.\\n\\nIt almost looked and sounded like Hollywood quality and on closer examination I discovered that video is how these guys contact their audience. Some of the videos they've made during this referendum campaign are laugh out loud funny and they are attracting significant numbers of young people.\\n\\nIn the evening I spoke at a public meeting. My life without public meetings would seem so empty. Dutch style they are little different. We began with a local singer and they even broke half way through so that people could go to the bar and get another beer.\\n\\nThe evening was infused with energy and fun. Virtually everyone in the room supported not just a no vote for the Ukraine being dragged into the European Union but they were all pro-Brexit as well. I'm confident that there will be a 'no' vote tomorrow and I believe that will give many British voters the encouragement to do the same on June 23rd.\\n\\nOur democracy and the means by which we examine it have already been fundamentally changed by the growth of the internet. I have a feeling that what this young team have achieved in the Netherlands could serve as a useful template for even more radical change in our democracy in the not too distant future.\\n\\nNigel Farage is the leader of the UK Independence Party"}
{"original": "President Donald Trump and a list of other high-profile speakers will address Stop the Steal protesters on Wednesday, Jan. 6, ahead of an effort by some congressional Republicans to challenge the certification of President-elect Joe Biden's electoral college victory, Breitbart News has learned.\\n\\nThousands of Trump supporters are expected to gather in Washington, DC, for the occasion, and members of Trump's team have been brought in to help organize the event which is officially being hosted by Women for America First.\\n\\nThe main event will happen on the Ellipsis at the White House—informally called the President's Lawn—a source familiar with the organizational efforts said. The president tweeted Sunday morning that he will be there on Wednesday.\\n\\nI will be there. Historic day! https://t.co/k6LStsWpfy — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2021\\n\\nThe president is expected to deliver remarks beginning at around 11 a.m. He will cap off an event at which several other high-profile names, including Kimberly Guilfoyle, Amy Kremer, Rudy Giuliani, Katrina Pierson, Boris Ephsteyn, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, Diamond and Silk, Georgia State Rep. Vernon Jones, Roger Stone, Benny Johnson, Scott Presler, Bernie Kerik, and Ali Alexander are all among those expected to speak, per a source involved in the matter.\\n\\nMany of these speakers, and others, will also speak on Tuesday, Jan. 5—the day before the official festivities—at an event at Freedom Plaza in downtown Washington, DC. But the main event is on Wednesday, at the Ellipsis at the White House.\\n\\nThe doors for the White House Ellipsis event will open at 7 a.m. on Wednesday, and while event-goers will not need to formally enter White House grounds through a White House gate there will be Secret Service checkpoints on the way in. Technically, event-goers do not need to register or have tickets, but are being encouraged to RSVP on the website MarchtoSaveAmerica.com.\\n\\nThe official program will begin around 9 a.m., and again will be capped by Trump's speech beginning around 11 a.m. When the president finishes his remarks, organizers then will lead a march up to the U.S. Capitol where they are expected to arrive around 1 p.m.—the time during which the new Congress, which is being sworn in on Sunday, will consider certification of the electoral college results.\\n\\nMore than a hundred House Republicans are expected to challenge the certification of the electoral college results, and they will be joined by at least a dozen Senate Republicans. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) was the first one to announce he would join House GOP challenges last week, and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) led an effort this weekend of 11 more Senate Republicans to join the cause.\\n\\nWith numbers like this, the effort is by far the most serious in modern history to challenge, via the process of Congress certifying the electoral college results, an election. There have been other attempts, like after Trump's win in 2016 in early 2017 some House Democrats tried to challenge the results but did not get a senator on board with their challenge. Also, in early 2005, some House Democrats joined with then-Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) to challenge then-President George W. Bush's re-election. That effort failed, as vast majorities in both chambers of Congress rejected it.\\n\\nThis effort is similarly expected to fail, as the Democrats control the U.S. House so despite the impressive showing of more than 100 House Republicans siding with Trump he will fall short of a majority in that chamber. Similarly, some Senate Republicans—ranging from Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) to Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) to Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) and even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell—have said they recognize Biden as the legitimate president-elect and will not go along with this effort.\\n\\nTherefore, given that the Senate GOP majority is tight—currently 52 members, which may change depending on what happens in Tuesday's runoff elections in Georgia where Sens. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) and David Perdue (R-GA) face Democrats Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff respectively—there are already not enough votes for Trump to even get a majority in the GOP-controlled Senate.\\n\\nNonetheless, the success of those cheering this challenge on in getting as many members of Congress as they have gotten on board this fight—even if it is doomed to fail no matter what—is remarkable. It also resembles the anger and fury of the GOP base in the wake of the Nov. 3 contest, and signals that Trump base voters are seeking fighters in the future for the party. But it is also a tough balancing act for GOP leaders, as they seek to show the base they are willing to fight but also attempt to move forward with the reality of an incoming Biden administration that is fast-approaching in just a couple weeks.\\n\\nThe U.S. Senate has not started holding hearings for Biden's cabinet picks, and may not start until after the inauguration. A large part of what will determine Biden's administration post selections' fates looms in Georgia on Tuesday, as those runoffs will ascertain which party controls the U.S. Senate for the foreseeable future and could mean the difference between some of Biden's selections getting confirmed or not.\\n\\nBut the energy on the right as evidenced by the thousands of Trump supporters who months after the election will still descend on Washington, DC, this week is something Republicans will seek to harness in the future as they go into battle with the incoming Biden administration and as they seek to retake the House majority in 2022 after winning unexpected gains in the 2020 congressional elections.\\n\\nUltimately, too, this will all culminate in the 2024 White House battle, with what is expected to be a huge field of potential contenders bidding for their shot at Trump's mantle, assuming he doesn't run again which is no foregone conclusion."}

{"original": "When Benjamin Netanyahu first became Israel's leader two decades ago, few would have predicted a future in which he would be poised to pass founding father David Ben-Gurion as its longest-serving prime minister.\\n\\nIn a country where no single political party has ever won an outright majority in parliament, voters have often had to trudge back to the polling stations after coalition governments have imploded before the end of their four-year terms.\\n\\nBut weeks after Bibi Netanyahu marked a cumulative 10 years in power, a political reality is dawning: the right-wing 66-year-old may not be popular with most Israeli voters, but there's no one else strong enough to unseat him.\\n\\nOn paper, Netanyahu's hold on power barely adds up: his right-wing coalition rules with only a one-seat majority in the 120-member Knesset. Nearly every vote is a nail-biter.\\n\\nAnd the majority of Israelis, according to an opinion poll last week, have grown weary of the blue-suited Likud party leader, with 51 percent saying they wouldn't want him to run in the next election, which isn't due until 2019.\\n\\nBut there's a catch: the survey, in the liberal Haaretz daily, also showed that voters haven't got much faith in any of the current line-up of opponents either.\\n\\nSo much so, that commentary accompanying the Haaretz poll said there would need to be a Big Bang – the creation of a new centrist alignment that might replace the so-far ineffective center-left opposition to Netanyahu.\\n\\nPolitical pundits say that line-up could be led by former Netanyahu allies – Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, who split from Likud to form his own party, and Gideon Saar, a former Likud minister who announced a break from politics in 2014 after feuding with the prime minister.\\n\\nA retired military chief, Gabi Ashkenazi, is still in the political closet but has been touted as a potential partner.\\n\\nKahlon's price-slashing reform of the cellular phone market as communications minister five years ago was widely popular, Saar could attract Likud voters dissatisfied with Netanyahu, and Ashkenazi has the kind of security credentials the Israeli electorate has traditionally embraced.\\n\\nUNBEATABLE IMAGE?\\n\\nOfer Kenig, a researcher on political reform at the Israel Democracy Institute, a think-tank, said that while Netanyahu is not very popular, he largely enjoys the lack of leadership in both his camp and the opposite camp.\\n\\nKenig is not convinced the perception of an unbeatable Netanyahu, fueled by what he called the big shock dealt to the Israeli left and center by Likud's last-minute victory in the 2015 election, is true.\\n\\nNevertheless, I think that in the last decade there is almost an automatic majority for the right-religious bloc and that it would require something special, a joining of forces in the center and left, in order to try to change that.\\n\\nAn earlier survey in the Jerusalem Post and Maariv newspapers hammered home the point: Netanyahu outpolled his main opposition rival, Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog, by a 56 to 25 percent margin.\\n\\nWithin Netanyahu's coalition, Naftali Bennett, the youthful head of the ultranationalist Jewish Home party, trailed him in popularity by a 40 to 29 percent margin.\\n\\nOnly Ben-Gurion, who declared Israel's independence in 1948 and served as prime minister on and off until 1963, has led the country longer than Bibi. Netanyahu, will break Ben-Gurion's 12-1/2-year record if he remains in office until Sept. 23, 2018, according to the Israel Democracy Institute.\\n\\nTo do so, the veteran politician must keep his government together. That has always been a struggle in Israel, but perhaps less so now: In the past, peace talks with the Palestinians have been a cause of coalition splits, but there haven't been any talks since 2014, and there are no signs of them resuming.\\n\\nSETTLEMENT EXPANSION\\n\\nWith world attention focused on hotter spots in the Middle East and Islamist militant bombings in Europe, Netanyahu has been moving ahead with settlement plans in the occupied West Bank. That is likely to appease ultranationalist political allies, helping to shore up his coalition.\\n\\nAnd he is also burnishing his image as Mr Security, playing on the fact that even if voters may not like him, they appear to trust him when it comes to tackling threats.\\n\\nOn Monday, a visibly relaxed Netanyahu visited Israeli military reservists in the occupied Golan Heights, choosing the occasion to let a secret out of the bag.\\n\\nHe confirmed numerous reports over several years that Israel has conducted dozens of air strikes across the nearby frontier with Syria against arms shipments to Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed guerrilla group that controls much of south Lebanon.\\n\\nThe disclosure, after Israel's refusal to acknowledge such attacks, perhaps out of desire not to provoke Hezbollah, came a day after he publicly put another security notch in his belt.\\n\\nA half-year-long surge in Palestinian street attacks against Israelis is waning, he told his cabinet on Sunday, attributing the decline to very firm action by Israeli security forces.\\n\\nIt's that tough talk that appears to keep the gray-haired Netanyahu one step ahead, fending off his rivals even as they look for new ways to unseat him.\\n\\n(Editing by Luke Baker and Giles Elgood)"}

In fact, on Monday, the fake news outlet announced it hired two anti-Trumpers who helped to drive the Weekly Standard into the ground.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nWhat can these guys, what can a 66-year-old John Kasich add to a last-place cable channel already overflowing with the only thing Kasich has to offer?

The media have an agenda. They want to drive Trump from office by any means necessary, including the use of violence, and will do anything to stop him from serving a second term or furthering his mandate. That I get… There is no mystery about that…\\n\\nBut ANOTHER Never Trump voice? Why add another soprano to a chorus already filled with sopranos?\\n\\nThe whole idea that Kasich might challenge Trump in 2020 for the Republican nomination is the biggest pile of fake news ever shoveled.\\n\\nDuring the 2016 Republican primary, and as that state's sitting governor, Kasich was only able to win with a plurality of Ohio votes. Other than Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) losing his home state to Trump, it does not get any more pathetic than that.\\n\\nWhat's more, in 2016, Kasich was still seen an something resembling a conservative. This was before he came out of the closet as a Democrat, as a pro-abortion governor in the pocket of left-wing unions.\\n\\nIf Kasich does challenge Trump for the nomination in 2020, it will be a total vanity project because his campaign is a non-starter.\\n\\nNow that Kasich has embraced the far-left, where will his establishment support come from — other than those willing to reveal that they too oppose right-to-work laws and support late-term abortion, not to mention Obamacare, gun control, open borders, high taxes, and the Climate Change hoax.\\n\\nOn every critical issue — Obamacare, guns, taxes, global warming, immigration, unions, Kasich is a Democrat, which makes the noise surrounding his 2020 grab for the GOP nomination a joke.\\n\\nSo let me ask again, why add an unnecessary voice to an already overstaffed chorus, someone who will be lost in the cacophony?\\n\\nWhat I see is a big political payoff, not only a direct payoff to Kasich, but a way to send a message to other Republicans that if they sell out, if they betray their own, CNN and the Washington Post and the New York Times and the rest of the media will pay you off, will create an unnecessary job for you as a reward, and do so regardless of your talent, popularity, credibility, or conservative credentials.\\n\\nObviously, this is a terrible business model. But the media are not about the business of journalism or even the business of business. This is all about a political agenda, and if that means creating a lucrative slush fund for Never Trump losers as a means to create more Never Trump losers, so be it.\\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

{"original": "Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock, who has worked as senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta for 15 years, has come under heavy scrutiny for his past speeches, sermons, writings, and run-ins with police as he challenges Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler in Georgia's U.S. Senate runoff election.\\n\\nCritics of Warnock have routinely labeled him radical, including Loeffler, who said during their last debate that Democrats want to fundamentally change America, and the agent of change is my opponent, radical liberal Raphael Warnock.\\n\\nBelow are nine of the most talked about issues, in no particular order, surrounding Warnock's Senate candidacy:\\n\\n1. Warnock's Wife Calls Him a 'Great Actor' After Alleging He Drove over Her Foot\\n\\nWarnock's then-wife, Ouleye Ndoye, told police in March her husband is a great actor and phenomenal at putting on a really good show in bodycam footage of Ndoye commenting to Atlanta police right after a domestic dispute. Ndoye accused Warnock of running over her foot with a car, according to a police report obtained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Warnock denied the accusation at the time, and a medical examiner later said Ndoye's foot did not show signs of injury.\\n\\nThe new bodycam footage shows Ndoye tearing up as she speaks to police after the incident, saying, I've tried to keep the way that he acts under wraps for a long time, and today he crossed the line. So that is what is going on here, and he's a great actor. He is phenomenal at putting on a really good show.\\n\\nWatch:\\n\\nGeorgia Democrat Raphael Warnock's ex-wife on his character after he allegedly ran over her foot with his car: I've tried to keep the way he acts under wraps for a long time, & today he crossed the line… He is a great actor. He is phenomenal at putting on a really good show. pic.twitter.com/0SuLy1IPub — Steve Guest (@SteveGuest) December 23, 2020\\n\\nWarnock's campaign responded to the footage by saying Loeffler has now stooped to a new low of attacking his family.\\n\\n2. Warnock Defends Rev. Jeremiah Wright\\n\\nWarnock has repeatedly defended Wright, who served as former pastor to President Barack Obama and is known for a number of incendiary statements — which Obama himself has condemned — including declaring that America's chickens are coming home to roost in regard to the 9/11 terrorist attacks and giving an impassioned sermon in which he shouted several times, God damn America!\\n\\nSpeaking to Greta Van Susteren in a 2008 Fox News appearance, Warnock said, We celebrate Rev. Wright in the same way that we celebrate the truth-telling tradition of the black church, which when preachers tell the truth, very often it makes people uncomfortable.\\n\\nDuring a 2013 speech, Warnock said Wright's God damn America sermon was a very fine homily entitled on confusing God and government and that it was consistent with black prophetic preaching. Warnock argued Wright's sermon had been taken out of context and noted that the black church was barely understood by mainstream America.\\n\\nThe Black Church Center for Justice and Equality posted a video in 2014 in which Warnock described Wright's God damn America sermon as Christian preaching at its best.\\n\\n3. Warnock Says America Needs to 'Repent for Its Worship of Whiteness'\\n\\nWarnock said while addressing Atlanta's Candler School of Theology in 2016, just before the presidential election, that America needs to repent for its worship of whiteness on full display.\\n\\nWatch:\\n\\n4. Warnock Says People Cannot Serve God and the Military\\n\\nWarnock said in a 2011 sermon, America, nobody can serve God and the military, a clip of which has garnered close to three million views online since it surfaced in November. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) called Warnock's words an insult to everyone who served — Georgia is home to several military installations, including Fort Benning, Fort Stewart, and Fort Gordon, and an analysis by 24/7 Wall St. found the state has the tenth-most active duty personnel in the country.\\n\\nThis is an insult to everyone who served. Raphael Warnock should withdraw. pic.twitter.com/64EmmpYlEm — Tom Cotton (@TomCottonAR) November 18, 2020\\n\\nResponding to the criticism in a press conference, Warnock said the sermon was a spiritual lesson about priorities, saying a person cannot have two masters. He said, My ultimate allegiance is to God, and therefore, whatever else that I may commit myself to, it has to be built on a spiritual foundation.\\n\\n5. Dr. James Cone Was Warnock's 'Mentor'\\n\\nWarnock has described Dr. James Cone, who often defended Marxism and used provocative, race-fueled language, as his mentor. Cone served as Warnock's academic adviser at the Union Theological Seminary, and Warnock considered Cone to be the father of black theology.\\n\\nIn My Soul Looks Back, Cone called for the total reconstruction of society along the lines of democratic socialism. In A Black Theology of Liberation, Cone argued that salvation comes from being like God and becoming black — that is, adopting total political solidarity with the black community. He determined that satanic whiteness makes white religionists incapable of perceiving the blackness of God; therefore, they must purge themselves of said whiteness. Cone wrote, There will be no peace in America until white people begin to hate their whiteness, asking from the depths of their being: 'How can we become black?'\\n\\nAfter his death, Warnock eulogized Cone, saying Cone spoke with the power and the moral authority of a prophet.\\n\\n6. Church Where Warnock Was Pastor Hosts Fidel Castro\\n\\nNew York's Abyssinian Baptist Church hosted communist Cuban dictator Fidel Castro while Warnock worked as a pastor there in 1995. Castro received a warm welcome at the gathering, including chants of Fidel! Fidel! Fidel!\\n\\nIn 2016, just after Castro's death, Warnock said, We remember Fidel Castro, whose legacy is complex. Don't let anyone tell you a simple story; life usually isn't very simple. His legacy is complex, kind of like America's legacy is complex.\\n\\n.@KLoeffler reacts to Raphael Warnock's nUaNcEd eulogy for murderous dictator Fidel Castro: https://t.co/xZ11njW7a6 — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) December 10, 2020\\n\\nWarnock has received enormous backlash for the association to Castro, who is widely considered responsible for thousands of innocent lives lost during his regime. Just last week, while campaigning in Georgia, South Carolina's senior senator, Sen. Lindsey Graham, asked a crowd, What kind of church is it that would invite Fidel Castro to come by and speak? Warnock is the most radical person to ever run for Senate in the history of Georgia.\\n\\nCNN's Jake Tapper asked Warnock about the issue in November. Warnock said, I was a youth pastor. I had nothing to do with that program. I did not make any decisions regarding the program. I have never met the Cuban dictator. And so I'm not connected to him. Tapper pressed further, But do you understand why people would be appalled by anyone celebrating Fidel Castro? Warnock responded, Well, absolutely. And I never have. What I'm putting forward in this race is American values.\\n\\n7. Warnock Defends Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam\\n\\nIn a 2013 sermon, Warnock praised the antisemitic Nation of Islam: Its voice has been important, and its voice has been important even for the development of black theology, Warnock said. As Breitbart News's Joel Pollak reported, the Nation of Islam is led by Louis Farrakhan, whose racist and antisemitic rhetoric has long been a matter of public record.\\n\\nWatch:\\n\\n8. Warnock Oversees Camp Suspected of Child Abuse\\n\\nWarnock worked as senior pastor of Baltimore's Douglas Memorial Community Church, which ran Camp Farthest Out, from about 2001 to 2005. The camp was suspected of child abuse in 2002, and according to a 2002 report by the Baltimore Sun, Warnock was arrested for interfering with a state trooper who was questioning the camp's counselors on the matter.\\n\\nWarnock has said his interference was due to making sure the counselors had the benefit of legal counsel.\\n\\nWarnock himself has not been accused of child abuse and little detail is public regarding the allegations against the camp; however, one of the camp's attendees, Anthony Washington, who was 12 years old at the time, recently detailed his experience at the camp to the Washington Free Beacon. Washington said he received a financial settlement after filing a lawsuit against the camp alleging child abuse, including an instance of counselors pouring urine on him and punishing him by forcing him to sleep outside.\\n\\nLoeffler told Breitbart News she found the allegations disgusting and chastised Warnock for refusing to answer questions about the allegations.\\n\\n9. Warnock Does Not Denounce Marxism, Describes Marxism as Useful\\n\\nIn their last debate, Loeffler asked Warnock whether he would denounce Marxism, and Warnock evaded the question. The momentous exchange was widely circulated online and has since been incorporated into Loeffler's stump speeches as evidence of Warnock's radical viewpoints.\\n\\nWatch:\\n\\nThe question stemmed in part from Warnock's past writings, which reveal his interest in Marxism, a philosophy named for Communist Manifesto author Karl Marx that has been employed by oppressive governments such as those of China and the Soviet Union.\\n\\nIn his 2014 book, The Divided Mind of the Black Church: Theology, Piety, and Public Witness, Warnock espoused Marxism, saying it has much to teach the black church. Warnock cited more than 30 separate works by the aforementioned Cone in his book, including several works on Marxism.\\n\\nWrite to Ashley Oliver at aoliver@breitbart.com."}

Spending bills start in the House of Representatives. The most responsible for the spending bill is the speaker of the House. He could have stood firm in the position we passed earlier in the week. I wish he would have done that. Do I think the speaker has problems? Yes I do, particularly now as we head into this big immigration debate. Just a few years ago he was viewed as the fiscal — the leader of fiscal responsibility in our party and now he presides over a bill that increases spending $300 billion dollars, a trillion dollar deficit. When we were so poised to win this fight. Of course he's got problems, but the key is let's see what happens next–\\n\\nWALLACE: You say he's got problems Congressman, is it time for a change?\\n\\nJORDAN: Well look, we'll have that debate at the appropriate time. You asked me if he has—if there are concerns with the Speaker. I think there are big concerns because he just presided over one of the biggest spending increases in the history of this country at a time where we were elected to do just the opposite."}

{"original": "The archbishop of Washington, DC, Cardinal Wilton Gregory, issued a statement Wednesday suggesting that some of the blame for the violence in the nation's Capitol falls on the shoulders of President Trump.\\n\\nThe divisive tone that has recently so dominated our national conversations must change, Cardinal Gregory said, in apparent reference to Trump. Those who resort to inflammatory rhetoric must accept some responsibility for inciting the increasing violence in our nation.\\n\\nCardinal Gregory, the first black American cardinal, has been an outspoken critic of Trump, accusing him of racism and divisiveness.\\n\\nI fear that recent public comments by our President and others and the responses they have generated, have deepened divisions and diminished our national life, the archbishop declared in August 2019 after the president had sharply criticized Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) for his verbal attack on Homeland Security officers and the conditions at the U.S.-Mexico border.\\n\\nOur faith teaches us that respect for people of every race, religion, gender, ethnicity and background are requirements of fundamental human dignity and basic decency, Gregory said, seeming to imply that Trump's words were motivated by racism. This include newcomers to our country, people who have differing political views and people who may be different from us.\\n\\nWe all need to reject racism, disrespect or brutality in speech and action, he said, adding that racism occurs when we ignore the fundamental truth that, because all humans share a common origin, they are all brothers and sisters, all equally made in the image of God.\\n\\nWe must all take responsibility to reject language that ridicules, condemns, or vilifies another person because of their race, religion, gender, age, culture or ethnic background, the archbishop said.\\n\\nAs an American, a Christian, a Catholic pastor, I pray that our President, other national leaders and all Americans will do all we can to respect the dignity of all God's children and nothing to further divide our nation. The growing plague of offense and disrespect in speech and actions must end, Gregory concluded.\\n\\nThis past June, Gregory once again attacked the president, declaring that his visit to the shrine of Saint John Paul II in Washington, DC, was a photo opportunity and a manipulation of a Catholic sanctuary, adding that it violates our religious principles.\\n\\nI find it baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree, the archbishop said.\\n\\nIn point of fact, the purpose of Trump's visit to the shrine, which commemorated the 41st anniversary of John Paul's historic visit to Poland in 1979, was to issue an executive order on advancing international religious freedom, a topic dear to the heart of Pope John Paul II.\\n\\nReligious freedom, America's first freedom, is a moral and national security imperative, the Trump order stated. Religious freedom for all people worldwide is a foreign policy priority of the United States, and the United States will respect and vigorously promote this freedom.\\n\\nIn late November, Cardinal Gregory announced that he would gladly give Holy Communion to Joe Biden, in deference to the practice established by former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick of offering Communion to pro-abortion politicians.\\n\\nIn 2004, Gregory, then president of the U.S. Bishops' Conference, joined McCarrick in opposing Rome's call for withholding Communion from Catholic politicians who support abortion.\\n\\nIn December 2020, Archbishop Charles Chaput responded to Cardinal Gregory by criticizing bishops who indicate their willingness to give Holy Communion to Joe Biden despite his overt support for abortion.\\n\\nPublic figures who identify as 'Catholic' give scandal to the faithful when receiving Communion by creating the impression that the moral laws of the Church are optional, the former archbishop of Philadelphia said. And bishops give similar scandal by not speaking up publicly about the issue and danger of sacrilege.\\n\\nIn reference to Gregory's remarks, Chaput also noted that bishops contribute to the scandal when they act as if supporting abortion does not harm a person's relationship with the Church.\\n\\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome"}
{"original": "CUMMING, Georgia — Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) suggested at a campaign event Saturday that anyone telling voters to boycott the general election results by refusing to vote in Georgia's Senate runoff election on January 5 has a different agenda in mind.\\n\\nCruz, speaking to reporters after appearing at the event for incumbent Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) Saturday morning, commented on the issue of voter fraud just before he and several other senators and senators-elect released a statement announcing they would object to the electoral college results on January 6, the day Congress is expected to certify those results.\\n\\nThe statement cited unprecedented allegations of voter fraud, violations and lax enforcement of election law, and other voting irregularities in the presidential election and called for an emergency ten-day audit to restore faith in democracy.\\n\\nIn his remarks to reporters, Cruz said:\\n\\nLook, I'm angry about the abuse of power that we've seen. Voter fraud is a real problem. It's a persistent problem. It's a problem in Georgia and across the country, but the answer isn't to stay home and hand control of the government over to the radical left and over to the extreme socialists.\\n\\nCruz said those pushing the theory that conservatives should stay home on Tuesday — they've got a different agenda in mind. They want the hard left to take over this country.\\n\\nAmong those who have encouraged Georgians to sit out voting are two attorneys, Lin Wood and Sidney Powell, who told attendees at a press conference December 2 that they should not vote in the upcoming election until state leaders fix the alleged issue of voter fraud. Wood later reportedly told the New Yorker that hundreds of thousands of Georgians are not going back to the polls out of disgust for the Georgia GOP. Wood, specifically, has a history of supporting Democrats, as Breitbart News reported, although he claims to be Republican.\\n\\nCruz, by contrast, said he has found conservatives are eager to vote. I've got to tell you, every conservative that I know is committed to standing up and fighting to defend our rights, and the anger you feel, let me encourage you to channel it into fighting to save the Senate and save America, Cruz said, adding:\\n\\nI think the stakes are that great, without exaggeration. These two Senate races in the state of Georgia I believe are the most important Senate races of our lifetimes because the gulf between what would happen with a Chuck Schumer radical Democrat Senate versus keeping it as a Republican Senate is massive.\\n\\nDuring the event, while speaking to a large crowd gathered in the Good ol' Days Bar and Grill parking lot, both Cruz and Loeffler quoted a variation of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's (D-NY) celebratory remarks when media declared Joe Biden president-elect: Now we take Georgia, then we change America! Schumer said on November 7.\\n\\nCruz warned that the radical left intends to go after and try to take away our right to free speech. They intend to take away our religious liberty rights. They intend to take away the Second Amendment, the right to keep and bear arms. We're not gonna let them do that.\\n\\nHe concluded, I think the common sense of the good men and women of Georgia is going to pull this country back from the brink and is going to protect and preserve our liberty.\\n\\nWrite to Ashley Oliver at aoliver@breitbart.com."}

{"original": "Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation, former Obama HUD Secretary and former mayor of San Antonio Julián Castro said he did not believe that we should have family detention for people that are seeking asylum or refugee status.\\n\\nOn Saturday, Castro announced he is running for president in 2020.\\n\\nPartial transcript as follows:\\n\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The president visited your home state of Texas this week, went to the border, said there is a humanitarian and national security crisis. Do you agree with him that there is a crisis at the border?\\n\\nCASTRO: What I believe is that he's created a tragedy at the border. This policy of separating children from their parents and the terrible way that Customs and Border Protection has managed its responsibilities, including the deaths of two children within the last few weeks. That's a real tragedy. And, you know, the folks down on the border know – and many of them have said – in fact, I just saw one border resident the other day on camera that said that a wall is not the answer. That we can have strong border security with personnel, with technology, but that the wall is not the answer. So the president may have his rhetoric, but everybody else has the facts right that a wall isn't the answer.\\n\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well that family separation policy has been paused at least. But there are a record number of family units crossing the border, and that creates a lot of challenges. So what would you do? Would you extend the amount of time that families can be held together in detention?\\n\\nCASTRO: I don't believe that we should have family detention for people that are seeking asylum or refugee status so that we should develop other ways to ensure that people are processed, that we're able to keep track of them in the country. And we have developed some ways to do that but that we don't detain them the way that we have been. So no, I don't agree with that. The other thing I'll say Margaret, and this is very important is, I hope that folks remember that the president said that he wanted to do this family separation policy because it would deter more families coming from these countries. And actually, the exact opposite happened. And so he's failed. He's a failed leader on this issue, and now he's just trying to stoke his political base by bringing up the wall all the time. And it's just a failure of leadership all around. I would end this kind of family detention. I would make sure that we invest in sensible, smart and effective border security that includes personnel, that includes the smart use of technology, and that does not scapegoat these immigrants but tries to look for a way that we can get to comprehensive immigration reform to fix our broken immigration system.\\n\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You've been calling immigration system broken for some time, and you were critical even under the Obama administration, specifically about their high level of deportations. So what do you offer as an alternative if you're not going to detain and you're not going to deport what do you do with illegal immigrants?\\n\\nCASTRO: Well, what I believe we could do and what the Obama administration did do I believe toward the end of its tenure was to look at things like ankle monitors so that you're able to monitor where people are in the country and ensure that they report back when they need to and that they are part of, you know, legal proceedings. But we also need to be serious about recognizing the right of people to seek asylum. And the president is playing games with this, blocking people's right to seek asylum. I would change that. I would make sure that we push as hard as possible for comprehensive immigration reform so that for the people who are already here, if they've been law-abiding, if they pay a fine, that- that they can get an earned path to citizenship. I still believe that that should be part of the answer."}

It is unlikely, in fact, that such an exhibit would even be permitted on campus, which would suggest a mentality that racism against blacks is wrong but when directed at whites it is somehow acceptable.\\n\\nIn praise of the exhibit, Trope said that the work has already prompted many generative conversations with participation by those who align with the sentiments and those who do not.\\n\\nThe website for the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism offers a brief lexicon of the keywords needed to appreciate the exhibit in all its depth.\\n\\nThe whiteness that needs dismantling is not just a person's color but everything that goes with it, from their unmarked and unnamed place of advantage, privilege or domination that comes from being white, to a lens through which white people tend to see themselves and others, or even an organizing principle that shapes institutions, policies, and social relations.\\n\\nPatriarchy, on the other hand, is a political-social system in which males hold a disproportionately large share of power.

Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) and David Perdue (R-GA) in Georgia's runoff elections this month after the state's foreign-born population ballooned over the last three decades.\\n\\nWarnock, who beat Loeffler with 51 percent of the vote, won huge majority support from Georgia's two largest immigrant populations — winning 64 percent of Hispanics and 60 percent of Asian Americans. In contrast, Loeffler won less than 4-in-10 Hispanics and about 40 percent of Asians.\\n\\nOssoff pulled off a similar feat, gaining support from 64 percent of Hispanics and nearly 6-in-10 Asians compared to Perdue's 36 percent with Hispanics and 41 percent with Asians.\\n\\nAccording to the New York Times, the Democrat wins are fueled by the state's changing demographics that could mean that Georgia has finally achieved battleground status, for which the Democrat Party has long worked. Days before the election, Democrat activists gleefully cheered that the state had become their new California with a trajectory of change.\\n\\nAs much of the establishment media has acknowledged, much of the Democrats' success in Georgia is due to the nation's annual admission of 1.2 million legal immigrants a year who can eventually become naturalized citizens and sponsor foreign relatives for green cards. The process is known as chain migration.\\n\\nBefore President George H.W. Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990, Georgia's foreign-born population stood at about 2.7 percent of its total population with fewer than 200,000 foreign-born residents in the state.\\n\\nToday, Georgia is home to nearly 1.1 million foreign-born residents who make up more than 10 percent of the state's population — a 515 percent increase in three decades. Nearly 3-in-10 of these foreign-born residents are Asian and another almost 4-in-10 are Hispanic.\\n\\nMost significantly for Democrats, though, is that in 1990, less than 40 percent of foreign-born residents in Georgia were naturalized citizens and thus eligible to vote if they were 18-years-old or older. Today, more than 45 percent, or about 480,000, of the state's foreign-born residents are naturalized citizens and thus eligible to vote once they hit 18-years-old.\\n\\nThe number of foreign-born voters and their voting-age children in Georgia has boomed by 337 percent since 2000 while the native-born voting-age population in Georgia has increased just 22 percent over that same period.\\n\\nAs has occurred in Virginia, the booming of Georgia's foreign-born population is making the state increasingly favorable to Democrats. President-Elect Joe Biden won the state by a slim margin of 0.2 percent against President Donald Trump, according to state election officials.\\n\\nThe establishment media has repeatedly noted the impact of immigration on the Democrats' odds in congressional districts, swing states, and presidential elections.\\n\\nIn 2019, for example, an analysis by the Atlantic's Ronald Brownstein revealed that congressional districts with a foreign-born population above the national average, a little more than 14 percent, have a 90 percent chance of being won by Democrats over Republicans.\\n\\nThe single biggest threat to Republicans' long-term viability is demographics, Axios reporters Jim VandeHei and Mike Allen wrote in 2019. The numbers simply do not lie … there's not a single demographic megatrend that favors Republicans.\\n\\nAt current legal immigration levels, Georgia's foreign-born population is set to continue expanding. By 2040, research by the Center for Immigration Studies states that the U.S. will have brought 15 million new foreign-born voters to the U.S. — eight million of which will have arrived through chain migration.\\n\\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Protesters have tried to reach the presidential Elysee Palace, which is protected like a bunker.\\n\\nSaturday's march had been declared in advance and approved, in contrast to some illegal December demonstrations that degenerated into vandalism, looting and chaos.\\n\\nThe latest demonstration was a sort of test of the movement's staying power after proposals by Macron to address concerns of the French who have a hard time making ends meet, including canceling the fuel tax hikes at the origin of the protests.\\n\\nInterior Minister Christophe Castaner estimated that about 50,000 people participated in protests around France on Saturday. Police counted some 3,500 protesters in Paris.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was initially calm in the French capital, but turned when some protesters tried to cross the river on a pedestrian bridge not on the official route from City Hall to the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament. Police used clubs and tear gas, then held the bridge in a standoff while violence broke out.\\n\\nVideo on French TV showed a man repeatedly stomping on an officer in riot gear on the ground and hitting the shield of another officer.\\n\\nSome confrontations took place in other cities around France, with tear gas fired in Bordeaux and in Rouen in Normandy.\\n\\nProtesters were looking to breathe new life into the yellow vest movement, named after the fluorescent protective gear French motorists must keep in their cars. The protests were launched in anger over fuel tax hikes, but have swelled with broader anger over Macron's economic policies, deemed to favor the rich.\\n\\nOn Saturday, protesters reiterated a call for Macron to resign.\\n\\nResolution 2019: Demacronize, read one sign. Power to the people, read another.\\n\\nGovernment spokesman Griveaux had said on Friday that those who show up to protest want insurrection as the movement appears to wane and radicalize.\\n\\nHe called on the French people to express their views during an upcoming national debate rather than by taking to the streets.\\n\\nRead the original story below:\\n\\nLaunched in November over French President Macron's attempt to pursue green policies by making car ownership unaffordable through punitive fuel taxes, the Yellow Vest movement has since transformed into a broader protest group that pulls in activists from across the political spectrum.\\n\\nMacron's back on the offensive https://t.co/9B811MhZBA — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 1, 2019\\n\\nOne of the key demands now being pushed by protesters after Macron bowed to pressure in December and gave in on the green taxes is the introduction of so-called Citizen Initiative Referendums, or 'RIC'.\\n\\nUnder the plans called for by the marchers, any petition in France that gained 700,000 signatures would be legally required to be put to a binding national referendum, with politicians forced to honour the results. The votes could be used to create or change laws, amend the constitution, and even fire the President.\\n\\nNew polling this week revealed the French public overwhelmingly support the idea, which if implemented would have the impact of dramatically reducing the power of politicians and handing it to the people. Some 80 per cent of French are thought to support of the initiative, while 47 per cent believed the Macron government was going to ignore the public.\\n\\nProtests took place outside French Mainstream Media Headquarters https://t.co/Ymiag7YBfA — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 29, 2018\\n\\nNow in its eighth week, Saturday's march saw fewer marchers than the tens of thousands seen nationwide in November, but also less of the violence that has marred some marches. Some political observers including populist leader Marion Marechal have suggested the violence was visited upon the marches by hard-left agent provocateurs using the grassroots movement as a pretext for violence.\\n\\nAhead of the protest on Friday, government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux criticised the movement, saying those taking to the streets are agitators who want insurrection and, basically, to overthrow the government.\\n\\nAnger among the protesters intensified this week after prominent Yellow Vest organiser Eric Drouet was arrested by police who said he'd organised an illegal demonstration. So far 216 Yellow Vest activists are in jail either sentenced or awaiting trial, and over 4,5000 were arrested in relation to the protests in 2018."}

{"original": "Americans must abandon their ambitions to raise their children in suburban greenery because the country is getting too crowded, says a pro-immigration immigrant at the New York Times.\\n\\nLet's Quit Fetishizing the Single-Family Home, said the headline to an op-ed by columnist Farhad Manjoo in the February 5 edition of the New York Times.\\n\\nThe reign of the single-family home is over. Whatever its habitable charms and nostalgic appeal, the single-family home is out of step with the future, Manjoo writes.\\n\\nThat future — according to Manjoo — is the continued immigration of millions of people from India, Africa, China, and elsewhere.\\n\\nManjoo writes about his childhood in the California Dream [of] sun-drenched suburbs that his father provided in the less-crowded 1980s. That dream now looks prohibitive: Houses with backyards in my neck of the woods require tech-I.P.O. levels of insane wealth, he complains.\\n\\nHe cannot afford to give his own children what his father gave him, so he beats his sunny memories into a progressive sword:\\n\\nAnd yet, wistful though I may remain for my suburban-sprawl childhood, these days I find myself continually amazed and befuddled by my state's insane fetishization of an anachronistic model of urban development. Why — when the case for some better way of living has become so painfully obvious — can't California quit propping up its endless rows of single-family houses? Why can't so much of America?\\n\\nManjoo is one of many young status-seeking progressives who want to abolish the ideal suburbia because they cannot afford to buy housing in fashionable districts. So he wants government to help investors fracture, diversify, split, and subdivide ordinary Americans' suburbia into affordable mini-homes, duplexes, four-unit apartments, and parking lots.\\n\\nHis demand for suburbia's death comes after he helped to make suburbia expensive by urging more immigration.\\n\\nMost migrants are clever and hard-working. So their intense competition for jobs and housing lowers wages and inflates housing prices. The resulting housing crisis is most obvious in Manjoo's high-migration state of California:\\n\\nCalifornia's poverty rate is worse than Alabama & Mississippi, says Census Bureau. The major cause of this huge change is immigration policy which spikes housing costs & shrinks wages — and delivers huge gains for investors in real-estate & corp. shares. https://t.co/mEjCP83Hkr — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) September 13, 2019\\n\\nManjoo does not entirely break the media taboo against mentioning the harms caused by mass migration. But he gets close by blaming California's crisis on too many people:\\n\\nIn an era constrained by sustainability and affordability, a big house with a backyard should be a rarity. Much of California is straining under its own success: We have too many people and too few places for them to live, offered at too-high prices, in too many areas touched-by-climate-change-related menaces, like wildfires, all too far from where people work. And the solution is so painfully obvious it feels almost reductive to point it out: Make it legal to build more housing that houses more people.\\n\\nManjoo is one of the open-borders progressive pundits who helped spike housing prices. My family came to the United States from our native South Africa in the late 1980s, Manjoo wrote in January 2019 as he argued for open borders:\\n\\nEconomically and strategically, open borders isn't just a good plan — it's the only chance we've got. America is an aging nation with a stagnant population. We have ample land to house lots more people, but we are increasingly short of workers.\\n\\nManjoo's self-defeating views are perfume for investors, real estate owners, and employers — including Democrats Tom Steyer and Mike Bloomberg. They have the wealth to profit from any inflow of immigrant consumers, renters and home-buyers, and workers.\\n\\nA booklet by the investor-funded Economic Innovation Group says:\\n\\nThe relationship between population growth and housing demand is clear. More people means more demand for housing, and fewer people means less demand. … As a result, a shrinking population will lead to falling prices and a deteriorating, vacancy-plagued housing stock that may take generations to clear. … The potential for skilled immigrants to boost local housing markets is clear. Notably, economist Albert Saiz (2007) found a 1% increase in population from immigration causes housing rents and house prices in U.S. cities to rise commensurately, by 1%.\\n\\nBut Manjoo is a clever pundit who can parlay his self-defeating politics into pleasing rationalizations:\\n\\nSingle-family zoning was one of the many ways white homeowners and politicians kept African-Americans out of suburbs. … I don't feel so bad. Our attached townhouse, on a piece of land a small fraction of the size of a single-family home, is less of a burden on the environment, and it is just the right size for the four of us. It's also just as loving and pleasant a place for my kids to grow up in as my own suburban manse was for me."}
{"original": "This year marks the 40th anniversary of Jeane Kirkpatrick's Dictatorships and Double Standards, an essay that changed the world.\\n\\nCommentary magazine, which published all of its 9,800 words, calls it The Classic Essay That Shaped Reagan's Foreign Policy—and few would argue.\\n\\nIn 1981, Kirkpatrick was named by President Ronald Reagan to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and the rest is history. The decisions made by Reagan in the early 80s, with Kirkpatrick as a key adviser, led, just a few years later, to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Changed the world, indeed.\\n\\nAnd yet even with the Soviets gone, today, another empire, China, threatens us. Indeed, the Chinese, at the rate they're going, could prove to be more of a threat to us as than the Soviets at their worst.\\n\\nIn the meantime, now, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on an eight-day trip to the Middle East, visiting our allies in the region, seeking to bolster regional strength against another rival, Iran. Some of those allies—most notably, Saudi Arabia and Egypt—are intensely controversial here at home, and so that's another reason why Kirkpatrick's wisdom is still so relevant, and important.\\n\\nSo just what was it in Kirkpatrick's article that made it, and her, so influential? And why is it worth remembering four decades later?\\n\\nIn her piece, Kirkpatrick focused on the foreign-policy failings of President Jimmy Carter, who had so badly mishandled the Cold War against the Soviets. The immediate issue, back then, was that the Carter administration was more critical of non-democratic allies than of actively anti-democratic enemies. Hence the double standard in Kirkpatrick's title; our non-democratic allies were scorned, while our anti-democratic enemies were sometimes even praised. Indeed, the Carterites seemed determined actually to depose pro-American autocratic regimes, thus paving the way for pro-Soviet totalitarian regimes.\\n\\nAs Kirkpatrick wrote, It is this belief which induces the Carter administration to participate actively in the toppling of non-Communist autocracies while remaining passive in the face of Communist expansion.\\n\\nKirkpatrick thus put her finger on a central and enduring aspect of liberalism: namely, the instinct to focus intensely on the small flaws of friends, while being blind to the larger flaws of foes. She derided this liberal impulse as a formula for self-abasement and apology. And we might add that this mindset never seems to change—hence, decades later, Barack Obama's notorious apology tours.\\n\\nAt its root, such thinking seems based on the idea that if a foreign government chooses to ally itself with the U.S., then that government can't be much good. Why not? Because, as liberals like to believe, the U.S. isn't so good, either. And this attitude, Kirkpatrick added, was a form of masochism.\\n\\nIndeed, when Kirkpatrick's article appeared, the Carter administration was meekly watching as a string of allied governments were being overthrown, including those of Somalia, Afghanistan, Nicaragua, and Iran.\\n\\nIn each instance, we might add, the Soviets were active on the other side—sometimes in a big way, sometimes in a lesser way. And just a few years earlier, Moscow had helped to engineer communist victories in Vietnam, Cambodia, Angola, and Mozambique. This was the reality of the Cold War—the Russians were playing for keeps.\\n\\nYet in the midst of this cascade of geopolitical dominoes, the Carter administration—its diplomacy led by Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, the pluperfect guilt-ridden liberal—was not only unconcerned but, sometimes, actually pleased. That's because the Carter administration, having come in preaching about human rights, was determined to hold friends to a far higher standard than enemies. As Kirkpatrick wrote of the administration, It actively collaborated in the replacement of moderate autocrats friendly to American interests with less friendly autocrats of extremist persuasion.\\n\\nAs Ronald Reagan often said during the Carter era, The most dangerous thing for a country is to be an ally of the U.S.\\n\\nKirkpatrick's point was that the U.S. had to be smart about its friends and its enemies. That is, we had to realize that an imperfect friend was a lot better than an implacable enemy. In a word, it's important to realistic, to deal with the world as it is. And it's also important to deal with the fact that not everyone in the world is going to live up to our standards of purity—and yet if they're friendly to us, well, that's a good thing, not a bad thing. As Franklin D. Roosevelt's secretary of state, Cordell Hull, reportedly once quipped about one pro-America dictator, He may be a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch.\\n\\nIndeed, the Roosevelt administration made some notably hard-nosed choices about working with sons-of-bitches—and worse. For instance, during World War Two, FDR made the wise decision to actively aid the Soviet Union in its fight against Nazi Germany. Roosevelt's logic was as simple as it was impeccable: The Soviets were bad, but the Nazis were much worse. After all, it was Hitler who declared war on the U.S.\\n\\nFDR's decision was intensely controversial at the time, and yet for the sake of American lives, it was absolutely necessary. The Red Army bore the brunt of the fighting in World War Two, and that was the fighting that spared our GIs. In fact, the Russians inflicted 75 percent of the casualties suffered by the Germans in the entire war.\\n\\nIn her 1979 essay, Kirkpatrick never claimed that human rights and democracy were unimportant; she simply argued that the American national interest was more important. Indeed, it's worth noting that in recent decades, some authoritarian allies of the U.S.—including South Korea, Taiwan, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile—have evolved into functioning democracies, and those countries are stronger as a result. So yes, it's possible for our friends to improve and for the Free World to expand; it's just that the process must be handled with the utmost care.\\n\\nSo now to the present day. As we have seen, Secretary Pompeo is currently traveling the Middle East, seeking to rally our allies against Iran. As Pompeo declared in Cairo on January 10, in the showcasing policy speech of his Middle East trip, We ask every peace-loving nation of the Middle East to shoulder new responsibilities for defeating Islamist extremism wherever we find it. And in sharp contrast to the liberal apologetics of Obama and others, Pompeo added, The age of self-inflicted American shame is over.\\n\\nOf course, inevitably, Pompeo will be dealing with leaders, and with regimes, that don't meet the standards of our national ideals.\\n\\nFor instance, there's Saudi Arabia, which has admitted its culpability in the death of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist. Khashoggi's death was an outrage, but still, we must ask ourselves: Should the terrible fate of one person, who was not even a U.S. citizen, be used as a reason to overturn a seven-decade-long friendship with the Saudis?\\n\\nIndeed, we must also ask: If anything were to happen to the current government in Riyadh, who would take power? Al Qaeda? ISIS? Iran? Pompeo's answer is, in effect, that for the foreseeable future, we must stick with the current regime, and one would bet that Kirkpatrick, who died in 2006, would agree.\\n\\nAnd then there's Egypt. Its president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, is strongly pro-American; he's even friendly to Israel. And yet he is being roasted by the Main Stream Media for human rights violations. And liberal groups, too, are joining in the chorus.\\n\\nYet the question, always, is, Compared to what? That is, what's the plausible alternative to el-Sisi and his heavy-handed ways? It's worth recalling that el-Sisi, while no democrat, is a vast improvement over what came before—namely, the rule of the Muslim Brotherhood. In fact, the Brotherhood was so scary that back in 2013, when el-Sisi seized power, even the Obama administration praised the move.\\n\\nIt's worth keeping in mind that el-Sisi's government must fight a low-grade war against murderous Islamist radicals; just on December 29, terrorists killed three Vietnamese tourists and an Egyptian tour guide. In response, the Egyptian military struck back, killing 40 alleged terrorists. The situation in Egypt certainly isn't pretty, but so long as his country is under siege, what else can el-Sisi do?\\n\\nIn the meantime, the Egyptian strongman is trying to make his country more inclusive to minorities; just on January 6, el-Sisi, himself a Muslim, joined in the inauguration of a new Coptic Christian church in Cairo, signaling to that beleaguered community that he has their back.\\n\\nSo yes, el-Sisi is a friend to the U.S., and, under the Trump administration, the U.S. is a friend to him. Again, it's a safe bet that Kirkpatrick, were she still with us, would agree that it's better to have him as a friend than someone else as an enemy.\\n\\nWe could go down the list of all the Arab countries that Pompeo is visiting and conclude that the regimes, noxious as they might be to human-rights purists, are a whole lot better than any possible successor. And all of them are, for sure, an improvement over the regime that the Iranians, if they could, would put in place.\\n\\nFinally, looming over all pro-American countries—and, in fact, over just about every country in the world—is the threat of China. China, of course, is a human rights-violator second to none: Even if we put its Maoist mass-murderous past aside, today, we see that it is defiantly anti-democratic; it routinely suppresses Christians, as well as Tibetans and other minorities and dissidents, including the Falun Gong. Indeed, it's reliably reported to have preemptively locked up as many as one million Muslims, without even the pretense of a legal trial.\\n\\nMeanwhile, beyond China's borders, the Belt and Road initiative of the People's Republic, while officially peaceful and cooperative, is, in fact, a key part of that country's bid for global dominion. It was Bloomberg News—not exactly a mouthpiece for hawks—that summed up China's goals in a stark headline late last year: Xi Jinping's Plan to Dominate the World. And oh yes: the Chinese are also busy hacking into America; there's a new report on China's cyber-espionage against the U.S. virtually every day.\\n\\nSo today, Pompeo and the Trump administration, operating as Kirkpatrick-type realists, believe that the U.S. has an affirmative duty to look out for itself. And that means, as a matter of strategic necessity, allying with other countries that also fear China's rise. We can worry about the nature of those governments later; the first priority is to make sure that we don't lose the greater geopolitical struggle.\\n\\nThat was Jeane Kirkpatrick's message in 1979, and it's a relevant message, still, in 2019. Of course, we can't hear from her directly anymore, but her wisdom is readily available. And that's good, because we need her clear thinking today as much as ever."}
{"original": "Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), a leading ally of President Donald Trump, told reporters in a brief conference call after a meeting with the president on Wednesday that Trump is planning withdrawals of U.S. forces from Syria and Afghanistan and will instead reinvest U.S. resources wasted there in rebuilding the United States.\\n\\nIn Syria, U.S. armed forces have been fighting the Islamic State or ISIS, a terrorist group that once controlled significant territory and resources, but the administration insists that ISIS has been defeated. As such, Trump is moving to withdraw all U.S. forces from Syria.\\n\\nIn Afghanistan, U.S. troops have been at war there for nearly 18 years, since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, making it the longest war in U.S. history. While Paul was nonspecific on the details of the timeline and scope of withdrawal from Afghanistan, the senator from Kentucky said that President Trump did make clear to senators and national security officials on Wednesday he intends to end the war there too. Paul said:\\n\\nI've just come from the White House and we had a great meeting there. I tweeted out that I've never been prouder of the president and I don't say that lightly. I'm not the kind to just say something is really great if it's not. I really am proud of the president for making an argument that no president in recent history has made and that is that we have been at war too long in too many places and that he's really going to make a difference. This is the kind of stuff those of us who have seen the horror of war and see the horror of those who have lost limbs in war and war that has gone on and on and on. We live for the day that somebody will actually stand up and say 'I'm going to change history.' I think the president is that person—and I really am proud of him not only for saying that not only is he following through with his Syria policy but I really do think there will be changes in Afghanistan as well. If you look at the polling data for the American people, I think the American people are with the president and they're tired of both parties who are unwilling to stand up and say enough is enough. It's time to spend some of that money at home. He mentioned how much money we spent in Afghanistan on gas stations, luxury hotels, and this and that—our country suffers. We need to be able to spend that money here at home.\\n\\nI have never been prouder of President Donald Trump. In today's meeting, he stood up for a strong America and steadfastly opposed foreign wars. Putting America First means declaring victory in Afghanistan and Syria. President Trump is delivering on his promises. — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) January 16, 2019\\n\\nRegarding the specifics of the withdrawal plans, Paul said he will allow the president to detail those for the nation but laid out how Trump has made clear both wars are coming to an end, and soon:\\n\\nI think the president will have to characterize the specifics, but I think his general—the idea is we're going to do things differently. We're not going to stay forever. The Afghans will have to step up. The Afghans will need to begin fighting their own wars and protecting their country. It's not that we'll do nothing. I think the president still help them. I think we'll still actually be there longer than I would like to be, but the president is willing to acknowledge that America's longest war needs to come to a close and that we need to learn how to declare a victory. I can tell you with each successive conversation that I've had with him, I feel that he really is going to try to do something extraordinary for our country. We've been at war for so long and so many young men and women have died and so many have given up parts of their body. I think it's a part of the president that a lot of people haven't seen publicly, and that's his concern for those he has met at Walter Reed… He takes that burden very personally that he is in charge and he is the one who now gets to decide whether we're going to be in this forever or if we're going to change course. And I think he's going to change course. And I think he's going to set his own. I don't want to talk to the specifics though because I think he has to tell the country that, but I will tell you if you'll look at his language in his tweets about 'endless war' and you hear him talk about how long this has gone on, I think you're seeing one of the extraordinary things about how people couldn't figure out how did Donald Trump get elected? Well, it would be because he doesn't fit neatly in a box. He was a different kind of Republican who actually looked at the issues of war and said you know what? We ought to think of America first, and not spend so much everywhere all the time that really a lot of times just doesn't work frankly.\\n\\nPaul added that in addition to a major policy win for the president, the withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan–ending both wars finally–are major political wins for him,as well, heading into his re-election in 2020.\\n\\nPaul said when asked by Breitbart News about how important keeping these promises is for his re-election:\\n\\nI think most people, most political pundits, still haven't figured out how he won in 2016. I think he did win by being different. He got a lot of working class voters who understand that he wanted to and would stand up to foreign countries to make sure we get a better deal for this country, that he would make even our friends and allies pay more for their own defense and the day of everybody thinking that we were Uncle Sam and going to take care of their every want and wish, that those days were over. That's also what he was saying with regard to war. He won because he said things—look he will defend America. He said in the meeting that he is for a stronger defense than anybody in the meeting ever imagined and that he will do whatever it takes to defend America but that he's not going to fight forever or leave our troops in wars forever where it's not really helping America.\\n\\nPaul was part of a meeting with several other senators and national security officials, along with Trump, at the White House. He also met with Trump privatel, where they discussed the ongoing government shutdown."}

It's a very, very important period in our history.\\n\\nI don't know of any conservative on this network, any, who has done anything but condemn what took place on Capitol Hill the other day. It was outrageous.\\n\\nBreaching the walls and the security the Capitol Building, 14 Capitol Police injured, a woman shot dead. That's not who we are, and those people who did that are not us.\\n\\nThere were hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people who came out to march in support of the President of the United States; hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people, and now they are all being accused of violence.\\n\\nThey're all being attacked. They're all being painted with a broadest of brushes. Why can't we focus on the hoodlums? Why can't we focus on the people who actually did this?\\n\\nWe need to find out who they are. We need to prosecute them. We need to know all about them. Why is that so controversial?\\n\\nI went back and I listened again to the President's speech, not once — not once, did he incite violence. Not once did the President of the United States say charge the Capitol Building, breach the Capitol Building. He said the opposite about peacefully protesting — peacefully protesting. That's what he said.\\n\\nAll of that aside for the moment, it's time to take a bigger look at this as far as I'm concerned. What we've had to deal with as a country over the last five years, and it's been extraordinary and it has been awful in many respects.\\n\\nDonald Trump isn't even elected President yet, and spies are implanted in his campaign. The Obama administration whether it's the FBI, the Intelligence Agencies are obviously scheming against him. The FISA Court process is undermined with lies that are given to the court for warrants.

The pretext of which was used to launch a criminal investigation that went on and on and distracted and undermined the presidency. And at the same time, we're listening to people on Capitol Hill who are speaking about impeachment, who are using the Intelligence Committees, the Judiciary Committees day in and day out.\\n\\nWe have to listen to Adam Schiff and Jerrold Nadler and other people day in and day out on TV accusing our President of espionage, of all kinds of horrific acts, treason, of selling out to dictators.\\n\\nThis has an impact on a society. It has an impact on the people.\\n\\nAnd the media — the media played not just a role, it played a leading role, constantly pouring fuel on the fire. And by the way, none of this excuse what happened to the Capitol. But we need to look at the whole horizon of things that have taken place in this country.\\n\\nWe have a newspaper, The New York Times that pushes the 1619 Project. What is the purpose of the 1619 project? It is being pushed into our schools. Now, other purpose is to undermine our founding. That's the purpose of the 1619 Project.\\n\\nWe have basketball players and football players taking knees all over the place. Why? Because we're such a systemically racist society. And we watch this and we watch this every day. What else has been taking place?\\n\\nOh, Black Lives Matter, which is a Marxist anarchist organization, a violent organization has roads named after it. It is celebrated by Corporate America. It is celebrated by the American media.\\n\\nWe have Facebook and Twitter conducting itself in the most fascistic ways imaginable.\\n\\nWe have a hundred days of attacks on a Federal Courthouse, the Mark Hatfield Federal Courthouse in Portland, and the Speaker of the House analogizes the Federal law enforcement that is trying to protect it to Storm Troopers during the Third Reich and she is not the only one.\\n\\nWe have violence, the most horrible violence we've seen since the 60s happening during the summer. Monuments being pulled down and so forth. People being beaten. Cops being beaten. That's after the George Floyd killing, and the media downplay every bit of it — every bit of it.\\n\\nNow, let's talk about an attack on our system of government.\\n\\nMy wife and I attended the last night of the Republican Convention on the South Lawn of the White House. That beautiful fair, all kinds of important people were there, all kinds of elected officials were there. Senators, congressmen, governors, you name it, they were there. That's where the Republicans come, the most powerful and the most influential in the country. That's where they came — the South Lawn of the White House.\\n\\nAnd about an hour before it was over, we could hear — we could hear a crowd forming outside the gates of the White House, and it got louder and louder and they were banging drums and they were playing music, and they were chanting, and they were saying all kinds of cuss words and so forth and so on.\\n\\nAnd my wife and I looked at each other and said, How the hell are we going to get out of here when this is done? This is at the end of the Republican Convention.\\n\\nA big formation of police came. They had to show us the way out. We had to walk halfway around the town in order to try and find an Uber. But some weren't as lucky. They beat the hell out of some of the delegates who have left, who tried to get back to their hotels.\\n\\nThey chased down Rand Paul and his wife, assaulted them and assaulted the police officer who was trying to protect them. They went after Dan Bongino and his wife and I can't even name all the people who were attacked, and that barely got the attention of the media. They didn't talk about an assault on our governing system. People left the White House grounds and they were attacked.\\n\\nRemember what took place in Lafayette Park? Remember the assaults that took place? Scores of Secret Service agents were injured. The President of the United States had to be hurried off to the bunker, the nuclear bunker because they were afraid that the fence would be breached.\\n\\nAnd the next day, the Attorney General and others cleared out Lafayette Park. They were attacked for clearing out Lafayette Park. That wasn't called an attack on our government at the time.\\n\\nHere's my point. We should oppose all violence — all violence — whether it's Capitol Hill, which is an outrage; whether it's the White House, it's an outrage; whether it's a Federal Courthouse in Portland, which is an outrage; whether it is people leaving the last night of the Republican Convention, that is an outrage; all forms of violence, all of it should be condemned. And I condemn it all. And I have always condemned it all, but everybody hasn't.\\n\\nWe have media organizations who talk about mostly peaceful protesters while buildings burning behind them, while people are throwing Molotov cocktails, while cop cars are burning, while cops are being hit over the head with skateboards and hit with baseball bats. And you see these areas taken over in these various cities and so forth.\\n\\nJoe Biden gave a speech the other day after the Capitol was breached, a speech about unity. And he said the President needs to step up.\\n\\nAll through the summer, people were begging Joe Biden to speak out against Black Lives Matter and Antifa and he wouldn't do it. And then finally, when he did, he did it in a one or two-sentence passing comment, people said, see he spoke out against it.\\n\\nWe need people to speak out against violence. This is a big problem in our country. There's no question about it.\\n\\nWe have lockdowns going on in our country. Governors who are abusing their power. Ask the Jews in Brooklyn what they think of the Mayor of New York who has targeted them. Ask the senior citizens in New York what they think of the governor of New York who has targeted them.\\n\\nAsk the people of this country what they think when these governors are putting the most constraining lockdowns in place while they're going on vacation, while their wives are going on vacation, while they're eating at five-star restaurants. They're all caught doing all kinds of things, breaking their own lockdowns. Imagine what that makes people feel like.\\n\\nThen imagine having an election, put the fraud aside, let's talk about the Constitution where Democratic officials in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, and even Republican officials in Georgia violate Article II of the Constitution where the executives and the courts change the election laws in violation of the Federal Constitution and people see this and they're upset about it.\\n\\nImagine turning on the Joe Scarborough show on MSNBC where a guest repeatedly refers to Trump supporters as neo-Nazis — as neo-Nazi. Imagine turning on CNN where Don Lemon and he has a few guests on there, mocking the mental intelligence of Trump supporters. The media have played a huge, huge role in what's going on in this country and they're exploiting now what took place on Capitol Hill. Trying to silence — silence — conservatives, silence Republicans, and unfortunately, a lot of Republicans are buckling.\\n\\nWe need to speak out against violence. We need to speak out against what happened on Capitol Hill or at the White House or at the Portland Courthouse. We need to reject all this violence.\\n\\nBut what about the media? Here's the headline the next day after the breach of Capitol Hill in The New York Times: Trump incites mob. Trump never incited the mob. This is projection. This is projection. He never did that. Or The Washington Post: Trump mob storms the Capitol. There were hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people there. Trump mob storms the Capitol. That's an awfully broad brush or The Daily News: Siege: President incites insurrection. The President didn't incite an insurrection.\\n\\nOr the USA Today: Pro-Trump mobs storm U.S. Capitol. How about thugs storm U.S. Capitol? How about lawbreakers storm U.S. Capitol? This is the way it can be reported. Here's The New York Post: Capitol invasion. OK, fair enough.\\n\\nHere's The Washington Times: Assault on democracy. OK, fair enough. We shouldn't downplay what happened on Capitol Hill the other day, we should be furious about what happened on Capitol Hill the other day. But either you're against violence or you're not.\\n\\nAnd so now the media and people like Adam Kinzinger and Chuck Schumer and their ilk, and their like, what are they doing? They're exploiting the situation. Talking about impeaching the President of the United States or the 25th Amendment nine days before he leaves office. Do they even know what's involved in the 25th Amendment?\\n\\nSo they doubled down, they tripled down, they quadrupled down. They're not going to change. Out of one side of their mouth, they talk about unity, out of the other side of their mouth, they spit on people, 74 million people and more. They're not going away. Their concerns still exist.\\n\\nAnd then I see — and then I see the Democrat leader than the Senate, Schumer still talking about attacking the Supreme Court. Isn't anybody concerned about that? Nobody wants the Supreme Court attacked, certainly not by the United States Senate. Attacking the voting system and the Electoral College, packing the Senate with four more Democrats, eliminating the filibuster so they can get through whatever legislation they want.\\n\\nNancy Pelosi the other day eliminated a hundred years of tradition, making it virtually impossible for Republicans to even propose legislation or amend legislation, even though she only has a 10 or 11-person majority in the House. It's 50/50 in the Senate. They have a very slight majority in the House, and their goal is to choke, choke, and choke the system even further and the media are trying to intimidate conservatives and constitutionalists by projecting onto them violence that occurred by reprobates and others who need to be tracked down and punished.\\n\\nSo it seems that the lessons have not been learned. They certainly haven't been learned by the left. They certainly haven't been learned by the media, and they certainly haven't been learned by the Never Trumpers."}

Subway stations, shopping malls, power plans, and other national infrastructure could be attacked, according to the NIS estimate.\\n\\nSeveral reasons for North Korean mischief beyond the obvious feud over its nuclear program were discussed, including upcoming large-scale U.S.-South Korean military exercises, which the North portrays as the prelude to an invasion; the possibility of the U.S. deploying an advanced missile defense system in South Korea; and the approaching congress of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, at which Kim Jong-un is expected to announce what the Korea Times describes as a major reshuffle. Those who get discarded during North Korean shuffles tend to have a very short life expectancy.\\n\\nAccording to CBS News, the NIS, which has a mixed record on predicting developments in North Korea, said it could not confirm its reported assessment.\\n\\nThe Park administration is pushing for the passage of a long-debated anti-terrorism bill, which Kim Sung-woo mentioned in a press briefing: While North Korea is intensifying its preparations for terror attacks, political interests should not be put above safety and property of the people. To effectively handle threats from North Korea or international terrorist groups, I strongly ask the National Assembly to process the bill.\\n\\nAnother piece at the Korea Times notes that Park's administration is weathering some confusion over her recent remarks about changing the behavior of the Pyongyang regime through more aggressive methods.\\n\\nSeveral Korean-language newspapers interpreted Park's comments as a call for the overthrow of the Kim regime. Interestingly, much of the confusion is based on the vague meaning of the Korean word for change, making it reasonable for even native speakers to read Park as saying either I will change the regime or I will make the regime change.\\n\\nThe former interpretation is, of course, much more forceful, and the Korea Times notes that Park did explicitly mention regime change during the course of her speech to the National Assembly.\\n\\nPark's spokesmen insist her words had the latter meaning: she was promising to bring pressures to bear that would change Pyongyang's behavior, not overthrow Kim Jong-un. The North Koreans, of course, promptly accused Park of plotting to subvert their government, a charge that is certain to come up as justification, if they do engage in terror attacks against South Korea."}

{"original": "Former Vice President Joe Biden mixed up Iraq, Iran, and Ukraine while discussing impeachment at a recent town hall in Iowa.\\n\\nBiden, who has long been known for his gaffes and lapses on the campaign trail, told an audience on Wednesday that ongoing impeachment trial was proof that President Donald Trump and Republicans were worried about him becoming the Democrat nominee.\\n\\nThe former vice president, in particular, claimed that questions about his political influence intersecting with his son's work in Ukraine were part of an organized smear campaign. The claim, which is disputed by ethics watchdogs in both the U.S. and Ukraine, was further undercut by Biden's inability to recollect in which country his son was working.\\n\\nThat's like just flat out acknowledging, 'We've been doing everything we do to keep Biden from being the nominee, and guess what: we tried it in Iraq, and it's not working.' … I mean, in Iran. Excuse me. 'We tried it in Ukraine,' the 77-year-old former vice president said:\\n\\nThe gaffe comes as the Iowa caucuses head to a finish, while simultaneously the impeachment trial continues to move forward in the Senate. Biden, who once led his rivals by double digits in the first caucus state, has fallen behind Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), with some speculating he may not place high enough to receive a single delegate.\\n\\nBiden's fading position in Iowa is contrasted by the central role he and his youngest son, Hunter, continue to play in the impeachment proceedings. This week, Trump's legal team laid out its case for why the president had good reason to suggest Ukraine look into Hunter Biden's role with the Ukrainian natural gas giant, Burisma Holdings. Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a member of the legal team, specifically noted that Hunter was paid $83,000 per month for a role he had little qualification to hold. She further argued the arrangement was rife with potential conflicts of interest, especially because Joe Biden led U.S. policy with Ukraine for most of the Obama administration.\\n\\nAlthough the Biden campaign attempted to dismiss Bondi's argument, the broader point about a culture of corruption permeating the former vice president's family seems to have taken hold with the mainstream media. Just this past week, Politico published an in-depth exposé on the financial ties between James Biden, the former vice president's brother, and a high-powered Washington, DC, lobbyist.\\n\\nThe culminating pressure from the campaign trail, the impeachment hearings, and a newly awakened media seem to be having an impact. In recent days, the former vice president has made an increasing number of stumbles and gaffes. The gaffe follows several others Biden has made on the campaign trail in recent days. Most notably, the former vice president elicited attention on Tuesday for pushing a voter and suggesting because of a disagreement about climate change that the man go vote for someone else."}

{"original": "Michael Gove – the most powerful figure in the UK government after Boris Johnson – has made a speech berating President Donald Trump for not doing enough about 'climate change.'\\n\\nBut Trump is unlikely to notice, let alone care. Most Americans just don't see climate change as a credible problem.\\n\\nHere is the evidence: a 2019 poll showing that for the 13th year running, 'dealing with global climate change' comes right near the bottom of Americans' political priorities.\\n\\nTop three concerns, according to the Pew Research Center were:\\n\\nStrengthening the economy Reducing health care costs Improving the education system\\n\\nClimate change, Donna Laframboise reminds us, came in at 17, second from bottom of a long list including terrorism, a financially sound social security system, Medicare, and dealing with the poor and needy. It will be the same when Pew releases its annual poll this year. Every time, climate change comes either bottom or second from bottom.\\n\\nLaframboise concludes:\\n\\nMoral of the story: There has never been any evidence that climate change is a top concern for most Americans. This is not a crowd pleaser or a vote getter.\\n\\nThis, in turn, has massive implications for the post-Brexit Special Relationship between Britain and the US.\\n\\nIf, as seems most likely, it will be a case of four more years of President Trump trying to forge links with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, then the two men are going to be pulling in opposite directions.\\n\\nOne, Trump, will be leading a fossil fuel economy — the world's largest by energy production — benefiting from the massive competitive advantage of using cheap, abundant energy, freed (thanks to Trump) from the shackles of the Paris Climate Accord.\\n\\nThe other, Johnson, will be leading an economy which has chosen to prioritise virtue-signalling over efficiency, hobbled by any number of green targets, regulations, misallocations of capital and crony-capitalist boondoggles; crippled by needlessly high energy costs. And with his most able minister Michael Gove in charge — and rumoured to be the man chosen, inter alia, to head Britain's hosting of the COP26 climate summit — it's a racing certainty that Britain's green-managed decline will be handled with great efficiency.\\n\\nI'm really not sure that this was quite the post-Brexit vision Trump had in mind when he promised Britain a 'fantastic' and 'very big' trade deal once it managed to extricate itself from the European Union.\\n\\nI'm fairly sure he had in mind that Britain would become a freebooting, free-market player in the manner of Trump's America.\\n\\nWhat I'm most certain he didn't have in mind is that he'd be at the receiving end of finger-wagging lectures from Boris's Chief Operating Officer Gove, as delivered at a conference of the mostly hard-left eco-loon gathering, the Green Alliance.\\n\\nAccording to the Guardian's report:\\n\\nUsing his speech to call for concerted global action on the climate emergency at the summit, Gove noted the lack of efforts on the issue by President Trump and the Brazilian leader, Jair Bolsonaro. I shan't mention any world leaders by name in a critical fashion, he began. However, it's important in the United States and in Brazil that we recognise that there will be people, at the state and at the city level, who can play a vital role in driving change that we all need to see. Predicting that nonetheless COP 26 would be a success, Gove pointed to what he called politically, a realisation of the scale of the challenge and the emergency across the globe.\\n\\nTrump's America produces approximately 14 per cent of global CO2 emissions; Brazil about 1.5 per cent; India 7 per cent; and China nearly 30 per cent. Since none of these economies has any intention of driving change on the CO2 production front any time soon, it will put Boris Johnson's attempts to take Britain's economy Net Zero by 2050 into tragic, painful and embarrassing perspective.\\n\\nBritain's economy produces around 1 per cent of global CO2 emissions.\\n\\nUnilaterally decarbonising it — as seems to be Johnson's and Gove's wizard plan; entirely uncosted as these 'a unicorn for every household' schemes always are — must surely count among the most suicidally pointless plan ever devised by any government in history, especially by one wearing the 'Conservative' tag.\\n\\nIf Trump weren't such an admirer of Britain he would probably find it very funny. As it is, he more likely thinks it's very sad.\\n\\nAnd it is."}

{"original": "Well, I did warn you not to trust them. A string of exposes in Gizmodo have exposed Facebook's repeated assurances of political neutrality to be just that — empty assurances.\\n\\nIn reality, the company regularly interferes in its own algorithms to suppress conservative news, while amplifying progressive causes like Black Lives Matter.\\n\\nWe've come a long way from the misty-eyed ideals that circulated in the tech world during the early days of social media, in the late noughts and early 2010s. That was the golden age of Silicon Valley utopianism, when tech promised to topple governments, revolutionize industries, and put old media elites out of jobs.\\n\\nThe age of the great gatekeepers of information — Fox News, MSNBC, CNN — was over. You could start a revolution from your blog, your Facebook page, your Twitter account. As Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian smugly announced to a TED talk in 2010, You've Lost Control, and That's OK!\\n\\nThe old media elites certainly did lose control. The web is unquestionably the communication platform of the future. But who did the old media elites lose their control to? The people, riding the democratizing wave of the internet?\\n\\nThat might have initially been the case, in the days of Occupy Wall Street, Wikileaks, and the Arab Spring. But today, it's pretty clear that the internet is a baron's revolution, not a peasant's revolution. Old media kingpins like Murdoch are simply being replaced by new media elites like Zuckerberg and Dorsey. And the new boss is very much the same as the old boss.\\n\\nThe change from social media as a democratic, people-powered tool of free-flowing information to another top-down system in which elites feed pre-approved information to the masses happened gradually. Destroying the dream of liberated information in one fell swoop would have created too much uproar. Instead, Facebook decided to poison it slowly.\\n\\nFirst, users' control over what they saw on the platform was quietly taken away. In the old, democratic Facebook, users saw posts from their friends chronologically and could sort their friends into different categories to provide different flows of information: friends, family, co-workers, and so forth.\\n\\nIn other words, users were originally able to control what they saw on Facebook. Today, the picture has changed considerably. Facebook largely controls what its users see. Instead of seeing posts from their friends in chronological order, its now placed in front of users according to opaque algorithms.\\n\\nSure, users still have to add friends and follow accounts before they see anything on their feeds. And, of course, they can block out information sources they don't like. They still have some control. But there's no telling what criteria Facebook uses to determine what's relevant to their users.\\n\\nThen there's Facebook's trending news feature, which we've heard all about this week. Modelled on Twitter's trending hashtags, the feature is ostensibly designed to pull together the most popular news stories on Facebook, presenting them in a list to its users.\\n\\nIn practice, as we saw this week, Facebook's list of trending topics is curated by a news team that is every bit as biased as MSNBC or CNN. Sources inside the curation team say that links to conservative sites like Breitbart, The Blaze, and The Washington Examiner are regularly suppressed, while stories about pet progressive causes like Black Lives Matter are artificially inserted into the rankings despite lacking the required popularity to make the cut.\\n\\nGizmodo, the outlet that broke the story, was blunt in its assessment. The once-revolutionary CEOs of social media have morphed into carbon-copies of the very old media barons they were supposed to disrupt.\\n\\nIn other words, Facebook's news section operates like a traditional newsroom, reflecting the biases of its workers and the institutional imperatives of the corporation.\\n\\nSo, after all the fears that traditional newsrooms would disappear due to the disruptive power of the web, we're now left with …. a traditional newsroom. Really, was it all worth it?\\n\\nOf course, it's the little differences that count. The CEOs who preside over Facebook and Twitter aren't quite like Rupert Murdoch, after all. They're the product of zealous millennial progressivism, coupled with a strong dose of San Francisco identity politics and wrapped in the kind of insulation from the affairs of ordinary citizens that only vast wealth can provide. They're plutocrats — hyper-progressive ones.\\n\\nAnd they control what more a billion of of us are going to read on the internet.\\n\\nYou can follow Allum Bokhari on Twitter, add him on Facebook, and download Milo Alert! for Android to be kept up to date on his latest articles."}
{"original": "The University of California Berkeley has conducted an investigation of problems related to free speech on campus — particularly surrounding events where conservatives (or even insufficiently left-wing progressives) are invited to speak on campus and met with violence and disruption by left-wing activists.\\n\\nBizarrely, the report of the Commission on Free Speech concludes that conservatives, not the left, are to blame for the violence on campus.\\n\\nIn one passage, the report states: [O]ur conclusion is that the rise of ultra-conservative rhetoric, including white supremacist views and protest marches, legitimized by the 2016 presidential election and its aftermath, encouraged far-right and alt-right activists to 'spike the football' at Berkeley.\\n\\nIt insists: Contrary to a currently popular narrative, Berkeley remains a tolerant campus.\\n\\nAnd it blames student groups who invite conservative speakers onto campus, while simultaneously denying that Berkeley is denying conservatives their free speech rights:\\n\\nAll the 2017 events that led to disruption were sponsored by very small groups of students working closely with outside organizations. Although those speakers had every right to speak and were entitled to protection, they did not need to be on campus to exercise the right of free speech. Indeed, at least some of the 2017 events at Berkeley can now be seen to be part of a coordinated campaign to organize appearances on American campuses likely to incite a violent reaction, in order to advance a facile narrative that universities are not tolerant of conservative speech.\\n\\nWhile insisting that the commission does not condone the sort of violence that greeted then-Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos last year, the commission warned students against inviting speakers with provocative views:\\n\\nThat said, the Commission recommends that all members of the campus community be mindful of one another and do unto others as they would want done to themselves. There are better ways to expand the political dialogue on campus than to invite a shock jock performance artist, as Professor Rossman characterized Yiannopoulos, to belittle historically oppressed communities.\\n\\nThe report said that student organizations should be balancing their right to hold events with their responsibility to the community.\\n\\nAs Megan McArdle notes in the Washington Post:\\n\\nThey have plenty of harsh words, however, for the conservatives who were targeted. Many Commission members are skeptical of these speakers' commitment to anything other than the pursuit of wealth and fame through the instigation of anger, fear, and vengefulness in their hard-right constituency. Their invitations to speak represented the assertion of individual rights at the expense of social responsibility by a handful of students. As a result, the commission finds speech of this kind hard to defend, especially in light of the acute distress it caused (and was intended to cause) to staff and students. In the report, conservatives are active, provoking and triggering. The left-wing activists who set things on fire appear in passive voice, that great grammatical machine for sanitizing the indefensible. Left-wing groups have reasonable fears for their safety from conservative speakers, and the police needed to defend them (from what? Further deponent sayeth not.) Conservative students allege that their beliefs make them targets for left-wing professors. And when it comes to the remedies, it's clear who the commission thinks ought to change their ways.\\n\\nShe concludes: [T]hus the ancestral home of the free-speech movement inches as close as it dares to advocating for censorship of any speech that offends a powerful majority — or even any minority that's decently armed.\\n\\nJoel B.

{"original": "Democrats in the House of Representatives voted on Wednesday against an amendment to a proposed bill that would prevent the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) from forcing credit reporting agencies to evaluate Americans based on political opinions or religious beliefs.\\n\\nWithout such an amendment, Republicans warn, the powerful CFPB would have the legal authority to make nearly any criteria mandatory for a private credit evaluation company to take into consideration, paving the way for a system in which the federal government has the power to assign numerical scores to individuals based on their loyalty to a certain political party, membership in civil society groups that the government approves or disapproves of, or other private behaviors.\\n\\nThe system, they say, would mirror the newly minted social credit system in place in China, which bans citizens from key social services like public transportation if they lose too many points behaving in a way the Communist Party disapproves of.\\n\\nThe CFPB, the brainchild of Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), is an executive agency that does not answer to the presidency, making it unaccountable to anyone but its head. The constitutionality of giving an unelected body the power to impose its demands on private individuals and corporations has been the subject of extensive debate, and the unique power given to a bureau director triggered an aggressive fight for the seat after founding director Richard Cordray, chosen by President Barack Obama, resigned.\\n\\nRepublicans moved on Wednesday to amend the 1970 Fair Credit Reporting Act in light of the existence of the CFPB. The failed amendment would have prevented the Bureau from forcing private credit scoring companies to make use of information related to political opinions, religious expression, or other expression protected by the First Amendment, whether obtained from a social media account of a consumer or other sources.\\n\\nThe amendment would have been tacked onto Rep. Ayanna Pressley's (D-MA) Student Borrower Credit Improvement Act, or Comprehensive CREDIT Act of 2020, which grants the CFPB power to order private credit evaluation companies not to take into account what Pressley and her fellow Democrats consider unfair criteria. Having bad credit could keep an American from buying a car or a home, limiting their economic potential. Pressley's bill would, in particular, prevent unexpected medical expenses or unpaid student loans from harming a person's credit.\\n\\nIn this country, our credit scores are our reputations. But too often, credit reporting agencies engage in unfair practices that keep consumers in the dark. My bill, the Comprehensive #CREDITAct is a bold legislative package to reform our deeply flawed credit reporting system. pic.twitter.com/j3GTXjAOYe — Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (@RepPressley) January 29, 2020\\n\\nThe bill, which passed, decrees:\\n\\nA consumer reporting agency may not furnish any consumer report containing any adverse item of information relating to a delinquent or defaulted private education loan of a borrower if the borrower has rehabilitated the borrower's credit with respect to such loan by making 9 on-time monthly payments (in accordance with the terms and conditions of the borrower's original loan agreement or any other repayment agreement that antedates the original agreement) during a period of 10 consecutive months on such loan after the date on which the delinquency or default occurred.\\n\\nIt then tasks the CFPB to implement a credit rehabilitation system to help individuals reach the point necessary for the above protection to apply to them.\\n\\nThe amendment banning the CFPB from including First Amendment expressions in its credit rehabilitation – in ways such as improving someone's credit for good speech or excluding them from the program for bad speech – would not have significantly limited the scope of the Comprehensive CREDIT Act.\\n\\nYet Democrats rejected the amendment with 208 votes; only 15 House Democrats voted in favor of the free speech protections. Some, like Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), abstained.\\n\\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) warned following the vote that the CFPB, if the new law passes the Senate without such protections, would now have the power to use any aspect of a person's life to change their credit score, with significant potential for abuse.\\n\\nIn keeping with their theme of handing over more control to the government, Democrats now support giving the CFPB unchecked authority on credit score modeling, without any built-in measure to stop potential abuse of power or violation of our Constitutional rights, McCarthy said in a statement following the vote. There is a terrifying parallel to the practices of China's communist regime, which seeks to control the actions of their population with a social credit score. This kind of oppressive practice is antithetical to American freedoms and ideals.\\n\\nThe Chinese social credit system is political, not financial – the Communist Party assigns a numerical value to every citizen in the country based on good citizenship, largely defined as loyalty to the party. China's expansive surveillance system monitors every action, online and in the real world, every citizen takes and scores a person based on each one. Among the activities known to affect a social credit score are jaywalking, curbing one's dog, littering, and speaking ill of the government online (disturbing public order). Ethnic and religious minorities fear that practicing any religion under communist rule will hurt their social credit scores, particularly Christians and ethnic Uyghur Muslims, millions of which are currently languishing in concentration camps. Among other vulnerable groups are anti-Xi Jinping Marxist activists, human rights attorneys, Communist Party members considered disloyal to Xi, or musicians suspected of using their art to promote non-Communist values.\\n\\nThe Chinese social credit system has blacklisted over 13 million people as of May, when Beijing made its latest figures public. It has blocked 23 million attempted purchases of train, public bus, and airplane tickets. The consequences for having a low credit score range from being banned from traveling anywhere or patronize businesses like hotels in the country to being forced to use an embarrassing ringtone that immediately identifies one as a discredited individual.\\n\\nChina has begun exporting this system, along with its surveillance technology, to countries in the Western Hemisphere like Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia.\\n\\nThe CFPB was nominally created to protect Americans from economic malfeasance in the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis.\\n\\nEvery day, the good people at that independent agency crack down on dishonest and deceptive practices like the ones that helped cause the crash, President Obama said in July 2016, sitting next to Warren, who designed the agency. The proof is in the more than 27 million consumers who in just five years have gotten refunds and other relief from credit card companies, payday lenders, debt collectors, and others that tried to rip them off.\\n\\nYet the Bureau has faced repeated accusations of abuse of power, particularly under Cordray, its founding director. In perhaps the most absurd example of overreach, the CFPB attempted in 2015 to punish a land development company for not maintaining roads in Tennessee at the standard the Bureau deemed appropriate. Industries or organizations the left disapproves of, like firearms manufacturers or politically conservative religious groups, could similarly find themselves in CFPB crosshairs.\\n\\nThe CFPB's constitutionality has been controversial given the fact that the president has only limited oversight on the agency through a narrow list of reasons to remove a director. Lawsuits have attempted to bring the constitutionality of the agency to the Supreme Court but have yet to successfully do so. The Supreme Court in October agreed to hear a challenge to the constitutionality of the CFPB.\\n\\nDemocrats' move to prevent free speech safeguards from being added to the CFPB's credit evaluation powers occurred just as Warren launched a campaign against disinformation, a word the Chinese regime often uses to censor anti-communist speech.\\n\\nAnyone who seeks to challenge and defeat Donald Trump must be prepared to take on the full array of disinformation that foreign actors and people in and around his campaign will use to divide Democrats, suppress Democratic votes, and erode the standing of the Democratic nominee, Warren wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. Campaigns and tech companies can take a number of steps to slow the spread of misinformation right now. And as president, I'll take a series of actions to further address the spread of disinformation.\\n\\nWarren did not define disinformation or offer examples of how she would use executive power to silence disinformation.\\n\\nOther Democratic presidential candidates have posited a separate point system for evaluating good citizenship. Andrew Yang has named his social credit system modern time banking.\\n\\nVolunteer activity and community engagement would be tracked by an app and seeded, initially, by the government. After that, local administrators would oversee the program, Yang explained on his website, comparing the point system to loyalty programs at chain restaurants.\\n\\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."}
{"original": "An official of the Church of England suggested that it may allow transgender Christians to be re-christened under their new names following a sex change.\\n\\nThe proposal is contained in a discussion paper that outlines those who have undergone a sex change cannot be re-baptized but can announce their new names before God through services of welcome that are already in place, the Daily Mail reported.\\n\\nIt is a fundamental belief of the Church that baptism can only be received once, Synod Secretary General William Nye said in a statement.

{"original": "Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi gave an interview to Chinese state television Saturday in which he credited the authoritarian rule of the Communist Party with defeating the coronavirus pandemic and celebrated the incoming Biden administration in America as a new window of hope for relations between the U.S. and China.\\n\\nWang said the sudden onslaught of COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] has accelerated the once-in-a-century transformation in an increasingly fluid and changing world, presenting the Chinese system as a model for the world to follow:\\n\\nHere in China, the CPC [Communist Party of China] Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has rallied the nation behind a common purpose, and secured major strategic gains in the fight against COVID-19. We have also scored decisive successes in the three critical battles against poverty, pollution and potential risks. The whole country is on course to fully build a moderately prosperous society. The recent Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee set a great vision for China's development in the coming years and charted the course for national rejuvenation. The unity and perseverance of the Chinese people have impressed the world. The resilience and dynamism of China's development have won global recognition.\\n\\nWang claimed China was able to build a strong defense against the virus at our borders without mentioning Beijing's implacable opposition to other nations defending themselves against the virus during the crucial months of spread in the late winter of 2020. Instead, he credited China with helping to erect an international bulwark against the coronavirus and said his government has made more friends in the world during the pandemic it unleashed.\\n\\nWe have been firm in safeguarding our national interests. We have responded resolutely and rationally to unjustified moves by the United States. We have handled issues relating to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet with justified, strong and proportionate countermeasures and won one fierce battle after another in international organizations, vigorously safeguarding China's sovereignty, dignity and development interests, Wang said, delivering a jaw-dropping defense of China's authoritarian atrocities.\\n\\nWang was comparably shameless in praising China for swiftly reporting coronavirus cases to the world — the exact opposite of the Communist Party's deadly campaign of secrecy and its vicious oppression of heroic whistleblowers.\\n\\nWhen hit by an unknown coronavirus, China took immediate actions to carry out epidemiological investigation, identify the pathogen and publicize key information including the genome sequencing of the virus. All this sounded alarm bells across the world, he said.\\n\\nWang bemoaned the serious misconceptions of U.S. policymakers about China and hoped the change of U.S. administrations would stave off America's plan to start a new Cold War:\\n\\nIn recent years, China-US relations have run into unprecedented difficulties. Fundamentally, it all comes down to the serious misconceptions of US policymakers about China. Some see China as the so-called biggest threat and their China policy based on this misperception is simply wrong. What has happened proves that the US attempt to suppress China and start a new Cold War has not just seriously harmed the interests of the two peoples, but also caused severe disruptions to the world. Such a policy will find no support and is doomed to fail. China-US relations have come to a new crossroads, and a new window of hope is opening. We hope that the next US administration will return to a sensible approach, resume dialogue with China, restore normalcy to the bilateral relations and restart cooperation.\\n\\nChina's state-run Global Times analyzed Wang's interview as a strong signal to other countries, especially the new US administration, that China's foreign policy has always been continuous and stable as China always hopes to return to a mutually beneficial and win-win track.\\n\\nIf the Biden administration understands China's determination to shape a healthy bilateral relationship and carry out a rational China policy, there is hope that the two countries can overcome the difficulties that the Trump administration has brought and reach cooperation in many areas that will positively affect long-term diplomacy, the Global Times wrote.\\n\\nThe analysis quoted various Chinese experts to the effect that China's plan for win-win cooperation through projects like the Belt and Road Initiative would move the Communist nation into a position of global leadership, while the remains of the Trump administration's unilateralism and protectionism are eliminated."}

Zaman, one of Turkey's largest newspapers, had developed a reputation for also being among the most critical of the president.\\n\\nIn the latest edition of the newspaper, however, there is little pushback on the Erdogan presidency. Instead, the cover story alleges historic excitement over Erdogan's plans for a new bridge across the Bosporus, one he may eventually name after himself upon the completion of construction.\\n\\nAustralia's ABC notes the cover also contained images of the funerals of 'martyrs' killed in the military clashes with Kurdish rebels in the south-east, which some suggest is a sign of support for attacks against the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) terror group. The newspaper also uses a favorable photo of Erdogan attending a pro-woman's event, holding hands with an elderly woman.\\n\\nTurkish newspaper Zaman gets pro-Erdogan makeover after police raid newsroom https://t.co/gyLFmPWKCG pic.twitter.com/Y2zC8q3Asq — Middle East Eye (@MiddleEastEye) March 6, 2016\\n\\nThe Turkish government's takeover of Zaman on Friday turned violent rapidly, as police fired tear gas and water cannons on protesters holding up editions of the newspaper.\\n\\nPolice installing barricades around #Zaman newspaper building, turning it into de-facto prison for staff & journos pic.twitter.com/ifQaTlND51 — Abdullah Bozkurt (@abdbozkurt) March 5, 2016\\n\\nThe takeover is a result of a Turkish court ordering that a court-appointed board of trustees run the Feza Media Group, which owns Zaman. Erdogan's government has accused the writers at Zaman of having ties to the cleric Gulen, formerly a Justice and Development Party (AKP) ally now considered a terrorist by Erdogan's government. Turkey announced an in-absentia trial against Gulen in October for terrorism charges, as Gulen is currently exiled in the United States. He has also faced legal troubles in America, accused of running a corrupt charter school system feeding into an Islamist cult. The FBI raided a number of Gulenist charter schools in 2014.\\n\\nZaman has a circulation of 650,000, according to Vice, largely the product of providing an alternative view of current affairs from pro-government publications. Journalists at Zaman were warned that the newspaper would experience a change in editorial policy after its editor-in-chief was forced out of his job, but were assured the newspaper would remain unbiased and objective, neutral. Doubting this, they released a statement on Friday calling the takeover the darkest and gloomiest days in terms of freedom of the press, which is a major benchmark for democracy and the rule of law.\\n\\nAs all of you know we are being governed by a regime that has no respect for our constitution, rule of law, or democracy, English-language Today's Zaman editor-in-chief Sevgi Akarcesme remarked. Today's Zaman's Twitter account has been deleted, and it does not appear to have published any new material since the takeover. Its articles on the seizure itself remain, however, providing a straightforward interpretation of events and promoting a petition against the takeover.\\n\\nMustafa Edib Yılmaz, a journalist who returned to work on Sunday, describes his office as being run under close police surveillance. He tells France24 the protesters have returned with him, too. Outside of my office window, I can see at least 500 and 600 people, chanting and singing slogans. … I can see conservative women in headscarves out there protesting with five or six-year-old children. He laments that he does not believe the international community will protest the takeover. There have been some statements from the European commission, saying something along the lines of 'we note with high concern,' which is like the dictionary definition of 'we are not going to do anything.'\\n\\nThe government has previously attempted to change leadership within Zaman. In November, the Turkish government issued an arrest warrant against Ekrem Dumanlı, who had stepped down from his position as the newspaper's editor-in-chief a month prior. Dumanlı had cited unlawful pressure on press and my personality from the government as part of his reasoning for stepping down. He was wanted for attempting a coup for having alleged ties to Gulen, according to the charges."}

{"original": "The NFL will reportedly consider a rule which makes it an unsportsmanlike penalty for a team to commit multiple fouls on the same down, in order to control or influence the clock.\\n\\nThe rule stems largely from a play towards the end of the first half of the Saints-49ers game last year where all of the 49ers defensive backs held all of the Saints receivers, resulting in the Saints having to run a play that took time off the clock, hurting their chances of scoring just before halftime.\\n\\nUnder last year's rules, the 49ers received a penalty for the infractions. However, they were only too happy to accept that penalty, because the clock still ran. If this proposed rule change had existed then, the 49ers would have received a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, and the play clock would have been reset to the start of the play.\\n\\nOf course, those arguing against this rule will cite the fact that with this proposal the league is now actively trying to decipher the intent of players who commit penalties. Now, instead of just assessing the penalty, the league will also judge motivation.\\n\\nWhile true, reasonable people can infer that if four players commit the same penalty all at once, some element of conspiracy occurred. After all, the NFL does have penalties for coordinated celebrations. So why not have one for coordinated penalties?\\n\\nThe stronger objection to the rule, however, will likely rest on the fact that teams will simply shift from having an entire secondary foul someone to having only one player foul someone. How will the league determine intent if it's only one guy committing the penalty?\\n\\nIf the rule passes, we might just find out.\\n\\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn"}
{"original": "Monday was a big day for activist groups working to end the practice of using Native American nicknames for sports teams.\\n\\nThe day began with news that Major League Baseball would force the Cleveland Indians to stop using their Chief Wahoo logo on their uniforms. However, not surprisingly, they didn't stop there.\\n\\nAfter applauding the Cleveland Indians for dropping their hurtful nickname, the Change the Mascot campaign focused their attention on the Washington Redskins.\\n\\nOneida Nation representative Ray Halbritter, delivered a statement:\\n\\nThe Cleveland baseball team has rightly recognized that Native Americans do not deserve to be denigrated as cartoon mascots, and the team's move is a reflection of a grassroots movement that has pressed sports franchises to respect Native people. Cleveland's decision should finally compel the Washington football team to make the same honorable decision. For too long, people of color have been stereotyped with these kinds of hurtful symbols — and no symbol is more hurtful than the football team in the nation's capital using a dictionary- defined racial slur as its team name. Washington Owner Dan Snyder needs to look at Cleveland's move and then look in the mirror and ask whether he wants to be forever known as the most famous purveyor of bigotry in modern sports, or if he wants to finally stand on the right side of history and change his team's name. We hope he chooses the latter.\\n\\nThe Change the Mascot campaign has been leading the fight to force the Redskins to change their name, for several years. However, any attempt to force that change will be complicated by several factors. First, Redskins Owner Daniel Snyder has remained steadfast in his refusal to change the name. Secondly, the movement to force the Redskins name change doesn't even enjoy widespread support inside the Native American community. A 2016 Washington Post poll found that 90 percent of Native Americans are not offended by the Redskins name, and don't consider it a slur.\\n\\nFurther complicating matters for the Change the Mascot campaign, last week the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated prior decisions which had vacated the Redskins trademark on the grounds that it was disparaging to Native Americans.\\n\\nThe Redskins did not respond to ESPN's attempt to reach out for comment."}

It was unclear how many would continue and how many would turn around.\\n\\nSome of those swept up Thursday were expected to give up and return to Honduras, even as scattered groups continued to walk and hitchhike through a tropical region of southeastern Guatemala.\\n\\nAmong them was Génesis Fuentes, a 19-year-old Honduran who was part of the first mass caravan in October 2018. Back then she made it to the northern Mexico city of Mexicali, across from Calexico, California, and lived there working as a waitress and cook for about five months. She ultimately crossed the border with some friends near Algodones, which borders California and Yuma, Arizona, but was detained by U.S. border agents and deported last May.\\n\\nClad in a red T-shirt, a hooded sweatshirt, jeans and sandals, Fuentes was limping from a bruised knee. She said that being sent back home meant returning to a life that is no life at all.\\n\\nThere is no work in Honduras, Fuentes said. Since they deported us, we have not been able to find jobs.\\n\\nAbout 100 miles (160 kilometers) to the southwest, in Esquipulas, more than 600 migrants who crossed the border Thursday at Agua Caliente lay on the ground under a low, gray sky, sleeping or eating. A plan was forming to spend the night there and leave before dawn Friday.\\n\\nJomas Joel Paredes of Villanueva, Honduras, left San Pedro Sula on Thursday morning, a day after most of the other migrants. He had luck hitching rides, and the truck he was aboard was not stopped before the border.\\n\\nHe said it was his fourth attempt at migrating to the United States. He never got any farther than Mexico in any of the other tries, the most recent in 2017.\\n\\nParedes said he was fleeing gang threats, debts and unemployment. He had heard in the local press that Mexico said it wouldn't let migrants pass, but he hoped the government would change its tune. He has plans to work in Mexico for a while and send money back home before eventually trying to reach the United States.\\n\\nHe left his wife and three daughters behind in Honduras.\\n\\nThose are decisions one has to make sometimes, Paredes said.\\n\\nGuatemala's immigration agency reported late Thursday that a total of 2,657 migrants had registered at its El Cinchado and Agua Caliente crossings. An unknown number of others crossed irregularly.\\n\\nOn Thursday, the International Rescue Committee, a New York-based humanitarian aid group, said the latest migrant movement showed that the humanitarian crisis in Central America's Northern Triangle continued.\\n\\nThis is not about the potential hope that awaits on the other side; it is about the destitution and insecurity that they left behind, Scott Lea, the organization's acting country director for northern Central America, said in a statement.\\n\\nActing U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said Thursday that measures implemented by the U.S., Mexico and Central American governments have driven down demand, noting lower apprehensions at the U.S. border for seven consecutive months.\\n\\nI will say that this caravan is not anything even remotely similar to what we saw in '18 and a little bit in '19.

Jones that True The Vote specifically wanted to disenfranchise black and brown voters who simply changed their address during the coronavirus pandemic, and that voters on the list feared their names would be published.\\n\\nFair Fight also described True The Vote's poll-watching activities as a form of intimidation.\\n\\nTrue The Vote pushed back, noting that it had no intent of intimidating anyone and had never done so, and that it was simply seeking First Amendment redress of grievances due to the dilution of legitimate votes by fraud. It also pointed out that its poll-watching activities were legal and conducted in compliance with local authorities.\\n\\nJudge Jones wrote that he had grave concerns about True The Vote's activities in seeking to disqualify the voters who had changed their addresses, saying they could run afoul of the National Voter Registration Act and could affect eligible voters.

Georgians owe a debt of gratitude to the registrars in Muscogee and Ben Hill counties who bravely told the court they'd discovered voters who had in fact moved out of state and were attempting to vote in this election – and would have if citizens had not submitted these challenges. And the Georgia citizens sued by Fair Fight were spending time with their families on Christmas Eve when they were served with court papers. They stood strong against these intimidation tactics and harassment. … True the Vote's counsel James Bopp represented the defendants in the Fair Fight case. These courageous citizens were targeted because they dared to stand up for their rights, Bopp said. Like true patriots, they stood strongly by the Constitution and the laws of their state and they effected positive change. This is what citizen engagement looks like: There are forces that will try to stop us, but we'll never stop fighting to defend our democracy. … Let the voters be heard. Let every legal, eligible voter have their vote counted, Engelbrecht said. For this to happen, it is critical that those not eligible to vote are prevented from doing so. True the Vote – a completely citizen-led organization – exists for the purpose of championing voting rights, ensuring all law-abiding Americans have the tools they need to cast their ballot, and we are committed to that important work in Georgia and beyond.\\n\\nThe case will continue, and the judge has said Fair Fight will have the opportunity to present further evidence of its claims against True The Vote.\\n\\nJoel B.

What were once among the most carefree pages of the nation's newspapers—the lifestyle, health, fitness, and women's interest sections—now boast life hacks designed to help families struggling to find basic goods like oil and flour.\\n\\nNewspapers use their social media accounts to crowdsource the discovery of rare medications for families whose children are dying. For women fearing the potential arrival of another mouth to feed, outlets share DIY pregnancy tests they admit are not approved by science. For home cooks, newspaper share tips for how to avoid eating poisonous tubers when scavenging empty markets for what is left. For any Venezuelan trying to flee a country with a passport shortage, outlets share immigration and travel shortcuts on how to get out.\\n\\nLast year, Venezuelan radio host Daniel Lara Farías tweeted, It is so true that communism is hunger that a communist country has never developed a recipe. A Twitter user joked back, Except those in El Nacional: 'how to make cake without flour,' 'how to make delicious pumpkin arepas.'\\n\\nSolo las de El Nacional: Cómo hacer una torta sin harina…, Cómo hacer deliciosas arepas de auyama… https://t.co/TAY2dA9XBU — Carlos G Trujillo C (@cgtrujilloc) May 8, 2017\\n\\nOne recently shared recipe, carried over from the women's site Eme de Mujer, teaches how to prepare a delicious chocolate cake without flour, sugar, or butter. Get excited to try it and surprise your family! The recipe substitutes cornstarch for wheat flour and uses creamed rice for texture. While corn flour, a common ingredient in Venezuela's popular arepas, has been on the list of most scarce basic food products in the country for years, cornstarch has taken its place and the place of many other goods, such as baby formula.\\n\\nEme de Mujer also suggests mixing cornstarch with carrot juice, yogurt, and water to create an economic and effective beautifying face mask.\\n\\nFor those who cannot find any starch or flour for their baked goods, another newspaper, El Diario de Caracas, published a recipe for bread without flour. If you did not have time to go to the bakery, if yesterday's bread wasn't enough for today, or if you just prefer home cooking, this alternative can save your morning coffee or breakfast, the recipe suggests. The recipe uses powdered milk and baking powder as a substitute for flour.\\n\\nEl Nacional has been sharing and promoting creative food content for years. In December 2016, for example, it shared a listicle of cheaper, easier to access foodstuffs that could help Venezuelans eat better for their money. The list included sardines, cheap mortadella, and yuca, a starchy tuber that is a staple of Caribbean and some African cuisine.\\n\\nThe listicle was published by the BBC before poisonous bitter yuca killed dozens of Venezuelans relying on the vegetable to survive. By March 2017, at least 28 had died of consuming bitter yuca, a species of yuca that is inedible and causes a complete deterioration of the digestive system and vital organs. The tragic deaths triggered a wave of helpful life hack-style articles on how to identify bitter yuca. El Nacional suggested biting into a tiny raw piece at marketplaces to ensure it had no raw flavor (edible raw yuca should taste essentially like flour) and not eating yuca that is difficult to peel or takes too long to soften while boiling.\\n\\nOn social media, El Nacional shares not only recipes for food and household products, but seeks out individuals who possess basic drugs that families cannot find on the market. A typical El Nacional medical tweet will read like this:\\n\\n#ServicioPúblico Familia de bajos recursos. Señora de tercera edad muy humilde, necesita la siguiente pastilla de Quimioterapia AROMASIN DE 25 Miligramos favor comunicarse con el número. 04141271100 URGENTE. — El Nacional (@ElNacionalWeb) February 8, 2018\\n\\n#PublicService Underprivileged family. Elderly woman, very humble, needs the following chemotherapy pill AROMASIN 25 milligrams please contact 04141271100 URGENT.\\n\\nOther publications have shared life hacks that do not necessarily feed any mouths. This week, the aggregation site La Patilla shared an article from October with a hack that allegedly uses toothpaste to reveal whether a woman is pregnant. If the toothpaste creates foam and changes color after being mixed in with a woman's urine, she is pregnant, according to the trick. La Patilla is quick to note, despite the growing popularity of this method, science denies its efficacy. The toothpaste tends not to change color, even if you are pregnant, while the foam appears in most cases due to contact between the acidity of the urine and alkalinity of the toothpaste.\\n\\nThe hack also presents one more problem: toothpaste is hard to come by regularly in Venezuela—easier to find than pregnancy kits, birth control, or any pharmaceutical supply, but not guaranteed. In January 2016, the nation's health minister told Venezuelans to become accustomed to brushing their teeth once a day, a sign the product had already been hard to find.\\n\\nThe dire situation the country faces has led many to find a way to leave the country. Venezuelan media have tips for that, too, particularly given that Venezuela ran out of paper and ink to print passports in October (suspiciously, whistleblowers contend that Venezuela had enough ink and paper to print thousands of passports for terror-tied Middle Eastern nationals out of its regional embassies for years).\\n\\nFor those seeking a way out without a passport, Venezuela al Día recommends going to Perú. Perú is becoming an ideal destination for Venezuelans because minors can use basic health services, either in public hospitals or low-cost public programs. Maduradas, another anti-regime site, merely lists the most enjoyable things to do in Venezuela before you leave.\\n\\nFree Venezuela—the one before Hugo Chávez—developed a reputation as a tropical paradise known for its beauty queens and delicious food. Political activism, both within its borders and by the Venezuelan exile community, highlights the dramatic change in national character that socialism has triggered. Its lifestyle and society writers, struggling to impose normalcy in a time of chaos, prove just how deep the political wounds go, deforming far more than ideological affiliations and policy preferences.\\n\\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."}

By taking the job as an undersecretary in the Obama administration he took a salary cut, earning $170,000.\\n\\nTrump publicly praised Shulkin for already doing a fantastic job during a recent interview with Fox and Friends host Pete Hegseth.\\n\\nThe results already have been incredible, he said.\\n\\nShulkin said he met with Trump in January at Trump Tower during the transition period, and he said he was encouraged by the newly elected president's committment to America's veterans.\\n\\nIt was important for him to hear my ideas for how to the fix the system, and it was equally important for me to hear that this is a president that was truly committed and getting the system fixed, Shulkin said. That's what I heard from him, and that's why I agreed to take on this role.\\n\\nRather than waging a war against the establishment in the VA, Trump chose continuity, appearing willing to allow Shulkin to continue the reforms that he started under Obama. The decision was approved by the Senate who confirmed his nomination with an unanimous vote of 100-0.\\n\\nIt's fitting to me that if there is going to be some continuity in the administration, that it would be in the Department of Veterans Affairs, Shulkin said, referring the bipartisan priority of caring for veterans.\\n\\nHe is very aware of the promises that Trump made during the presidential campaign, including the aggressive 10 point reform plan for the VA.\\n\\nShulkin insists that he is committed to those promises.\\n\\nI don't see it as campaign rhetoric, he said. The president put out a 10 point plan, and we are implementing all 10 points of his plan, and we are making significant progress in all the areas, and that's what the president and I talk about when we get together.\\n\\nBut as Shulkin approaches his goal of reform, problems at the Veterans Affairs continue.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, an inspector general's report revealed that the clinic in Washington D.C. was badly mismanaged, endangering veterans who were seeking care in the nation's capitol.\\n\\nShulkin immediately responded by reassigning the medical director and bringing in a hand-picked replacement to start reforming the center. Later, he held a press conference to answer questions about the report and vowed swift changes.\\n\\nWe are acting differently. This is a different VA, and we're going to act in the interest of veterans, and we're going to act decisively and quickly, which is a departure from the culture of the past, Shulkin told Breitbart News, when asked about his response.\\n\\nLast month, Shulkin was faced with another embarrassing incident after a VA employee in Florida was caught watching porn while working with a patient. But the secretary argues he is limited by law from firing an employee immediately. The porn-watching employee was removed from the medical center and put on paid administrative duties for 30 days.\\n\\nThis is an example of why we need accountability legislation as soon as possible, Shulkin said in a statement in response to the news. It's unacceptable that VA has to wait 30 days to act on a proposed removal.\\n\\nThat caught the attention of House Republican reformers who already passed a VA Accountability First Act reform bill to shorten the length of the firing process. But the legislation has stalled in the Senate, as Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Johnny Isakson remains uncommitted to the bill.\\n\\nShulkin appeared on Fox News to raise attention to the issue, urging Congress to act.\\n\\nWe're taking a hard stance that we want this employee removed, and we do not believe the current rules allow us to do that quickly enough, he said. We need changes in the law, and I need the authority to remove these people immediately.\\n\\nFrustrated reform advocates who want action in Congress feel like this is business as usual, despite Trump's campaign promise to make the VA great again.\\n\\nBut for Shulkin, the difference in tone signals an important message to VA employees and the American public.\\n\\nI understand the frustration, and we hear it loud and clear, that the country has that they want what veterans deserve and they want the system fixed, and they want accountable leadership, and that's exactly what we are putting in place, he said. And we are identifying those leaders that frankly shouldn't be in leadership, and we are making those changes … if we don't get the people out that shouldn't be working there, it demoralizes the rest of the workforce.\\n\\nShulkin is very aware of the suicide rate among veterans and the statistic of 20 veterans a day committing suicide.\\n\\nIt is my single top clinical priority, Shulkin said.\\n\\nHe explained that out of the 20 veterans a day who commit suicide, only six are getting care from the Veterans Affairs, something he wants to change.\\n\\nPart of solution, he said, is to promote an aggressive public outreach to veterans who aren't in the system, and using predictive analytics to identify at-risk veterans who may be struggling with mental health issues. He also touted an increase of 200 more crisis line providers, to help answer the over 2,000 calls per day on the crisis hotlines.\\n\\nIn September 2016, more than one third of the calls to the suicide hotline were left unanswered, according to reports, a frightening statistic that Shulkin says has been fixed.\\n\\nWe're now answering 99 percent or more of all the calls that are coming into us, he said.\\n\\nShulkin is currently trying to hire an additional thousand mental health professionals to join the VA and has instituted same day services for patients who have mental health problems.\\n\\nIf anybody is in crisis, they can walk into any of our medical centers and expect help that day, he said."}

{"original": "Republic of Thirst is a three-part series made possible by a generous fellowship from the Robert Novak Foundation. Part I of examined the debate over how California's scarce water resources should be allocated. Part III will examine whether those resources can be expanded through technological innovations like desalination. Part II examines whether more can be done to store and manage the water that falls naturally on the Golden State.\\n\\n***\\n\\nThe water burst out through the spillway in a constant gush, a mad torrent of white, unstoppable and ferocious. It swept down the smooth concrete — then pounded into the new cracks in the failed spillway, sending a spray hundreds of feet into the air and carving a new chasm in the hillside.\\n\\nAlongside the ruined structure, new channels appeared in the earthen emergency overflow spillway, strewn with rip rack rock that had been dropped by helicopter to keep the hillside from collapsing, to save the cities downstream.\\n\\nViewed from a small airplane above the Oroville Dam — at 770 feet, the highest in the U.S. — in March 2017, the future of water storage in California looked doubtful. That year, California's deep drought was broken by record rainfall, filling that dam and many others.\\n\\nAs water continued to pour in, authorities opened the spillway gates as wide as possible. But the concrete cracked, and the main spillway failed — spectacularly. The earthen emergency spillway, used for the first time ever, eroded itself and nearly failed.\\n\\nInitially, local authorities evacuated nearly 200,000 people downstream of the dam. But a herculean effort by engineers managed to save and stabilize the emergency spillway, averting a massive disaster.\\n\\nStill, the crisis provoked questions about whether state authorities had mismanaged Oroville Dam or ignored warnings about the structural integrity of the spillway — or even of the dam itself, which, some claimed, had already begin to leak.\\n\\nTo critics of dams, especially among environmentalists, the events at Oroville Dam were further proof of the dangers of dams and reservoirs — which, they argued, stored water only at great cost to nature and great risk to human life.\\n\\nTo others, especially advocates of industry and agriculture, the Oroville near-disaster was proof the state government had neglected California's infrastructure needs in favor of redistribution, water conservation mandates, or flashy pet projects.\\n\\n***\\n\\nLife as we know it in California today would be unthinkable without the extensive system of dams, reservoirs, pumps and aqueducts that make urban life possible and that have transformed the drought-prone Central Valley into the most productive farming region on earth.\\n\\nAnd yet it is a system that remains almost frozen in time, constructed largely during the early 20th century, the New Deal era, and the postwar boom that followed — designed for a population of 10 million, in a state now reaching 40 million.\\n\\nIt is also a system replete with ironies. The state that gave Ronald Reagan to America, and with him a new brand of unapologetic conservatism, is one in which the survival of the population depends on massive investments in infrastructure — albeit paid for, ultimately, by water users themselves.\\n\\nMoreover, the liberal cities that have incubated America's utopian environmental movement for decades could not exist without ongoing human intervention in the environment that brings water from mountaintop to tap.\\n\\nFor decades, policymakers have debated whether to build new reservoirs. One project, the Auburn Dam, was authorized by Congress in 1965 for flood control, but later abandoned over structural and environmental concerns. Numerous other proposals have been studied for decades, with little progress at the state or federal level — though local authorities have built their own projects, such as the Los Vaqueros Reservoir in the East San Francisco Bay, one of the few projects environmentalists have not opposed (though many have since opposed its expansion.)\\n\\nAnother project, the Sites Reservoir, has been debated for decades. Rather than capturing water by blocking a river with a dam, the reservoir would be built in a valley with minimal water and would receive excess water during floods, relieving pressure on other dams and allowing them to store more.\\n\\nAs Robert Dolezal of the California Water Alliance, a non-profit advocacy group funded by the state's business community, told Breitbart News:\\n\\nSites Reservoir … reduces the flood potential of the Sacramento River … and it allows the entire Central Valley system, all the other major dams in the north — Trinity, Shasta, Oroville, and Folsom — to rebalance … [A]s much as 3 million more acre-feet of water can be stored in Trinity, Shasta, Oroville and Folsom because they don't have to prevent flooding of Sacramento and other downriver communities, rebalancing the system. A similar proposal to raise the height of the Shasta Dam has a similar purpose, as would Temperance Flat on the San Joquin River near Fresno.\\n\\nBut critics say these dams would achieve little for storage, while hurting fish populations and destroying Native American heritage sites. They call such projects vampire dams — because they so often rise from the dead after being rejected by state leaders, one wrote recently.\\n\\nThe divisions over water storage do not match partisan divisions on other issues. In the Central Valley, Democrats tend to be as vociferous in their advocacy for water storage as Republicans are. And in the past, Republicans were as skeptical of such projects as urban Democrats are today.\\n\\nRegardless of political predilection, during years of drought, one thought pervades public consciousness: how much water is left? Residents anxiously turn to the state's reservoirs as they slowly drain, and dry.\\n\\nThe consequences of poor planning, and political infighting, have become clear — from a distance, at least for now. Across the ocean, the South African city of Cape Town, Africa's most advanced and cosmopolitan city, provides a new warning. Its population has doubled over the past two decades, but it has not built much new water storage capacity — thanks, in part, to the fact that the national government has authority over water and the local government is controlled by the opposition. As a result, the city nearly ran out of water in 2018, forcing severe restrictions on residents.\\n\\nThat foreshadows California's grim fate — if it cannot find solutions now.\\n\\n***\\n\\nDroughts are nature's fault. Water shortages are our fault.\\n\\nRep. Tom McClintock (R-CA) greeted me in his office on a frigid Tuesday in December. He is one of the last seven Republicans left in the 53-strong California congressional delegation after Democrats won the midterm elections.\\n\\nThe hallway was strewn with the furniture of departing GOP colleagues, but for McClintock, it was business as usual. And the business at hand was water storage in California.\\n\\nA continent away, frantic negotiations were continuing on the eve of the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) decision on the Bay-Delta Plan, the controversial new policy that will mandate that rivers in the San Joaquin watershed must have an average of 40% unimpeded flow during the spring months — a decision that shifts precious water from farmers and cities to the environment in an effort to save threatened fish populations.\\n\\nMcClintock's office was well-apprised of the state of talks between the various parties, including outgoing Governor Jerry Brown and incoming governor Gavin Newsom. The two liberal Democrats asked the SWRCB to postpone its decision, originally scheduled for November, to Dec. 12 to leave time for voluntary agreements with local water authorities. (The day following my meeting with McClintock, the SWRCB voted to approve the Bay-Delta Plan, despite some agreements being reached.)\\n\\nThe governors' real priority, some skeptical observers claimed, was to secure enough water for the California Waterfix — the Twin Tunnels project that will divert water from the Sacramento River under the California Delta to be pumped south.\\n\\nBut that is a fight about allocation. McClintock focused on storage, noting that the cheapest and best way to solve the state's water problems — measured in cost per acre-foot — is to build more reservoirs rather than letting much of the state's rainfall run out to sea. McClintock reminded me that it has been 40 years since California's last dam, the New Melones Dam, was completed in 1978.\\n\\nThe state's largest water reservoir — by far — is the natural reservoir provided by its Cascades and Sierra Nevada Mountain Range snowpack. That dwarfs the man-made facilities and, through gradual snowmelt in spring, continuously refills the man-made reservoirs long after winter rains and snows have stopped for the season.\\n\\nThough smaller than nature's own reservoir, California's system of man-made reservoirs is vast — and complex. The Public Policy Institute of California notes that state and federal agencies manage 240 large reservoirs that account for 60% of the state's storage capacity, with the rest of the state's reservoirs owned and operated by local water agencies, or by private entities for use on private lands.\\n\\nThe California Department of Water Resources notes: On average, California receives about 200 million acre-feet of water per year in the form of rain and snow. (It adds that the state rarely experiences an average year.) The state's reservoirs can capture about 42 million acre-feet of that — roughly one-fifth. The rest seeps into underground aquifers, or flows out to the sea.\\n\\nDolezal notes that California uses an average of about 80 million acre-feet of water per year, and over the past two decades, roughly half of that is preserved for environmental use — dropping to 40% in the most recent drought, with agriculture using just over 40%, in both wet and dry years.\\n\\nThe reservoir system has a variety of purposes — and storage is just one of them. Many dams and reservoirs were built for flood control.\\n\\nThe state's capital city of Sacramento, which sits at the confluence of the American and Sacramento Rivers, was inundated during the Great Flood of 1862, which turned enormous regions of the state into inland seas for months, Scientific American recalled. That event, and others like it, fueled enthusiasm for building dams.\\n\\nCalifornia's dams are also multipurpose facilities, providing hydroelectric power generation; water storage and supply; recreation; and flood management protection.\\n\\nBut tn times of drought, such as the unusually severe drought that gripped the state from 2011 to 2017, storage is the most salient priority. And McClintock believes there is too little of it.\\n\\nHe and others argue that California can add to its storage capacity relatively easily — not just by building new dams, but expanding existing ones, such as the Shasta Dam, one of the major reservoirs in the federal Central Valley Project, which supplies water to farmers hundreds of miles south.\\n\\nShasta Dam was built under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt during World War Two, reaching 602 feet, though it was designed to be even bigger. (An even bigger dam was envisioned for the Klamath River, but was canceled in the 1970s; today dams along the Klamath are set to be torn down.)\\n\\nSimply finishing the Shasta Dam to its design height [of 800 feet] could add nine million acre-feet to the system, McClintock says. Indeed, the Trump administration, is proposing to raise the dam by 18.5 feet, increasing the capacity of the dam by 7 percent (630,000 acre-feet) — if tiny salamander species that environmentalists wish to have declared endangered do not stop plans for expansion.\\n\\nAnother proposal is to build the Sites Reservoir in the foothills west of the small town of Maxwell, just over an hour north of Sacramento. As noted earlier, the Sites Reservoir would store 500,000 acre-feet of off-stream water, meaning that it would not dam an active river, but rather be a site for water from other sites to be stored as available and used as needed. Proponents argue that it would contribute to environmental quality as well as the state's storage capacity.\\n\\nCrucially, the Sites Reservoir appears to have some startup funding. As much as half of the money will come from a special water bond passed by voters in Proposition 1 of 2014, which set aside $2.7 billion (of $7.5 billion) for water storage projects. The rest of the project would theoretically be funded by long-term contracts for water not reserved for public use.\\n\\nJim Watson, general manager of the Sites Project Authority, told Breitbart News that he was confident the project would proceed, given the support of the voters for water storage when they passed Proposition 1. He noted that $816 million had been set aside for Sites — the largest project funded by the proposition bond, compared to several competing projects. He added that local water agencies had also been working with state and federal authorities in preparing studies for the project.\\n\\nSome of the water that will be produced from the project will be dedicated for environmental projects, he said, nothing that some water would help fish, and some would supply existing refuges that support waterfowl species.\\n\\nGiven that no formal opposition was raised by environmentalists during the approval process for Sites, he said, he did not anticipate significant opposition from them — though they were skeptical the reservoir would provide the water promised. Watson said the project was consulting with environmental interests to allay those concerns, and to explore their thoughts about how the water should be managed once it had been stored, in the reservoir. He said the management process the project had developed would include local communities and Native American groups. And he added that the Sites Reservoir will have statewide reach by helping recharge depleted aquifers throughout California — an urgent necessity once the state's new groundwater management requirements go into effect in 2020.\\n\\nThree years ago, the concept of a local agency taking on such a project, that had been on the board since the 1950s, seemed pretty remote, he said. We have now become the state's lead agency for complying with environmental requirements.\\n\\nWe've come a long way … we're starting to put the pieces together, he added with evident pride.\\n\\nLikewise, Erin Curtis of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation told Breitbart News, There is a lot of momentum for the project right now.\\n\\nAnd obviously, she added, for any project in California, especially related to water, there's going to be some discussions with environmental organizations and local landowners, but it did get Proposition 1 funding.\\n\\nCurtis described the value of the project in terms environmentalists might understand: given that the state's climate is changing, and becoming warmer, that means more of California's annual precipitation is falling as rain, rather than snow.\\n\\nWithout that frozen, natural reservoir, the system must build new capacity to store water — or else it will be lost, not just to industry and agriculture, but to environmental and recreational users as well.\\n\\nWe have been getting less and less water in the form of snowpack, which means less storage — we get more rain, so we can't store it. Sites, she said, provides another place to put that water.\\n\\nCritics, however, say that state authorities allocated just enough money to the project to make it appear as if they are spending money on water storage, while not quite enough to allow the reservoir to be built.\\n\\nMcClintock is among the skeptics. He told Breitbart News that he has been hearing talk about the Sites Reservoir for decades, and that Californians are constantly told that construction is imminent. But somehow, that reservoir, and others, are never built.\\n\\nHe blamed the state and federal environmental laws and regulations that make dams more difficult, and more expensive, to build. Until we change the environmental laws, construction is cost prohibitive, he told me.\\n\\nThat would be perfectly fine with many environmental groups, for whom opposition to dams has become something of an article of faith over the past several decades. Dams were once thought to provide an environmentally-friendly source of renewable energy, through hydroelectric power. But they destroy whatever habitat finds itself submerged by reservoirs; impede fish migration; and — if managed poorly — create new hazards, such as mechanical failure.\\n\\nMcClintock dismissesdconcerns about Oroville. No dam, no work of man is perfect, he said. We make mistakes, we learn, we go forward.\\n\\nThat is, dam projects would go forward — if there were the political will to build them.\\n\\nThe lack of will has less to do with engineering challenges, he maintains, than it does with politics, bureaucracy, and lawsuits by radical environmentalist groups.\\n\\nEnvironmentalists have made no secret of their opposition to the Sites Reservoir. The Sierra Club has cast the project as a fatal threat to the Sacramento River, declaring:\\n\\nThe Sites Reservoir would be filled by significant water diversions from the Sacramento River, which could harm the river's dynamic flow-based ecosystems. More than 20,000 acres of federal and state public lands along the river that were acquired to protect and restore the river's riparian and aquatic habitats, could be degraded by the diversions. In addition to reducing flows in the Sacramento River, the reservoir would drown up to 15,000 acres of existing oak woodlands, grasslands, wetlands, and agricultural land in the western Sacramento Valley. Impacts associated with the reservoir footprint would harm the federally protected bald eagle, a host of other sensitive wildlife species, several rare plants, and significant historical and cultural resources. The Sites Project Authority, a consortium of water districts and local governments, claim that the reservoir could store up to 1.8 million acre feet of water (making it the seventh largest reservoir in the state) and reliably yield about a half million acre feet of water annually for communities, farms, and the environment. But this yield estimate fails to adequately consider the effects of climate change, chronic drought, and reservoir evaporation on project storage and deliveries. …"}

You're the governor of the state. I'm not the governor of the state. DeSantis: Okay, but you didn't investigate why how, like in Lee County, why was there a big line? Did you investigate why? Flores: Could you tell us why? DeSantis: Because we distributed [the] vaccine to hospitals and the hospitals said first come, first serve. If you show up, we'll do it. So they didn't use a registration system. There wasn't anything that was done, and there's a lot of demand for it so people are going to want to go ahead and get it. Flores: So are you saying there was no plan from the state to make sure that senior citizens didn't wait outside overnight?

{"original": "Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) told Breitbart News exclusively on Saturday that his Democrat opponent in Tuesday's upcoming runoff election, Jon Ossoff, is compromised by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in much the same way other young Democrats have been targeted by CCP agents.\\n\\nPerdue made the allegation on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel, and it comes after a series of damaging revelations about Ossoff have emerged in recent weeks. It also comes after Ossoff was finally confronted, by Fox News reporter Peter Doocy, about the matter last week on the campaign trail in Georgia.\\n\\nPerdue compared Ossoff, whose documentary film company has financial ties to the CCP through a state-backed media enterprise, to Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) and to Hunter Biden, the son of President-elect Joe Biden. Perdue argued that Ossoff's situation is actually worse than Swalwell's or Hunter Biden's because Ossoff went into business with CCP-connected companies and then covered it up by not disclosing the relationship in financial disclosure forms. Perdue said Ossoff committed a federal crime by failing to disclose this information required of candidates on personal financial disclosures.\\n\\nThe CCP has identified for some time young ambitious liberal politicians, Perdue said. You see it now coming out in Eric Swalwell. You see it in Hunter Biden. Now, you have Jon Ossoff. I think Jon Ossoff is actually as or more serious than the other two for this reason: He knowingly worked for the Chinese Communist Party for two years. He hid it from the primary voters in Georgia this year. He did not disclose it. He got caught. Then he finally disclosed it, and that's a federal crime to not disclose it, by the way. He finally amended his filing and got caught again, then lied about it again.\\n\\nWhile Fox did ask Ossoff the question, Perdue noted in his interview with Breitbart News that Ossoff completely dodged answering it—something that Perdue said has been a consistent pattern of dishonesty from Ossoff.\\n\\nPeter Doocy this week asked him the right question that the liberal media has not asked him, and that is explain your relationships to the Chinese Communist Party, Perdue told Breitbart News. He didn't answer it. Jon Ossoff has never answered it. He lied in a debate when I asked him if he worked for that company, PCCW, which is owned indirectly by the Chinese Communist Party. They are the propaganda arm that fights against the freedom fighters in Hong Kong specifically. This is an ongoing thing. I'm not sure he can even get an intelligence clearance now as a U.S. Senator if he were elected. Frankly, it's the same thing Eric Swalwell has to deal with. He is compromised. This is a scandal that is just beginning to now come out. We've been trying for months. Thank you guys for bringing it up. He's got a real China problem for sure.\\n\\nThe reason exposing Democrats like Ossoff, Swalwell, and Hunter Biden—among others—who have been, in Perdue's word, compromised by the CCP is important, the Georgia Senator said, because the CCP has a nefarious long term agenda.\\n\\nYou have to understand their long term agenda. Michael Pillsbury wrote a book called The 100 Year Marathon, Perdue said. He's a renowned China expert. I concur with all of that. They want to be the hegemony of this century. They've got a long term plan. What they really want in simple terms is influence. They want to compromise people in positions of authority and bend them toward their propaganda and their way of thinking. As a matter of fact, Jon Ossoff actually tweeted out in support of Xinhua, which is one of their propaganda arms supporting some of the things they were saying about the Uyghurs and the freedom fighters in Hong Kong. This is something that is very serious. You think about people like Eric Swalwell on the Intel Committee getting these classified briefings and having all this inside information about what's going on inside the United States. That's one thing. The other is just a very subtle long-term drip, drip, drip of desensitizing Americans to a socialist agenda. You see that right now in the Democratic offering. This didn't just happen. They've been working on this for some time, and there are a lot of people who think socialism might not be all that bad. I can tell you, people are not trying to break into Venezuela or Cuba right now. Socialism has failed every time it has been tried, and yet the Chinese Communist Party has a long-term strategy to be a global hegemony. They want to be the rule maker, they want to be the reserve currency, and they want to be the dominant player in the world politically, militarily, socially, and economically.\\n\\nBut it's not just his CCP financial ties that Ossoff has been dishonest with Georgia voters about. Back in 2017, when he ran for the U.S. House and lost in a special election to Republican Karen Handel, Ossoff inflated his national security credentials—for which he was called out by a number of different media outlets including PolitiFact. Ossoff had given off the impression he was a senior national security congressional staffer when in fact he had just worked in a congressional office. Asked about that, Perdue told Breitbart News that, while that is bad indeed, what's worse about him is if Ossoff were to be elected he would serve as a rubber stamp for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\\n\\nThe worst indictment is he will be nothing but an absolute rubber stamp for Chuck Schumer, Perdue said. He perpetrates this agenda if he gets these two seats. But as you speak of this, he actually lied. Let's be direct about this. His clearance, intelligence clearance, in the House, he didn't have what he said he had. He did not have five years of Intel experience. He was a staff guy right out of school at 25 in a House member's office. Now, if you know how House members are organized, there are no 25-year-olds with that type of clearance and he did not have it either. He also, his dad bought a small business for him when he was right out of school so for the last nine years or so he's had this documentary journalism business which is fine, but his biggest client over the last nine years has been Al Jazeera. This is a pattern with this guy and he's never owned up and answered the tough questions about how he has been compromised by dealing with Al Jazeera and PCCW and the Chinese Communist Party. Number one, he's not qualified to be in the Senate, but more than anything else his judgment is impaired. He's been compromised by the Chinese Communist Party, and continues to lie about his background and my background as far as that goes. They don't want to defend the agenda they want to perpetrate, and that's the ultimate thing I want to say this morning is that we've got to get the vote out in Georgia to hold the line against this agenda that we know they want to do, but in these two Senate races these two Senate candidates have been absolutely totally reluctant to talk about what they stand for. They lie about Kelly Loeffler and they lie about me to prevaricate and hide the fact that they would be a rubber stamp for Chuck Schumer. We know what they want to do. He wants to change the voting rules in the Senate so with 51 votes they'll be able to do anything they want, they want to add two or three new states, they want to stack the Supreme Court, and they eventually want to change the way that the House is set up with the number of people per district, which would affect the electoral college, and we know the agenda because it's in the presidential platform they laid out this year. You hear Bernie Sanders and AOC talking about it every day on the news.\\n\\nLISTEN TO SEN. DAVID PERDUE ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY:"}
{"original": "The Trump administration announced Friday that it will roll back school lunch nutrition standards championed by Michelle Obama — on the former first lady's 56th birthday.\\n\\nThe Department of Agriculture said in a statement that the rule change will allow increased flexibility for schools on which fruits and vegetables they can offer students.\\n\\nSchools and school districts continue to tell us that there is still too much food waste and that more common-sense flexibility is needed to provide students nutritious and appetizing meals. We listened and now we're getting to work, said Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue.\\n\\nThe announcement follows the Agriculture Department rolling back nutrition standards for federally subsidized school meals in 2017, which was prompted by excess food waste.\\n\\nIn 2012, the Obama administration toughened standards on nutrition that schools had been required to follow in order to receive federal reimbursement for free and reduced-price meals for low-income students.\\n\\nPerdue's proclamation restored local control of guidelines on whole grains, sodium, and milk in the National School Lunch Program. It did not spell out changes with fruits, vegetables, and protein.\\n\\nThis announcement is the result of years of feedback from students, schools and food service experts about the challenges they are facing in meeting the final regulations for school meals, Perdue said in a release at the time.\\n\\nThe UPI contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on Wednesday declared victory for Democrats in the Georgia Senate runoff races, one of which has been called for Raphael Warnock, promising change with a Democratic Senate, Democratic House, and Democratic President.\\n\\nIt feels like a brand new day. For the first time in six years, Democrats will operate a majority in the United States Senate — and that will be very good for the American people, Schumer said in a statement.\\n\\nAmerica is experiencing one of the greatest crises we have ever faced, and the Senate Democratic Majority is committed to delivering the bold change and help Americans need and demand. Senate Democrats know America is hurting — help is on the way, he said, expressing gratitude to the people of Georgia and across the country who volunteered their time, donated what they could, and worked so hard to elect new leadership in Washington.\\n\\nBoth Warnock and Jon Ossoff, whom he referred to as senators-elect, ran first-rate campaigns and will be outstanding Senators for Georgia, he continued, noting Georgia's senators were both segregationists at the time Warnock, who is black, was born.\\n\\nYesterday, Georgia just elected its first African-American Senator in its history. I am so proud of both their campaigns and excited to welcome them to the Senate, Schumer said.\\n\\nAs Majority Leader, President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris will have a partner who is ready, willing and able to help achieve a forward-looking agenda and deliver help and bold change to the American people, he said, adding that help has been stalled or diluted by Republican leadership in the Senate.\\n\\nThat will change with a Democratic Senate, Democratic House, and Democratic President, the New York lawmaker said, promising to work every day to reward the faith that the American people have placed in us:\\n\\nWarnock defeated GOP incumbent Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) in one of the Senate runoff races in the Peach State. With 98 percent of precincts reporting, Warnock leads Loeffler 50.6 percent to 49.4 percent, according to the Associated Press.\\n\\nThe race between Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) and Jon Ossoff is a bit tighter and yet to be called, although the Democrat leads Perdue 50.2 percent to 49.8 percent with 98 percent reporting. Neither GOP senators had conceded as of Wednesday morning.\\n\\nAs we've said repeatedly over the last several weeks and as recently as this evening, this is an exceptionally close election that will require time and transparency to be certain the results are fair and accurate and the voices of Georgians are heard, Perdue's campaign said in a statement.\\n\\nWe will mobilize every available resource and exhaust every legal recourse to ensure all legally cast ballots are properly counted, it continued. We believe in the end, Senator Perdue will be victorious."}
{"original": "Mainstream media outlets, including NPR, the Associated Press and the UK's Guardian newspaper, have adopted the antisemitic canard that Israel is denying Palestinians access to the coronavirus vaccine while its own vaccine drive enjoys stunning success.\\n\\nThe Guardian article, which was also published in its sister paper, the leftwing Observer, was headlined Palestinians excluded from Israeli Covid vaccine rollout as jabs go to settlers, and featured a lead photo of an ultra-Orthodox Jew being vaccinated.\\n\\nThe subhead reads: Human rights groups accuse Israel of dodging obligations to millions in occupied territories who may wait months for vaccination.\\n\\nNPR, meanwhile, published a piece entitled, As Israel leads in COVID-19 vaccines per capita, Palestinians still await shots.\\n\\nThe Associated Press ran a piece, republished by scores of news outlets including PBS and Al Jazeera, headlined: Palestinians left waiting as Israel is set to deploy COVID-19 vaccine.\\n\\nBut as critics have noted, Israel has neither the responsibility nor the authority to provide Palestinians with the vaccines. Instead, it is up to the Palestinian Authority to do so.\\n\\nThe PA, which chose to cut off coordination and security ties with Israel last year, has not even approached Israel for help on the matter — a fact Oliver Holmes and Hazem Balousha, the authors of the Guardian piece, themselves admit, but only midway through the article do they bother to mention it.\\n\\nIsrael transports batches of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine deep inside the West Bank. But they are only distributed to Jewish settlers, and not the roughly 2.7 million Palestinians living around them who may have to wait for weeks or months, Holmes and Balousha write.\\n\\nThe Board of Deputies of British Jews slammed the Observer and the Guardian over the piece, saying it provided grist to the mill of far-right and far-left antisemites alike.\\n\\nSheila Gewolb, the group's Senior Vice President, said in a statement, We are extremely troubled by the Observer's blatantly false headline claiming that Israel has 'excluded' Palestinians from its Covid-19 vaccination program.\\n\\nVACCINE RACE: Israel #2 in world today in vaccinating the public per capita pic.twitter.com/JBdCsLvC22 — Aaron Klein (@AaronKleinShow) December 25, 2020\\n\\nThe Palestinian Authority is responsible for vaccinations provided to Palestinians in both the West Bank and Gaza, she went on. As reported within the same article, the PA has not even asked Israel for help in this regard, looking to source the vaccines elsewhere.\\n\\nShe continued by saying the paper fueled antisemites who seek to take anything positive Israel does and twist it beyond recognition, and called on the papers to change the headline and issue and apology.\\n\\nShany Mor, a researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute, said on Twitter that no mainstream outlet has done more than the Guardian in the past 30 years to normalize the view that the Jewish state is uniquely diabolically evil.\\n\\nHe said that the Guardian perpetuates a sub-genre of journalism that presents a false story of Israeli medical malpractice which is supposed to prove the innate moral rot of the Jewish state, and pointed to a slew of discredited articles published by the paper, including a 2009 claim that Israel harvests Palestinians' organs, a 2013 claim that Israel forced contraceptives on Ethiopian citizens, and a 2014 claim that Israel deliberately targeted Gaza hospitals.\\n\\nThose articles invariably involve 1) Crazy Jewish doctors doing something fishy. 2) Broad hints that their motivations are racist supremacy. 3) Heroic humanitarians bravely standing up to the nefarious Jewish plot.\\n\\nDespite the PA's choice to cut ties, Israel has been helping it stem the infection rate with a variety of different initiatives including training medical personnel and donating testing kits.\\n\\nHealth Minister Yuli Edelstein last month told The New York Times that it was in Jerusalem's interest to ensure that Ramallah was on top of the virus spread in Palestinian areas.\\n\\nAs the Jerusalem Post notes, Israel is already vaccinating Palestinians living in Jerusalem, because healthcare for those Palestinians, unlike those in Gaza and the West Bank, do fall under Israel's jurisdiction. Israel also plans to vaccinate Palestinians who are currently serving time in Israeli prisons.\\n\\nThe country has also rolled out its nationwide vaccine drive with a heavy emphasis on Arab areas, which have disproportionately been affected by the coronavirus. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has visited vaccine centers in two Arab cities in recent days in an effort to convince more Arab-Israelis, who are wary of the jab, to get vaccinated.\\n\\nIsrael advances status of LGBTQ?

{"original": "Former Vice President Joe Biden claimed on Sunday that his strong support from minority voters stemmed, in part, from having been politically raised in the black church.\\n\\nBiden, who recently suggested he turned out as many black voters in 2008 as did Barack Obama, addressed an NAACP forum in Des Moines, Iowa, on Sunday. At the event, the former vice president spoke of his connection to black voters, asserting his political identity was forged through a decades-long relationship with Delaware's large minority community.\\n\\nI have a lot of black support because that's where I come from. I was raised in the black church, politically, not a joke, Biden told the event's audience, which was mostly white, according to the Washington Examiner.\\n\\nWhen I got into politics, I was the only white guy working on the east side, in the projects, because these were the guys I grew up with, the former vice president added. These were the guys I worked with.\\n\\nThe claim is similar to those the former vice president has made throughout the entire span of his political career. While first running for president in 1988, Biden was forced to drop out of the race after a number of the assertions he made about his background were proved false. Most notably, as Breitbart News has reported, Biden claimed during that campaign that he marched in the civil rights movement.\\n\\nWhen I marched in the civil rights movement, I did not march with a 12-point program, Biden told a group of New Hampshire school children in 1987. I marched with tens of thousands of others to change attitudes, and we changed attitudes.\\n\\nAs Matt Flegenheimer of the New York Times pointed out, however, the candidate had, in fact, never marched.\\n\\nMore than once, advisers had gently reminded Mr. Biden of the problem with this formulation: He had not actually marched during the civil rights movement, Flegenheimer wrote. And more than once, Mr. Biden assured them he understood—and kept telling the story anyway.\\n\\nEven though such claims were debunked and there is little evidence Biden took part in any civil rights demonstrations after high school, the former vice president has continued to exaggerate his role within the movement as he seeks the 2020 Democrat nomination.\\n\\nI never thought coming out of the civil rights movement, that I'd see people walking out in fields, carrying torches, Biden said at South Carolina's Limestone College in August 2019 when accusing the Trump administration of emboldening racists."}

{"original": "ESPN seems to be the big loser in the latest trends for cable pricing plans, analysis shows.\\n\\nAs the cable industry struggles with customers cutting the cord and ending their relationship with cable television, the industry is toying with a new way to sell cable by offering skinny bundles of networks. The new plans of fewer networks will sell at a lower price point than the more expensive, all-inclusive plans presented to customers since cable came on the scene.\\n\\nBut, cable networks that have high overhead costs like ESPN just don't fit in with bundles of cheaper programming, meaning that the nearly 40-year-old sports network is on the losing end of the stick with the new pricing plans. This complicates the future of a network already groaning under the loss of millions of viewers.\\n\\nCable companies look to offer smaller bundles of networks to viewers that hope to get away from the $200 and higher cable bills. The new bundles range in price from $50 to $100 depending on the package.\\n\\nBut, networks like Nickelodeon and ESPN, with their high production costs, are not included in these cheaper bundles because cable providers can't make back their costs by including them.\\n\\nFor its part, ESPN warns that it may go to court to force providers to add the sports network to the cheaper bundles. As The Wall Street Journal recently reported, ESPN said that if those bundles grew in popularity to become the operator's most or second-most distributed packages, ESPN would have to be included contractually.\\n\\nClearly, ESPN believes its current contracts would force providers to add the sports network into its new, low-cost packages. But, will that set the two entities up for a court fight? Perhaps so.\\n\\nThe Journal reminds readers that as ESPN owner Disney finds the number of lost subscribers growing, the entertainment giant is already working to offer cheaper sports alternatives:\\n\\nAfter Disney reported a slightly increased pace of subscriber declines at ESPN, Disney CEO Bob Iger promised new streaming services focused on certain sports or teams. Given that ESPN's flagship programming won't be offered, those services are likely to be a niche offering, which may limit the benefits, wrote Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar in a research note.\\n\\nIn the meantime, it appears that ESPN is being left behind again as the cable industry tries to change to serve customers better.\\n\\nIt only makes ESPN's future seem murkier than ever. This year the network has lost over 10,000 subscribers a month. The report came just ahead of several rounds of layoffs that hit the Connecticut-based company, the latest of which claimed over 100 jobs.\\n\\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com."}

{"original": "A new poll shows that a plurality of Americans believe that Johnny Manziel does not deserve another shot at the NFL.\\n\\nThe Yahoo Sports/YouGov poll of 1,183 adults found that 42 percent of Americans think the former Heisman Trophy-winner does not deserve another chance in the NFL and 40 percent of respondents believe that he does. Eighteen percent did not offer an opinion. The younger the survey-taker, the more likely it was for them to support the beleaguered quarterback receiving another look in the league.\\n\\nThe release of the poll follows a Thursday court date in which a judge instructed Manziel to stay away from his ex-fiancee, who alleges that he assaulted her this winter. In addition to a police helicopter searching for Manziel in Texas, the player allegedly trashed a mansion he had rented with friends, lost the services of two disgusted sports agents, showed up at the Coachella music festival, and received his walking papers from the Cleveland Browns all in 2016.\\n\\nThe change of fortune comes less than two years from the night Manziel rubbed his thumb and forefinger together in a money gesture after the Browns drafted him in the first round of the 2014 NFL draft. The undersized quarterback failed to make much of an impression on the field and made the wrong kind of impression off of it, no-showing mandatory team sessions and allegedly showing up hungover to other team meetings. As Manziel did not hide his life as a late-night carouser in college, the Browns can't say they were not warned.\\n\\nAlso as part of the survey, YouGov developed a word cloud based on the words people most commonly used to refer to Manziel, Yahoo Sports points out. That's a little more definitive: the word good is the largest descriptor, but almost every other word after that, including loser, idiot, troubled, and stupid, has a negative connotation."}

Bobby Scott (D-VA), which passed through the chamber on strictly partisan lines.\\n\\nDespite the Pro Act's title, many Republicans contend that the legislation contains many provisions that actually harm workers.

Fred Keller (R-PA) wrote in an op-ed this week.\\n\\nThe Democrat union bill also contains language that would allow illegal aliens to participate in unions.\\n\\nFor instance, page 19 of the ProAct allows for illegal aliens to obtain back pay:\\n\\nProvided further, no relief under this subsection shall be denied on the basis that the employee is, or was during the time of relevant employment or during the back pay period, an unauthorized alien as defined in section 274A(h)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1324a(h)(3)) or any other provision of Federal law relating to the unlawful employment of aliens.\\n\\nRep. Kevin Hern (R-OK) proposed a motion to recommit or send the legislation to the Education and Labor Committee, with instructions that the bill includes a provision that would prevent illegal aliens from communicating and working with a labor union.\\n\\nThe Republican amendment states, A labor union shall not communicate with an employee regarding joining or supporting the labor organization if the employee is not authorized to work in the United States.\\n\\nWhile Hern spoke, Democrats frequently interrupted, booed, and hissed at the Oklahoman congressman when he delivered his remarks.\\n\\nWATCH: Democrats hiss and boo as @repkevinhern stands up for American workers. pic.twitter.com/HPg7f6KymR — Mark Bednar (@MarkBednar) February 7, 2020\\n\\nHern said on the House floor:\\n\\nThis amendment ensures that labor unions are not using illegal foreign labor to expand their reach into American workplaces & collect more union dues. Under current law, an employee can sign a union authorization card to count toward the showing of interest in a union election regardless of whether that worker is authorized to work in the United States. Illegal immigrants should not be working at American companies, let alone used by labor unions to organize workplaces. This Motion to Recommit ensures that unions cannot communicate with employees for organizing purposes if the employee is not legally authorized to work in the United States. … The change we're proposing here is simple. We're asking that unions be barred from contacting individuals who are not eligible to work in our country. If an employer cannot hire someone in our country illegally, a union should not be allowed to organize those individuals. Believe it or not, this is not currently outlawed. If my colleagues insist on moving forward with legislation that empowers union bosses and strips independence from our workers, they should not do it in a way that encourages illegal immigration. … This Motion to Recommit would make the PRO Act pro-American worker, rather than just pro-union bosses.\\n\\nRep. Andy Levin (D-MI) said in response to Hern that the Republican amendment to block illegal aliens from participating in unions deters all workers from organizing.\\n\\nDemocrats rejected the amendment that would have blocked illegal aliens from working with unions, with 223 lawmakers against and 195 in favor of the amendment.\\n\\nReps. Joe Cunningham (D-SC), Abigail Spanberger (D-VA), and Collin Peterson (D-MN) voted with Republicans to pass the amendment, while Rep.

{"original": "Home Secretary Priti Patel is just about the only proper Conservative within the Boris Johnson administration — so naturally, the left-leaning Remainer Deep State is trying to destroy her and claim her scalp.\\n\\nAll week, the media has been full of stories — leaked, of course, by her Deep State enemies in the Civil Service — about what an awful, useless minister Patel is. One egregious rumour claimed that MI5 officials were withholding intelligence from her because they did not trust her. (MI5 has robustly denied this). Other reports have claimed that she is a workplace bully in the habit of swearing, belittling people, making unreasonable and repeated demands.\\n\\nThe last claim was made by Sir Philip Rutnam, the senior Home Office official who publicly resigned at the weekend in front of a BBC camera crew, in order to cause maximum embarrassment to Patel and the government.\\n\\nRutnam — nicknamed Sir Calamity because in his time as a senior civil servant he has presided over so many cock-ups and disasters — is the very embodiment of the kind of remote, arrogant, complacent, intractable and devious Deep State mandarin that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's chief advisor Dominic Cummings is trying to purge from the Civil Service.\\n\\nLike most of the Civil Service, Rutnam is an ardent Remainer. Though his job is to implement government policy, Rutnam appeared to spend more of his time trying to frustrate it – especially with regards to the plans for Brexit, which Rutnam claimed, were too ambitious to complete in time for the December deadline.\\n\\nAccording to the Sun's account of their spat:\\n\\nBut Ms Patel's allies last night retaliated to dub Sir Philip a classic, old school establishment mandarin who is overly cautious. One said: He is very good at blocking things without saying it. It is never a flat out 'no', just lots of 'ooh minister, that's very courageous'.\\n\\nRutnam, in other words, was ripe for the chop. But by jumping before he was pushed, he was able to present his departure as a case of high moral principle – while sticking the knife into Patel.\\n\\nHis pompous resignation letter gives a pretty good idea of the kind of man Rutnam is:\\n\\nOne of my duties as permanent secretary was to protect the health, safety and wellbeing of our 35,000 people. This created tension with the Home Secretary, and I have encouraged her to change her behaviours. I have received allegations that her conduct has included shouting and swearing, belittling people, making unreasonable and repeated demands – behaviour that created fear and that needed some bravery to call out.\\n\\nIt's really not difficult to read between the lines here. Rutnam – and his fellow civil servants – tried to frustrate Patel rather than help her. Patel wasn't having this and made her displeasure known. This then enabled the Civil Service to pretend that the issue was Patel's workplace bullying rather than its own institutional sclerosis and incompetence.\\n\\nThe liberal elite hunts in packs, so it comes as no surprise whatsoever to find that the BBC is ganging up with the Civil Service to try to oust Patel.\\n\\nBREAKING: A formal complaint about Priti Patel's conduct was made when she was Employment Minister at Department for Work and Pensions,@BBCNews has been told.

But equally no one likes the tendency — especially prevalent among the kind of Social Justice Warrior snowflake types rampant in the Civil Service — towards using mental health issues as a way of avoiding responsibility for laziness or incompetence.\\n\\nAcheson's article for Cap X about his experiences at the Home Office is well worth a read.\\n\\nHe writes:\\n\\nBut I have also encountered many more people in public service who allege bullying or go off sick with 'stress' at the point where they are facing exposure and accountability for failure to deliver. This can also be the final throw of the dice for the bureaucrat who, having used all his obfuscatory ammunition to no effect, deploys the 'B' word.\\n\\nAnd he goes on to spell out just why it's so important that Boris stands up for Patel:\\n\\nTo put it bluntly, people burying their kids due to knife crime, fearful about violent extremism, plagued by a collapse of civility and antisocial behaviour, marooned in postcodes where the only visible authority is a parking ticket aren't interested in the bruised feelings of some well-heeled permanent secretaries. They want things done. Their preference will be to back a Home Secretary who is on their side and impatient for results. The political rhymes with the personal. And that constituency dwarfs the Whitehall machine.\\n\\nAbsolutely right. The voters who gave Boris Johnson an 80-seat majority did not do so in order to buoy up the overmanned, overpaid, self-serving Civil Service — not least because that Civil Service is full of people who think that Brexit voters are ignorant, fascistic thickos.\\n\\nReports today suggest that Prime Minister Boris Johnson is 'sticking by' Priti Patel (who, symbolically, sat next to him on the government benches). Boris is not stupid; his chief advisor Dominic Cummings even less so: lose this one and they lose the entire game."}

Aaronson compared Google's decision-making process in this regard to a closely-guarded Pepsi Formula.\\n\\nThese comments, part of a longer post copied below, seem to contradict Google CEO Sundar Pichai's sworn congressional testimony that his company does not manually intervene on any particular search result.\\n\\nAccording to an internal discussion thread leaked to Breitbart News by a source within the company, a Google employee took issue with Pichai's remarks, stating that it seems like we are pretty eager to cater our search results to the social and political agenda of left-wing journalists.\\n\\nAccording to the posts leaked by the source, revealed that YouTube, a Google subsidiary, manually intervened on search results related to abortion and abortions. The intervention caused pro-life videos to disappear from the top ten search results for those terms, where they had previously been featured prominently. The posts also show YouTube intervened on search results related to progressive activist David Hogg and Democrat politician Maxine Waters.\\n\\nIn a comment to Breitbart News, a Google spokeswoman also insisted that Google has never manipulated or modified the search results or content in any of its products to promote a particular political ideology.\\n\\nPichai might claim that he was just talking about Google, not YouTube, which was the focus of the leaked discussion thread. But Aaronson's post extends to Google's other products: organic search, Google Home, and Google Assistant.\\n\\nAaronson is also clear that the manipulation of the search results that are prone to abuse/controversial content is not a small affair, but are the responsibility of huge teams within Google.\\n\\nThese lines are very difficult and can be very blurry, we are all well aware of this. So we've got huge teams that stay cognizant of these facts when we're crafting policies considering classifier changes, or reacting with manual actions\\n\\nIf Google has huge teams that sometimes manually intervene on search results, it's scarcely plausible to argue that Pichai might not know about them.\\n\\nAaronson's full post is copied below:\\n\\nI work in Trust and Safety and while I have no particular input as to exactly what's happening for YT I can try to explain why you'd have this kind of list and why people are finding lists like these on Code Search. When dealing with abuse/controversial content on various mediums you have several levers to deal with problems. Two prominent levers are Proactive and Reactive: Proactive: Usually refers to some type of algorithm/scalable solution to a general problem E.g.: We don't allow straight up porn on YouTube so we create a classifier that detects porn and automatically remove or flag for review the videos the porn classifier is most certain of\\n\\nReactive: Usually refers to a manual fix to something that has been brought to our attention that our proactive solutions don't/didn't work on and something that is clearly in the realm of bad enough to warrant a quick targeted solution (determined by pages and pages of policies worked on over many years and many teams to be fair and cover necessary scope) E.g.: A website that used to be a good blog had it's domain expire and was purchased/repurposed to spam Search results with autogenerated pages full of gibberish text, scraped images, and links to boost traffic to other spammy sites. It is manually actioned for violating policy These Organic Search policies and the consequences to violating them are public\\n\\nManually reacting to things is not very scalable, and is not an ideal solution to most problems, so the proactive lever is really the one we all like to lean on. Ideally, our classifiers/algorithm are good at providing useful and rich results to our users while ignoring things at are not useful or not relevant. But we all know, this isn't exactly the case all the time (especially on YouTube). From a user perspective, there are subjects that are prone to hyperbolic content, misleading information, and offensive content. Now, these words are highly subjective and no one denies that. But we can all agree generally, lines exist in many cultures about what is clearly okay vs. what is not okay. E.g. a video of a puppy playing with a toy is probably okay in almost every culture or context, even if it's not relevant to the query. But a video of someone committing suicide and begging others to follow in his/her footsteps is probably on the other side of the line for many folks. While my second example is technically relevant to the generic query of suicide, that doesn't mean that this is a very useful or good video to promote on the top of results for that query. So imagine a classifier that says, for any queries on a particular text file, let's pull videos using signals that we historically understand to be strong indicators of quality (I won't go into specifics here, but those signals do exist). We're not manually curating these results, we're just saying hey, be extra careful with results for this query because many times really bad stuff can appear and lead to a bad experience for most users. Ideally the proactive lever did this for us, but in extreme cases where we need to act quickly on something that is so obviously not okay, the reactive/manual approach is sometimes necessary. And also keep in mind, that this is different for every product. The bar for changing classifiers or manual actions on span in organic search is extremely high. However, the bar for things we let our Google Assistant say out loud might be a lot lower. If I search for Jews run the banks – I'll likely find anti-semitic stuff in organic search. As a Jew, I might find some of these results offensive, but they are there for people to research and view, and I understand that this is not a reflection of Google feels about this issue. But if I ask Google assistant Why do Jews run the banks we wouldn't be similarly accepting if it repeated and promoted conspiracy theories that likely pop up in organic search in her smoothing voice. Whether we agree or not, user perception of our responses, results, and answers of different products and mediums can change. And I think many people are used to the fact that organic search is a place where content should be accessible no matter how offensive it might be, however, the expectation is very different on a Google Home, a Knowledge Panel, or even YouTube. These lines are very difficult and can be very blurry, we are all well aware of this. So we've got huge teams that stay cognizant of these facts when we're crafting policies considering classifier changes, or reacting with manual actions – these decisions are not made in a vacuum, but admittedly are also not made in a highly public forum like TGIF or IndustryInfo (as you can imagine, decisions/agreement would be hard to get in such a wide list – image if all your CL's were reviewed by every engineer across Google all the time). I hope that answers some questions and gives a better layer of transparency without going into details about our Pepsi formula.

Because of their extensive training, the dogs are not like regular dogs, Larner said. He also insisted it would not be easy to retrain the dogs to ignore scents they have been trained to recognize since they were young.\\n\\nHe noted that if dogs do not take to retraining, they may subject people to unfair drug stops. We do not want to subject innocent citizens or motorists who travel through Illinois … to unlawful search and seizures, Larner said.\\n\\nThe dog expert added that K-9s are not easily adopted by willing families because they are not trained to be social animals.\\n\\nMacon County Sheriff Howard Buffett agreed the dogs will be put in jeopardy if pot is legalized. [T]he biggest thing for law enforcement is, you're going to have to replace all of your dogs, Buffett said. So to me, it's a giant step forward for drug dealers, and it's a giant step backwards for law enforcements and the residents of the community.\\n\\nAssistant Police Chief Steve Petrilli of the Normal Police Department also said dogs could not be retrained to ignore the scent of marijuana and insisted K-9s would end up being euthanized if lawmakers change the laws.\\n\\nOther states have faced similar problems after changes in the law. Some have tried retraining, while others have retained their K-9s for use only in large-scale drug seizures instead of using them for sniffing out pot in small cases.\\n\\nThen there are the training costs that will go to waste if K-9s become useless due to legalization. According to the outlet, it takes up to 16 weeks to train a dog and costs about $5,000 per dog for initial training in drug detection. The ultimate cost can be $16,000 per dog with ongoing training and maintenance. If dogs are euthanized because of a law change, that would be precious budget money wasted and then doubled, as new dogs will have to be purchased and trained in ways to reflect the new laws.\\n\\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston."}

Although the main campus is in Fairfax, its law school is in a separate facility in Arlington, close to the Potomac River, as part of the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area.\\n\\nWith an enrollment of approximately 500 students, George Mason's law school has been ranked as a Tier One (top 50) law school for almost half of its 37-year existence.\\n\\nThe university is named for the Founding Father who refused to sign the U.S. Constitution because it granted government vast powers but did not also explicitly declare the people's individual rights. His protest in large part led to the addition of ten constitutional amendments that comprise the Bill of Rights, two years after the ratification of the original Constitution.\\n\\nOn March 31, the Board of Visitors of George Mason University announced that it was renaming the university's law school in honor of Justice Scalia. Similar to the university's having been named in recognition of Mason's role as the Father of the Bill of Rights, the board chose to name the law school in recognition of Scalia's role as a historic figure in the development of American law and a champion of constitutional government.\\n\\nThe law school announced it had received two large donations totaling $30 million, $10 million of which came from the Charles Koch Foundation, and the other $20 million from a donor who wishes to remain anonymous, but who asked for the name change.\\n\\nThese donations will fund three new scholarships and the hiring of additional faculty. George Mason's law school is well known for having a faculty that has at least as many conservatives and libertarians as liberals, providing a balanced education in terms of constitutional interpretation and legal philosophy.\\n\\nAs a Washington-area law school, many of the professors have had extensive experience on Capitol Hill and in top executive-branch positions, including the White House and U.S. Justice Department. Several federal appeals judges have served on faculty as either adjuncts or full-time professors. Justice Scalia—who was a law professor before becoming a federal judge—had also lectured at the law school.\\n\\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg responded to the news of the school's taking Scalia's name, saying that it was a fitting tribute to her dear friend:\\n\\nJustice Scalia was a law teacher, public servant, legal commentator, and jurist nonpareil. As a colleague who held him in the highest esteem and great affection, I miss his bright company and the stimulus he provided, his opinions ever challenging me to meet his best effort with my own. It is a tribute altogether fitting that George Mason University's law school will bear his name. May the funds for scholarships, faculty growth, and curricular development aid the Antonin Scalia School of Law to achieve the excellence characteristic of Justice Scalia, grand master in life and law.\\n\\nIn announcing the name change, Henry Butler, the dean of the law school, added:\\n\\nJustice Scalia's name evokes the very strengths of our school: civil liberties, law and economics, and constitutional law. His career embodies our law school's motto of learn, challenge, lead. As a professor and a jurist, he challenged those around him to be rigorous, intellectually honest, and consistent in their arguments.\\n\\nThe anonymous donor of the multimillion-dollar gift approached Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the influential Federalist Society, and also a close personal friend of Scalia and his family. Leo said:\\n\\nThe Scalia family is pleased to see George Mason name its law school after the justice, helping to memorialize his commitment to a legal education that is grounded in academic freedom and a recognition of the practice of law as an honorable and intellectually rigorous craft.\\n\\nThe name change must be approved by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, which is expected to allow the change.\\n\\nKen Klukowski is legal editor for Breitbart News.

In January, after faculty criticism of the policy, Khurana created a task force to address the criticisms and reconsider the policy.\\n\\nLast May, Khurana argued that single-gender social groups have led to an environment at Harvard that is based on social power imbalances and oppression.\\n\\nDiscrimination is pernicious, Khurana wrote.

In this case, the discriminatory membership policies of these organizations have led to the perpetuation of spaces that are rife with power imbalances. The most entrenched of these spaces send an unambiguous message that they are the exclusive preserves of men.\\n\\nDouglas Melton, co-chair of the implementation committee, claimed that the policy was proposed to enact social change at Harvard.\\n\\nGenerally what we're trying to help the College do is effect a cultural change and that won't happen with one policy or in one month or in one year, Melton said. We're not of the view that if [Khurana] followed our recommendations then next term everything would be picture perfect.\\n\\nAlthough it's unclear what effect this would have on the Harvard community, the social change intended is to transition single-gender social groups to co-ed status.

{"original": "While much of President Trump's attention has been focused on illegal immigration and the soaring level of border-crossers at the United States-Mexico border, reforms to the country's legal immigration system remain one of the key tenets of his America First agenda.\\n\\nThese are five legal immigration reforms that Trump can readily follow through on in 2019 to fulfill his campaign promises ahead of 2020.\\n\\n1. Reduce Legal Immigration Levels to Raise U.S. Wages\\n\\nEvery year, the U.S. admits about 1.1 million mostly low-skilled legal immigrants, many of whom immediately become low-wage competition for America's working and middle class. The latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau marks a nearly 108-year record high of immigration to the country. In 2017, the foreign-born population boomed to 13.7 percent, encompassing 44.5 million immigrants.\\n\\nThat 44.5 million includes roughly 22 million naturalized citizens, 11 million other residents – including more than 1.5 million foreign temporary visa-workers – plus at least 11 million illegal aliens.\\n\\nThe Washington, DC-imposed policy of mass immigration is a boon to corporate executives, Wall Street, big business, and multinational conglomerates as every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of each occupation's labor force reduces those Americans' hourly wages by 0.4 percent. Every one percent increase in the immigrant workforce reduces Americans' overall wages by 0.8 percent.\\n\\nMuch of the inflow comes from the process known as chain migration, whereby newly arrived naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S., so Trump could drive up wages rather quickly for American workers by ending the category; ending the Diversity Visa Lottery program, which imports about 55,000 random foreign nationals every year; and implementing mandatory nationwide E-Verify to cut down on foreign competition in the U.S. labor market.\\n\\nAs Breitbart News has extensively reported, Since 2005, 9.3 million foreign nationals have been able to resettle in the U.S. through chain migration. This huge inflow outpaces two years of American births, which amount to roughly four million babies every year.\\n\\nThe number of extended-family foreign nationals who have resettled in the U.S. in the last decade is greater than the total combined population of Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco, and Cleveland.\\n\\n2. Crackdown on American Job Outsourcing via H-1B\\n\\nUSCIS has been considering a plan since April to massively reform the country's largest American job outsourcing scheme, the H-1B visa program.\\n\\nEvery year, more than 100,000 foreign workers considered high-skilled are brought to the U.S. on the H-1B visa and are allowed to stay for up to six years. There are about 650,000 H-1B visa foreign workers in the U.S. at any given moment. This program gives hundreds of thousands of good white-collar jobs to foreigners instead of young American scientists, software developers, engineers, chemists, graphic designers, investment analysts, and accountants.\\n\\nAmericans are often laid off in the process and forced to train their foreign replacements, as highlighted by Breitbart News. More than 85,000 Americans annually potentially lose their jobs to foreign labor through the H-1B visa program. Worse, the H-1B system allows U.S. companies to hire inexperienced foreigners who will work in exchange for getting green cards from the government, instead of allowing U.S. graduates to develop their skills in the job market.\\n\\nThe USCIS regulatory change that has yet to be implemented would narrow the definition of specialty occupations, keeping big business and outsourcing firms from importing cheaper foreign workers for high-paying, white-collar jobs that American citizens could do. Additionally, the change would increase the annual wage requirement for the foreign imports, driving up wages for Americans in the process.\\n\\nThe plan would only approve H-1B visas for foreign workers who have perfected a foreign style in fashion design, marketing managers with expert knowledge of foreign markets, and doctors and software designers who are considered extraordinary.\\n\\nImplementing the change would be a promise kept to the laid off, replaced, and forgotten American workers who rallied with Trump against all odds in the 2016 presidential election.\\n\\n3. Convert the J-1 Visa to an Economic Engine for Inner-City Youth\\n\\nIn August 2015, then-candidate Trump released his immigration policy papers which, among other things, demanded an end to the J-1 visa in favor of an economic opportunity program for inner-city youth.\\n\\nThe J-1 visa jobs program for foreign youth will be terminated and replaced with a resume bank for inner-city youth provided to all corporate subscribers to the J-1 visa program, the Trump immigration policy paper stated under a section header calling for a jobs program for inner-city youth.\\n\\nThe J-1 visa, brings up to 300,000 foreign youths to the U.S. every year, Breitbart News has noted, to take American jobs at summer resorts, national parks, and tourist destinations.\\n\\nThus far, the J-1 visa has remained in place, unreformed, though the new year brings a new opportunity for the Trump administration to tackle the small, but essential reform.\\n\\n4. Enforce Modern 'Public Charge' Rule\\n\\nTrump's United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) seems to be planning to implement a modern public charge rule that would protect American taxpayers' dollars from funding the mass importation of welfare-dependent foreign nationals.\\n\\nThe USCIS rule provides that legal immigrants would be less likely to secure permanent residency in the U.S. if they have used any forms of welfare in the past, including using Obamacare, food stamps, and public housing.\\n\\nEssentially, foreigners in the U.S. would not be allowed an adjustment of status to become green card holders unless they can show they will not be a burden on other Americans.\\n\\nThe immigration controls would be a boon for American taxpayers in the form of an annual $57.4 billion tax cut — the amount taxpayers spend every year on paying for the welfare, crime, and schooling costs of the country's mass importation of 1.5 million new, mostly low-skilled legal immigrants.\\n\\nAs Breitbart News reported, the majority of the more than 1.5 million immigrants entering the country every year use about 57 percent more food stamps than the average native-born American household. Overall, immigrant households consume 33 percent more cash welfare than American citizen households and 44 percent more in Medicaid dollars.\\n\\nThis straining of public services by a booming 44.5 million foreign-born population translates to the average immigrant household costing American taxpayers $6,234 in federal welfare.\\n\\nSuch a rule would even likely shift migration to the U.S. away from the poorest regions of the world — like Mexico and Central America — towards more middle class areas in Europe and Japan.\\n\\n5. Sign Executive Order Ending Birthright Citizenship\\n\\nIn October, Trump announced that he was readying a plan to end the country's birthright citizenship policy whereby the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens are rewarded with American citizenship despite their parents having arrived unlawfully.\\n\\nNow, how ridiculous–we are the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits? It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous–and it has to end, Trump said at the time of ending birthright citizenship.\\n\\nThe children of illegal aliens are commonly known as anchor babies, as they anchor their illegal alien and noncitizen parents in the U.S. There are at least 4.5 million anchor babies in the country, a population that exceeds the total number of annual American births. Roughly 300,000 anchor babies are born every year.\\n\\nPoll: Vast Majority of GOP Voters Want U.S. Anchor Baby Policy Endedhttps://t.co/dhbcZbU56J — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) November 6, 2018\\n\\nThe Supreme Court, however, has never explicitly ruled that the children of illegal aliens must be granted automatic citizenship and many legal scholars dispute the idea.\\n\\nAdditionally, as Breitbart News reported, there are nearly 62 million immigrants and their U.S.-born children — given birthright citizenship — living across the U.S. There were 17.1 million U.S.-born minor children of immigrants in the country as of 2017, according to the latest data by the Center for Immigration Studies.\\n\\nThe U.S. is nearly alone in granting birthright citizenship to the children of foreign nationals. For example, the U.S. and Canada are two of the only developed nations with birthright citizenship. On the other hand, countries such as France, the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Italy, and Germany all have either outlawed birthright citizenship or never had such a policy to begin with.\\n\\nTrump has yet to sign the executive order.\\n\\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

{"original": "The cable industry is in the process of reinventing itself, in order to stop, or stall, the process of its own demise.\\n\\nUpon realizing that people really don't like paying for television channels they don't watch, the industry has come up with offers consumers something called a skinny bundle, a smaller package of channels that still includes some premium channels.\\n\\nEssentially, the skinny bundle would serve as a limbo status that saves consumers some money, hopefully, in the eyes of the cable networks and slows down the rate of cord-cutting while the industry makes the inevitable transition to a la carte cable packages.\\n\\nAnother idea, one which could have devastating consequences for sports networks like ESPN, is something called the entertainment package, an idea explained at a recent conference by Viacom CEO Bob Bakish.\\n\\nAccording to Variety:\\n\\nBakish referenced the slew of OTT skinny bundle offerings that are hitting the market at around $40. He told J.P. Morgan media analyst Alexia Quadrani that what he called the entertainment pack option would probably be priced around $10-$20. The new breed of digital MVPDs are still not transformational opportunities for pay TV because they remain dominated by broadcast signals and sports. He doubted whether new offerings from YouTube, DirecTV Now and Hulu would have much appeal to what he called cord-never millennials. The transformational opportunity is to bring in a new entry segment at a much lower price point, Bakish said. The industry needs a path to bring in someone who wants high-quality entertainment but doesn't want to pay for sports channels. With a truly low-cost entertainment option, MVPDs can also offer more flexibility to consumers to trade up from and trade down as the household needs change.\\n\\nFor an inside look at the mentality of cable/television CEOs when it comes to sports channels, look no further than where Bakish says, the industry needs a path to bring in someone who wants high-quality entertainment, but doesn't want to pay for sports channels.\\n\\nYikes.\\n\\nTwo things shine clear from that statement: first, industry executives believe high-quality entertainment can be had without sports channels. Secondly, industry execs not only know full well that bloated sports channels with huge subscriber fees have killed cable television, they're prepared to cut the cord on the sports networks altogether in order to save their own skins.\\n\\nThese two revelations should send shockwaves down the corridors of power in Bristol, Connecticut.\\n\\nESPN has already lost twelve million subscribers in the last six years, precisely because no one wants to pay exorbitant fees for a sports channel they don't watch. Should this entertainment package become a reality, a smaller, cheaper package that saves the consumer money and doesn't force them to buy sports networks, then ESPN could see those subscriber losses soar even beyond the two million per year loss rate they've averaged over the last six years.\\n\\nThe layoffs that would ensue in such a scenario would make the layoffs that took place last month look like a molehill in the shadow of a mountain.\\n\\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn"}

{"original": "AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) — Rory McIlroy knows better than most how quickly fortunes can change in the Masters.\\n\\nHe was eight shots behind Friday and headed to the scariest par 3 at Augusta National in tree-shaking wind. All that mattered was picking the right club, hoping for the right wind and getting it somewhere on the 12th green. He did just that, made his par and began an important climb back into contention.\\n\\nWith birdies on the par 5s and a bonus birdie from a 40-foot putt on the par-3 16th, McIlroy recovered for a 1-under 71 that put him right in the thick of the tournament going into the weekend.\\n\\nThe most comfortable thing for me on this golf course is knowing that even if you are five or six shots back, things can change quite quickly, McIlroy said. I've been on the opposite end of that where things can start to get away from you.\\n\\nA green jacket is all that keeps McIlroy from the career Grand Slam. He looked to have that wrapped up five years ago when he took a four-shot lead into the final round, only to close with an 80 and finish 10 shots behind.\\n\\nMcIlroy is a long way from redemption. The Masters doesn't really get started until the weekend.\\n\\nBut it's clearly on his mind.\\n\\nI sort of feel that Augusta owes me something, and I have come with that attitude, McIlroy said to Irish radio network RTE. I have come here to get something that I should have had a long time ago.\\n\\nThose birdies on the par 5s — a good chip from behind the 13th green, a 5-wood onto the green for a two-putt on the 15th — were just what he needed. And the putt on the 16th to the toughest pin signaled that his fortunes indeed were changing.\\n\\nI started it … maybe 6 feet left of the hole and just got it up there really, really high, McIlroy said. And basically let gravity and wind take it the rest of the way. I was just looking to two-putt, try to get it within 2 or 3 feet of the hole. And it was a bonus when it dropped.\\n\\nOn Thursday, McIlroy was 4-under par and challenging for the lead when he bogeyed two of the last three to fall four shots back. He was 4 under again on Friday when he made double bogey on No. 4, hit a poor pitch that didn't reach the green on No. 5 and was back to even par for the tournament when he missed a 5-foot par putt on the 11th.\\n\\nHe was determined to finish better in the second round, and he did.\\n\\nI probably would have taken three pars to finish and I would have been happy, he said.\\n\\nAlong with the unlikely birdie on the 16th, he had to get out of the trees right of the 18th fairway, and then pitched to 6 feet and saved par. His caddie kept reminding him that par was a good score in wind like this. Not only was a score under par good, it was rare on this day.\\n\\nMcIlroy said after posting a 3-under 141 that it didn't matter what the leaders did on the back nine. He paused when he said leaders and glanced over at the electronic leaderboard in the press center. At the time, Jordan Spieth was at 5 under and Bryson DeChambeau was tied with McIlroy at 3 under.\\n\\nHe resumed his thought by changing leaders to guys. As tough it was, there was no telling at that point what or who was going to be leading.\\n\\nI know I'm in a good position going into the weekend, McIlroy said. And I'm happy with that."}

{"original": "VATICAN CITY (AP) – God's love may be free, but the Vatican says it has a copyright on the pope.\\n\\nUnnerved by the proliferation of papal-themed T-shirts, snow globes and tea towels around the world, the Vatican has warned it intends to protect the image of Pope Francis and stop situations of illegality that may be discovered. It also wants to protect the crossed keys emblem of the Holy See.\\n\\nThe secretary of state will undertake systematic surveillance aimed at monitoring the way in which the image of the Holy Father and the emblems of the Holy See are used, intervening with opportune measures when necessary, the Vatican said in a statement.\\n\\nTo back up this declaration, the Vatican has hired the global law firm Baker McKenzie to protect its intellectual property rights, the Italian daily Corriere della Sera reported. without citing the source of the information. Baker McKenzie declined to comment.\\n\\nThe threat of enforcement marks a sea change for a church that for some 2,000 years has seen popes venerated on all manner of flags, banners and medals. But the popularity of Francis and the ease with which his image can be copied in the internet age has spawned a flood of papal trinkets, causing the Holy See to worry that they are losing control of his image.\\n\\nThe pope's image rights are no different from those of any other famous celebrity and so it's not surprising that the Vatican is giving notice that it will protect its (intellectual property) rights as necessary, said Nick Kounoupias, the founder of an intellectual property consultancy in London. What will be interesting to see, however, is how vigorously these rights are pursued, given who the IP owner is.\\n\\nFrancis' many travels have taken him to countries like the Philippines and Sri Lanka, where factories can quickly churn out pope hats, T-shirts and towels. Vatican officials have grown fearful the faithful will think that the church is making money off the merchandise, experts say. Worse still, they see the conditions in which some of the items are made and worry about being associated with labor abuses.\\n\\nThe decision reflects an evolution in the last decade as the Vatican adapted to modern markets. While in the past the Holy See might get word of improper use of the pope's image through local church organizations around the globe, the approach was random.\\n\\nIt's not new that people were selling T-shirts of the pope, but (previously) those were probably little local vendors, said Mark McKenna, an intellectual property expert at the Notre Dame Law School in Indiana.\\n\\nWhat's changed is the magnitude of what can be produced and how quickly it can be distributed through online platforms.\\n\\nIn a world of Etsy, you are able to do it on a bigger scale, he said.\\n\\nAlthough the Vatican did not elaborate on how it would crack down, the warning seemed a pre-emptive move to explain why the Vatican is going after the unauthorized commercial uses of the pope's image. There was no immediate indication that souvenir buyers would risk fines or legal action.\\n\\nIt's not as if the church refrains from selling its own pope-themed material.\\n\\nOn the Vatican website, one can buy Francis medals, icons and rosary boxes. The Vatican museum boutiques offer silk ties and scarves and watches showing scenes from Michelangelo's frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. And that may be part of the Vatican's motivation in safeguarding Francis' face – and warning that they will challenge the copycats.\\n\\nIt's probably also the case that there is some genuine commercial motivation, McKenna said. They want to be sure they're the only ones selling this stuff."}

The artists are using sculpture and 3D imaging technology to turn skulls into images they hope will help family members identify their loved ones.\\n\\nSculptors from the New York Academy of Art recently fashioned 3D facial reconstructions of eight men whose remains were recovered after they died while illegally crossing the U.S. border with Mexico, the Guardian reported. The skulls are held in the Pima County, Arizona, medical examiner's office because officials are unable to identify the victims.\\n\\nIn addition to sculptures, the art students are employing 3D technology to create images using information provided by medical examiners, including the estimated height, weight, gender, nationality, and ages of the missing migrants. Following the creation of the likeness of the deceased, photographs are taken and the information is sent to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs).\\n\\nThe Guardian reported that since 2000, 1,004 people remain unidentified after being found dead in Pima County. Officials were able to identify more than 1,800 from the remains found in the Arizona desert during the same period.\\n\\nFrom the Guardian:\\n\\nSuch work is not easy. The students must accurately depict a once-living person, using only their skull. To do this, they follow basic rules of anatomy. For example, a small change of direction on the mastoid process, a bony projection behind the ear, indicates whether a person has detached or attached earlobes. A hairline notch in the nose can signify a deviated septum or injury; the span from the brow of the nose to its end is always the same as that from the top to the bottom of the ears.\\n\\nIf we can't raise any other leads in any other way, then putting a face on a skull is usually a positive thing to do, Pima County Medical Examiner Bruce Anderson told the news outlet.\\n\\nWe provide answers to families, he continued. They are very painful answers, but they are answers owed to families. In our office here, we make no distinction between American citizens and foreign nationals in doing everything we can to identify a person and determine a cause of death.\\n\\nThe forensic sculpture class began in 2015 when Joe Mullins, an 18-year veteran of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, wanted to create a program to use these skills and technology to help families by reuniting them with their deceased loved ones. Since that time, his five-day classes helped identify skulls stored in the New York medical examiner's office. He then shifted his focus to the crisis of border crossing deaths.\\n\\nJust because they died trying to come here that doesn't mean they should lose their identity, Mullins explained.\\n\\nMullins said it becomes very clear when the work is done on one of the facial reconstruction projects.\\n\\nSouthern Arizona is not the only place where unidentified migrant remains stack up in the offices of medical examiners.\\n\\nSince 2006, more than 600 bodies or sets of remains of migrants have been found in Brooks County, Texas.\\n\\nThe coyotes who attempt to smuggle these people around the Falfurrias Border Patrol Checkpoint are ruthless, Brooks County Sheriff Benny Martinez told Breitbart Texas during a November 2016 interview. If anyone becomes injured, dehydrated, or exhausted, and can't keep up, they simply abandon them and leave them to die.\\n\\nThis is a very dangerous trek these immigrants take as they attempt to circumvent the Border Patrol's inland checkpoint, Martinez explained.\\n\\nIn October 2017, Breitbart Texas reported on CNN's Chris Cuomo after he highlighted the efforts in South Texas to help identify these deceased migrants. During an episode of Inside with Chris Cuomo on CNN's Headline News, Cuomo spoke with Webb County, Texas, Medical Examiner Dr. Corinne Stern. Her office is tasked with identifying the remains of migrants found not only in Brooks County, but other smaller counties extending as far as Del Rio.\\n\\nBy the time remains of the deceased migrants reach her office, there is frequently not much to work with in identifying the remains and reuniting them with their families.\\n\\nEven with all the helicopters, sensors, and manpower, by the time they find the migrants in this inhospitable terrain — it is often too late, Dr. Sterns stated.\\n\\nWe have seen 109 migrant deaths as of today, Sterns told Breitbart Texas during an October 24 interview. In addition to the 43 from Brooks County, 42 were found here in Webb County. Starr County had 10, Dimmit had 5, and the remainder came from Jim Hogg, Zapata, Maverick, Kenedy, and Val Verde counties.\\n\\nDr. Stern discussed the time it takes to identify the remains of the migrants with Cuomo. She says it often takes up to five months to get DNA results. Stern tries to use other methods to find their identities more quickly.\\n\\nShe then took Cuomo to two large coolers where the remains of 52 migrants are being stored until she receives DNA results from the FBI.\\n\\nWhile the efforts of Stern, the artists in New York, and others tasked with identifying these remains continue, thousands of families are left with the painful thought that their loved one may never be found or identified."}
{"original": "The woman who led the French authorities to Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the mastermind behind last November's terrorist atrocity in Paris, has said that 90 jihadis who posed as migrants are currently in Paris. Despite foiling further attacks including a planned attack on a that nursery, she says she has been abandoned by the state and forced to move from hotel to hotel to avoid reprisals.\\n\\nIn desperation, the 26-year-old known only by the pseudonym 'Sonia' has now spoken to BFM TV about the events of that day in the aftermath of the attack, and about her life since handing over the terrorist ringleader. She has revealed that at least 90 more jihadis from Syria are among the migrants who have entered France in the last year.\\n\\nOn the 15th November, two days after the attack which claimed the lives of 130 Parisians, Sonia was with her lifelong friend Hasna Ait Boulahcen, Abaaoud's cousin, when Boulahcen received a call on her mobile phone. She was instructed to go to 2 Rue des Bergeries in Aubervilliers, in Seine-Saint-Denis, and pick up someone who was in need of accommodation.\\n\\nThe address turned out to be an isolated industrial estate, where from behind a bush, out stepped Abaaoud. Until this point Sonia, along with the rest of France, assumed that he had already fled to Syria.\\n\\nHe was smiling, he didn't look at all like a terrorist, said Sonia.\\n\\nShe asked him: Did you take part in what happened on November 13?\\n\\nHe said, just like that: 'The terraces, that was me', an apparent reference to the attacks on people sitting outside restaurants in central Paris.\\n\\nI said: 'But you killed people, you killed innocent people', said Sonia.\\n\\nHe said: 'No they're not innocent. You must see what's happening to us in Syria.'\\n\\nI saw that he was proud of himself, that he wasn't scared of anyone, she related. He was telling the story as though he had gone shopping and found a good bargain. He was happy.\\n\\nKeeping a cool head, Sonia asked Abaaoud how he had managed to regain entry to France. He told her that it had been easy to pass himself off as a migrant with no documents, adding France is useless. Whatsmore, he told Sonia that he had travelled with a group of about 90 fellow jihadis, including Syrians, Iraqis, French, German and British citizens. He said they were spread around everywhere in the Paris region, she said.\\n\\nBut there were more horrors to come: he then went on to tell her that mistakes had been made in the attack on the 13th, and that he had remained near Paris to finish the job. The exact phrase he told me was that there were failures, and I am here to ensure that there are no more failures.\\n\\nAt that point Abaaoud left, asking his cousin to supply him with two suits, two pairs of shoes and a hideout, which she did, later visiting Abaaoud at the hideout. Upon her return to Sonia, Boulahcen was crying. She told me, he will die, Sonia said. It emerged that Abaaoud was planning further attacks, this time on a shopping centre, a police station and a children's nursery in La Défense, a major business district in western Paris.\\n\\nShe told me it's Thursday and in my head I say, I know I'll stop them, Sonia said. She called 197, the emergency number set up by the authorities in the wake of the attacks to advise them of the location of the hideout.\\n\\nThe following day the French police raided the apartment, killing Abaaoud and an accomplice as well as Boulahcen.\\n\\nFollowing the raid Sonia was held in custody for her own protection. Police and prosecutors came to thank her, and asked her what she wanted, but, being tired, she misunderstood and told them she wanted to go home.\\n\\nThey told me that I will have to change my name, move city, and that I will be supported by specialist officers from witness protection. I didn't expect that. I didn't expect to never see my family or friends.\\n\\nThey told me to change all my habits, to pay attention to everything, not to give my identity to anyone, not to say what had happened, not to tell anyone that I had called 197. I must be silent.\\n\\nFor several weeks she moved from hotel to hotel, eventually being given an apartment to live in. But she has been unable to apply for a new job as she has not yet been given new identity documents; everything is still in her old name.\\n\\nThe state must treat me with consideration because without people like me, they'll never succeed, she said. The proof of that is Abaaoud was there and they didn't know it.\\n\\nFrance's interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve has denied failing Sonia, saying we're doing everything necessary."}

{"original": "CLEVELAND (AP) — Two days after celebrating their return to the NFL playoffs, the Cleveland Browns were knocked flat.\\n\\nCOVID-19 will keep coach Kevin Stefanki — and at least two players — out of the team's first playoff game since the 2002 season.\\n\\nThe Browns announced Tuesday — 18 years to the day since their last playoff game — that Stefanski tested positive with the virus, which has plagued the team in recent weeks and now causing a devastating disruption as Cleveland prepares to play the Pittsburgh Steelers for the second straight week on Sunday.\\n\\nJust 48 hours ago, the Browns and their long-suffering fans were overjoyed by the team ending the league's longest playoff drought with a 24-22 win over the Steelers, who rested quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and several other prominent starters to be fresh for the playoff opener.\\n\\nNow, the Browns are launching contingency plans that have been in place since the pandemic began.\\n\\nStefanski tested positive along with Pro Bowl left guard Joel Bitonio, wide receiver KhaDarel Hodge and two coaching staff members — tight ends coach Drew Petzing and defensive backs coach Jeff Howard. The Browns already had six players and three other assistants on the reserve COVID-19 list.\\n\\nSpecial teams coordinator Mike Priefer will be the acting head coach Sunday.\\n\\nNFL rules state that anyone testing positive must be away from the team at least 10 days.\\n\\nLeague spokesman Brian McCarthy said there is no change to the status of Sunday night's game at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh. He added the league is continuing to conduct standard contact tracing to identify any possible high-risk close contacts.\\n\\nIf any players or personnel are identified as such, they would remain apart from the team and facilities for five days from the last exposure to a positive individual, McCarthy said in an email to The Associated Press. They would be eligible to return to the team and play in the game.\\n\\nBecause Bitonio and Hodge played against the Steelers, there would seem to be concern that some Pittsburgh players could become infected.\\n\\nBut McCarthy said the league has found no evidence of player-to-player transmission from practices or games throughout this season.\\n\\nCleveland has been one of the hardest hit teams by the virus this season. The Browns were without six players, including top cornerback Denzel Ward, and the assistants last weekend for their biggest game in years after a rash of positive tests.\\n\\nAlso, star defensive end Myles Garrett missed two games after contracting COVID-19. Garrett has had a difficult time shaking the illness and recently said he was still undergoing breathing treatments.\\n\\nFor Bitonio, the positive test deprives him of finally reaching the playoffs after so many difficult years with the Browns. He endured the 0-16 season in 2017 and numerous coaching and front-office changes only to have COVID derail his dreams.\\n\\nFollowing Sunday's game, Stefanski presented Bitonio with a game ball to recognize his journey and asked him to address his teammates\\n\\nIt was just I appreciate everybody in the room and the work that they put in from the top down, just working to change the culture here, Bitonio said when asked about the moment. There was a culture of losing and a culture of not being able to finish some of the games that we have been in. I just appreciate everybody and hopefully we are setting the stage for a winning culture in Cleveland for a long time.\\n\\nOn Monday, Stefanski said he didn't want to get into any hypotheticals regarding Ward or any of the other infected players. Now, he'll be able to work only virtually this week to prepare Cleveland for its first playoff game since Jan. 5, 2003 — a 36-33 loss at Pittsburgh.\\n\\nThe Browns are the second NFL team to be without their coach during the pandemic. Detroit interim coach Darrell Bevell sat out the Lions' Dec. 26 game at Tampa Bay because of COVID-19 protocols.\\n\\nPriefer, who is from Cleveland and spent several years on Minnesota's staff with Stefanski, was an interim coach for one game in 2016 when Mike Zimmer had eye surgery."}
{"original": "(AFP) – Just a week into the year, France has already been rattled by an attempted attack on a police station, but counter-terrorism officials have far graver fears for Europe in 2016.\\n\\nNovember's attacks in Paris, in which 130 people were killed by Islamic State group jihadists, showed the trauma that could be caused by a group of men with Kalashnikov rifles, but experts fear it could be just the start.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I think 2015 was nothing, a counter-terrorism official told AFP on condition of anonymity.\\n\\nWe are moving towards a European 9/11: simultaneous attacks on the same day in several countries, several places. A very coordinated thing. We know the terrorists are working on this, he added.\\n\\nHe said the Islamic State group was recruiting and training Europeans with the goal of sending them back to hit their countries of origin.\\n\\nThey have the necessary false documents, the mastery of the language, the sites, the weapons. We stop a lot of them, but it must be recognised that we are overwhelmed. Some will get through — some already have.\\n\\nRecent arrests of jihadists returning from Syria and Iraq have added to concerns, he said.\\n\\nThe profiles are changing. We are seeing ultra-radical guys return, very battle-hardened, who should have stayed over there.\\n\\nBefore we mostly had guys returning who had made a mistake, who didn't realise that war can be painful. But now, we are seeing guys return who are sticking to their chosen path.\\n\\n– Rapid response needed –\\n\\nFaced with an enemy that is happy to die and maximise civilian casualties, the challenge for France's security forces is to massively speed up response times.\\n\\nThere will always be a delay for intervention forces that we have to reduce as much as possible, Colonel Hubert Bonneau, head of the elite GIGN police, told AFP.\\n\\nIn the Bataclan, the killing of 90 people took 20 minutes. It stops when there is the opposition of security forces, he said, referring to the attack on a Paris concert hall on November 13.\\n\\nIt took two-and-a-half hours for police to storm the concert hall as they tried to gather information on the layout of the building and position of the jihadists.\\n\\nBonneau said this new type of threat meant there were no classic hostage situations such as in the past.\\n\\nHostages are just a buffer to slow the progress of security forces. If we don't intervene as quickly as possible there will be more victims. That's the lesson to draw from the attacks of November 13, that will change our mode of intervention.\\n\\nWe need to have surgical action, as forceful as possible and as quickly as possible, he said.\\n\\n– 'Just a rehearsal' –\\n\\nMultiple, pan-European plots are not new and have been disrupted on several occasions, including one in late August 2010, said Yves Trotignon, a former analyst for France's DGSE intelligence service.\\n\\nAt that time, it was still Al-Qaeda, he said.\\n\\nThe teams were due to arrive in western Europe, recover pre-placed material — handguns and assault rifles. It was disrupted by the Americans, who carried out a series of preventative drone strikes in Afghanistan and Pakistan against the guys thought to be mounting the operation.\\n\\nThis type of multiple attack is part of the worst-case scenarios for 2016, said Trotignon.\\n\\nI know that in European capitals, particularly London, specialised services are working on this theory.\\n\\nPolice, military and intelligence services are constantly adapting to the shape-shifting threat, but so are the other side and often more quickly and effectively, the specialists said.\\n\\nIt's not just us that learn the lessons, it's the Islamic State as well, said the counter-terrorism official.\\n\\nHe said a key lesson was to stay away from telephones, which have often been a key way to monitor potential attackers.\\n\\nThey take lessons from the press investigations, read everything on the subject. They saw that it took two-and-a-half hours to launch the police raid at the Bataclan, said Trotignon.\\n\\nThey also saw that the explosives weren't good, that they must be changed, that the guys left too many traces. They learn fast.\\n\\nIf the quality of the attackers improves, we will have a problem, he said, adding that there was a terrible pessimism among security service professionals for 2016.\\n\\nMaybe we will say that 2015 was just a rehearsal, he added."}

You all did it, now we're going on to South Carolina to win and then we're going to take this back.\\n\\nBy the way, I plan on coming back to win this state outright, the former vice president added, before proceeding to elaborate on why he was the best candidate to beat Trump in the general election.\\n\\nBiden's remarks came even though the final caucus results have yet to be determined. When the race was officially called, with only a little more than four percent of precincts reporting, Biden appeared to have finished in second place, garnering 19 percent among caucus-goers.

{"original": "GOP senators, including Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Steve Daines (R-MT), John Kennedy (R-LA), and Mike Braun (R-IN), are joining Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) in objecting to electoral college votes on January 6, they announced on Saturday in a joint statement alongside four senators-elect.\\n\\nThe senators and incoming lawmakers — including Sens.-elect Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), and Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) — released a joint statement on Saturday, expressing their intent to reject the electors from disputed states on January 6, explaining that the 2020 presidential election featured unprecedented allegations of voter fraud, violations and lax enforcement of election law, and other voting irregularities.\\n\\nAnd those allegations are not believed just by one individual candidate. Instead, they are widespread, the lawmakers said, citing a Reuters/Ipsos poll showing that over one-third of Americans, or 39 percent, believe the election was rigged.\\n\\nThat belief is held by Republicans (67%), Democrats (17%), and Independents (31%), the Republicans said, noting that some members of Congress disagree, as do many members of the media.\\n\\nBut, whether or not our elected officials or journalists believe it, that deep distrust of our democratic processes will not magically disappear. It should concern us all. And it poses an ongoing threat to the legitimacy of any subsequent administrations, they continued, explaining that, in an ideal world, the courts would have heard evidence and resolved these claims of serious election fraud.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court, however, declined to do so on two occasions, they argued.\\n\\nOn January 6, it is incumbent on Congress to vote on whether to certify the 2020 election results. That vote is the lone constitutional power remaining to consider and force resolution of the multiple allegations of serious voter fraud, they said, explaining the long precedent of Democratic Members of Congress raising objections to presidential election results, as they did in 1969, 2001, 2005, and 2017.\\n\\nThey wrote:\\n\\nAnd, in both 1969 and 2005, a Democratic Senator joined with a Democratic House Member in forcing votes in both houses on whether to accept the presidential electors being challenged. The most direct precedent on this question arose in 1877, following serious allegations of fraud and illegal conduct in the Hayes-Tilden presidential race. Specifically, the elections in three states—Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina—were alleged to have been conducted illegally. In 1877, Congress did not ignore those allegations, nor did the media simply dismiss those raising them as radicals trying to undermine democracy. Instead, Congress appointed an Electoral Commission—consisting of five Senators, five House Members, and five Supreme Court Justices—to consider and resolve the disputed returns. We should follow that precedent. To wit, Congress should immediately appoint an Electoral Commission, with full investigatory and fact-finding authority, to conduct an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in the disputed states. Once completed, individual states would evaluate the Commission's findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a change in their vote, if needed.\\n\\nAccordingly, we intend to vote on January 6 to reject the electors from disputed states as not 'regularly given' and 'lawfully certified' (the statutory requisite), unless and until that emergency 10-day audit is completed, they announced.\\n\\nThe GOP lawmakers contended that support of election integrity should not be a partisan issue and called for a fair and credible audit completed prior to inauguration day, expressing the belief that such would dramatically improve Americans' faith in our electoral process and would significantly enhance the legitimacy of whoever becomes our next President.\\n\\nWe owe that to the People, they continued:\\n\\nThese are matters worthy of the Congress, and entrusted to us to defend. We do not take this action lightly. We are acting not to thwart the democratic process, but rather to protect it. And every one of us should act together to ensure that the election was lawfully conducted under the Constitution and to do everything we can to restore faith in our Democracy.\\n\\nThe senators' announcement puts them alongside Hawley, the first GOP senator to announce his intention to object to the electoral college votes in key states.\\n\\nIn a Wednesday release, the Missouri lawmaker explained that he could not vote to certify the results without raising the fact that some states, particularly Pennsylvania, failed to follow their own state election laws. He also said he could not do so without pointing out the unprecedented effort of mega corporations, including Facebook and Twitter, to interfere in this election, in support of Joe Biden.\\n\\nHe, too, called on Congress to investigate allegations of voter fraud and adopt election security measures. At this point, Hawley added, Congress failed to properly act on the matter.\\n\\nFor these reasons, I will follow the same practice Democrat members of Congress have in years past and object during the certification process on January 6 to raise these critical issues, he said.\\n\\nAt least 140 House Republicans are expected to object to an immediate certification of a Joe Biden victory, as Breitbart News detailed. The action from both members of the House and Senate will trigger debates in both chambers.\\n\\nThe new Congress will be sworn in on Sunday, three days prior to January 6."}

Some Democratic officials were at that event — I think we have some pictures of it which we can show here. Do you think that the Democrats should have been down there watching a play, instead of working with the president to try to end the shutdown? Rosselló: Well, they were here also listening for over four hours. They had a hearing. This is the largest congressional delegation in the history of Puerto Rico, and I thank them for coming over here. I had an opportunity to explain to them the root cause of the problems in Puerto Rico. We had a discussion about the [Hurricane Maria] recovery, how some of the recovery's being stalled because of bureaucratic processes that are imposed in Puerto Rico that are not imposed elsewhere. How we need to start the rebuilding phase to be very effective, and how Puerto Rico can become a model, and how we're going to implement some of these core concepts that we value, such as tackling inequality, and battling climate change. But it is important underneath all of that, it's the reality that Puerto Rico, we are treated as second-class U.S. citizens. Because we're not a state, we — you know, we get a third of the federal funding for healthcare, for example. And it was important for me to state to the over 30 congressional leaders that were here that the main, the root cause of the problem is that we are a colonial territory of the United States and I wanted to ask them to forcefully take this as a battle of their own, as they have with, for example, statehood for Washington, D.C.\\n\\nCNN anchor Dave Briggs criticized Fox News on Twitter for criticizing the Democrats' trip on Monday morning without mentioning that the Hamilton show had raised some $15 million toward Puerto Rican post-hurricane recovery.\\n\\nAccording to the Washington Post, the money is actually headed to a fund for struggling Puerto Rican artists and arts institutions that is run by the family of Hamilton creator and star Lin-Manuel Miranda.\\n\\nJoel B.

While recognizing that there are many generous and committed young people in search of a deep spiritual life, many succumb to a secular logic entailing a quest for success at any price, easy money and easy pleasures, he said.\\n\\nThis logic seduces many young people, he added.\\n\\nA third and final factor comes from within consecrated life itself, in which there is no shortage of counter-witness that make fidelity difficult.\\n\\nWhen priests or religious sisters and brothers allow routine, weariness, administrative burdens, internal divisions and careerism to take root, there is little motivation to keep going when consecrated life becomes trying, Francis said.\\n\\nIn order to maintain its fascination, consecrated life must keep the freshness and novelty of the centrality of Jesus, which nourishes the attractiveness of spirituality and the strength of the mission.\\n\\nWhen hope dwindles and there is no joy, Francis said, consecrated life becomes ugly.\\n\\nThe priestly or religious vocation, like faith itself, is a treasure we carry in earthen vessels, the Pope said, and that is why it must be guarded as one guards the most precious things, so that no one can steal this treasure, and it doesn't lose its beauty with the passage of time.\\n\\nThis can only happen through prayer and the practice of the theological virtues of faith, hope and charity, Francis said, along with a solid theological and spiritual formation.\\n\\nThe Pope ended his address by underscoring the importance of spiritual accompaniment, encouraging priests and religious to seek out a mentor or spiritual director—male or female—who can help them stay faithful to God and to his call.\\n\\nFollow Thomas D.

{"original": "Although writer/director Adam McKay has managed to keep the fires of his hatred for Dick Cheney stoked a full decade after the former vice president left office, rather than serving as a constructive muse, this hatred is so blinding, so smug, so superior, McKay ends up revealing more about himself than his subject.\\n\\nMcKay had $60 million to work with and plenty of time to study Cheney. Rather than use those resources to explain what made Cheney tick, McKay chooses instead to hurl rocks at all of the bullet points on Cheney's Wikipedia page.\\n\\nVice has no depth or insight. The choppy, scattered story rolls out like a series of marginal-to-bad Saturday Night Live/Funny or Die skits. McKay was a longtime writer at the former and a co-founder of the latter, and boy does it show.\\n\\nMcKay's Cheney (Christian Bale) has no core, does not believe in anything, is not even a Republican. According to Vice, Cheney chose to join the GOP because Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carrell) said a few cynical words to a group of congressional interns.\\n\\nFrom there, the one thing animating Cheney is something called the Unitary Executive Theory (UET), which basically says that whatever the president of the United States does is legal because he is the president.\\n\\nIn fact, Vice assures and reassures us that Cheney believes in nothing (literally nothing) other than the UET, but McKay cannot explain why. For example, after an hour or so of presenting Cheney as power hungry, when the opportunity finally arises to run for president, Mr. Power Hungry chickens out based on one bad poll. And his wife Lynne (Amy Adams), who is supposed to be the true power behind the snarl, agrees, and they happily retire from politics.\\n\\nHuh?\\n\\nWhuh?\\n\\nIf that is not baffling enough, after Cheney comes out of retirement to become vice president under George W. Bush (Sam Rockwell), he puts the UET to work, but only to protect the country from terrorists via the War on Terror — all of which McKay rages against in that same tired way Michael Moore did more than a decade ago.\\n\\nBut again, this makes no sense. Why would someone seeking power for the sake of power use that power to protect the country from terror, as opposed to setting the table to succeed Bush in 2008, or to crush the Democrat party?\\n\\nThis is what I mean by a really bad House of Cards episode. As weak as the Netflix series became in its later seasons (let's forget season six ever happened), we at least understood what motivated Frank Underwood — his quest to obtain and hold onto power.\\n\\nEven Bond villains have a reason to be, a goal to make the world a better place through some heinous act. Cheney's reason to be is never explained.\\n\\nAccording to McKay, Cheney's decades-long obsession to fulfill his destiny through the UET was all about being able to drop bombs and water board a handful of terrorists. To what end? It's like watching the kid in Christmas Story deliberately destroy his Red Ryder BB gun after scheming for months to get his hands on it.\\n\\nAnd it all ends with McKay blaming Cheney for everything wrong in the world, including the California wildfires, ISIS, and Trump — again in that tired Michael Moore style.\\n\\nVice is nowhere near as awful as W., Oliver Stone's disastrous George W. Bush biopic, but at the very least, Stone tried to understand and explain his subject. All McKay wants to do is make his rich Hollywood friends laugh, and not just at Cheney, but the stupid American people who allowed him to become vice president.\\n\\nMcKay has always had a smug problem. This is what undermined his comedies with Will Ferrell, what most undermines Vice, and why he wears a scarf in public. McKay despises anyone not enlightened enough to share his beliefs and is even more disgusted with those who enjoy life rather than obsess over politics, those more interested in the next Fast & Furious movie than they are in using Twitter to own the Republicans.\\n\\nAfter The Big Short, McKay's successful turn to serious movie-making, I had high hopes for Vice, that it would be something closer to Stone's underrated Nixon. Unfortunately, McKay uses the irreverent formula that made The Big Short so memorable to own Cheney, and the results are alternately ham-handed (fishing lures and heart removals as metaphors), hollow (it's a movie filled with impersonations, not characters), and laughably dishonest.\\n\\nMcKay blames Cheney for leaking Valerie Plame's name when an exhaustive investigation proved that was not true. He even blames Cheney for coming up with the term Climate Change because it sounds less alarming than Global Warming — an audacious lie when we all know the left made the change after Jesus made it snow every time Al Gore made a speech.\\n\\nUltimately, the experience of watching Vice is like watching two hours of Jimmy Kimmel monologues — a bitterly angry lecture disguised as entertainment, a relentless Thanksgiving hectoring from an uncle only interested in signaling his own superiority.\\n\\nVice is never boring. There are enough pinwheels, hula hoops, and party poppers to hold your interest. It's just that after a while it all becomes tiresome and reveals itself to be an endless series of hollow talking points.\\n\\nAt least the Fast & Furious movies are about something, are about the importance of family and working together. Other than justifying the scarf, Vice isn't about anything.\\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here."}

These frightening and repulsive actions represent the most significant breach on our Capitol in over 200 years, and I don't care what happened in the past or whether those who didn't think the election was stolen. That is not justification.\\n\\nSeventy-five million of us are still angry about the election, but we don't storm the Capitol and stop looking for other people to blame, including those dirtbag terrorists, Antifa. To those of you who did this, you did it of your own will and you will be held accountable.\\n\\nTake the veil of politics off. Be totally objective.

Did anyone change their vote? No.\\n\\nYou have tarnished all the good that's been done over the last four years because of this senseless lunacy. And worst of all, you have yielded the moral high ground to those who have repeatedly and consistently taken away our freedoms: our freedom of speech, religion, our right to be with our family, celebrate Holidays, even go to work as you prance around like a bunch of idiots in the Capitol.\\n\\nWe are a proud populist movement of millions of Americans who support a man who struck a chord with us, people who never voted before, forgotten men and women, people who didn't think their vote mattered came out in droves, and for four years, we watched President Trump deliver on his promises.\\n\\nHe championed law and order. He supported the military, and he fought to fund it like no other President in our lifetime. And he fought for police while the left called to defund the police.

They got away with police being told to stand down and prosecutors not filing charges when they created CHAZ and CHOP and burnt neighborhoods, businesses and got away with it.\\n\\nNow, I have long believed that there are two systems of justice; one for the rich and one for the poor. I even wrote a book about it, He Killed Them All, how the rich get away with crimes, and the poor don't have the ability to mount a defense or influence public opinion.\\n\\nToday, I still believe that there are two systems of justice, two systems of outrage, but today, there's one for the left and one for the right.\\n\\nIt seems the rules are applied unequally and we have lived under incredible tension on top of that for the last year, and as predictable as day after night, Big Tech has followed up on what they gave us a taste of, pre-election, last night when Twitter said it would permanently ban President Trump from his platform of 88 million followers, the slide down the slippery slope began.\\n\\nCensorship in the United States is the biggest threat to our freedom right now. Social media is the broadcast medium of our generation. It's how we communicate. It's how we get news. It's how we share our thoughts, persuade, dissuade, argue, it's how we laugh, emote.\\n\\nThere is a reason freedom of speech is in the First Amendment. It is the essence of our American way. And suddenly, Silicon Valley, Jack Dorsey and company, they get to decide what speech is acceptable, anointing themselves as arbiters of whether what the right says is allowed to be heard.\\n\\nThe amazing part is that the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that even hate speech is protected speech, that it cannot be regulated because it's part of our fundamental right of free speech under the First Amendment.\\n\\nNow, I don't like it when Kamala Harris goes on Twitter to raise money for criminals who come out and commit crimes again. But I would fight for her right to say it under the Constitution.\\n\\nAnd amazingly, even the ACLU has joined to criticize the move by Twitter. And now, Apple is threatening conservative-leaning, Parler, with removal from its platform. When you are removed, censored, canceled from these platforms, you are then the subject of attack, assault, derision, even dismissal from your job.\\n\\nIf you're on the left, however, you're rewarded with a job or you become the head of a department at a university.\\n\\nBut the idea of censorship of speech in the United States is destructive to our free and open society. How can anyone possibly believe this is good? Forget fair, the idea that people get to decide whose speech is oppressed, and whose isn't is totally outside our constitutional framework.\\n\\nSocial media is the marketplace where we share ideas. As Big Tech continues to suppress conservative speech, the inability of Americans to get the facts will be even more dire, drawing a politically influenced distinction between the truth and a lie, which will create even more chaos.\\n\\nFiction remember, often drives people over the edge.\\n\\nWhenever the media takes side in a movement, historic anger and frustration results. We need a media that gives us the truth, they have not, which has prompted many of us to go online. And now Big Tech is as much as admitting they don't like what people on the right have to say and they can argue that their law enforcement with an obligation to seek out and root out criminal behavior is not their job.\\n\\nSo Big Tech must be regulated. They can no longer have the immunity under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The shame is they do what they do because no one in Congress has told them they can't.\\n\\nThe monopolies must end, yet they continue because no one in Congress has said that they can't.\\n\\nIt's past time to peel back their immunity.

Turner declared.\\n\\nTurner was preceded by Emilio Vicente, a self-declared undocumented immigrant, who said that he held Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol responsible for the deaths of migrants who died trying to cross the southern U.S. border.\\n\\nVicente said that Sanders would bring justice for those who had died in U.S. custody.\\n\\nLater, Sanders defended his unorthodox style and ideology as the key to bringing new voters into the political process.\\n\\nTo defeat Trump, you cannot run a conventional campaign, he said.\\n\\nHe went on to take several shots at former Vice President Joe Biden, noting that he voted for the Iraq War and supported reforms to Social Security and Medicare.\\n\\nSanders noted that his campaign had closed a large gap with Biden in the polls, pulling within single digits, with a chance to win in the South Carolina primary on Saturday.\\n\\nWhat would win the general election, Sanders said, were not typical Democratic Party policies, but policies aimed at the working class, like a $15 per hour minimum wage and universal health care.\\n\\nWhat we are going to do is take on the health care industry and their $100 billion in profits and move this country toward 'Medicare for All', he declared.\\n\\nThat meant, Sanders said, No more premiums, no more co-payments, no more deductibles, no more out-of-pocket expenses, no more paying more than $200 per year for prescription drugs.\\n\\nHe also promised that Medicare for All would include dental care, hearing aids, eyeglasses, and all health care.\\n\\nAs to what that would cost, he quipped: We are paying for it now!\\n\\nSanders also spoke of the urgent need for action on climate change, predicting that major cities would be wholly or partially underwater by the end of the century.\\n\\nHe added that on Day One of his administration, he would legalize the sale of marijuana in every state in this country.\\n\\nSanders also delivered a strong pro-choice message, promising to expand federal funding for Planned Parenthood, and specifically addressing the men in the room: Women right now are under attack all over this country. Stand with the women!\\n\\nSanders closed where Turner began, drawing parallels between his campaign and the civil rights movement, women's rights movement, and gay rights movement.\\n\\nRather than President Donald Trump's conception of the good life, which he said revolved around cheating for money, Sanders said, his ethos was: We are stronger and more human when we care about other people.\\n\\nHe concluded:\\n\\nReal change never ever takes place from the top on down … the only way change takes place is millions of people standing up and fighting for justice …\\n\\nIn the wealthiest country in the history of the world, why do so few have so much while so many have so little?:\\n\\nThe 2020 election, Sanders said, was a chance to say: Enough is enough!\\n\\nJoel B.

{"original": "Friends of anti-corruption dissident Xu Zhiyong revealed that Chinese prosecutors are filing inciting state subversion charges against him after he published a letter calling for Chinese dictator Xi Jinping to resign over the nation's failed response to the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported on Monday.\\n\\nXu may face a maximum of 15 years in prison on those charges, which essentially label him a threat to national security. Xu served time in prison from 2014 to 2017 over organizing the New Citizens' Movement, a group demanding government accountability on state corruption and challenging the totalitarian communist regime.\\n\\nXu had reportedly been hiding from arrest since Chinese police raided the city of Xiamen in December on a tip that dissidents had congregated there for a meeting to freely discuss politics in China. Authorities reportedly found Xu using facial recognition technology, which Beijing has deployed extensively to keep track of political dissidence, but entered the home he was hiding in using a coronavirus check as an excuse.\\n\\nFrom an undisclosed location, Xu published a letter condemning the Communist Party for turning the coronavirus outbreak into a national disaster and urged Xi to resign. The letter surfaced in February and friends and family believe Xu has been in police custody since February 15.\\n\\nAt the time, Amnesty International condemned reports of Xu's arrest, which did not specify what he was being arrested for.\\n\\nThe detention of Xu Zhiyong shows that the Chinese government's battle against the coronavirus has in no way diverted it from its ongoing general campaign to crush all dissenting voices and its ruthless assault on freedom of expression, Patrick Poon, Amnesty International's China researcher, said in February. Xu has been in the authorities' sights ever since he attended a meeting of human rights activists in Xiamen in December, and he has since criticized President Xi's handling of the coronavirus crisis.\\n\\nThis weekend, Xu's friends and family revealed that he may be going to prison for as many as 15 years over the subversion charges, believed to be related to his criticism of the Chinese coronavirus response. Police revealed his arrest and offered the vague reason why after his family reported him missing.\\n\\nThe police station admitted it, saying they had him, an unnamed source told RFA. [They said] he was someone in the custody of the Beijing state security police, who had sent the notification to his hometown in [the central province of] Henan. His sister then found out more from the Henan state security police, who said he is being held under RSDL.\\n\\nRSDL is an abbreviation for residential surveillance at a designated location, a form of arrest that allows the government to abduct a person for up to six months without contacting family or an attorney, as it is neither prison nor house arrest. RFA notes that this type of abduction is allowed in Chinese law if a suspect is accused of national security crimes.\\n\\nHu Jia, a fellow human rights activist, warned that police had also abducted Li Qiaochu, Xu's girlfriend.\\n\\nThe authorities really hate him [Xu], because they wanted to 'educate' him and he just wouldn't change. They want to contain him and undermine his activism so they have been seeking evidence to jail him again, Hu said.\\n\\nThe Chinese Communist Party has not confirmed the charges. Sources speaking to RFA, Voice of America, and other outlets suggest, however, that Li also may face incitement to subvert state power charges.\\n\\nMany government critics and human rights lawyers who have been held in such detention have been subjected to torture, sleep deprivation and forced medication in solitary confinement for months before being formally charged and jailed on state security crime, Voice of America noted.\\n\\nShortly before his abduction, Xu published an open letter to Xi titled, Dear Chairman Xi, It's Time for You to Go, accusing him of incompetence in response to the Wuhan viral outbreak.\\n\\nIn actual fact, I don't really think that you are a bad person, as such; it's simply that you're not all that bright, Xu wrote to Xi, acknowledging that Xi's associates are searching for me high and low so they can throw me back into jail.\\n\\nXu's extensive letter disparages the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Xi's attempts to colonize the South China Sea, the response to the coronavirus outbreak, and essentially every aspect of Xi's rule. It is laden with personal insults, referring to Xi as stupid, unconfident, and generally embarrassing to the Chinese people:\\n\\nYou have amassed dictatorial powers, and through your policies you have increasingly distorted the market. Now, the nation's economy is trending downwards. You call this a revival? You have also espoused building a beautiful China. But that's all just put out there for show; what about the deeply held aspirations people have to enjoy true equality, justice, freedom, and happiness? You tout things like the Four Self-Confidences, the Eight Clarifications and the Fourteen Perseveres. Sure, you've got a grab-bag of such slogans, but no one has a clue what any of them really means. … You're not Putin, or Modi, and you're certainly not Trump. You flirt with Cultural Revolution fanaticism, but you are no true-believing Leftist; you lurch towards bellicose nationalism, but you're no hawk, either. You're a big nothing. … Official documents pile up like mountains on your desk and you are drowning in an endless sea of meetings. You don't even have time to read everything that's put in front of you, so how can you possibly stand above the fray and have the kind of perspective that's necessary to run a country like China? Fiscal management and the economy—you're in charge of all of that as well! What's the premier of the State Council [Li Keqiang] supposed to do? Do you have any particular expertise in economic matters? If not, then hand the responsibility to someone who does. Any political leader worth their salt would know to do that.\\n\\nOn the coronavirus outbreak, Xu accuses Xi of having a basic ignorance of how a modern society actually works that resulted in a chaotic and failed response in Wuhan.\\n\\nThe practical measures taken should have been precise and involved targeted quarantines. Instead, you decided to go the whole hog and, with the stroke of a pen, you put over nine million people in lockdown, Xu wrote. When this masterstroke was announced, there was already a serious shortage of medical supplies and hospitals in Wuhan were full to capacity. As a result, large numbers of infected individuals could not be properly tested, let alone quarantined and treated.\\n\\nYou're no politician. You're far inferior to Deng Xiaoping. You have proved that you lack the most rudimentary competences. Yet you remain perversely unaware of your limitations; you actually think you are more formidable than Deng ever was and you have the hubris to presume that you are on par with Mao Zedong, he continued. Furthermore … you have an embarrassing penchant for making erudite references and quoting classical texts. … One presumes that in your youth you never thought you'd get this far, and your evident inferiority complex certainly does betray you, though nowadays you've changed a lot.\\n\\nXu has been far from the last person to condemn Xi for allowing the coronavirus outbreak to infect tens of thousands of people and putting the global population in danger. In the early days of the outbreak in January, Wuhan police detained eight people for allegedly spreading rumors on social media. Most were health professionals sharing tips for how to prevent the virus from spreading or alerting to the spread of an unidentified contagious disease. One of those health professionals, Dr. Li Wenliang, died in February after contracting the Wuhan virus himself, prompting a wave of outrage at Chinese authorities for detaining and humiliating him during his last days."}
{"original": "Wednesday, Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson delivered a monologue about the riots seen at the U.S. Capitol that left four dead and many more injured.\\n\\nAfter emphasizing how horrified he was by the violence, Carlson said on Tucker Carlson Tonight that as long as the people feel that their democracy is fraudulent and are silenced while speaking out about it, the people will act out as seen on Wednesday and in history. He warned that the chaos at the Capitol could be used by the nation's leaders to strip Americans of their basic rights.\\n\\nPartial transcript as follows:\\n\\nAs long as people sincerely believe they can change things by voting, they stay calm. They don't storm the bastille. They don't burst into the House chamber. They talk and they organize and they vote. But the opposite is also true. If people begin to believe that their democracy is fraudulent, if they conclude that voting is a charade, that the system is rigged and it's run in secret by a small group of powerful dishonest people who are acting in their own interests, then God knows what could happen. Actually, we do know what could happen. It's happening right now. It's happened in countless other countries over countless centuries, and the cycle is always the same because human nature never changes.\\n\\nListen to us! screams the population. Shut up and do what you're told, reply their leaders. In the face of dissent, the first instinct of illegitimate leadership is to crack down on the population. But crackdowns never make it better. Instead, they always make the country more volatile and more dangerous. The people in charge rarely understand that. They don't care to learn or listen because all of this conversation is a referendum on them and their leadership, so they clamp down harder. Obey, I tell you. Obey! This is the Romanov program. It ends badly every single time. But that doesn't mean they won't try it again. Of course, they will because it's their nature. It's how we got here in the first place.\\n\\nMillions of Americans sincerely believe the last election was fake. You can dismiss them as crazy, you can call them conspiracy theorists, you can kick them off Twitter, but that won't change their minds. Rather than trying to change their minds to convince them and reassure them the system is real, that the democracy works as you would do if you cared about the country or the people who live here, our new leaders will try to silence them.\\n\\nWhat happened today will be used by the people taking power to justify stripping you of the rights were born with as an American. Your right to speak without being censored, your right to assemble, to not be spied upon, to make a living, to defend your family, most critically. These are the most basic and ancient freedoms that we have. They are why we live here in the first place. They're why we are proud to be Americans. They are what make us different, and they are all now in peril. When thousands of your countrymen storm the Capitol building, you don't have to like it. We don't.\\n\\nYou can be horrified by the violence, and as we said and we will say it again, we are horrified. It's wrong. But if you don't bother to pause and learn a single thing from it, from your citizens storming your Capitol building, then you're a fool. You lack wisdom and you lack self-awareness. You have no place running a country. We got to this sad, chaotic day for a reason. It is not your fault. It is their fault."}
{"original": "NEW YORK (AP) — In a Golden Globes chock full of upsets, the Freddie Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody took best picture, drama, over Bradley Cooper's heavily favored A Star is Born and Glenn Close bested Lady Gaga for best actress.\\n\\nFew winners were seen as more certain than Lady Gaga as best actress in a drama at Sunday's ceremony at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California. But the veteran actress Close pulled off the shocker for her performance in The Wife, as the spouse of a Nobel Prize-winning author. Close said she was thinking of her mother, who really sublimated herself to my father for her whole life.\\n\\nWe have to find personal fulfillment. We have to follow our dreams, said Close, drawing a standing ovation. We have to say I can do that and I should be allowed to do that.\\n\\nMinutes later, the surprise was even greater when Bohemian Rhapsody won the night's top award, shortly after Rami Malek won best actor for his prosthetic teeth-aided performance as Mercury.\\n\\nThank you to Freddie Mercury for giving me the joy of a lifetime, said Malek. This is for you, gorgeous.\\n\\nPolitics were largely absent from the ceremony before Christian Bale took the stage for winning best actor in a musical or comedy for his lead performance in Adam McKay's Vice.\\n\\nWhat do you think? Mitch McConnell next? joked the Welsh-born actor, referring to the Senate's majority leader. Thank you to Satan for giving me inspiration for this role.\\n\\nOh and Andy Samberg opened the Globes, put on by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, on a note of congeniality, including a mock roast of attendees and a string of jokes that playfully commented on critiques of Hollywood. Oh performed an impression of a sexist caveman film executive who casts like the title of Damien Chazelle's Neil Armstrong drama: First … man!\\n\\nNoting the success of Crazy Rich Asians, Oh alluded to films with white stars in Asian roles like Ghost in the Shell and Aloha, the latter of which prompted Emma Stone, who starred in Aloha, to shout out I'm sorry! from the crowd.\\n\\nBut Oh, who later also won for her performance on the BBC America drama series Killing Eve, and Samberg closed their opening monologue on a serious note explaining why she was hosting.\\n\\nI wanted to be here to look out at this audience and witness this moment of change, said Oh, tearing up and gazing at minority nominees in attendance. Right now, this moment is real. Trust me, this is real. Because I see you. And I see you. All of these faces of change. And now, so will everyone else.\\n\\nSome of those faces Oh alluded to won. Mahershala Ali, whom the foreign press association overlooked for his Oscar-winning performance in Moonlight, won best supporting actor for Green Book. While the Globes, decided by 88 voting members of the HFPA, have little relation to the Academy Awards, they can supply some awards-season momentum when it matters most. Oscar nomination voting begins Monday.\\n\\nThe biggest boost went to Green Book, Peter Farrelly's interracial road trip through the early '60s Deep South, which has struggled to catch on at the box office while coming under substantial criticism for relying on racial tropes. It won best film, comedy or musical, and best screenplay. If Don Shirley and Tony Vallelonga can find common ground, we all can, said Farrelly, the director best known for broader comedies like There's Something About Mary.\\n\\nAs expected, Lady Gaga, Mark Ronson, Anthony Rossomando and Andrew Wyatt won best song for the signature tune from A Star Is Born, the film most expected to dominate the Globes.\\n\\nCan I just say that as a woman in music, it's really hard to be taken seriously as a musician and as songwriter and these three incredible men, they lifted me up, Gaga said.\\n\\nThough the Globes are put on by foreign journalists, they don't including foreign language films in their two best picture categories (for drama and musical/comedy). That left Netflix's Oscar hopeful, Alfonso Cuaron's memory-drenched masterwork Roma out of the top category. Cuaron still won as best director and the Mexican-born filmmaker's movie won best foreign language film.\\n\\nCinema at its best tears down walls and builds bridges to other cultures. As we cross these bridges, these experiences and these new shapes and these new faces, we begin to realize that while they may seem strange, they are not unfamiliar, Cuaron said accepting the foreign language Globe. This film would not have been possible without the specific colors that made me who I am. Gracias, familia. Gracias, Mexico.\\n\\nNetflix also won numerous awards for the series The Kominsky Method, which won both best actor in a comedy series for Michael Douglas (he dedicated the honor to this 102-year-old father, Kirk Douglas) and for best comedy series over favored nominees like The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (whose star, Rachel Brosnahan still won) and Barry.\\n\\nNetflix, Netflix, Netflix, said series creator Chuck Lorre.\\n\\nOlivia Colman, expected to be Lady Gaga's stiffest competition when the two presumably go head-to-head at the Oscars, won best actress in a comedy/musical for her Queen Anne in the royal romp The Favourite. ″I ate constantly throughout the film, said Colman. It was brilliant.\\n\\nBest supporting actress in a motion picture went to the Oscar front-runner Regina King for her matriarch of Barry Jenkins' James Baldwin adaptation If Beale Street Could Talk. King spoke about the Time's Up movement and vowed that the crews of everything she produces in the next two years will be half women. She challenged others to do likewise.\\n\\nStand with us in solidarity and do the same, said King, who was also nominated for the TV series Seven Seconds.\\n\\nA year after the Globes were awash in a sea of black and #MeToo discussion replaced fashion chatter, the red carpet largely returned to more typical colors and conversation. Some attendees wore ribbons that read TIMESUPx2, to highlight the second year of the gender equality campaign that last year organized the Globes black-clad demonstration. Alyssa Milano, the actress who was integral in making #MeToo go viral, said on the red carpet that in the past year a really wonderful sisterhood has formed.\\n\\nSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse won for best animated film. Ryan Murphy's The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story won for both best limited series and Darren Criss' lead performance.\\n\\nFor its sixth and final season, FX's The Americans took best drama series over shows like Amazon's conspiracy thriller Homecoming and Oh's own Killing Eve. Richard Madden, the breakout star of the terrorism suspense series Bodyguard, won best actor in a drama series. Ben Wishaw took best supporting actor in a limited series for A Very English Scandal.\\n\\nThe press association typically likes having first crack at series that weren't eligible for the prior Emmys. They did this year in not just The Kominsky Method and Bodyguard but also the Showtime prison drama Escape at Dannemora. Its star, Patricia Arquette, won for best actress in a limited series.\\n\\nUsually the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's ceremony is known for its freewheeling frivolity and fun. The free-flowing booze helps. But the 2018 Globes were the first major televised awards in Hollywood following the downfall of Harvey Weinstein and the subsequent push for greater gender equality in the film industry.\\n\\nLast year's show, like a lot of recent awards shows, saw ratings decline. Some 19 million tuned in to the Seth Meyers-hosted broadcast, an 11-percent decline in viewership. This year, NBC has one thing in its favor: an NFL lead in. Ahead of the Globes, NBC broadcast the late afternoon wild card game between the Chicago Bears and the Philadelphia Eagles, which proved to be a nail-bitingly close game — likely delivering the network a huge audience.\\n\\nJeff Bridges received the Globes' honorary Cecil B. DeMille Award. In remarks about everything from Michael Cimino to Buckminster Fuller and, of course, to his Big Lebowski character the Dude, Bridges compared his life to a great game of tag. We've all been tagged, said Bridges. We're alive. He ended by tagging everyone watching. We can turn this ship in the way we want to go, man, said Bridges.\\n\\nA similar television achievement award was also launched this year, dubbed the Carol Burnett Award. Its first honoree was Burnett, herself.\\n\\nI'm kind of really gob-smacked by this, said Burnett. Does this mean that I get to accept it every year?"}
{"original": "California Governor Gavin Newsom is fighting President Donald Trump over funds to assist with the recent wildfires in the state, after the newly-installed governor used his inaugural address to attack the president.\\n\\nOn Monday, Newsom took the oath of office and then delivered a fiery speech promising to offer an alternative to the corruption and incompetence in the White House. It was a gratuitous swipe at Trump that made headlines and seemed to backtrack on the progress the two made during Trump's visit to wildfire-stricken regions in November.\\n\\nTrump had criticized California for poor forest management, echoing critics who say that environmentalists have been so successful in pushing the government to restrict logging that they have inadvertently created conditions in which wildfires are likely to spread rapidly through dead trees and dense underbrush, and in which the lack of logging roads makes fighting fires harder. (Democrats prefer to blame climate change, though without evidence.)\\n\\nAmidst criticism that Trump's rebuke showed insensitivity to the victims of ongoing fires, as well as first responders battling the blazes, the president subsequently made an extra effort to show his support for the state during the fires. Newsom joined then-Gov. Jerry Brown in welcoming the president on a tour of Paradise, California and other areas.\\n\\nBut on Monday, the detente was over, as Newsom — likely seeking a bolder national political profile — cast himself as the anti-Trump. The president did not take the attack lightly, announcing on Twitter he had ordered the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to cease sending funds to California until it revised its forestry practices:\\n\\nBillions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen. Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2019\\n\\nNewsom responded in kind:\\n\\nMr. President — Just yesterday, @OregonGovBrown, @GovInslee, and I sent a letter asking the federal government to work with us in taking on these unprecedented wildfires.

He added: Republicans will offer an amendment to the Democrat's [sic] spending bills that will be voted on the floor this week to increase money for forest management that will help prevent and reduce the devastation from wildfires that we saw a couple months ago.\\n\\nDemocrats criticized the president, with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) — a likely presidential contender in 2020 — saying Trump should fight climate change, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) saying Trump ought to remember that he is president of the entire country — despite California's consistent efforts to oppose his governance.\\n\\nRep. Tom McClintock (R-CA), an ally of the president, criticized his tweet and urged him to reconsider. In his own statement, McClintock said that the principal blame for California's wildfires lies with federal agencies and laws which govern most of our state's forests and brushlands, not with state laws. He added that cutting FEMA's funding to CalFire would damage the one governmental agency that actually works in the state of California.\\n\\nJoel B.

{"original": "On the third Monday of February, Americans celebrate George Washington's Birthday, often inappropriately called Presidents Day. Even more unfortunately, this holiday doesn't even fall on Washington's Birthday due to the Uniform Monday Holiday Bill, which pushed numerous holidays to Monday in order to create more three-day weekends. Washington's real birthday does not occur until February 22.\\n\\nThe sad result of the attempt to create more long weekends is this uninspiring, mishmash holiday that falls between Washington's Birthday and Lincoln's on February 12, and ends up being barely more than a bland, generic February day off to clean house. This is a shame; the Father of Our Country deserves better.\\n\\nDavid Azerrad of the Heritage Foundation justly called the holiday insipid, and lamented the fact that a celebration of Washington was lumped in with a menagerie of other second-rate presidents. Washington, the 'indispensable man' of the revolution who was rightly extolled for being 'first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen,' has now been lumped together with the likes of James Buchanan, Jimmy Carter, Franklin Pierce and John Tyler, he said.\\n\\nIt is particularly unfortunate that there is not a more proper celebration of Washington in 2016, as the United States gears up to choose its next president and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. George Washington set a precedent of presidential leadership and dedication to Constitution.\\n\\nWashington came into office as a great man: the hero of the American Revolution, a great warrior, general, and leader who had also made himself wealthy through hard work and shrewd business practices at his Mount Vernon plantation. Having already willingly resigned his commission to the Continental Congress at the end of the Revolutionary War, he ended any discussion of military dictatorship for the new country. Washington was aiming for something much higher than being simply one of history's great commanders and conquerers.\\n\\nWhat made Washington truly great is that he eschewed great man politics. Though the story of the American Revolution can largely be told through Washington's life, he believed that the ideas and the constitutional government that were produced by it were far larger than himself.\\n\\nIn 1776, John Adams wrote, There is no good government but what is republican…[T]he true idea of a republic is 'an empire of laws, and not of men.' That, as a republic is the best of governments, so that particular arrangement of the powers of society, or in other words, that form of government which is best contrived to secure an impartial and exact execution of the law, is the best of republics.\\n\\nThis is what Washington, Adams, and the Founding Fathers fought for and dedicated their lives to. They were creating a republic based around the idea of ordered liberty. Washington was undoubtedly a great man, but knew that to establish a grand republic to survive the ages the new country would have to thrive without the perpetual need for great men wielding unlimited power in high office.\\n\\nThe historian and political philosopher Harry Jaffa wrote in his book, A New Birth of Freedom:\\n\\nAmerica's Founding Fathers denied entirely any right of Caesar… Caesarism, which became the ultimate origin of the divine right of kings, was accordingly anathema to Americans. The American Founders looked toward and empire of freedom unprecedented in human history. They meant to combine power greater than that of the Rome of the Caesars with freedom greater than that of the roman republic or any other republic of antiquity.\\n\\nWhen constitutional crisis emerged, such as in the National Bank debate authorization conflict, Washington did not simply mock the idea of following the founding document as some modern politicians have. Washington consulted the greatest legal minds of his generation and settled on policy he believed was in the scope of the the Constitution's original intention.\\n\\nIt was this adherence to ideas and the rule of law that separated Washington from a Napoleon Buonaparte—another great man who helped topple the French Monarchy to established a republic, but eventually drove his nation to an empire of arbitrary rule. And it was the commitment to the Constitution and ultimately the virtue of the American people that allowed America's founding generation to create an empire of liberty. Washington understood this when he become the first president of the United States. He said in his inaugural address, The sacred fire of liberty and destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered, perhaps, as deeply, as finally, staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people.\\n\\nThe great historian of the founding, Forrest McDonald, summarized the importance of Washington in his book The Presidency of George Washington.\\n\\nGeorge Washington was indispensable, but only for what he was, not for what he did, McDonald continued. He was the symbol of the presidency, the epitome of propriety in government, the means by which Americans accommodated the change from monarchy to republicanism, and the instrument by which an inconsequential people took its first steps to becoming a great nation.\\n\\nIt should be particularly apparent in the minds of Americans today—after the passing of the great Originalist Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia—how fragile American liberty is. This country as it was founded will not survive if leaders do not commit to circumscribed governmental power. It will be even worse if the people no longer care to hold them accountable and in check.\\n\\nThis makes the celebration of Washington's life so important at this time. Americans honor the Father of Our Country by committing to the principles and ideas he stood for and exemplified in office. It is the only way to keep our republic."}
{"original": "Foreign Affairs Minister Joseph Wu of Taiwan erupted against the World Health Organization (WHO) on Twitter Wednesday for its deliberate exclusion of the country from the ongoing coronavirus response and its misreporting on the situation in Taiwan.\\n\\nThe WHO, a United Nations body, refuses to acknowledge the existence of Taiwan or allow it into any of its venues or programs, as the Chinese Communist Party falsely claims it as a rogue province. The WHO has refused to cooperate with the Taiwanese government through the process of responding to the coronavirus crisis that began in China last month and claims to be in contact with Taiwan through the Communist Party, which has no ties to Taipei or control of the island.\\n\\nAs a result, the WHO published false statistics on the coronavirus outbreak in Taiwan, inflating the actual number of confirmed cases there. It has also referred to Taiwan as Taiwan, China, which the Taiwanese government has repeatedly condemned as inaccurate and disrespectful.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Foreign Minister Wu used the official account of his ministry to address the WHO and demanded to know, what's wrong with you:\\n\\n.@WHO, what's wrong with you? First you called us Taiwan, China, then you changed to Taipei. You misreported the confirmed cases, & now you call us Taipei & Environs. Look! Taiwan is #Taiwan & not any part of the #PRC. JW — 外交部 Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ROC (Taiwan) 🇹🇼 (@MOFA_Taiwan) February 6, 2020\\n\\nThe WHO published a situation report on the coronavirus outbreak – which at press time is believed to have infected over 28,000 people and killed over 500, nearly all of them in China – on Wednesday that referred to Taiwan as Taipei and environs, an attempted correction of Taiwan, China, which prompted global outrage. The day before, the Taiwan, China case count was listed as 13, three more than the Taiwanese government had actually confirmed. The error is a result of the WHO refusing to communicate with the Taiwanese government. Taiwan's Health and Welfare Ministry referred to the number as fake news and blamed wrong numbers that were provided by China for the mistake. Taipei also blamed the WHO for Vietnam and Italy limiting its flights to Taiwan, citing false information from the U.N. organization.\\n\\nThe ministry account addressed WHO Secretary-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus directly on Thursday, demanding a retraction of his effusive praise for China's response to the viral outbreak. China has consistently withheld key information during the outbreak, refusing to acknowledge it for nearly a month in the city of Wuhan, where it originated. The refusal to alert health professionals in the city about the contagious nature of the deadly virus left many exposed to coronavirus patients and resulted in hospitals not adequately isolating potential patients and thus exposing people who were already sick and in a state of compromised health, to the virus.\\n\\nAdhanom has demanded that the world show gratitude and respect to the Communist Party for its flawed response to the outbreak.\\n\\nOne week ago, @DrTedros, you said: China is setting a new standard for outbreak response. China deserves our gratitude & respect. I will praise China again & again. Are you going to stand by your statements or retract them? Hello? JW https://t.co/XGZyLe7YMg — 外交部 Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ROC (Taiwan) 🇹🇼 (@MOFA_Taiwan) February 6, 2020\\n\\nThe remarks followed a stern rebuke from Foreign Affairs Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou on Thursday, who called the false numbers from the WHO absurd.\\n\\nWe expressed our solemn protest to the WHO after Taiwan's objection with regards to the matter through its representative office in Geneva and several other channels was ignored, she said. I'd like to ask the WHO, how many times are you going to change Taiwan's name? These are not our correct names. Let me reiterate — our name is Taiwan, whose formal name is the Republic of China.\\n\\nAt a WHO meeting on Wednesday, the United States urged the group to include Taiwan in the response, insisting that saving lives from a health emergency was not a political endeavor.\\n\\nFor the rapidly evolving coronavirus, it is a technical imperative that WHO present visible public health data on Taiwan as an affected area and engage directly with Taiwan public health authorities on actions, American Ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva Andrew Bremberg said at a WHO executive board meeting, according to the Taipei Times.\\n\\nI would like to reiterate that Taiwan is part of China, this fact cannot be changed, Bremberg's Chinese counterpart at the meeting, Qi Daihai, stated falsely. Stop hyping-up about the so-called Taiwan issue. Don't waste our time.\\n\\nThe United States and Japan, which also complained to the WHO about its designation of Taiwan as China, joined eSwatini, Paraguay, and Guatemala, which also demanded Taiwan be included in global outbreak response in a prior WHO meeting. The three are part of the 15 nations that accurately recognize Taiwan as a sovereign state; the list does not include the United States. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen recognized the three states on Twitter.\\n\\nI want to thank the representatives from #Eswatini, #Paraguay, & #Guatemala for taking a stand for global health & safety by supporting #Taiwan's @WHO participation & highlighting ways that #TaiwanCanHelp combat the spread of #2019nCoV. pic.twitter.com/Q2niR21y7H — 蔡英文 Tsai Ing-wen (@iingwen) February 5, 2020\\n\\nTsai's vice president, Lai Ching-te, is currently in Washington meeting with congressmen and national security officials.

{"original": "Iranian officials released economic data this week indicating oil exports are sharply down and U.S. sanctions have cut the export of products other than oil in half.\\n\\nRadio Farda reviewed the numbers on Tuesday and found Iran's exports were growing significantly before the second, much tougher round of U.S. sanctions took effect in November:\\n\\nThe country exported only $1.867 billion non-oil goods during November 21-December 22, less than half of Iran's monthly average during the current fiscal year, which started on March 21, 2018. The plunge in exports was partly due to a complete stoppage in ultra-light oil (gas condensate) sales, which Iran includes in non-oil export basket. The monthly gas condensate export has averaged at about $330 million, or only a seventh of the drop in total non-oil exports during November 21-December 22. In the other world, U.S. oil-related sanctions also seriously impacted Iran's non-oil exports as well. The U.S. also imposed financial sanctions on Iran in August, but the details of customs statistics does not show any meaningful change in the non-oil exports level during the August-November period. During the first nine months of the fiscal year (FY), the country has exported about 5.6 million metric tons of gas condensate at $2.776 billion, which indicates a 50% decline year-on-year. However, the country's total non-oil exports during March 21-December 22 reached $33.36 billions, or 4.5% more than the same period in last FY. Despite this growth, Iran has fulfilled less than 70% of its non-oil export target for the period. Its non-fuel imports also declined 13.3% year-on-year to $32.62 billion.\\n\\nThe Radio Farda report included a necessary disclaimer that Iran does not officially publish details about its crude oil exports, but since even the countries granted waivers by the United States to purchase Iranian oil have significantly reduced their imports, a decline in export volume can be readily deduced.\\n\\nIt was widely feared – or, among oil executives and the heads of nations whose economies are driven by oil revenue, devoutly hoped – that knocking Iran out of the market with sanctions would cause oil prices to soar and supplies to become tight. That does not appear to be happening, as another Radio Farda report pointed out.\\n\\nAnalysts predicted continued oversupply from the astounding surge in U.S. production, reduced demand from the global economic slowdown, anxiety about the U.S.-China trade war, waivers granted to Iran's largest customers, the failure of the OPEC cartel to arrange a production slowdown, and possibly President Donald Trump's lobbying for lower oil prices will keep fuel relatively cheap in 2019.\\n\\nOverall, this is not a rosy picture for Iran, already suffering from deep economic crisis, compounded by U.S. sanctions, which have impacted the country's banking ties with the world and its non-oil trade, Radio Farda predicted.\\n\\nThe Iranian regime unsurprisingly chose to focus on the positive, with President Hassan Rouhani declaring on Wednesday morning, The Islamic Republic of Iran will continue to export oil despite U.S. sanctions.\\n\\nIn the past 9 months, Iran's trade balance has been positive due to the $750m non-oil exports, indicating that the activities of the economic executives and the private and public sectors have been successful, Rouhani told his cabinet, delicately understating what happened in the last two of those months.\\n\\nBased on oil minister's reports, Iran's oil sales have been continuing just as it was expected, but there are some minor issues that are solvable and will be solved soon, he claimed. No one looking at the actual data could possibly believe that, but Iranians will be required to believe it so their leaders can claim victory over the American quest to reduce its oil exports to zero.\\n\\nThe Syrian regime tried to cheer up its Iranian patrons this week by promising they will make a fortune from postwar reconstruction, a project in which Iranian bids will ostensibly be privileged.\\n\\nOn the other hand, officials in Tehran have probably noticed the United Arab Emirates just reopened its embassy in Damascus and its diplomats are reminding the Syrians about the extensive UAE investments made before the civil war blew up in 2011.\\n\\nPresident Trump has been talking up the amount of money the UAE's allies in Saudi Arabia are prepared to invest in Syrian reconstruction, to the consternation of Saudis who apparently cannot see the bountiful opportunities for lavish profit promised by Syrian officials. At the very least, sober money men in Tehran will have some doubts about Syrian reconstruction sparking an economic renaissance in Iran.\\n\\nIran's best hope for weathering sanctions might lie with India, which is generally supportive of U.S. policy but has not disguised its hunger for more Iranian oil. India's finance ministry kicked off the new year by announcing a massive retroactive tax break for crude oil imports from Iran. The move was a major step toward creating a durable financial infrastructure for working around U.S. sanctions to keep Iranian oil flowing into India, and will give Iran a trove of Indian currency to spend on imports and investment.\\n\\nThe New York Times last week dismissed Tehran's happy talk about the economy and lamented the devastating effect of sanctions on the Iranian middle class, which was already suffering from the absurd mismanagement of Rouhani's regime, especially its habit of manipulating the currency to cover up economic shortfalls.\\n\\nThe Times quoted analysts who labored mightily to blame the travails of the Iranian middle class on President Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the reimposition of sanctions, but the very same article makes it clear the Iranian government was already fiddling with the economy in a variety of disastrous ways to conceal the effects of corruption, political repression, foolish policies, and the squandering of Iran's windfall from the nuclear deal on foreign adventures.\\n\\nRouhani is trying to reassert control and tamp down public unrest with a new budget that spends more on domestic priorities, but he could easily have done that during the Obama years when lucrative foreign deals and literal pallets of cash were falling into his lap. If Tehran is truly changing and turning its focus inward, it is only because the crushing effect of sanctions forced a major re-evaluation of policy. There is little evidence that any sort of political liberalization flowed from the nuclear deal boom and a great deal of evidence to the contrary."}
{"original": "Facebook Chief Operating Officer (COO) Sheryl Sandberg says that male executives who follow Pence rule, and refuse to dine alone with female colleagues, should avoid eating with male colleagues as well.\\n\\nThe rule is named for Vice President Mike Pence, who in 2002 said he will not attend events where alcohol is being served without his wife by his side, and will not have dinner alone with a woman other than his wife.\\n\\nPence was mocked when the rule first emerged. But in the wake of the #metoo movement, men throughout the workforce are beginning to see his point.\\n\\nAccording to SiliconValley.com, nearly half of male managers say they're uncomfortable participating in a work activity such as mentoring or socializing with women, according to a survey conducted this year by LeanIn.Org and SurveyMonkey in response to sexual harassment allegations. SiliconValley.com also noted that [a] higher percentage of male managers is also uncomfortable working with a women or mentoring them.\\n\\nSandberg responded by demanding that men who follow the Pence rule apply it to everybody. If you insist on following it, adopt a revised version, she wrote in a Facebook post Tuesday. Don't want to have dinner alone with a female colleague? Fine. But make access equal: no dinners alone with anyone. Breakfast or lunches for all. Or group dinners only, nothing one-on-one. Whatever you choose, treat women and men equally.\\n\\nSandberg also argued that placing more women positions of power would decrease sexual harassment in the workplace, writing, We also need to focus on getting more women into positions of power. A more equal world would be a better world, with stronger companies, economies, and families. And yes, with less sexual harassment, which is less prevalent when women lead.\\n\\nAlso on Tuesday, Sandberg announced that her nonprofit organization, LeanIn.Org, had launched a campaign called #MentorHer, which urges men to mentor female colleagues.\\n\\nSandberg wrote:\\n\\n[#MentorHer] urges men to step up and use their power to support women in the workplace, with research-backed information for why mentorship matters and tips for how to be an effective mentor to women. People with mentors are more likely to get promotions – yet women are less likely than men to be mentored, and women of color get the least support of all. If we're going to change the power imbalance that enables so much sexual harassment in the first place, we need to ensure women get more mentorship and sponsorship, not less. That's how we get the stretch assignments that lead to promotions. That's how we build the networks that put us on the path to exciting opportunities. That's how we get the respect – and recognition – we deserve.\\n\\nHuffington Post founder Arianna Huffington echoed Sandberg's sentiments on Tuesday, tweeting, 3x as many male managers are now uncomfortable mentoring women in the wake of # MeToo.

{"original": "The sweeping wildfire that has consumed a fifth of Fort McMurray, Canada, has slowed its march over the city's surrounding forests, but experts still warn it could be months before the last ember is put out.\\n\\nYou know what? It's a lot better than I thought it was, Alberta MP David Yurdiga told BBC about the state of the fire on Sunday, noting that it now covers 620 square miles – still a major threat to Fort McMurray and surrounding communities, but significantly better than the worst case scenario. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley added to this optimism, telling reporters the fire is quite a bit smaller than we had feared.\\n\\nThe quite a bit smaller fire has destroyed about one fifth of buildings in Fort McMurray and forced 100,000 residents to flee. Entire neighbourhoods are missing south of downtown. Broken foundations on winding streets are all that is left of some homes, Canada's Globe and Mail reports. Wrecked swing sets stand in what were once backyards, the metal shells of hefty appliances stand in fields of cracked concrete and steel.\\n\\nFort McMurray fire has scorched 397,831 acres — and destroyed some 1,600 structures: https://t.co/f85FWFLm2e pic.twitter.com/PyoDdOHAYC — TODAY (@TODAYshow) May 9, 2016\\n\\nWildfire at Fort McMurray quickly overtakes Canada's environmental debate https://t.co/XudpU6zSfa pic.twitter.com/qJQkmGUVb0 — Los Angeles Times (@latimes) May 8, 2016\\n\\nCanada has deployed over 500 firefighters and 200 helicopters, which dump large bags full of gallons of water over piece by piece of the fire, hoping to contain it. Executive provincial operations director for the Alberta Emergency Management Agency Scott Long told the Globe and Mail that, while experts believe the fire will continue to rage for months, firefighters are hoping to contain it enough to allow for evacuees to safely return home much sooner than that. It's going to take quite a while for the wildfire fighters to actually get that under control, contain it, put it out, he admits, but adds, Our goal is certainly, as soon as it's stabilized and safe, that we're going to start allowing Albertans to get back to the community. I am not looking at months.\\n\\nThe newspaper notes that major infrastructure challenges lay ahead for the city, as its gas infrastructure remains unusable for fear of strengthening the fire and there is no potable water available in any buildings.\\n\\nAdding to the destruction is the movement of the fire in the city. The Calgary Herald cites firefighters saying the fire has moved underground into basements, sewers, and gas pipes, often imperceptible but capable of causing explosions should someone introduce a flammable element near the underground fires. Canadian firefighters have managed to prevent any deaths related to the fire outside of those involved in car accidents during evacuation; no one has died in the fire itself. The positive result is the product of an extremely strict evacuation policy – anyone in civilian clothing found within the evacuation area is arrested immediately. The Calgary Herald notes two people have been arrested trying to save their pets from the fire.\\n\\nAn appreciative Fort McMurray resident found our officers today.

The BBC notes it is home to the world's third-largest oil reserves, and oil production may take months to return to pre-fire levels. Alberta has 30 million barrels in reserve and you can see that in ten days time, that cushion will have been eroded or squeezed — if that happens, and no one can find product, it could become a problem, the Calgary Sun quotes Dan McTeague, senior analyst for GasBuddy, as saying in a blog post. These shortages are expected to be limited to Alberta, but that could change rapidly depending on the global context for oil production."}

{"original": "Before each game, Green Bay Packers fans look forward to the party before the game. But if the lobbyists pushing a new state law get their way, fans will find it much harder to indulge one of their favorite indulgences: Tailgating.\\n\\nA new state law has been churning its way through the state capital at Madison, Wisconsin, that would force property owners to purchase a liquor license before renting out parking spaces for fans to tailgate, the Washington Post reported. This would essentially ban tailgate parties where fans rent a parking spot to imbibe alcohol to party it up before a game, that is unless the property owner pays the fee for the license.\\n\\nOne can assume that jumping through all the difficult, costly, and time-consuming hoops to qualify to purchase a liquor license is something few property owners would bother with. There is also no indication if the number of licenses needed to cover every property owner who has rented space to fans in the past would be increased from the limited number the city has to offer now.\\n\\nMany football fans think the new law will put an end to a large number of the spots fans rented to party in the past.\\n\\nAccording to the Post, this example of over-regulation is a result of a legislative fight between a lobby group that represents tavern owners and another group looking to advance the interests of the state's growing winery sector.\\n\\nThe winery owners want to change state laws that force wineries to close at 9 PM. They say this law prevents them from hosting weddings and other such events. But the tavern owners are unhappy with the idea that they will have increased after hour competition possibly taking customers away from the state's bars.\\n\\nThe tavern owners' league is at the heart of the efforts to restrict the fans' tailgating sending the message that booze is their turf. But the tavern league says that the tailgaters were not exactly their target. The league says they only wanted to restrict the expansion of barn weddings, wineries, and other venues hoping to expand their own business prospects.\\n\\nSome members of the state legislature are looking to alter Assembly Bill 433 to strip out the restrictions on the tailgaters. But one thing that the sudden attack on Packers fans' beloved tailgating has shed a harsh light on the over protective actions of the Tavern League.\\n\\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston."}

The decision to make the historic change at the expense of Hamilton drew angry rebukes from fans of the former Treasury Secretary. The pro-Hamilton movement gained steam after the smash success of the hip-hop Broadway musical about his life this year.\\n\\nThose pressures led Lew to determine that Hamilton should remain on the front of the bill. Instead, a mural-style depiction of the women's suffrage movement — including images of leaders such as Susan B.

{"original": "The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has intensified an assault on all human rights against every group and individual in China, Britain's Conservative Party Human Rights Commission has alleged in a report, which claims to show evidence that the actions carried out by the regime are indicative of the crime of genocide.\\n\\nIn the report, The Darkness Deepens: The Crackdown on Human Rights in China 2016-2020 — an advance copy of which was seen by Breitbart London — the Commission detailed the stunning growth of authoritarianism in China carried out by the dictatorship in Beijing.\\n\\nThe report documented the implementation of mass surveillance systems, mass instances of modern-day slavery, torture, organ harvesting, the dismantling of promised freedoms in Hong Kong, and the crimes committed against ethnic minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang.\\n\\nThe Commission said that evidence shows that between one and three million Uyghur Muslims have been detained in concentration camps in the Western Chinese province of Xinjiang, known also as East Turkestan by the local inhabitants.\\n\\nEvidence presented to the Commission demonstrated the mass internment, forced labour, torture, mass surveillance, severe violations of freedom of religion or belief and forced sterilisation in Xinjiang.\\n\\nDr Joanne Smith Finley, Reader in Chinese Studies at Newcastle University, told the Commission of a conversation she had with a Uyghur man in Urumqi, the capital city of Xinjiang, on July 18, 2018, who told her that people are taken for small things, not necessarily always because of religious practice.\\n\\nThe man said that he had never heard of anyone leaving the internment camps, with the exceptions of those who fell ill, saying: Some people were given 'medicine' to change their thinking, 'for their minds'. When this made them mentally ill, only then were they released.\\n\\nTwo days prior to the conversation, a Han Chinese man — the dominant ethnic group of China — told Dr Smith Finley that detainers are just there to have their thinking changed.\\n\\nOne Uyghur woman who provided testimony to the Commission said that the CCP was attempting to wipe out three types of Uyghur: intellectuals, the rich, and the religious.\\n\\nShe said that 15 of her extended family members were interned in the camps for these reasons, including both of her parents, for not cooperating with the Communist Party of China and for performing pilgrimage, being religious, being rich, and having more children.\\n\\nShe said that one of her family members died as a result of the torture carried out by the communist regime.\\n\\nMy youngest uncle has two children, and when he and his wife were taken away, the regime took his children away and put them in the children's concentration camps, the woman testified.\\n\\nSpeaking to the Commission, Dr Adrian Zenz said that by 2019, Xinjiang authorities had planned to subject at least 80 per cent of women of childbearing age in the rural southern four minority prefectures to intrusive birth prevention surgeries (IUDs or sterilisation), with actual shares likely being much higher.\\n\\nDr Zenz said that between 2015 and 2018, population growth rates fell by 84 per cent in the two largest Uyghur Muslim prefectures, with birth rates continuing to fall. He said that in 2020, one Uyghur region saw an unprecedented near-zero population growth.\\n\\nThese findings provide the strongest evidence yet that Beijing's policies in Xinjiang meet one of the genocide criteria cited in the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Dr Zenz said.\\n\\nThe Conservative Party Human Rights Commission added: We believe that the CCP is committing mass atrocity crimes against the Uyghurs and others in [Xinjiang]… and that is evidence indicative of the crime of genocide.\\n\\nExclusive Video — 'Torture and Rape': Uyghurs in London Protest Communist China's Concentration Camps https://t.co/NOEFHdAqq8 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 9, 2019\\n\\nReligion as a whole has increasingly become a target of the communist regime, with Christian Solidarity Worldwide (CSW) stating that under Xi Jinping, there has been a new focus on religion at the highest levels of government.\\n\\nWhile the persecution of the Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang currently draws the most international attention, the CCP has systematically targetted Buddhists and Falun Gong practitioners as well as Christians, of both Protestant and Catholic denominations.\\n\\nCSW said that there has been a fresh emphasis placed on the requirement that all religious communities in China 'sinicise' by becoming 'Chinese in orientation' and adapting to socialist society and to bring all religious activities under state control.\\n\\nThe China Aid Association said that the Chinese Communist Party intends to bring Christianity under the full control of the government.\\n\\nBoth registered and unregistered Protestant churches have been individually and collectively penalised for peaceful religious activities, the CSW said.\\n\\nRegistered churches under the Three-Self Patriotic Movement have been forced to sing national and pro-Communist songs during services, to fly the national flag and remove religious images. Across the country, churches have had their crosses removed, and many report that under-18s are now banned from attending religious activities, the Christian human rights group added.\\n\\nChristian Solidarity Worldwide also told the Commission that so-called unregistered churches have been forcibly shut by the government, with their property confiscated by the state and their leaders have been subject to detention and even sentenced to prison terms.\\n\\nFalun Gong, a spiritual Chinese religious movement in the Buddhist tradition, was outlawed by the CCP in 1999, with the government classifying the religion as an evil cult, prompting decades of persecution from the state.\\n\\nI have to make it very clear the Falun Gong is an evil cult, then-Chinese President Jiang Zemin, the architect of the Tiananmen Square massacre, said in 2001.\\n\\nThe Falun Dafa Association UK told the Commission that while it is unknown how many Falun Gong practitioners have disappeared in the country, they believe the number is in the tens of thousands.

{"original": "Clint Eastwood is a terrific actor. Unfortunately, like a number of Hollywood legends who failed to take home a performance Oscar (Cary Grant, Judy Garland, Edward G. Robinson, Greta Garbo, Kirk Douglas, Lauren Bacall, Robert Mitchum, James Garner, Marilyn Monroe Richard Burton, Charlie Chaplin) Eastwood is so good at what he does, he makes it look so easy and natural, his talents are taken for granted. We just assume he is playing himself.\\n\\nAnyone who has seen Heartbreak Ridge, White Hunter Black Heart, or the Bridges of Madison County knows this is not true. Outside of that perfectly-honed Harry Callahan screen persona, Eastwood has proven his range more than once, but never more so than in a little 1980 classic called Bronco Billy.\\n\\nEastwood turned 50 in 1980, was already a Hollywood legend, and with Paint Your Wagon (1969), The Beguiled (1971), and Breezy, he was a legend who had taken a number of career risks (something else Eastwood does not get enough credit for). Bronco Billy, though, was something entirely different.\\n\\nSure, Eastwood's Bronco Billy McCoy is plenty ready to throw a punch, but he's also a few degrees shy of a weirdo. This self-proclaimed Fastest Gun in the West is a walking-talking anachronism who keeps his mediocre (but charming) Wild West Show alive through hook or crook. Billy's scattering of misfit performers is made up of a pregnant fake Indian, a real Indian (who's constantly getting snakebit), a black ringleader (the wonderful Scatman Crothers), an Army deserter, an alcoholic, a cripple, a spoiled heiress, and Billy himself — a former shoe salesman from New Jersey and ex-convict who shot and wounded his unfaithful wife.\\n\\nEastwood has said that Bronco Billy is the best window into the values he holds dear — and those are forgiveness, reverence for children (Say your prayers and stay in school, little pards.), second chances, the melting pot, charity, unwavering loyalty to friends, the miracle of a country where you can become anything you want, and America's big beautiful tent (as seen in the touching closing shot).\\n\\nBilly is a tad dim, plenty eccentric, and as courtly and old-fashioned as a silent movie cowboy. Most of all, though, he is determined to sustain his self-created fantasy world and grateful to the country and friends who made this middle-aged self-invention possible.\\n\\nEastwood is nothing less than enchanting as Billy, and it is the kind of tightrope performance that could have easily resulted in the audience laughing at him out of a sense of superiority, instead of just laughing.\\n\\nSo why am I spending all this time on a 39-year-old movie in what is supposed to be a contemporary movie review? First off, I want to encourage everyone to see Bronco Billy. As the media, Democrats, academia, and even Hollywood seek to divide us more and more with un-American identity politics, Eastwood's quirky ode to the simple grace of e pluribus unum plays even better today than it did in 1980. But there's a second reason…\\n\\nLike Billy McCoy, Eastwood's Earl Stone is a charming, off-beat eccentric; a living, breathing anachronism; and like Bronco Billy, Eastwood appears to reveal something about his values in The Mule.\\n\\nEarl Stone (Eastwood) is a 90-year-old Korean War veteran and bankrupted (by the Internet) horticulturist given a second financial chance by a Mexican drug cartel. This actually makes sense. Earl is the perfect mule, an old white guy in a pickup traveling from the Southern border to Illinois with a suitcase, a bag of pecans, golf clubs, and hundreds of kilos of cocaine.\\n\\nEarl is also looking for a second chance, the means to reinvent himself. He has been a terrible family man. Work always came before family, as did the hollow pleasure of being a minor celebrity within the sub-culture of the flower trade.\\n\\nAnd so, with his ill-gotten wealth, Earl ingratiates himself with his loved ones as he alternately impresses and infuriates his cartel confederates with his competence, poise, politically incorrect sense of humor, stubbornness, and quirky need to sing (poorly) along with the oldies station.\\n\\nBut in that understated way of his, Eastwood the director also has something to say about honoring our veterans, losing ourselves in our iPhones, the importance of the small pleasures of life, the common decency of those of us who populate flyover country, and how we've traded in the vital lesson of sticks 'n stones as a means to feel offended and superior — which is a miserable way to live a life.\\n\\nOther than the dreaded omnipresent iPhone, Earl does not lecture. Often, he is on the wrong side of it. Violating a cardinal cartel rule of the road, Earl pulls over to help a black family change a tire. With no malice he calls them negroes. But the no malice doesn't matter because he is seeing skin color, he is focused on something meaningless. The beauty of this moment, though is that the family's response is just as politically incorrect. Rather than screeching at Earl about his lack of Woke-ness and the proper use of the term African-American, the mother says, How about just seeing us as people? To which Early replies, Alright.\\n\\nAmen.\\n\\nOverall, Earl is a tragic figure, but not due to the bankruptcy or the drug dealing. This is a man who chased career and carnal pleasures all of his life, and did so at the expense of his own happiness, that abiding happiness that can only come from being a good man, which most of all means being a good husband, son, and father. This regret dogs him like the DEA.\\n\\nEastwood's performance is a wonder, another lovely, endearing, peculiar tightrope walk in a compelling and very touching little movie.\\n\\nFor those who don't know, Eastwood's Earl is based on Leo Sharp, the real-life Tata who spent ten years transporting thousands of kilos of poison into the Midwest. To make all of this more sympathetic, screenwriter Nick Schenk (who also wrote the 2008 Eastwood classic Gran Torino) condenses the story from ten years to a dozen or so runs and makes Earl more financially desperate than Leo actually was. The most important difference, though, is what happens in court, which I won't spoil.\\n\\nI would have bet my house that no one could ever leap over John Wayne as Hollywood's Greatest Ever, but here is Clint Eastwood still opening movies at age 88, still a major star after seven decades, and not just a star, but a major director — one responsible for five Best Picture nominees, two of them (Unforgiven – 1992, Million Dollar Baby – 2004) winners. Eastwood is also an accomplished musician and composer who has scored his own films.\\n\\nNo one even comes close to matching Eastwood's longevity as a consequential artist.\\n\\nHere's hoping that both he and his values live forever.\\n\\nUPDATE: This articles was updated to correct a factual error.\\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

The primary beneficiary of this protracted war of attrition was IS, he said.\\n\\nBecause IS is a terrorist group, the Assad regime attributed more importance to Saudi and U.S.-backed opposition groups, which dragged Washington into the Syrian quagmire, from which it only now tries to be extracted, thanks to Russia.\\n\\nThe official claimed that the events of recent months have shown that the only bulwark against the spread of terror in Syria is the Assad regime, while the Saudi and U.S.-backed rebel organizations have maintained what he described as a love-hate relationship with IS and the al-Qaeda affiliated Nusra Front.\\n\\nThey never saw them as enemies or ideological adversaries, he said.\\n\\nThe dissent between the U.S.-backed groups and IS and Nusra Front … was about the distribution of resources. And the proof is that on the eve of last month's Geneva talks, Saudi Arabia, backed by America, demanded that the areas controlled by Nusra be included in the ceasefire agreement, which Syria and Russia dismissed out of hand. America was subsequently left with no choice but to declare Nusra, Riyadh's ally, a terrorist organization.\\n\\nThe only difference between the U.S.-backed organizations, which, the official claimed, include the Army of Islam, as well as IS and Nusra Front, is that the former are loyal to their backers. They are Salafi jihadist groups, whose vision for Syria is identical to IS and Nusra. They want to turn secular Syria into a Taliban-style Afghanistan.\\n\\nThe first indications of a sea change in American policy came against the recent gains made by Russian and Syrian forces in Palmyra, Homs, and other places, during which U.S.-backed opposition groups were forced to abide by the ceasefire, said the official. It is encouraging, but too little and too late. With American backing, the rebels ravaged Syria and exported their ideology to other places, including Turkey and Europe, where we've now seen the results.\\n\\nThe Americans now understand that they will have to cooperate with Russia and the Syrian regime, which they declined to do before, he added. They now realize that they have to be part of the war against terror, rather than aid and abet it, whether directly or indirectly.\\n\\nRussia's resolve was clearly what tipped the balance, he said."}

{"original": "The Trump administration is attempting another push to scrutinize the influence of the Chinese government on U.S. schools.\\n\\nAxios reported Monday the administration is trying to push through a final rule that would require K-12 schools and universities with foreign exchange programs to reveal any contracts, partnership,s or financial arrangements with Confucius Institutes or classrooms.\\n\\nSchools that do not report the required information would be denied certification for their exchange program.\\n\\nThis lack of reporting makes it impossible for the U.S. government to discern the level of potential influence of China on the U.S. educational system, a senior DHS official said, according to the report.\\n\\nThe Washington Free Beacon reported Monday, as well, federal documents reveal that, over a period of six years, Chinese entities linked to the military, cyber attacks, and espionage, directed at least $88 million to U.S. colleges and universities.\\n\\nAccording to the report:\\n\\nInstitutions controlled by the Chinese government—state-owned enterprises, state-controlled public universities, government-controlled nonprofits, and other sources—collectively donated at least $315 million to American colleges between 2014 and 2019. More than a quarter of the contributions—27 percent—came from either state-owned defense contractors or public universities that closely partner with the Chinese military to conduct defense research.\\n\\nIn October 2019, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) urged the Senate to investigate China's influence on American schools.\\n\\nBreitbart News reported:\\n\\nHawley's concerns center on an education group called the Confucius Institute, a Chinese-government agency that has built partnerships with American colleges and universities. The Confucius Institute is steeped in controversy. Critics have accused the organization, and by extension, the Chinese government, of seeking control over messaging at American universities.\\n\\nIn December 2019, a U.S. Education Department investigation revealed $1.3 billion in unreported donations to U.S. universities from foreign countries, including China, Russia, and Qatar.\\n\\nThe department said the unreported foreign funds discovered were only a small portion of the donations from foreign countries that are pouring into U.S. campuses.\\n\\nThe investigation into the foreign funds was made after Sens. Rob Portman (R-OH) and Tom Carper (D-DE), chairman and ranking member, respectively, of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, released an initial bipartisan report that pointedly sounded a warning about the influence of foreign funds and the Chinese government throughout U.S. K-12 classrooms and on up to university campuses.\\n\\n[T]he Department of Education does not conduct regular oversight of U.S. schools' compliance with required foreign gift reporting, the report noted, and ultimately led the U.S. Education Department to remind universities of the requirement to report foreign funding.\\n\\nThe Senate subcommittee's final report specifically observed the role of China's Thousand Talents Plan (TTP), a talent recruitment program that was launched in 2008 and is operated by the Chinese Communist Party. The report noted:\\n\\nThe TTP targets U.S.-based researchers and scientists, regardless of ethnicity or citizenship, who focus on or have access to cutting-edge research and technology. In response to U.S. government scrutiny, China has attempted to delete online references to its talent recruitment plans and reportedly instructed Chinese institutions on how to avoid additional U.S. scrutiny.\\n\\nIn September, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged state and city officials to ensure their colleges and universities are not inappropriately influenced by organizations with ties to the Chinese Communist Party, including the Confucius Institutes.\\n\\nTelling the truth about China isn't partisan, the secretary said. It's principled. And it protects our people.\\n\\nBreitbart News reported in May on a New York Times account in 2012 of an interview with Martin Davidson, chairman of Adam Smith International, who observed the Confucius Institute financially incentivizes colleges and universities for allowing control over campus speech regarding China.\\n\\nDavidson said at the time:\\n\\nThe Chinese are very clear on what they are trying to achieve. They want to change the perception of China — to combat negative propaganda with positive propaganda. And they use the word propaganda in Chinese. But I doubt they have to say, We'll only give you this money if you never criticize China. The danger is more of self-censorship — which is a very subtle thing.\\n\\nAt this point, it is unclear whether the Trump administration rule will be entered into the Federal Register prior to Joe Biden's inauguration, though Trump officials are pushing to have that happen."}
{"original": "Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden, who boasted during the CNN debate Sunday evening of his 100 percent rating from abortion political advocacy group NARAL, presents his Agenda for the Catholic Community at his campaign website.\\n\\nI'm a practicing Catholic, Biden states in his vision for Catholic Americans, and adds, I believe faith is a gift. And the first obligation we all have is, 'Love your God,' the second one is, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' … 'Treat people with dignity.' Everyone's entitled to dignity, that's a basic tenet in my household.\\n\\nThat dignity, however, does not extend to the unborn in Biden's vision for Catholics, though the Church makes clear its unchanging teaching in the sanctity of human life, from conception to natural death.\\n\\nDuring his debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Biden answered his rival's challenge regarding his flip-flopping on the issue of support for the Hyde Amendment, a longstanding provision that is applied to congressional spending bills that prohibits taxpayer funds to be used for abortions.\\n\\n[B]y the way, everybody who has been to the Congress voted for the Hyde Amendment at one point or another because it was locked in other bits, Biden said, defending his prior votes for the Hyde Amendment, and then said:\\n\\nThe reason why I firmly came out opposed to the Hyde Amendment was that if we're going to have public funding for all healthcare along the line, there is no way you could allow for there to be a requirement, that you have the Hyde Amendment – a woman who doesn't have the money could not have coverage under health care … I did that a while ago. [N]umber two, I would send immediately to the desk of the United States Congress when I'm elected president – if I'm elected president – a codification of Roe v Wade, amended by Casey, because I think it is a woman's right to choose. I think it's a woman's opportunity to be able to make that decision. And in fact, I've gotten 100% rating from NARAL as well.\\n\\nBiden's latest views appear to have been influenced by the abortion lobby, rather than the Catholic church.\\n\\nNARAL President Ilyse Hogue released the following statement touting her group's prowess in having pushed Biden to move further left on the issue of abortion and, consequently, further away from the Church's position:\\n\\nWe are proud that NARAL's scorecard is seen as the gold standard for support for reproductive freedom. We know that our fundamental rights are under attack in unprecedented ways. Both candidates need to demonstrate their unequivocal commitment to Roe v. Wade and safeguarding abortion access. When Joe Biden fell short of that commitment, supporting the discriminatory Hyde Amendment, we pushed him along with our partners committed to reproductive justice. We will continue to push him to take a stronger stance. He must demonstrate that he will prioritize the critical issue of reproductive freedom as president.\\n\\nApparently, even actress and left-wing activist Alyssa Milano had more sway with Biden than the Church. The Atlantic reported in June 2019:\\n\\nAlyssa Milano, the actress who's become a major online presence on issues of women's rights as well as a friend of the Biden team, spoke by phone Wednesday to Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz, telling him the candidate needed to change. More calls came in, more tough conversations.\\n\\nIn July, Biden finally revealed his health plan would enshrine Roe v. Wade into the Constitution and force taxpayers to fund abortion.\\n\\nThe Biden campaign said his health plan would build on the progress of Obamacare's contraceptive mandate that offers free preventive care including contraception by repealing the Hyde Amendment because health care is a right that should not be dependent on one's zip code or income.\\n\\nAs Breitbart News reported in October, Biden was denied communion at a Catholic church in South Carolina due to his ardent support for abortion on demand.\\n\\nRev. Robert E. Morey, the pastor of St. Anthony Catholic Church in Florence, refused to give the Eucharist to Biden during Mass.\\n\\nSadly, this past Sunday, I had to refuse Holy Communion to former Vice President Joe Biden, Morey told the Florence Morning News. Holy Communion signifies we are one with God, each other and the Church. Our actions should reflect that.\\n\\nBiden's shift radically leftward reflects that of his party.\\n\\nDemocratic National Committee (DNC) chairman Tom Perez said in 2017 there is no room in the Democrat Party for pro-life individuals.\\n\\nEvery Democrat, like every American, should support a woman's right to make her own choices about her body and her health, Perez said, as HuffPost reported. That is not negotiable and should not change city by city or state by state:\\n\\nIn an AxiosOnHBO interview with Jonathan Swan, Perez rebuked Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who commented on Perez's stance: It saddens me and weakens the democracy millions of Americans cherish when the party that once embraced Catholics now slams the door on us.\\n\\nWell, actually the majority of Catholics voted for Democrats in 2016, Perez shot back during the Axios interview when reminded of Dolan's comment, adding:\\n\\nYou know, Matthew:25 is a pretty important teaching. And Matthew:25 says, you know, when you are hungry, I fed you. When you were naked, I provided you with clothing. When you were an immigrant, I welcomed you. I think one of the reasons why so many people are moving away from Donald Trump is that he's abandoned all of those values.\\n\\nAxios reported Perez said in a previous interview:\\n\\nI think the challenge that I see among a lot of people that go to Donald Trump rallies, and then they will go to church on Sunday, and I'm not … I don't know what faith they are worshipping. Donald Trump has done more to hurt the least of us among us than just about any president I can think of:\\n\\nA few days ago @BernieSanders declared that being pro-choice is an absolutely essential part of being a Democrat. That is shocking & disturbing. Where's the voice of those in the Democratic Party who disagree? Where's the outcry against this & socialism? https://t.co/T2XpoVgr9Y — Franklin Graham (@Franklin_Graham) February 12, 2020\\n\\nIn fact, in August, the DNC unanimously passed a resolution that embraced religiously unaffiliated voters and belittled Americans of faith.\\n\\nThe resolution proclaimed that 70 percent of religiously unaffiliated Americans share the values of the Democrat Party.\\n\\nReligiously unaffiliated Americans overwhelmingly share the Democratic Party's values, with 70% voting for Democrats in 2018, 80% supporting same-sex marriage, and 61% saying immigrants make American society stronger, the DNC stated, further defending secularists by asserting they have often been subjected to unfair bias and exclusion in American society, particularly in the areas of politics and policymaking where assumptions of religiosity have long predominated.\\n\\nThe Democrats continued by demeaning Americans of faith, referring to them as those most loudly claiming that morals, values, and patriotism must be defined by their religious views.\\n\\nReligious Americans, the DNC said, have used those religious views with misplaced claims of 'religious liberty,' to justify public policy that has threatened the civil rights and liberties of many Americans, including but not limited to the LGBT community, women, and others.\\n\\nBiden's vision for his Catholic agenda continues with the directive Build an economy where everyone comes along and we protect the 'least of these.'\\n\\nOnce again, the least of these does not include the vulnerable unborn.\\n\\nBiden's campaign, however, uses this section of the agenda to condemn Trump's tax cuts, which actually helped middle class Americans and to vow to raise the federal minimum wage to $15.\\n\\nThe former vice president's campaign also says the Catholic vision includes protecting the dignity of unions:\\n\\nThere used to be a basic bargain in this country that when you work hard, you were able to share in the prosperity your work helped create. It's time to restore the dignity of work and give workers back the power to earn what they're worth. Joe will start by strengthening unions and helping workers bargain successfully for what they deserve. His plan will check the abuse of corporate power over labor and hold corporate executives personally accountable for violations of labor laws. He will also encourage and incentivize unionization and collective bargaining.\\n\\nAs a Catholic, Biden also likely knows the Church teaches marriage is reserved solely for one man and one woman.\\n\\nCNN reported Monday that, as a senator, Biden voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 law, signed by former President Bill Clinton, that stated marriage is defined as between one man and one woman.\\n\\nDuring his debate with Sanders, however, Biden touted he supported same-sex marriage as early as 2012 – even before former President Barack Obama.\\n\\nI'm the first person to go on national television in any administration and say, 'I supported gay marriage,' Biden boasted.\\n\\nThe 2020 presidential candidate has made the radical shift leftward with the rest of his party.\\n\\nAs Breitbart News reported in October, Catholic League President Bill Donohue noted the Democrat Party's hostility toward Americans of faith.\\n\\nTo be specific, it is clear that none of the Democratic candidates wants to be tagged as religion-friendly, he stated.\\n\\nThere are some voices in the Democratic Party that freely admit how dangerously secular the Party has grown, he added. Their effort to bring sanity to their Party is commendable. But it is quite clear that they have failed."}

{"original": "President Donald Trump is pressing Democratic leaders for $5.6 billion in border-fence funding for 2019 — but Democrats face little public, media, or political pressure to end the shutdown or provide anything above $1.3 billion for some mix of fencing and various border security projects.\\n\\nTrump, House, and Senate leaders met January 2 and are expected to meet again on Friday to continue the shutdown negotiations.\\n\\nTrump's push for $5.6 billion comes after Democrats quickly rejected the White House's quiet offer of a $2.5 billion compromise proposal to end the seven-agency shutdown, which began December 22. Somebody said $2.5 [billion], Trump told reporters during a 90-minute White House press event on January 2. No … this is national security we're talking about.\\n\\nDemocrats say they will approve $1.3 billion for border security funding, but they have not said how much or how little of that funding could be spent on an actual barrier, as opposed to additional surveillance gear or new facilities.\\n\\nThe federal government is expected to spend $4,400 billion in the 12 months up to October 1. The $4 billion dispute over extra wall funding comprises just one penny for every $10 in federal spending during 2019.\\n\\nMost government agencies, including the Department of Defense, are funded. But no funds have been approved for the Departments of Justice, Transportation, State, Housing, Agriculture, and Interior. Roughly 350,000 federal workers have been sent home, and roughly 450,000 workers in those agencies remain on the job.\\n\\nAdvocates for stronger border security worry that Trump will lose the fight. What pressure are the Democrats going to feel to come to the table? asked Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. In contrast, Trump is under great pressure to win fence funding and may sign a pro-amnesty deal with the Democrats to get some funding, he said, adding:\\n\\nTrump needs a win, and the Democrats desperately need to prevent him from getting a win, and in the middle are federal employees who are working for free or for not at all. At some point, the Transportation Security Administration, the border patrol, are going to have to get paid or they are not going to turn up for work.\\n\\nDemocratic House leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi plans to quickly pass a bill on Friday that would fully fund six of the unfunded agencies until October 1, at levels already approved by the Senate. But the Pelosi package would provide only 30 days of funding for the Department of Homeland Security, without any barrier money.\\n\\nThe Pelosi plan would minimize Trump's ability to impose political pain on Democrats after February 30 because the only unfunded agency would be DHS.\\n\\nDemocrats tried to extract concessions from Trump during the leaders' January 2 meeting. According to Politico:\\n\\nAt three different times, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer asked Trump why he won't support reopening the other areas of the government that don't have to do with the immigration dispute, according to a source familiar with the meeting. Trump replied: I would be foolish if I did that.\\n\\nThe GOP-run Senate is expected to ignore any House bill pushed by Pelosi unless it has Trump's approval.\\n\\nPelosi's plan is a total non-starter and political performance art, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said January 2. The Senate will not debate the House bill, he said, adding, it is exactly the kind of proposal you would expect if the incoming House Democrats are choosing to stage a political sideshow rather than doing the hard work of helping govern the country.\\n\\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the Pelosi plan is a non-starter because it fails to secure the border and it puts the needs of other countries above the needs of our own.\\n\\nThe Washington Post reported:\\n\\nThe president's not going to sign it . . . Now's the time to come together, find common ground and solve this problem, [House Majority Leader Kevin] Mc­Carthy said. I didn't find the Democrats were wanting to negotiate today.\\n\\nThe Hill.com reported:\\n\\nThe problem with what Nancy Pelosi is talking about bringing up doesn't change the status quo. It doesn't add a dime to border security, House Republican Whip Steve Scalise (La.) told reporters in the Capitol. If they are not playing political games, they need to put a credible offer on the table that the president can sign.\\n\\nDemocratic leaders rejected Trump's argument for border security. The crisis that they [say exists] at the border, we don't think it exists, House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer said, according to the Hill.com.\\n\\nDemocrats are blocking the budget plan — even though they now would likely approve spending roughly $1 billion on the fence — because they do not want Trump to get roughly $1.5 billion above that total. The extra $1.5 billion might help Trump claim a victory, and likely would cause Democratic activists to claim a defeat.\\n\\nHow many more times can we say no? Nothing for the wall, Pelosi told MSNBC, without being asked how much she would agree to spend on construction of a fence.\\n\\nDemocrats — like many GOP candidates in 2016 — say they favor funding for border security. But that vague term can include many ineffective projects, such as more lights, more trucks, or more drone surveillance aircraft.\\n\\nWe are in a shutdown because Democrats refuse to fund border security, Trump said. We need a physical barrier — everything else is bells and whistles."}
{"original": "Much of the sports-watching world is accusing the Philadelphia Eagles of tanking after Eagles coach Doug Pederson pulled starting quarterback Jalen Hurts in a pivotal game against Washington.\\n\\nAnd, as it turns out, NBC Sunday Night Football hosts Cris Collinsworth and Al Michaels appear to be among them.\\n\\nSoon after Pederson pulled Hurts in the second half of a 17-14 game, Collinsworth criticized Pederson for the QB change, saying, I couldn't have done it.\\n\\nAl, I couldn't have done it. I couldn't have done what Philadelphia did, Collinsworth said from the NBC booth. I simply just could not have done it. You've got men out there that are fighting their guts out trying to win the game.

And the Giants have to be beside themselves, and who can blame them?\\n\\nThe moaning and wailing of Michaels and Collinsworth over the woes of the Giants were a constant and agonizing theme throughout the course of the evening. The Giants would have clinched a playoff berth with a Philadelphia victory and clearly, the TV networks would rather have the Giants than the Washington Football Team. However, announcers rarely let their preferences be known as loudly and proudly as Collinsworth and Michaels did last night.\\n\\nAlso, who really cares about the Giants' feelings?\\n\\nThe New York Giants were a six-win football team that scored 49 points in their final four games. In any normal year, their season would have ended four weeks ago.\\n\\nAfter the game, Eagles coach Doug Pederson defended his decision to pull Hurts by saying he was coaching to win.\\n\\nRegardless of the motive behind the decision, none of the three teams involved actually deserve to be in the playoffs and this writer says that as a lifelong fan of one of them.\\n\\nNFL teams care about their own self-interest. The Giants needed Philly to win to get into the playoffs. Philly – allegedly – decided they needed the sixth overall pick more than the ninth.

{"original": "Two books by one of Sweden's most popular and decorated children's authors may be withdrawn from circulation after an investigation revealed that they contained stereotypical depictions of other cultures. Jan Lööf was issued with an ultimatum: redraw the pictures, or have the books withdrawn.\\n\\nThe books in question are incredibly popular, and one – Catch Fabian – is sold out and will not be restocked, while publisher Bonnier Carlsen have withdrawn all 5,000 copies of the other – Grandpa is a Pirate – from sale. They have given me an ultimatum. I either have to redraw the pictures or the books will not be published anymore, the author told the newspaper Dagens Nyheter.\\n\\nGrandpa is a Pirate, first published in 1966, is considered an integral part of children's literature in Sweden, has having been translated into several languages and have even been distributed at McDonalds.\\n\\nOn Bokus.com, which lists the most popular books for each age range, Grandpa is a Pirate is at number three – but unlike the other books listed on the website, buy is no longer an option.\\n\\nThe objections the publishers have are that its main character meets a street seller named Abdullah and an evil pirate named Omar, pictured in the tweet below:\\n\\nThe Local reported that the other book, Catch Fabian, published in 1997, Has pictures of what appears to be a bongo drummer dressed in bangles, paint, a skirt, a headdress, and sunglasses. The rest of the band wear formal attire. What The Local failed to mention was that, in the Dagens Nyheter interview, Mr Lööf explained the drummer was a friend of his, Rebop Kawku Baah, who died thirty years ago.\\n\\nIn discussions with the publisher over Catch Fabian, Mr Lööf was asked to re-draw illustrations the publisher deemed problematic, including: the image of jazz musicians performing and that somebody wore sunglasses to go to bed. He attempted some sketches, which were then deemed not good enough. Mr Lööf told the publisher that he had realised the task was not possible and subsequently was told that they would have to be put out of print.\\n\\nThe publisher's spokeswoman categorically denied being too afraid to portray uncomfortable topics, saying instead that the decision to withdraw Grandpa is a Pirate was about awareness and respectfulness to our younger readers.\\n\\nFor us, Jan and his writing is incredibly important, the representative said. But apparently not as important as the current debate which is about how, in a respectful manner, we take into account contemporary values and at the same time cultural heritage.\\n\\nIf this were true then Bonnier Carlsen would have welcomed the book as it illustrates a the rarely portrayed but hugely historical role that Arabs played in the days of high piracy, as well as being a part of (now often forgotten) Swedish history: Sweden joining America in her first overseas war, which was fought against Barbary pirates. Barbary pirates, from four North African states known as the Barbary States, kidnapped American crews for ransom money, and kidnapped and enslaved more than one million Europeans, which prompted the two countries into war with the Barbary States.\\n\\nMr Lööf received the Schullströmska prize, which is awarded by the Swedish Academy every two years to an outstanding writer of children's books, just last month. Previously he has been decorated with both the Lagerlöf Literature Prize and the Astrid Lindgren Prize, but the author says he will not be changing his books, saying:\\n\\nI'm 76 years old and can not be bothered to change. This is not about the money. But, I probably will not be doing any more books for children.\\n\\nThe Local reported that: There has been general support for Lööf on Sweden's social media channels, with many social media users questioning whether censorship has gone too far.\\n\\nHaving examined all recent tweets with the relevant hashtag, of 18 tweets referencing the controversy 16 strongly opposed the censorship.\\n\\nOne user jokes that the country should burn all literature written before the 2000s, another saying that a book called Pettson and Findus should be banned because it contains unpleasant stereotypes of forest farmers and cats."}
{"original": "Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg is promising to nearly double the intake of refugees admitted to the U.S. under the Obama administration.\\n\\nBloomberg, whom polls show is gaining traction in his quest for the 2020 Democrat nomination, released his proposal for overhauling America's immigration and refugee laws on Monday. The plan, based on policies the mayor implemented during his tenure at the helm of New York City, is being touted as beneficial to not only the country's diversity, but also its profit margins.\\n\\nThe proposal states:\\n\\nAs the grandson of immigrants, Mike understands that immigration has been and always will be one of America's greatest strengths. His plan focuses on … tapping into the dedication and entrepreneurial spirit of immigrants to grow our economy and enrich our communities.\\n\\nOne way that Bloomberg hopes to grow and enrich the economy is by increasing the number of refugees allowed into the country annually. If elected, Bloomberg hopes to accept 125,000 refugees if elected—nearly doubling the intake accepted under former President Barack Obama. A portion of the new refugees will be individuals fleeing the impact of climate change, an idea also favored by Bloomberg's more progressive rivals, like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and environmentalist billionaire Tom Steyer.\\n\\nDuring his first year in office, Mike will set the target for refugee admissions at 125,000, and—recognizing the changing conditions causing displacement—will also establish a precedent for people permanently displaced by climate change to qualify as refugees, Bloomberg's plan states.\\n\\nThe proposed numbers stand in stark contrast to the 18,000 refugees President Donald Trump's administration is on track to accept between October 1, 2019 and September 30, 2020.\\n\\nTrump's refugee policy, which has shrunk the number of incoming individuals to levels unseen since 1980, is central to his agenda for raising wages and living standards for the American worker. The president and his allies have argued that a tight labor market benefits workers already in the country by pushing companies to invest in skill training and development. It also has the benefit of boosting wages, as there is a smaller pool of workers competing for open positions.\\n\\nThe president's policy differs from that of his predecessor. During former President Barack Obama's tenure in the White House, the number of displaced persons being resettled in the U.S. increased drastically. Between 2008 and 2017, more than 67,000 refugees on average were admitted into the country. The total would have been larger if Republicans had not stymied Obama's efforts to admit 110,000 displaced persons, most notably from Syria, during his final year in office.\\n\\nOverall, as of 2005, nearly 860,000 refugees have been resettled across America—a large proportion going to areas that have lagged behind the rest of the country in economic growth since the Great Recession. The incoming refugees have stressed the already depleted resources of state and local governments. The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) estimates that it costs taxpayers more than $64,000 over five years to resettle one Syrian refugee. To resettle an entire family, the cost estimate rises to more than $257,000 over five years.\\n\\nComplicating matters is the education levels of recently admitted refugees has plummeted, according to data analyzed by CIS. In 1996, only 35 percent of incoming refugees lacked a high school diploma. By 2015, the number had skyrocketed to 51 percent. The low educational attainment levels help explain why 56 percent of refugee households received food stamps or other government benefits in 2015.\\n\\nDespite the murky economic picture, Bloomberg is not only promising to accept more refugees, but he's also lashing out at those who disagree. Last month, during a campaign swing through Texas, the former mayor attacked Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX) for his decision to halt refugee resettlement.\\n\\nThis is America. We shouldn't be doing this, the former mayor told The Dallas Morning News at the time. It's not good for Texas. It's not good for America.\\n\\nIt's certainly not good for the people who are trying to get here, Bloomberg added, before claiming America was too wealthy to deny refugees."}
{"original": "President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan responded vigorously to a speech this week by Chinese Communist Party chief Xi Jinping announcing that China would no longer tolerate Taiwan's sovereignty, urging Xi to bravely move towards democracy and face the reality of the existence of the Republic of China.\\n\\nIn his speech on Tuesday, Xi called Taiwanese independence a dead end and warned that, in 2019, China would no longer accept the status quo.\\n\\nWe make no promise to abandon the use of force, and retain the option of taking all necessary measures, he warned.\\n\\nTsai, speaking on Wednesday, responded by lamenting that China has consistently rejected the democratic values that, according to her, define the national identity of Taiwan and condemned China for spending much of 2018 attempting to bribe Taiwan's allies away from recognizing the nation's sovereignty.\\n\\nDemocratic values are the values and way of life that Taiwanese cherish, and we call upon China to bravely move towards democracy, Tsai declared. This is the only way they can truly understand Taiwanese people's ideas and commitments.\\n\\nTsai called on China to face the reality of the existence of the Republic of China (Taiwan), and not deny the democratic system that the people of Taiwan have established together. She insisted that Taiwan absolutely will not accept 'one country, two systems,' the policy in place for Hong Kong, which nominally allows Hong Kong to remain democratic but technically deprives it of sovereignty. Xi's regime has increasingly crippled Hong Kong's ability to govern itself under one country, two systems by banning political candidates anathema to the Communist Party's interest from running for office.\\n\\nTsai also implied that China's behavior towards Taiwan, particularly since she took over as president in 2016, had brought it international embarrassment. I want to remind the Beijing authorities that a superpower must act with the demeanor and take the responsibility of a superpower, she noted, and international society is watching China to see if it can make changes and become a trustworthy partner.\\n\\nPressuring international corporations to change their designation for Taiwan won't bring about a spiritual union, nor will buying off Taiwan's diplomatic allies or circling Taiwan with military aircraft and naval vessels, Tsai concluded.\\n\\nThe latter remark referred to China's policy of using sharp power, or economic intimidation, to force international corporations to accept its worldview. Throughout 2018, companies such as Ikea, American Airlines, and Marriott faced the brunt of sharp power, forced to choose between identifying Taiwan as a country in their legal papers, websites, and drop-down menus or losing access to the massive Chinese market. Three major airlines in the United States ultimately changed their fight booking options to stop identifying Taiwan as a country even as the U.S. government dismissed China's bullying as nonsense and urged them not to do so. Marriott, in one notable instance, fired a social media manager for liking a Twitter post by a group called Friends of Tibet, which opposes communism.\\n\\nChina has also used its Belt and Road initiative (BRI, or One Belt, One Road) to offer high-interest loans to nations that maintain friendly relations with Taiwan, notably in Latin America. Nations like the Dominican Republic and El Salvador announced last year they no longer recognized Taiwan's sovereignty after lucrative business meetings with Beijing's representatives. An enraged Tsai warned the world in August that China's increasingly out of control behavior was not only a threat to cross-strait peace … [but] caused high levels of global instability.\\n\\nTsai's speech on Wednesday followed new year's remarks from Xi Jinping warning that 2019 would be the last year China would tolerate Taiwan's existence.\\n\\nReunification is a historical trend and it is the right path. Taiwan independence is an adverse current of history and is a dead end, Xi announced. The issue of Taiwan is part of China's domestic politics. It is a core interest of China, and the … feelings of the Chinese people, and foreign interference is intolerable.\\n\\nHe added that Chinese officials make no promise to abandon the use of force to end Taiwan's independence.\\n\\nAsked about the aggressive remarks on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang claimed to reporters that Xi was not speaking for China, but for the world.\\n\\nXi made it very clear in his speech that adherence to the one-China principle is a consensus shared by the international community, Lu said. The international community generally understands and supports the just cause of the Chinese people in opposing 'Taiwan independence' separatist activities and realizing national reunification.\\n\\nWe make no promise to renounce the use of force. This does not target compatriots in Taiwan, but the interference of external forces and the very small number of 'Taiwan independence' separatists and their activities, he added, likely alluding to the United States as an external force against Beijing's interests on the matter.\\n\\nThe threat of use of force is not new for Xi's regime. In October, Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe said during remarks to the press that if someone tries to separate out Taiwan, China's military will take the necessary actions at any cost. Two months later, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) reportedly deployed a significantly larger fleet of naval vessels to the Taiwan Strait, presumably to surround Taiwan's military and intimidate U.S. ships in the area. The Chinese Foreign Ministry argued this was necessary because a U.S. Navy ship had traveled through the sovereign Vietnamese waters in the South China Sea, which China has illegally claimed for itself.\\n\\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."}

{"original": "This month marks the 50th anniversary of one of the most destructive books of the last century, The Population Bomb, by Paul Ehrlich.\\n\\nThe 1968 doomsday bestseller generated hysteria over the future of the world and the earth's waning ability to sustain human life, as Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich offered a series of alarming predictions that turned out to be spectacularly wrong, creating the enduring myth of unsustainable population growth.\\n\\nEhrlich prophesied that hundreds of millions would starve to death in the 1970s (and that 65 million of them would be Americans), that already-overpopulated India was doomed, and that most probably England will not exist in the year 2000.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Ehrlich warned that sometime in the next 15 years, the end will come, meaning an utter breakdown of the capacity of the planet to support humanity.\\n\\nIf these musings had been received for what they actually were—the wacky theories of a crackpot academic—all would have been well. But The Population Bomb sold some 3 million copies and influenced an entire generation.\\n\\nIdeas have practical consequences, and Dr. Ehrlich did not leave his followers guessing as to what they ought to be.\\n\\nIn the course of his illustrious career, Ehrlich has defended mass sterilization, sex-selective abortion, and infanticide. In his call for radical population control, Ehrlich has said he would prefer voluntary methods but if people were unwilling to cooperate, he was ready to endorse various forms of coercion.\\n\\nTo allow women to have as many children as they want, Ehrlich said, is like letting people throw as much of their garbage into their neighbor's backyard as they want.\\n\\nThose who had the coercive power to put Ehrlich's theories into practice bear witness to just how horrifying they were.\\n\\nTo reduce its population, China instituting a draconian one-child policy, which has now left the country (through sex-selective abortions) with a horrific gender imbalance, with yearly births of some 120 boys born for every 100 girls. As a result, 30 million more men than women will reach adulthood and enter China's mating market by 2020.\\n\\nMany nations—including the United States—began attaching population control measures to aid packages to third-world countries, meaning that the amount of aid received became conditioned by the state's ability to coercively reduce its own population.\\n\\nThe tragic fact is that as a credentialed scientist—a biologist lecturing at Stanford University—Ehrlich's proclamation of the end times as well as the means to confront them struck many as the plausible theory of an expert.\\n\\nAs Bill McGurn argues in the Wall Street Journal Monday, in his day, Dr. Ehrlich's assertion about the limited 'carrying capacity' of the Earth was settled science. Never mind that it is rooted in an absurdity: that when a calf is born a country's wealth rises, but when a baby is born it goes down.\\n\\nA few brave souls resisted the urge to jump on the population explosion bandwagon, urging calm and rationality. One was economist Julian L. Simon, who later noted that whatever the rate of population growth is, historically it has been that the food supply increases at least as fast, if not faster.\\n\\nIn 1981, Simon published The Ultimate Resource, underscoring man's ability to adapt to new circumstances and overcome obstacles through ingenuity and creativity. It is the human mind, rather than coal, trees, or iron, that is the ultimate resource—one that suffers no risk of depletion.\\n\\nAnother population expert, Fred Pearce, has more recently noted that birthrates are now below long-term replacement levels nearly everywhere, a trend he examined in his 2010 book, The Coming Population Crash and Our Planet's Surprising Future.\\n\\nThe baffling mystery is how Ehrlich—despite his utterly failed forecasts—can continue to be hailed today as a serious scientist with something important to say to the world.\\n\\nIn early 2017, the Vatican invited Dr. Ehrlich to speak at an academic conference titled 'Biological Extinction, sponsored jointly by the Pontifical Academy of Science and the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences.\\n\\nThe conference addressed issues of biodiversity, great extinctions of history, population and demographics, and Ehrlich was invited to speak on Causes and Pathways of Biodiversity Losses: Consumption Preferences, Population Numbers, Technology, Ecosystem Productivity.\\n\\nThe enduring power of alarmist theories such as Ehrlich's, which somehow survive being exposed as utterly false, should give people pause before embracing similar theories and their practical corollaries, even when based on settled science.\\n\\nIn a 2015 article, The New York Times observed that worrying about an overcrowded planet has fallen off the international agenda and has now been replaced by climate change and related concerns.\\n\\nWhile perhaps failing to observe the irony of its own reporting, the Times juxtaposed the thoroughly discredited population explosion theories of the 1970s with the (equally alarmist) global warming predictions of our day.\\n\\nAs scientists themselves are beginning to recognize, doomsday theories—including those surrounding global warming—must learn to factor in the astounding resilience of human intelligence and the ability of human beings to react to changing scenarios in remarkably ingenious ways.\\n\\nFollow Thomas D.

In total, 50,000 images of human body parts were scrutinized by humans who then annotated more than 5 million data points which provided the training data for the network, The Next Web reported. Once the system understood how humans see other humans, it was ready to train its 'learner' how to see people the same way.\\n\\nThe end result is an AI that uses a 2D RGB image as input and applies it to any number of humans in a video, they explained. Instead of putting a celebrity's face on someone else's body, you could change the way people look in a video as if editing a Minecraft skin.\\n\\nThough the Next Web notes that there have been other 2D image-mapping neural networks, this one is the first to put it all together in real-time and effectively 'connect the dots' without a depth sensor, and the team behind DensePose want to use the technology to replace character modeling in video games.\\n\\nThe technology is similar to that used in deepfakes videos, where the faces of popular celebrities are mapped onto the bodies of porn stars in videos using A.I. to create fake, but realistic celebrity porn.\\n\\nPornhub and other websites recently banned deepfakes videos, which portrayed celebrities including Gal Gadot, Emma Watson, Scarlett Johansson, Maisie Williams, and Aubrey Plaza in explicit scenarios.\\n\\nI just found a clever way to do face-swap, declared the programmer behind many deepfakes videos in an interview last year.

{"original": "The new superior of the worldwide Jesuit religious order said recently that, as Jesus Christ's words about marriage were never recorded, there is no basis for a black and white church doctrine centering on lifelong marriage between one man and one woman.\\n\\nIn a recent interview with Vatican journalist Giuseppe Rusconi of the Italian Catholic blog Rossoporpora , Father Arturo Sosa Abascal states that Jesus's words about marriage must be contextualized and discerned.\\n\\nHuman reality is much more nuanced and never black and white, said Abascal, who was elected superior of the Society of Jesus in October.\\n\\nLifeSiteNews has published the translation of the interview – which included the topic of remarriage following divorce. Abascal, who is from Venezuela, was asked by Rusconi about Jesus's teaching regarding marriage as provided in the Gospel of Matthew:\\n\\nHe said to them, Have you not read that He Who made them in the first place made them man and woman? 5 It says, 'For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and will live with his wife. The two will become one.' 6 So they are no longer two but one. Let no man divide what God has put together.\\n\\nRusconi stated to Abascal that the prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith, Cardinal Gerhard Műller, observed the words of Jesus were clear, and that no power in heaven and on earth, neither an angel nor the pope, neither a council nor a law of the bishops has the faculty to modify them.\\n\\nAt that time, no one had a recorder to take down his words, the Jesuit superior responded. What is known is that the words of Jesus must be contextualized, they are expressed in a language, in a specific setting, they are addressed to someone in particular.\\n\\nAsked whether the words of Jesus, then, have an absolute value, Abascal replied:\\n\\nOver the last century in the Church there has been a great blossoming of studies that seek to understand exactly what Jesus meant to say… That is not relativism, but attests that the word is relative, the Gospel is written by human beings, it is accepted by the Church which is made up of human persons… So it is true that no one can change the word of Jesus, but one must know what it was!\\n\\nAsked whether he is questioning Jesus's words, Abascal said he agrees with Pope Francis – also a Jesuit. One does not bring into doubt, one brings into discernment… the superior said.\\n\\nRusconi replied that, with discernment, the final decision is based on a judgment relative to different hypotheses, and, thus, brings the word of Jesus into doubt. Abascal responded that he did not mean, the word of Jesus, but the word of Jesus as we have interpreted it… Discernment leads to a decision: one must not only evaluate, but decide.\\n\\nThe Jesuit superior continued that the Church has always made personal conscience a priority.\\n\\nDoctrine is a word that I don't like very much, it brings with it the image of the hardness of stone, Abascal said.

That is the terrifying new threat to freedom that western societies must now contend with.\\n\\nFinancial blacklisting doesn't just rob you of a chance to spread your message: it robs you of your ability to do business, your livelihood, your very means of functioning in a capitalist society. Thanks to the encroachment of progressive ideology into the financial industry — including major credit card companies like Visa, Discover, and Mastercard — it has now become a reality.\\n\\nI first wrote about the rise of financial blacklisting in July, in a column for Breitbart News in which I highlighted the growing tendency of online financial platforms — as well as Visa and MasterCard — to deny service to customers for political reasons. I was surprised to receive a strongly worded comment from the liberal Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), who bluntly warned that banks and credit card companies had become de facto internet censors. That even liberal groups had raised the alarm signaled the seriousness of the problem.\\n\\nSince then, financial blacklisting has only gotten worse. In August, Mastercard and Discover deplatformed conservative and Islam critic Robert Spencer. In the same month, Visa and Mastercard ceased service to David Horowitz. While credit card processing service to Horowitz was eventually restored, Spencer remains financially blacklisted.\\n\\nCrowdfunding platforms like Patreon, which allow online content creators to collect donations from their supporters, are frequently cast as the primary villains in financial blacklisting. Patreon's recent ban of YouTuber Carl Benjamin, better known by his moniker Sargon of Akkad, triggered a crisis for the platform. Both donors and creators — including prominent atheist Sam Harris — quit the platform in protest, while Jordan Peterson and Dave Rubin pledged to create an alternative platform that is pro-free speech.\\n\\nBut Patreon and other crowdfunding platforms are not the real villains. They are dependent on the whims of the credit card companies, something that was already apparent in August when Mastercard forced them to withdraw service from Robert Spencer. We now know that the credit card companies were also a factor in Patreon's decision to boot Benjamin.\\n\\nYouTuber and Patreon creator Matt Christiansen recently released a transcript of his conversation with Jacqueline Hart of Patreon about Benjamin's ban. Hart frankly admits that the sensibilities of credit card companies play a key role in Patreon's decisions.\\n\\nHere's an excerpt of that transcript (emphasis ours):\\n\\nJACQUELINE: The problem is is Patreon takes payments. And while we are obviously supportive of the first amendment, there are other things that we have to consider. Our mission is to fund the creative class. In order to accomplish that mission we have to build a community of creators that are comfortable sharing a platform, and if we allow certain types of speech that some people would call free speech, then only creators that use Patreon that don't mind their branding associated with that kind of speech would be those who use Patreon and we fail at our mission. But secondly as a membership platform, payment processing is one of the core value propositions that we have. Payment processing depends on our ability to use the global payment network, and they have rules for what they will process. MATT: Are you telling me that this was Patreon's decision then, or someone pressured you into this? JACQUELINE: No – this was entirely Patreon's decision. MATT: Well then I don't understand passing the buck off to somebody else. JACQUELINE: No, I'm not passing the buck off. The thing is we have guidelines, but I'm trying to explain, #1 it is our mission to fund the creative class and obviously some people may not want to be associated. MATT: Well if it's your mission, then payment processors are irrelevant. It's your mission. That's what you're pursuing. JACQUELINE: We're not visa and mastercard ourselves – we can't just make the rules. That's what I'm saying – there is an extra layer there.\\n\\nThis extra layer places platforms like Patreon in an impossible position: abandon free speech or lose your ability to process payments. That's also why so many free-speech alternatives to Patreon have failed: FreeStartr, Hatreon, MakerSupport, and SubscribeStar all tried to offer a more open platform, and were promptly dumped by the credit card companies. All are unable to do business.\\n\\nThis exposes the emptiness of establishment conservative arguments about the free market. Those who oppose Silicon Valley censorship aren't allowed to just build their own alternative platforms. They must build their own global payment processing infrastructure to have any hope of restoring free speech online.\\n\\nThat, or they must find a way to stop Visa, Mastercard and Discover from taking advice from the far-left Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) and Color of Change. The former was allegedly responsible for the blacklisting of Robert Spencer, while the latter claims to have removed 158 funding sources from white supremacist sites — although as the group won't list what those sites are, we don't know if they really are white supremacist. The far left typically includes regular Trump supporters under the label.\\n\\nAnother thing the credit card companies will have to avoid — listening to the New York Times, which is currently pressuring them to blacklist gun purchasers.\\n\\nThe only other option is to find an alternative to Visa, MasterCard, and Discover that is indifferent about American social justice politics. There's only one card which has a similar level of global coverage — China's UnionPay. It remains to be seen if a company at the whim of Chinese Communists is better than Visa, Discover, and Mastercard — all of which currently appear to be at the whim of American communists.\\n\\nVisa, Mastercard, Discover and Patreon did not return requests for comment.\\n\\nAllum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.

{"original": "AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas was tired of waiting for Tom Herman to deliver a Big 12 title and turn the Longhorns back into national championship contenders.\\n\\nNext up: Steve Sarkisian, the architect of the Alabama Crimson Tide's offense and its tsunami of points this season.\\n\\nTexas fired Herman on Saturday after four winning seasons, then hours later announced it was giving the job to the Alabama offensive coordinator.\\n\\nIt's a quick move Texas expects will deliver quick results. The Longhorns are not known to be a patient bunch.\\n\\nI think there's championship talent on this team. Clearly, there's work to be done or a change wouldn't be made, Sarkisian said.\\n\\nSarkisian leads a Crimson Tide offense that has pummeled opponents and produced two Heisman Trophy finalists in quarterback Mac Jones and receiver DeVonta Smith heading into the Jan. 11 College Football Playoff championship game against Ohio State. He recently won the Broyles Award given to college football's top assistant coach.\\n\\nHe's also been around. At 46, Sarkisian has previous head coaching stints at Washington and Southern California. He's been Alabama's offensive coordinator under Nick Saban since 2019, and has experience as an NFL assistant.\\n\\nSarkisian will remain with Alabama for the championship game.\\n\\nCoach Saban wants to win a national championship, so he didn't push me out the door, Sarkisian said.\\n\\nTexas wants Sarkisian to not just win — Herman did that with a 32-18 record and four bowl victories — but to knock rival Oklahoma off the top of the Big 12 while also making sure recruiting in their home state doesn't get swamped by Texas A&M's rise in the Southeastern Conference.\\n\\nHe will be Texas' fourth head coach since the program's last Big 12 championship in 2009. Since then, Texas has fired Mack Brown — the only coach to lead the program to a national championship (2005) in 50 years — Charlie Strong and Herman. Of note, Sarkisian was a USC assistant when Texas beat the Trojans for the national championship in the epic 2006 Rose Bowl.\\n\\nIt's amazing to think here we are 15 years removed from me standing on the opposite sideline of Vince Young running into the end zone at the Rose Bowl, (to) me being the head coach at Texas, Sarkisian said.\\n\\nSarkisian was 46-35 overall at Washington and USC, but was fired midway through his second season with the Trojans 2015 and went into alcohol rehabilitation treatment. He later lost a $30 million breach of contract and disability discrimination lawsuit against USC that alleged the school fired him instead of allowing him to seek treatment.\\n\\nSarkisian said he's grown as a person since then and is ready to step back into the spotlight at Texas.\\n\\nI'm proud of the work that I've done (in treatment). But I will say when you battle what I battle, you have to work on it every day, he said.\\n\\nTexas did not immediately release contract terms for Sarkisian. Herman still had three years left on a guaranteed contract set to pay him more than $6 million per year. Texas is on the hook for more than $20 million in buyouts for Herman and his staff.\\n\\nTexas fired Herman just three weeks after athletic director Chris Del Conte said he would remain the coach. In a new statement Saturday, Del Conte said he'd since decided it was time for a change.\\n\\nTexas President Jay Hartzell said Texas first began talks with Sarkisian a couple of weeks earlier and that a deal was reached Saturday morning.\\n\\nI can't wait to see what the team accomplishes under his leadership, Hartzell said.\\n\\nHerman's best season was 2018, the only time he got the Longhorns to the Big 12 title game. They finished that season with a dominating win over Georgia in the Sugar Bowl that prompted quarterback Sam Ehlinger's now-infamous We're ba-aack! statement to a national television audience.\\n\\nTexas instead sunk back to the middle of the pack in the Big 12. The Longhorns reached as high as No. 8 early in the pandemic-stricken 2020 season before quickly fading. They were, in effect, eliminated from the Big 12 title game with a 23-20 home loss to Iowa State with two games left.\\n\\nFrustrated by the stagnation, Texas also saw ominous signs in recruiting. Several of the state's top players signed elsewhere or backed off commitments last month.\\n\\nHerman, 45, had seemed like the can't-miss coach to return Texas to glory when he was hired after two successful seasons at Houston. Yet there were moments that suggested he just wasn't ready for a job as big as Texas and struggled to grow into it.\\n\\nHe taunted the Missouri quarterback in the waning minutes of a Texas Bowl win in 2017. He had a fiery confrontation with Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy after a tough road loss. In 2019, he head-butted his own players before a game, then flipped a double-barreled obscene hand gesture toward television cameras during live broadcast of national signing day.\\n\\nAnd 2020 challenged him in ways that had nothing to do with football.\\n\\nWhen protests erupted nationally erupted after the death of George Floyd, Herman joined his players in a march from campus to the state Capitol in a demonstration against police brutality and and racial injustice.\\n\\nHerman then faced intense criticism from fans, and pressure from the administration, when the players didn't join the traditional postgame singing of The Eyes of Texas school song for several games in protest over racist elements of the song's past."}

His remarks strongly implied the mission had something to do with North Korea.\\n\\nWith tensions growing over North Korea, the Self-Defense Forces carried out a mission to protect U.S. vessels and aircraft for the first time, Abe said.\\n\\nAn alliance gets stronger if the partners can help each other.

The U.S. military was no more forthcoming.\\n\\nWithout much to go on, Stars and Stripes theorized Abe might have been alluding to a mission last spring where a Japanese helicopter carrier escorted a U.S. Navy vessel to resupply one of the warships protecting Japan from North Korean missiles. That seems a bit less remarkable than what the prime minister alluded to, or perhaps that mission was more exciting than previously reported.\\n\\nOne reason Abe addressed the Diet on this subject is that laws allowing Japanese self-defense forces to protect Americans and other allied forces only went into effect last March. Before that, it was only legal for Japan to defend allies ships, planes, or ground forces if Japan itself was also under attack.\\n\\nThere was considerable unhappiness among the Japanese public that Abe implemented this policy change, and perhaps more importantly, policy changes that allow Japan to deploy its forces overseas, without amending the national constitution. Abe has long expressed a desire to reform the pacifist constitution but felt the urgency of the North Korean threat called for some changes to be implemented more quickly.\\n\\nJapan may take some comfort from the Pentagon's report this week that American defenses against potential North Korean missile attack have improved. The report's optimism was buoyed by what it described as a nearly flawless test intercept in May of the most realistic ICBM target missile employed to date. However, critics still believe testing has not adequately simulated the difficulty of taking out a live weapon employing defensive countermeasures."}

{"original": "President Donald Trump ordered the Treasury Department on Friday to examine two controversial powers given to financial regulators in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, including a bailout authority widely favored by the biggest banks.\\n\\nOne of the memos Trump signed Friday takes aim at the Orderly liquidation authority or OLA, which authorizes the federal government to take over and wind down a failing financial firm. It instructs Treasury to examine whether OLA encourages excessive risk-taking or exposes taxpayers to liability. It also orders Treasury not to use OLAA while the review is underway.\\n\\nOLA has been a target of conservative critics for years, largely because it permits federal regulators to attempt to deal with a failing financial firm outside of ordinary bankruptcy procedures. If regulators conclude that bankruptcy would cause serious financial disruption, they can invoke OLA to take over the failed firm and use taxpayer funds to keep it operating until it can be wound down in an orderly manner. Critics say this creates an implicit safety net for too-big-to-fail financial firms, creating moral hazard and encouraging excessive risk-taking.\\n\\nNot surprisingly, OLA is one of the regulatory powers created by Dodd-Frank that the big Wall Street firms actually would rather keep in place. Because OLA would likely cushion the impact of a big bank's failure on creditors and counterparties, it reduces the cost funding for the big banks. It may also give the biggest firms a competitive advantage over smaller competitors whose customers, counterparties, and creditors would still have to worry about the prospects of a formal bankruptcy.\\n\\nTrade groups representing banks and other large financial institutions have lobbied against the repeal of OLA. In February, the chief executive of the Financial Services Roundtable told the Wall Street Journal that the trade group did not believe changes needed to be made to OLA.\\n\\nRepealing OLA would create $15.2 billion in budget savings over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Those savings could be used to pay for other Trump administration priorities, such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending. This also means that OLA could likely be repealed through the budget reconciliation process, making it immune to filibusters.\\n\\nThe second memo temporarily bars regulators from designating new non-bank financial companies as systemically important financial institutions or SIFIs. It orders a review of the process used to make these designations, which was harshly criticized by a federal judge last year. Regulators have designated the insurers American International Group, Prudential Financial, and MetLife as SIFIs, although MetLife won relief from the designation last year when a court decided that the process used to make the designation was arbitrary and opaque.\\n\\nCritics of the rule charge that in addition to the problems with the designation process, the SIFI label may also create an implicit safety net for companies–the impression that they would be rescued in the case of failure. While the insurers and other non-bank financial companies would likely benefit from having the risk of SIFI designation–and the added regulatory burdens that come with it–lifted, this isn't a change that has been sought after by the big banks that automatically qualify as SIFIs."}
{"original": "French President Emmanuel Macron used his New Year's televised address to lash out at the populist Yellow Vest protestors who have taken to the streets through November and December to oppose his globalist policies, accusing them of anti-Semitism and other defects.\\n\\nSpeaking after a year which has seen his approval ratings plunge to new and historic lows and even the President placing a helicopter on standby to escape angry protesters, Emmanuel Macron defied expectations on New Year's Eve to deliver a speech that was combative and unapologetic. The address came as a significant change of tone from just when weeks before when he attempted to defang the Yellow Vest protests by promising policy changes.\\n\\nInstead of speaking of a united France as he did last year, Macron attacked his detractors, who have taken to the streets in weekly protests over two months to demand his resignation.

{"original": "Former Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday mockingly imitated a journalist for repeatedly asking him about his brewing feud with presidential rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) following a campaign event in Mason City, Iowa.\\n\\nThe incident began when CBS reporter Ed O'Keefe asked Biden why he attacked Sanders after accepting his apology for an unofficial surrogate's blistering op-ed slamming him as a deeply flawed candidate with a corruption issue. When O'Keefe asked why the senator's apology wasn't sufficient, Biden turned around and replied: why, why, why, why, why, why, why!?\\n\\nYou're getting nervous, man, the former vice president continued. Calm down, it's okay.\\n\\nBiden then explained that Sanders only apologized for being accused of corruption and refused to correct about whether he supported cuts to Social Security. After the 2020 Democrat frontrunner finished his answer, he gently thumped his fist on the reporter's chest and walked away.\\n\\nOn Tuesday evening, Sanders tweeted: Let's be honest, Joe. One of us fought for decades to cut Social Security, and one of us didn't. But don't take it from me. Take it from you.\\n\\nLet's be honest, Joe. One of us fought for decades to cut Social Security, and one of us didn't. But don't take it from me. Take it from you. pic.twitter.com/qh7qb1Hmcl — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) January 22, 2020\\n\\nThe tweet featured a video clip of Biden, then a senator from Deleware, making a speech on the upper chamber floor's in 1995, saying: When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans' benefits. I meant every single solitary thing in the government. And I not only tried it once — I tried it twice. I tried it a third time, and I tried it a fourth time.\\n\\nThe video seemingly came in response to Biden declaring earlier Tuesday at a campaign event that he won't make any cuts to social security if elected to the White House.\\n\\nIn response to Sanders' video, Biden wrote on Twitter: I've been fighting to protect — and expand — Social Security for my whole career. Any suggestion otherwise is just flat-out wrong. Bernie's negative attacks won't change the truth: Joe Biden is still the strongest Democrat to beat Donald Trump.\\n\\nThe latest barbed exchange comes after Biden accused the Sanders campaign of spreading a doctored 2012 video of him, in which it appears the former vice president says he supports then-Rep. Paul Ryan's plan to cut social security. The Biden campaign has argued that the remarks were sarcastic.\\n\\nBut it is simply a lie, that video that is going around, and ask anybody in the press, it's a flat lie. They've acknowledged that this is a doctored tape, Biden said. And I think it's beneath him, and I'm looking for his campaign to come forward and disown it, but they haven't done it yet.\\n\\nOn Sunday, Sanders issued a statement to CBS News about the incident, but did not apologize for the video. [Joe] is a decent person. He is a friend of mine. People like him. And we're not going to make personal attacks on Joe Biden but I think the record shows that Joe's history in the Senate and my history in Congress are very different, he said."}
{"original": "Now that Trump has finally turned to the campaign promise that won him the election — build a wall and deport illegals — the Democrats, the media and even most Republicans are hysterical.\\n\\nJust remember: They were hysterical about Ronald Reagan, too. You don't change history by being a follower, particularly if the people you're following are unimaginative, go-with-the-flow company men.\\n\\nWhen President Reagan implemented the strategy that won the Cold War, he was opposed by the entire media, as well as foreign policy experts in both parties.\\n\\nThe New York Times and Washington Post produced nonstop denunciations of his dangerous policies. There were propaganda movies like The Day After, terrifying Americans about a Soviet strike on our country. Witless college students demanded cyanide pills be stocked in campus health care clinics, on the grounds that Reagan was going to get us all nuked.\\n\\nOnly after Reagan's policies succeeded did these same hysterics say, Ho hum, no big deal. We always knew the Soviet Union was a paper tiger. New\\n\\nFrantically rewriting history, they claimed Reagan had merely continued the policies of his predecessors. The truth about their eight-year primal scream is helpfully assembled in my smash best-seller, Treason.\\n\\nThe Democrats, the media and most of the Republican Party are as fanatically opposed to Trump's ideas about illegal immigration as they were to Reagan's ideas about winning the Cold War.\\n\\nLike Reagan, Trump has only the people on his side. Unlike Reagan, he doesn't seem as confident that he is right.\\n\\nSo the people need to be louder.\\n\\nAll we're getting from the media on immigration is an avalanche of lies, neurotically repeated by people citing one another:\\n\\nPolls show Americans don't want a wall!\\n\\nWe're a nation of immigrants!\\n\\nImmigrants commit less crime than the native born!\\n\\nStudies show: Black Americans are NOT hurt by illegal immigration.\\n\\nEvery one of these claims is a lie, as demonstrated in my book Adios, America!\\n\\nPeople assume a minimal standard of decency in others and think to themselves, Well, Joe Scarborough wouldn't say that if it weren't true.\\n\\nWhat viewers don't understand is how lazy media personalities are. They are merely quoting what someone told them. They don't know. Their expertise consists of memorizing a set of talking points, like ABBA memorizing the syllables to English words without knowing what they meant.\\n\\nIf journalists allowed follow-up questions and you could ask, How do you know that? The answer would be, I heard it from a guy at Vox.\\n\\nThe media go to extremely biased sources; they know nothing, so they're not in a position to challenge them; and even if they were, they wouldn't, because they're on the same team.\\n\\nAfter a New York Times reporter tracked me down for a quote about the wall, I gave him the following, but he chose not to run it. Why should the Newspaper of Record present the opposition's side honestly?\\n\\nThere are a million reasons we want a wall, but here are five:\\n\\n1) The Simpson-Mazzoli Act — passed almost 30 years ago to the day Trump was elected president — came with elaborate promises that it would put an end to illegal immigration. In fact, 30 to 40 million more illegals have poured into our country since then.\\n\\n2) Notwithstanding the vast number of illegal alien valedictorians, there are also criminals, drunk drivers, drug cartel members and desperately poor people consuming government services meant for the least among us and driving down the wages of our working class.\\n\\n3) We need a better method.\\n\\n4) Walls work. See Israel.\\n\\n5) If we don't get it done now, we never will. Trump is our last chance.\\n\\nBut instead of explaining to the Times' readers why Trump's promise to build a wall shook the political world to its foundation, the newspaper trotted out campaign adviser Sam Nunberg's boast that he invented build the wall because Trump's mind tends to wander. It was only a dumb talking point, you see, not a serious campaign pledge.\\n\\nThis is like claiming you were the guy who invented carrying an umbrella when it rains. I'm sorry, Sam, but you're not getting royalties for that.\\n\\nBuilding a wall is kind of an obvious idea for protecting a border. Not only have walls been used from time immemorial to defend borders, but those precise three words have been used to describe what should happen at our specific border thousands of times before Trump used them, according to a quick Nexis search.\\n\\nThe current DNC talking point against a wall is that it is a medieval solution to a 21st-century problem! Turn on MSNBC or CNN right now, and you'll hear someone saying it.\\n\\nSo are wheels. Are Democrats taking tires off their cars?\\n\\nA roof is a medieval solution. How about Nancy Pelosi replace the one over her house with new technology — like a drone! Drones won't keep anything out, but at least she can see what's coming in seconds before it drops on her head.\\n\\nMedievalism: 1; Pelosi: 0."}

{"original": "The Pentagon and CIA do not believe Russia will honor the ceasefire agreement in Syria arrived at this week, according to sources speaking to The Wall Street Journal.\\n\\nOfficials want to apply more pressure on Moscow to make sure they keep their end of the bargain. The Wall Street Journal reports that Defense Secretary Ash Carter, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, and CIA Director John Brennan all have indicated they want to inflict real pain on the Russians should they break the ceasefire.\\n\\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal:\\n\\nThe emerging alliance of Russia hawks exposes discord among defense and diplomatic officials and could put pressure on Mr. Obama to take stronger action against Moscow. But doing so risks pulling the U.S. deeper into a proxy fight in Syria, with Moscow showing little sign of lessening its support for President Bashar al-Assad. The Syrian government said Tuesday it accepted the proposed cease-fire, announced a day earlier by the U.S. and Russia. But it said military operations would continue not only against Islamic State and the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front—both designated by the United Nations as terrorist organizations—but against other terrorist groups connected to them as well.\\n\\nSecretary of State John Kerry declared at the time:\\n\\nIf implemented and adhered to, this cessation will not only lead to a decline in violence, but also continue to expand the delivery of urgently needed humanitarian supplies to besieged areas and support a political transition to a government that is responsive to the desires of the Syrian people.\\n\\nSpokespeople for the Pentagon, CIA, and Gen. Dunford did not reply for comment.\\n\\nWe'll judge Russia by its actions, not its words, one senior administration official told The Wall Street Journal, adding:\\n\\nTo be clear: Our actions are not aimed at Russia. Our focus, however, does not change the fact that Russia, by increasingly involving itself in a vicious conflict on the side of a brutal dictator, will become enmeshed in a quagmire. Should it not change course, Russia's fate will be self-inflicted.\\n\\nThe three men voiced these concerns during meetings with Secretary Kerry. The official told the Journal that the agreement was partially intended to test whether Moscow can be trusted. If they violate the agreement, the official said, Plan-B thinking needs to occur.\\n\\nRussia began airstrikes in Syria on September 30, only a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin met with President Barack Obama. The Defense Ministry insisted their forces only targeted areas occupied by the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL), but the strikes occurred in areas with no known Islamic State presence, most populated by rebel groups opposing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. CNN reports:\\n\\nA senior U.S. defense official told CNN the Pentagon was taken aback by Russia's actions. Our presidents just talked about setting up de-confliction talks and now they just go ahead and do this? They cannot be trusted. A second U.S. official said: This is not how military relations are conducted, by banging on the door of our embassy and reading a note.\\n\\nResidents in Syria echoed the same worries as American officials. The two countries agreed weeks ago to a ceasefire that never took hold. Syrian residents reported no evidence the bombing ever stopped. Some told The New York Times that officials prevented them from re-entering Syria when they escaped to Turkey.\\n\\nThe deals they make there are so isolated and detached from this reality here, cried Faisal, 25, who only provided a first name.\\n\\nThe Times also spoke with moderate groups supported by the U.S., who dismissed the cease-fire plan as naïve and fanciful. They expected Russia to continue bombing any opposition against Assad since the agreement allowed bombing against Islamic State and Nusra Front.\\n\\nRussia will continue bombing Nusra and Daesh [ISIS], stated fighter Yusef Farrouh. And we know what Russia means by 'Nusra' and 'Daesh' — us. If we thought Russia was bombing Nusra clearly and specifically, we would have moved away from them."}

The drone broke and the author took to Amazon to purchase a new one, sorting search results by average customer review, believing that this would show him the most high-quality toy drones.\\n\\nInstead, he found a number of drones with extremely high star ratings that were filled with fake reviews. Many of the reviews were clearly not related to the product at all, with one drone review stating If you're looking to have a taste of Greece without making the journey, this honey does the trick, and another stating that the drone was dark, luxurious pine honey, not too sweet, absolutely fantastic with strained Greek yogurt and extra cream.\\n\\nArs Technica reached out to Amazon about the issue and received a response from a spokesperson, stating: We have clear guidelines about when products should be grouped together and we have guardrails in place to prevent products from being incorrectly grouped, either due to human error or abuse. The detail page in question has been fixed, and we are taking appropriate action on the bad actor.\\n\\nArs Technica writes in their article:\\n\\nAmazon could easily require sellers to provide some basic transparency about these listings—disclosing where these manufacturers are located, how long they've been in business, and which other brands they own. This might make it easier for Amazon to punish companies that try to mislead customers with fake reviews. Major Internet companies often insist that policing their platforms for misinformation is a logistically insurmountable task. This argument has at least superficial plausibility for companies like Facebook and Twitter that have to deal with billions of pieces of content every week. But maintaining minimum standards for Amazon product listings shouldn't be so difficult. Amazon isn't just listing information on its website, it's offering a product for sale and taking a cut of the sale price. In many cases it's warehousing and shipping the physical products. The resulting revenue should give Amazon ample resources to do basic vetting of product listings. Amazon probably can't verify every claim in a product listing, but it shouldn't be hard to detect when someone takes a listing for honey and converts it into a listing for a drone. If it can't be done algorithmically, Amazon can and should hire enough human beings to review every significant change to product listings. It shouldn't be possible for someone to change a listing for honey into a listing for a drone without anyone in Seattle noticing.\\n\\nRead more at Ars Technica here.\\n\\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

{"original": "A Silicon Valley elementary school recently told third-graders to rank themselves according to their power and privilege, whistleblower documents revealed.\\n\\nA third-grade teacher at the R.I. Meyerholz Elementary School in well-to-do Cupertino, California, conducted a lesson on social identities during a math class, Christopher Rufo reported at Manhattan Institute's City Journal.\\n\\nAccording to the report, based on the whistleblower documents and parents' comments, the teacher asked the young children to create an identity map, composed of characteristics such as race, class, gender, religion, and family structure.\\n\\nNext, the teacher taught the children they live in a dominant culture of white, middle class, cisgender, educated, able-bodied, Christian, English speaker[s], with others of privilege who created their culture in order to hold power and stay in power.\\n\\nThe young children then read from the New York Times bestseller, This Book Is Antiracist, only to learn their privilege allows them power over others.\\n\\nRufo reported:\\n\\nAs an example, the reading states that a white, cisgender man, who is able-bodied, heterosexual, considered handsome and speaks English has more privilege than a Black transgender woman. In some cases, because of the principle of intersectionality, there are parts of us that hold some power and other parts that are oppressed, even within a single individual.\\n\\nThe third-graders then deconstructed their own identities and were asked to circle the identities that hold power and privilege on their maps and rank them using the hierarchy they were taught.\\n\\nAdditionally, Rufo noted the children received another related essay assignment of at least one full page of writing describing their powerful and privileged identities.\\n\\nAs an example, the presentation included a short paragraph about transgenderism and nonbinary sexuality, he wrote.\\n\\nParents were reportedly outraged when they discovered the lesson and assignment.\\n\\nWe were shocked, one Asian-American parent told Rufo. They were basically teaching racism to my eight-year-old.\\n\\nThis parent organized others to protest the school's intersectionality curriculum. Eventually, the parents met with Jenn Lashier, the school principal, and demanded the instruction end. According to the report, Lashier ultimately agreed to suspend the curriculum.\\n\\nRufo explained the paradoxical situation:\\n\\nThe irony is that, despite being 94 percent nonwhite, Meyerholz Elementary is one of the most privileged schools in America. The median household income in Cupertino is $172,000, and nearly 80 percent of residents have a bachelor's degree or higher. At the school, where the majority of families are Asian-American, the students have exceptionally high rates of academic achievement and the school consistently ranks in the top 1 percent of all elementary schools statewide. In short, nobody at Meyerholz is oppressed, and the school's high-achieving parents know that teaching intersectionality instead of math is a waste of time—and potentially dangerous.\\n\\nReading from This Book Is Antiracist, the teacher taught the children the theory of intersectionality and claimed that those with privilege have power over others and that folx who do not benefit from their social identities … have little to no privilege and power. pic.twitter.com/GX77Og36Ai — Christopher F. Rufo ⚔️ (@realchrisrufo) January 13, 2021\\n\\nRufo reported one parent noted that Critical Race Theory is a reminder of the Chinese Cultural Revolution in that its goal is to portray society as divided between those who are oppressors and those who are the oppressed. The parent explained:\\n\\n[S]ince these identities are inborn characteristics people cannot change, the only way to change it is via violent revolution. Growing up in China, I had learned it many times. The outcome is the family will be ripped apart; husband hates wife, children hate parents. I think it is already happening here.\\n\\nRufo reported that what has happened in this one elementary school is but an example of what has grown into a larger development of mobilization by West-Coast Asian-Americans against affirmative action.\\n\\nIn October 2019, he reported on Asian-Americans in Washington, organizing to resist the radical leftwing agenda that demands diversity, equity, and inclusion.\\n\\nThe families rebelled against the Democrats' affirmative action laws that actually penalize academically successful Asian-American students by limiting their admissions to the University of Washington system.\\n\\nRufo reported other Asian-Americans in California have been successful in 2020 as well.\\n\\nIn both cases, they defended the principles of meritocracy, individual rights, and equality under the law—and roundly defeated a super-coalition of the states' progressive politicians, activists, universities, media, and corporations, Rufo noted, observing the leftwing mantra of systemic racism and white supremacy has made Asian-Americans an inconvenient minority.\\n\\nAs Breitbart News also reported in November, the North Thurston Public School district in Washington released a statement in its equity report in which officials were forced to apologize for ejecting Asian-American students from their students of color category because they were performing satisfactorily. The report had grouped white and Asian-American students together.\\n\\nAsians are too inconvenient to their narrative. — ALeaf (@yangleicq) November 15, 2020\\n\\nWhile the school district attempted to justify its actions with its intention to make equity-based decisions, after an apparently significant response from the community's Asian-American families, officials apologized for the negative impact we have caused and removed the equity report from the district's website.\\n\\nIn November, a federal appeals court upheld Harvard University's affirmative action policy that had been challenged by a group that alleged the Ivy League school discriminates against Asian-Americans.\\n\\nIlya Shapiro, director of constitutional studies at the Cato Institute, commented to USA Today he was not surprised by the ruling.\\n\\nThe case was always designed to go to the Supreme Court and now it will, he said. It's high time that the justices end the 40-year error of interpreting the Constitution to allow universities that accept public funding to use racial preferences in admissions decisions."}
{"original": "Kirk Douglas, the intense, muscular actor with the dimpled chin who starred in Spartacus, Lust for Life and dozens of other films, helped fatally weaken the blacklist against suspected Communists and reigned for decades as a Hollywood maverick and patriarch, died Wednesday, his family said. He was 103.\\n\\nIt is with tremendous sadness that my brothers and I announce that Kirk Douglas left us today at the age of 103, his son Michael said in a statement on his Instagram account. To the world, he was a legend, an actor from the golden age of movies who lived well into his golden years, a humanitarian whose commitment to justice and the causes he believed in set a standard for all of us to aspire to.\\n\\nKirk Douglas' death was first reported by People magazine.\\n\\nHis granite-like strength and underlying vulnerability made the son of illiterate Russian immigrants one of the top stars of the 20th century. He appeared in more than 80 films, in roles ranging from Doc Holliday in Gunfight at the O.K. Corral to Vincent van Gogh in Lust for Life.\\n\\nHe worked with some of Hollywood's greatest directors, from Vincente Minnelli and Billy Wilder to Stanley Kubrick and Elia Kazan. His career began at the peak of the studios' power, more than 70 years ago, and ended in a more diverse, decentralized era that he helped bring about.\\n\\nAlways competitive, including with his own family, Douglas never received an Academy Award for an individual film, despite being nominated three times — for Champion, The Bad and the Beautiful and Lust for Life.\\n\\nBut in 1996, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded him an honorary Oscar. His other awards included a Presidential Medal of Freedom and a lifetime achievement award from the American Film Institute.\\n\\nHe was a category unto himself, a force for change and symbol of endurance.\\n\\nIn his latter years, he was a final link to a so-called Golden Age, a man nearly as old as the industry itself.\\n\\nIn his youth, he represented a new kind of performer, more independent and adventurous than Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy and other giants of the studio era of the 1930s and 1940s, and more willing to speak his mind.\\n\\nReaching stardom after World War II, he was as likely to play cads (the movie producer in Bad and the Beautiful, the journalist in Ace in the Hole) as he was suited to play heroes, as alert to the business as he was at home before the camera. He started his own production company in 1955, when many actors still depended on the studios, and directed some of his later films.\\n\\nA born fighter, Douglas was especially proud of his role in the the downfall of Hollywood's blacklist, which halted and ruined the careers of writers suspected of pro-Communist activity or sympathies. By the end of the '50s, the use of banned writers was widely known within the industry, but not to the general public.\\n\\nDouglas, who years earlier had reluctantly signed a loyalty oath to get the starring role in Lust for Life, provided a crucial blow when he openly credited the former Communist and Oscar winner Dalton Trumbo for script work on Spartacus, the epic about a slave rebellion during ancient Rome that was released in 1960. (A few months earlier, Otto Preminger had announced Trumbo's name would appear on the credits for Exodus, but Spartacus came out first.)\\n\\nEverybody advised me not to do it because you won't be able to work in this town again and all of that. But I was young enough to say to hell with it, Douglas said about Spartacus in a 2011 interview with The Associated Press. I think if I was much older, I would have been too conservative: 'Why should I stick my neck out?'\\n\\nDouglas rarely played lightly. He was compulsive about preparing for roles and a supreme sufferer on camera, whether stabbed with scissors in Ace in the Hole or crucified in Spartacus.\\n\\nCritic David Thomson dubbed Douglas the manic-depressive among Hollywood stars, one minute bearing down on plot, dialogue and actresses with the gleeful appetite of a man just freed from Siberia, at other times writing not just in agony but mutilation and a convincingly horrible death.\\n\\nDouglas' personal favorite was the 1962 Western Lonely are the Brave, which included a line of dialogue from a Trumbo script he called the most personal he ever spoke on screen: I'm a loner clear down deep to my very guts.\\n\\nThe most famous words in a Douglas movie were spoken about him, but not by him.\\n\\nIn Spartacus, Roman officials tell a gathering of slaves their lives will be spared if they identify their leader, Spartacus. As Douglas rises to give himself up, a growing chorus of slaves jump up and shout, I'm Spartacus!\\n\\nDouglas stands silently, a tear rolling down his face.\\n\\nAs Michael Douglas once observed, few acts were so hard to follow. Kirk Douglas was an acrobat, a juggler, a self-taught man who learned French in his 30s and German in his 40s.\\n\\nLife was just so many walls to crash through, like the stroke in his 70s that threatened — but only threatened — to end his career. He continued to act and write for years and was past 100 when he and his wife published Kirk and Anne: Letters of Love, Laughter, and a Lifetime in Hollywood.\\n\\nHe was born Issur Danielovitch to an impoverished Jewish family in Amsterdam, N.Y.. His name evolved over time. He called himself Isidore Demsky until he graduated from St. Lawrence University.\\n\\nHe took the name Kirk Douglas as he worked his way through the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, choosing Douglas because he wanted his last name still to begin with D and Kirk because he liked the hard, jagged sound of the K.\\n\\nDouglas was a performer as early as kindergarten, when he recited a poem about the red robin of spring. He was a star in high school and in college he wrestled and built the physique that was showcased in many of his movies. He was determined, hitchhiking to St. Lawrence as a teen and convincing the dean to approve a student loan. And he was tough. One of his strongest childhood memories was of flinging a spoonful of hot tea into the face of his intimidating father.\\n\\nI have never done anying as brave in any movie, he later wrote.\\n\\nBeginning in 1941, Douglas won a series of small roles on Broadway, served briefly in the Navy and received a key Hollywood break when an old friend from New York, Lauren Bacall, recommended he play opposite Barbara Stanwyck in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers.\\n\\nHe gained further attention with the classic 1947 film noir Out of the Past and the Oscar-winning A Letter to Three Wives.\\n\\nHis real breakthrough came as an unscrupulous boxer in 1949′s Champion, a low-budget production he was advised to turn down.\\n\\nBefore 'Champion' in 1949, I'd played an intellectual school teacher, a weak school teacher and an alcoholic, Douglas once said in an interview with the AP. After 'Champion,' I was a tough guy. I did things like playing van Gogh, but the image lingers.\\n\\nHe had long desired creative control and Champion was followed by a run of hits that gave him the clout to form Bryna Productions in 1955, and a second company later.\\n\\nMany of his movies, such as Kubrick's Paths of Glory, The Vikings, Spartacus, Lonely Are the Brave and Seven Days in May, were produced by his companies.\\n\\nHis movie career faded during the 1960s and Douglas turned to other media.\\n\\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, he did several notable television films, including Victory at Entebbe and Amos, which dealt with abuse of the elderly.\\n\\nIn his 70s, he became an author, his books including the memoir The Ragman's Son, the novels Dance With the Devil and The Gift and a brief work on the making of Spartacus.\\n\\nWe are living in a town of make-believe, he told The Associated Press in 2014. I have done about 90 movies. That means that every time I was pretending to be someone else. There comes a time in your life when you say, well, `who am I?' he said. I have found writing books a good substitute to making pictures. When you write a book, you get to determine what part you are playing.\\n\\nDouglas also became one of Hollywood's leading philanthropists. The Douglas Foundation, which he and Anne Douglas co-founded, has donated millions to a wide range of institutions, from the Children's Hospital Los Angeles to the Motion Picture & Television Fund.\\n\\nIn 2015, the foundation endowed the Kirk Douglas Fellowship — a full-tuition, 2-year scholarship — at the American Film Institute.\\n\\nAs a young man, Douglas very much lived like a movie star, especially in the pre-#MeToo era. He was romantically linked with many of his female co-stars and dated Gene Tierney, Patricia Neal and Marlene Dietrich among others.\\n\\nHe would recall playing Ann Sothern's husband in A Letter to Three Wives and how he and the actress rehearsed the relationship offstage.\\n\\nHe had been married to Diana Dill, but they divorced in 1951. Three years later, he married Anne Buydens, whom he met in Paris while he was filming Act of Love (and otherwise pursuing a young Italian actress) and she was doing publicity.\\n\\nHe would later owe his very life to Anne, with whom he remained for more than 60 years. In 1958, the film producer Michael Todd, then the husband of Elizabeth Taylor, offered the actor a ride on his private jet. Douglas' wife insisted that he not go, worrying about a private plane, and he eventually gave in. The plane crashed, killing all on board.\\n\\nDouglas had two children with each of his wives and all went into show business, against his advice.\\n\\nBesides Michael, they are Joel and Peter, both producers, and Eric, an actor with several film credits who died of a drug overdose in 2004.\\n\\nLater generations came to regard Kirk as Michael's father. Michael Douglas not only thrived in Hollywood, but beat his dad to the Oscars with a project his father had first desired.\\n\\nKirk Douglas tried for years to make a film out of Ken Kesey's cult novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\\n\\nIn the 1970s, he gave up and let Michael have a try. The younger Douglas produced a classic that starred Jack Nicholson (in the role Kirk Douglas wanted to play) and dominated the Oscars, winning for best picture, director, actor, actress and screenplay.\\n\\nMy father has played up his disappointment with that pretty good,'' Michael Douglas later told Vanity Fair. I have to remind him, I shared part of my producing back-end (credit) with him, so he ended up making more money off that movie than he had in any other picture.\\n\\nAnd I would gladly give back every cent, if I could have played that role, the elder Douglas said.\\n\\nKirk Douglas' film credits in the '70s and '80s included Brian De Palma's The Fury and a comedy, Tough Guys, that co-starred Burt Lancaster, his longtime friend who previously appeared with Douglas in Seven Days in May, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and other movies.\\n\\nA stroke in 1996 seemed to end his film career, but Douglas returned three years later with Diamonds, which he made after struggling to overcome speech problems.\\n\\nI thought I would never make another movie unless silent movies came back, he joked.\\n\\nIn 2003, Douglas teamed with son Michael; Cameron Douglas, Michael's 24-year-old son; and ex-wife Diana Douglas, Michael's mother, for It Runs in the Family, a comic drama about three generations of a family, with a few digs worked in about the elder Douglas' parenting.\\n\\nIn March 2009, he appeared in a one-man show, Before I Forget, recounting his life and famous friends. The four-night show in the Kirk Douglas Theatre in Culver City was sold out.\\n\\nI've often said I'm a failure, because I didn't achieve what I set out to do, Douglas told the AP in 2009. My goal in life was to be a star on the New York stage. The first time I was asked by Hal Wallis to come to Hollywood, I turned him down. 'Hollywood? That trash? I'm an actor on the Broadway stage!'"}

This vote is about more than hummus, Rabbi Devlin reportedly said. Even though Sabra is an American-based brand, people associate it with Israel and Jews. This vote is about banning a Jewish product, Jewish business.\\n\\nDespite the vote, the UC Riverside administration reportedly said it has no plans to remove Sabra hummus from its shelves.\\n\\nAssistant Vice Chancellor and Campus Spokesman James E.

Each company is a separate entity and independent company.\\n\\nThis is not the first time UC Riverside has faced controversy over this brand of hummus.\\n\\nIn 2015, UC Riverside's campus dining services banned the sale of Sabra hummus after it was confronted by SJP. However, the school reversed course after it realized that by removing the Israeli hummus, it was taking a political position of its own.\\n\\nThe product was changed due to consideration for student preferences without consideration of the political issues raised, UC Riverside said in a statement to the Los Angeles Times at the time.

{"original": "An essay published on Wednesday in the Nation calls for Kamala Harris to avoid attending the presidential inauguration on January 20 so as to spare her life in the event of an armed attack by a rabble of white people aided by law enforcement compromised by Trump sympathizers and white supremacists within their ranks.\\n\\nThe essay, penned by the magazine's justice correspondent Elie Mystal, is titled I No Longer Trust Law Enforcement to Keep Biden and Harris Safe on Inauguration Day with a caption reading The siege of the Capitol revealed what most Black people already knew: Law enforcement is in league with Trumpism.\\n\\nThe author describes how Joe Biden's inauguration will and must take place on an open-air platform erected just outside the Capitol in Washington, D.C.\\n\\nNo matter how many threats Biden receives from Trump supporters and their enablers in Congress and the current administration, he will be inaugurated on that platform for everybody to see, Mystal writes, adding that it will serve as a statement to white seditionists like Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley as well as governments worldwide, that the U.S. cannot be intimidated by violence.\\n\\nThough Biden has to be inaugurated on that stage——no matter how manifestly unsafe the conditions may be, Harris is urged to avoid it entirely.\\n\\nBiden has to be there, but Kamala Harris does not, Mystal writes. The principle of protecting the continuity of the government suggests that Harris and [Nancy] Pelosi, who are respectively the first and second in line to assume the presidency should something happen to Biden, must be shielded at all costs during Biden's big day.\\n\\nClaiming that Harris, the first woman elected as vice president and first black person to hold the post, deserves both to be up on that stage every bit as much as Biden as well as all the pomp and circumstance of her own inauguration, the essay claims that ensuring her safety takes precedence.\\n\\nEven more than a celebration, we deserve Harris alive, Mystal writes. And we deserve a government that can continue to function in the face of a white-supremacist attack.\\n\\nThe essay continues by suggesting that the real danger the inauguration faces is due to potential inside help from Trump sympathizers within law enforcement, noting as a fact that the people who stormed the Capitol clearly benefited from inside help—or at least from permissiveness from members of the Capitol Police.\\n\\nI don't think the MAGA crowd can overcome the United States paramilitary apparatus that is set to be deployed to defend our government, Mystal states. I don't think law enforcement can be overpowered in a repeat of its January 6 failures—unless, that is, its members want to be overpowered.\\n\\nHowever, the essay continues, it would be impossible to oust all the Trump sympathizers and white supremacists from all the numerous law enforcement agencies in time for the inauguration.\\n\\nWhether the department suspends two or 200 more officers, there is zero chance we will have rooted out all the Trump sympathizers within the Capitol Police by the time of the inauguration, Mystal writes. Nor will we have found all the violent white supremacists currently embedded in the National Guard. Or working for the Secret Service.\\n\\nWe might never catch all of the law enforcement personnel who breached the Capitol, Mystal adds. We certainly won't catch all the law enforcement personnel who stayed outside but cheered them on.\\n\\nThe essay then seeks to prove the assertion that law enforcement is, in great part, aligned with white supremacist forces.\\n\\nWe know, at the very least, that many in law enforcement sympathize with Trump because their unions almost universally endorsed him, Mystal asserts without any reference to the Black Lives Matters riots that endangered police lives and saw them abandoned by Democrats nationally.\\n\\nMost people reacted to the police union endorsement of Trump as mere politics, but Black people have been trying to tell the rest of you for years that the police are aligned with white supremacist forces in this country, Mystal writes. They're the same damn forces that change hats or hoods as needed but never change their underlying belief in white supremacy.\\n\\nAfter accusations against members of law enforcement in general and those responsible for protecting the inauguration and Harris's safety in particular, including the Capitol Police, National Guard and Secret Service, the essay then turns to accusations against most white people.\\n\\nMost white people never treat white supremacy as the national security threat that it is. Instead, they allow these officers to keep their jobs and guns, even as they openly threaten elected officials—and, oh yeah, Black people, Mystal writes.\\n\\nSubsequently, white people are then accused of threatening the safety of all others.\\n\\nNone of us are safe—not Black and brown people, not Muslims, Jews, immigrants, not even our most powerful politicians—because white people have allowed white supremacists to infect law enforcement at every level, Mystal charges.\\n\\nThe essay notably emphasizes the threats specifically to non-white Congress members.\\n\\nNobody knows if people of color in Congress are safe from their own law enforcement, Mystal writes.\\n\\nNoting that Biden is taking extra precautions, the essay focuses entirely on the safety of Harris.\\n\\nBiden is taking what precautions he can, Mystal writes. It's a wise move, but how in the hell does that help Harris?\\n\\nEven Harris's own security detail is suspected of potentially posing a threat to her.\\n\\nWho is watching Harris's back? And what have they been posting on burner social media accounts for the past five years? Mystal asks.\\n\\nRight now, the only people I truly trust to protect Harris are her husband, Doug Emhoff, and Karine Jean-Pierre, who has already put her body between Harris and a white man amped up on privilege, he explains.\\n\\nThe essay then declares law enforcement as compromised and not necessarily committed to defending government leaders.\\n\\nLaw enforcement is spoiled. It is compromised, writes Mystal. I do not question its capability to defend the government from armed attack by a rabble of white people—I question its commitment to do so.\\n\\nThe solution, the essay proposes, is to prevent Harris from attending.\\n\\nAnd so, it is safer to separate the leaders of our government from each other on Inauguration Day in the hope that their protectors' commitment is never really tested.\\n\\nThe author concludes by placing the blame for the need for such protection on racist cops, something white people have yet to grasp.\\n\\nIf we protected Black people from racist cops on the street, we wouldn't have to worry about protecting presidents from their own Secret Service details, Mystal concludes. Maybe now, white people will get that.\\n\\nFollow Joshua Klein on Twitter @JoshuaKlein."}

{"original": "Monday on Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson Tonight, host Tucker Carlson opened his program warned of consequences if Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff are elected, adding that he saw the call between President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger as something being used to divert attention away from the Georgia Senate race.\\n\\nTranscript as follows:\\n\\nCARLSON: The other point though, of vacation is to regain some perspective. And New Year's is a handy time to do it, a time to assess the big picture, where we've been and where we're headed next. So the question is, where were we a year ago?\\n\\nWell, as it happened, this week, last year, the biggest story in the world was getting almost no attention in our country: a terrifying new form of the coronavirus was spreading through Central China. And from the very first moments of the outbreak, we'll have more detail on this in just a minute, it was clear to many scientists that that virus may have been engineered by the Chinese government and escaped from a lab in Wuhan.\\n\\nNow, if that happened, it would be hugely significant and have tremendous implications for all of us. Yet, for a variety of reasons, the people in charge of this country didn't want to talk about it. They preferred to change the subject.\\n\\nSo instead, they told us that the biggest thing on Earth happening on January 4, 2020 was the impeachment of Donald Trump, and nothing was more important than removing him from office, by force if necessary.\\n\\nTrump's world-historic crime you may remember was a 30-minute long phone call he'd had with a foreign leader. In that call, Trump suggested there might be something corrupt about Joe Biden's son making 40 grand a month from a Ukrainian energy company despite having no relevant work history in either Ukraine or the energy business.\\n\\nAnd for saying that, they told us, Trump needed to be taken from the White House.\\n\\nWell, a year later, and this is the interesting part. They're saying pretty much the same thing. They're telling us that Donald Trump must be impeached over a phone call that was tape-recorded.\\n\\nThe call they're mad about this time took place over the weekend. The President spoke by telephone to the Secretary of State of Georgia for about an hour. They talked about vote counting in Georgia.\\n\\nThe President, as you may have heard, believes the election was stolen from him. Georgia's Secretary of State whose job it is to oversee elections disagrees. You can listen to the call yourself. It's online and you can make up your own mind about who is right on that question.\\n\\nBy the way, if you have time, you ought to do that. It's interesting.\\n\\nBut no matter what you conclude about vote counting in Georgia, we're willing to bet that you won't decide Donald Trump's latest phone call is the single most important thing happening in the world right now. Probably not even close.\\n\\nAnd yet CNN is claiming that it is. Why are they doing that? Well, that's a good question and worth pondering. Maybe they're trying to divert your attention again. But divert it from what? Well, here's one guess.\\n\\nTomorrow, as we told you, there are two U.S. Senate elections in Georgia, and the outcome of those races will determine who controls the entire U.S. government.\\n\\nIf Democrats win both races, and at this point that is entirely possible; according to the polls, it's likely — if that happens, the Democratic Party will run everything — everything in Washington from top to bottom, and they will be able to do whatever they want.\\n\\nIt's hard to remember the last time that more power was at stake in a single day, and if you thought about that long enough, you might decide to get involved. The Democratic Party and its marionettes, the news media would rather you didn't get involved. And so they're encouraging you to think about Trump's phone call instead.\\n\\nDo you notice a theme here? Manipulation maybe. Ignore the details. Don't ask questions. Here's the latest outrage. Take the bait. Get mad about it – – Trump's phone call in this case — and move on.\\n\\nWrite a grouchy Instagram post if you want. But whatever you do, do not think for yourself because once you start doing that, you might not stop. And at some point, you might start asking bigger, more disruptive questions. Questions like how exactly did this guy win more votes than any other presidential candidate in the history of the United States? Seriously, this guy?\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nJOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: Am I on?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, sir.\\n\\nBIDEN: Good evening. Thanks so much for tuning in.\\n\\nNo man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger other than in self-defense, and that rarely ever occurs. And so we have to just change the culture. Period. And keep punching at it and punching at it and punching at it.\\n\\nPlay the radio, make sure that television — excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night.\\n\\nPoor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.\\n\\nWe choose science over fiction. We choose truth over facts.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: So those aren't selectively edited clips. You've seen them before, but you've seen many more like them because that's who he is. And yet, that's the man they're now calling the President-elect. Again, with more votes than any candidate in history.\\n\\nSo how did this happen? Was it democracy in action? Did suddenly, after 50 years of uninterrupted mediocrity in Washington, two spectacularly unsuccessful presidential campaigns in which he was rejected resolutely by Democratic primary voters, after all of that, did Americans suddenly decide they wanted to be led by Joe Biden?\\n\\nStill unimpressive, but this time senile. Yes, no, that's not what happened. Not at all.\\n\\nWhat happened was, the people in charge rigged the game. Joe Biden got his party's nomination for one reason, because Bernie Sanders turned out to be more popular than anyone expected him to be. And Sanders was an actual threat to the Democratic establishment. He talked about changing tax rates. So they crushed him.\\n\\nAnd out of nowhere, CNN told us that Sanders was not simply a violent sexist, a danger to women everywhere; news they've hidden from us until then, but he was also — and this was shocking — a Russian asset. So predictably, within days, Bernie Sanders melted away and Joe Biden got the job. No one expected that, least of all, Biden. He looked more confused than ever.\\n\\nBut once he was chosen, they knew what to do. Virtually every power center on Earth joined the cause. That included Big Business, Wall Street, the defense establishment, pharma, the permanent bureaucracy in Washington, and above all Silicon Valley.\\n\\nAll of these power centers worked tirelessly from the day Biden got the nomination until the first Tuesday in November to bypass voters and get Joe Biden to the White House. Google changed its famed algorithm to obliterate traffic to websites that criticized Joe Biden. Facebook and Twitter did essentially the same thing.\\n\\nIf that's not rigging an election, there's no meaning to that phrase. The people who control the flow of virtually all information in English became unpaid consultants to the Joe Biden for President Campaign. And that's not speculation. Here is Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey admitting this under sworn testimony before Congress in October.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nSEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): Does Twitter have the ability to influence elections?\\n\\nJACK DORSEY, CEO, TWITTER: No.\\n\\nCRUZ: You don't believe Twitter has any ability to influence elections.\\n\\nDORSEY: No, we are one part of a spectrum of communication channels that people have.\\n\\nCRUZ: So you're testifying to this Committee right now that Twitter when it silences people, when it censors people, when it blocks political speech, that has no impact on elections?\\n\\nDORSEY: People — people have choice over other communication channels with which —\\n\\nCRUZ: Not if they don't hear information.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: Yes, as the CEO of Twitter, we do censor you. But if you don't like it, because markets work, you can go elsewhere. But it doesn't work that way. There's nowhere else to go.\\n\\nApart from FOX News, pretty much every major media outlet in the United States is beholden to Silicon Valley. Referrals from search engines on social media sites generate revenue that news organizations need to survive. So if you mess with Big Tech, you die.\\n\\nThose are the new rules. They are unsustainable. You can't have a democracy in a system like that, because people can't get the information they need to make informed decisions. You bypass the First Amendment.\\n\\nBut if Democrats take over the entire Federal government tomorrow, that's it. There will be no way to stop it. And in fact, it of course, will accelerate because it benefits a specific political party.\\n\\nSo don't think about that. Stop talking about the Georgia election. Donald Trump's phone call is the real story. You'll have plenty of time to think about what happened on Tuesday come Wednesday morning, when Democrats are in charge and there's nothing you can do about it now or ever.\\n\\nToday, and this is another story that's not as important as Donald Trump's phone call over the weekend. Nancy Pelosi, the sitting Speaker of the House came out in favor of D.C. statehood. Yes, that's plainly unconstitutional. But that's not the point. The point is two more Democrats in the United States Senate, and probably not just two. You add Puerto Rico, and that's four new senators. That's a permanent new majority.\\n\\nThat means you have what's called a one-party state, and that means the game is over. That's coming. It's coming at high speed. Just be sure not to think about it.\\n\\nAnd while you're at it, don't think about the Democratic candidates who are running for the United States Senate in Georgia tomorrow. One of them is a man — we are using the term man lightly here — called John Ossoff. He is 33 years old. He is the living embodiment of unearned privilege, of a dilettante.\\n\\nJohn Ossoff has done literally not one impressive thing over the entire span of his life. His only real job was several years working for the single dumbest member of the House of Representatives. Other than that, he has done nothing, not one thing, and yet, he could easily win because you haven't been paying attention.\\n\\nThe other candidate is called Raphael Warnock, the Reverend Raphael Warnock. And Raphael Warnock, by contrast, has done a lot of things. Here's one of them.\\n\\nThis is police bodycam footage of Warnock's wife describing what sounds a lot like domestic violence.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nOULEYE NDOYE, EX-WIFE OF RAPHAEL WARNOCK: This man is running for the United States Senate and all he cares about right now is his reputation.\\n\\nI work at the Mayor's Office. This is a big problem. I've been trying to be very quiet about the way that he is for the sake of my kids and his reputation.\\n\\nI've tried to keep the way that he acts under wraps for a long time. And today, he crossed the line.\\n\\nSo that is what is going on here. And he's a great actor, he is phenomenal at putting on a really good show.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: Now situations like that are complex domestic situations, as the police calls them, and we don't pretend to know the whole story there. We don't pretend to have all of the context.\\n\\nWe do believe that in a democracy, when someone is running for the United States Senate, someone whose presence will tip the balance completely in favor of one party that will then control the entire U.S. government, you probably ought to know that.\\n\\nAnd the candidate ought to answer questions about it, we should have a discussion about it. It is domestic abuse that's being alleged, after all. So we aired that footage. That was almost two weeks ago. And the time since, pretty much no one else has. It's been roundly ignored. Because domestic abuse isn't relevant when powerful Democrats commit it apparently.\\n\\nBy the way, what does Raphael Warnock have to do with Donald Trump's phone call? Nothing. So just relax.

It's scheduled for a May 7 release.\\n\\nF9 is the next chapter in the insanely popular Fast & Furious saga, and is scheduled for a May 28 release.\\n\\nNo Time to Die is the newest James Bond offering, the first big toe that is supposed to dip into the theatrical water on April 2.\\n\\nAll of these movies were originally supposed to be released last year, early last year. So in a sane world, they would already have been released on DVD and Blu-ray and slightly stale entries on HBO and Showtime.\\n\\nThe talk now, according to the far-left Variety, is that Black Widow is headed to the Disney+ streaming channel at the same time it hits theaters. That would be a crushing defeat for a $200 to $300 million movie that would need to gross twice that just to break even.\\n\\nThe same with F9 and No Time to Kill. Those are billion dollar franchises that need to pass the half-billion mark just to avoid being a box office catastrophe, which was also true for Wonder Woman 1984,and that flop probably won't cross $200 million worldwide.\\n\\nThe problem is that the studios have huge interest payments on the loans taken out to finance these films and no guarantee that when they do release them, they won't still crash and burn like Wonder Woman 1984. In fact, there is no guarantee movie-going will ever return to normal. Not this year. Not five years from now.\\n\\nNOLTE review of 'Wonder Woman 1984': Many alive, what a disaster. https://t.co/VpTO7kPzTA — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) December 26, 2020\\n\\nJust for starters, the Democrats who run most of the major cities, like New York and Los Angeles and Chicago, are adamant about keeping people locked down and terrified, even young people who have almost nothing to fear from this virus. It was lunacy shutting down theaters and terrifying young people. Now they may never come back. There's probably some cosmic justice in that.\\n\\nOh, and nothing is guaranteed overseas…\\n\\nThe collapse of Wonder Woman 1984, especially overseas, is freaking everyone out. That sequel was seen as bullet-proof, part of a franchise with a rock-solid foundation of audience goodwill. But even after all those fake early, raving reviews were released, it didn't even soar in China, where movie-going is back to normal and the first one was a monster hit.\\n\\nWorse still, the studios can't sit around and wait to see how the lay of the land looks around release time. Decisions need to be made right about now. If you're going to release a new James Bond movie into the world in April, now is when you have to pull the trigger on promotion and advertising. That's a $100 million to $200 million decision.\\n\\nAlso at risk are some smaller titles. People are wondering about The King's Man, a prequel to the popular Kingsmen franchise, which is set for a March 12 release. Seems to me it would be perfect to end up at Disney+ instead.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Netflix just announced its latest cannon shot across the bow of movie-going normalcy with a new slate of feature films, promising at least one a week in 2021, 70 in all, and not the typical genre/TV fare. This year, Netflix intends to deliver a regular supply of blockbusters and prestige titles starring the likes of Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot, Halle Berry, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kevin Hart, Meryl Streep, Denzel Washington. Sandra Bullock, and on and on…\\n\\nAll these titles will all be released on Netflix's streaming service, which is a monster change from just last year, which saw only a handful of these type of A-list projects.\\n\\nWhy go to the movies if you can get your action/horror/sci-fi/prestige fix at home?\\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

{"original": "President Obama stated, I'll be the first to admit that the tone of our politics hasn't gotten better, but worse and that making it easier to vote, among other changes, can help change this during Saturday's Weekly Address.\\n\\nTranscript as Follows:\\n\\nHi, everybody. I'm speaking to you today from Springfield, Illinois.\\n\\nI spent eight years in the state senate here. It was a place where, for all our surface differences in a state as diverse as Illinois, my colleagues and I actually shared a lot in common. We fought for our principles, and voted against each other, but because we assumed the best in one another, not the worst, we found room for progress. We bridged differences to get things done.\\n\\nIn my travels through this state, I saw most Americans do the same. Folks know that issues are complicated, and that people with different ideas might have a point. It convinced me that if we just approached our politics the same way we approach our daily lives, with common sense, a commitment to fairness, and the belief that we're all in this together, there's nothing we can't do.\\n\\nThat's why I announced, right here, in Springfield that I was running for President. And my faith in the generosity and fundamental goodness of the American people is rewarded every day.\\n\\nBut I'll be the first to admit that the tone of our politics hasn't gotten better, but worse. Too many people feel like the system is rigged, and their voices don't matter. And when good people are pushed away from participating in our public life, more powerful and extreme voices will fill the void. They'll be the ones who gain control over decisions that could send a young soldier to war, or allow another economic crisis, or roll back the rights that generations of Americans have fought to secure.\\n\\nThe good news is there's also a lot we can do about this, from reducing the influence of money in our politics, to changing the way we draw congressional districts, to simply changing the way we treat each other. That's what I came back here to talk about this week. And I hope you check out my full speech at WhiteHouse.gov.\\n\\nOne thing I focused on, for example, was how we can make voting easier, not harder, and modernize it for the way we live now. Here in Illinois, a new law allows citizens to register and vote at the polls on Election Day. It also expands early voting, which makes it much easier for working folks and busy parents. We're also considering automatic voter registration for every citizen when they apply for a driver's license. And I'm calling on more states to adopt steps like these. Because when more of us vote, the less captive our politics will be to narrow interests – and the better our democracy will be for our children.\\n\\nNine years after I first announced for this office, I still believe in a politics of hope. And for all the challenges of a changing world; for all the imperfections of our democracy; choosing a politics of hope is something that's entirely up to each of us.\\n\\nThanks, everybody.\\n\\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"}
{"original": "The South Korean government revealed Wednesday that it had fired 20 machine gun rounds at an unidentified drone widely believed to have come from North Korea that had entered South Korean territory. The incident follows international condemnation of a weapons test Pyongyang claims was the successful detonation of a hydrogen bomb.\\n\\nSouth Korean military officials initially attempted to make contact with the drone and warn it not to cross into South Korean territory. The drone continued its trajectory, CNN notes, until South Korean soldiers fired the warning shots, after which the drone immediately turned around, flying back towards North Korea.\\n\\nCNN quotes retired Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer, a former U.S. Army intelligence officer, as positing that the drone had been sent on an intelligence-seeking mission. The second thing they were trying to do, he added, was probably provocation. North Korea has previously sent rudimentary drones to the north/south border, or Demilitarized Zone, though they have yet to ever attack South Korean soldiers.\\n\\nIn addition to the suspected deployment of the drone, South Korean officials reported Wednesday that Pyongyang has begun a new propaganda offensive against Seoul, where leaflets with anti-South Korean and anti-American messages have been found. The leaflets, Yonhap reports , have been found in towns on the border very near the capital. Careless barking would lead to merciless killing, read one leaflet , while another encouraged, Let us slay the mad villainess in the presidential Blue House for her attacks on a unitary people.\\n\\nOthers were more profane. Don't get caught up with bitch Park Keun Hye's anti-North Korea provocations that only bring calamitous results. Only miserable death awaits for those who slander their same people, read one. North Korean official state media has repeatedly referred to the South Korean president as bitch, notably in the multi-part column series, We Accuse Park the Bitch.\\n\\nSouth Korean officials have announced that they are preparing additional propaganda against the north. After having resumed audio broadcasts into the North condemning dictator Kim Jong-un and broadcasting Korean pop music, officials say they are preparing large electronic signs. It takes some time to arrange them because the electronic bulletin boards that were used before were dismantled or old, defense ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said , noting they have not been used since 2004.\\n\\nSouth Korea is intensifying its call for the international community to sanction North Korea for its nuclear weapon detonation, as North Korea escalates its rhetoric . North Korea's state media outlet threatened to destroy the United States all at once on Wednesday, claiming their nuclear scientists are in high spirits for war.\\n\\nNew sanctions, Park said Wednesday, must be strong enough to change North Korea's attitude. We will make every effort for the strongest sanctions against North Korea by taking new actions. China's role is significant here, she added, pressing China to play its role as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. While China has previously blocked sanctions at the Security Council, it has issued stern condemnations of North Korea's latest nuclear test. The Chinese government's words appear to have reached Pyongyang, as evidence has surfaced that at least one high-ranking Chinese official has been disappeared from North Korean propaganda."}

Davutoglu should have resisted, said Kemal Kilicdaroglu, head of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP).\\n\\nSoner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute, said the move was the next stage in a hollowing out of Turkish institutions by Erdogan.\\n\\nIt shows how much power has been massed in one person's hands, he told AFP, adding that Erdogan was now exercising more control than anyone in Turkey's modern democratic history.\\n\\nLeading potential successors to Davutoglu include the president's longtime henchman Transport Minister Binali Yildirim, and the youthful Energy Minister Berat Albayrak, 38, who is married to the president's eldest daughter Esra.\\n\\nBut press reports also pointed to less high-profile figures, such as Deputy Prime Minister Yalcin Akdogan, Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag, or AKP deputy chairman Mehmet Ali Sahin.\\n\\n– 'Not a word of criticism' –\\n\\nThe political tumult unnerved financial markets, with the lira losing almost four percent in value against the dollar on Wednesday.\\n\\nThe currency rallied by 1.84 percent Thursday, supported by the prospect of a smooth succession process as Davutoglu stays on to the May 22 congress and his apparent lack of public rancour.\\n\\nThe prime minister's office also said Davutoglu would go ahead with a scheduled visit to Bosnia on Friday and Saturday.\\n\\nStill, the shake-up comes at a challenging time for Turkey, with Ankara battling Kurdish militants in the southeast and in Iraq, Islamist jihadists on the Syrian border as well as hosting 2.7 million refugees from the Syria war.\\n\\nRelations between Erdogan and Davutoglu had been seen by analysts as uneasy, but the speed with which their divisions burst into the open took many by surprise.\\n\\nThe premier championed a March deal with the EU to stem the flow of refugees across the Aegean Sea — an accord in which the president has shown little interest despite Turkey on the verge of winning visa-free travel to Europe for its citizens.\\n\\nDavutoglu had said there was no need for haste in Erdogan's drive to create a presidential system in Turkey, a pet project of the president that risked diminishing the premier's own powers.\\n\\nA decision last week by the AKP executive committee to remove Davutoglu's right to appoint regional party officials was seen by commentators as the most severe blow yet to the premier's authority.\\n\\nBut Davutoglu vowed to stay on as an AKP lawmaker and pledged to never voice a single word of criticism of Erdogan, saying their strong relationship would continue until my last breath.\\n\\nIn a speech in Istanbul on Thursday, Erdogan made no mention of the premier's resignation."}

The turf war led to intense fighting where both sides resorted to the use of armored vehicles and explosives during their fierce gun battles.\\n\\nPart of the strategy used by the Gulf Cartel to keep out the CDN-Los Zetas is to use lookouts and have teams of gunmen roaming dirt roads and highways into territories in Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. Late last month, Breitbart Texas exclusively reported on the arrest of a Nuevo Leon police officer with Fuerza Civil who actually worked as a troop commander with the Gulf Cartel.\\n\\nAs part of the investigation into that arrest, authorities learned about an increased attempt by that criminal organization to hire local and state police officers in Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas in an ongoing effort to fight off the CDN-Los Zetas. Breitbart Texas also reported that authorities learned the Gulf Cartel began using low profile work trucks and dressing up their lookouts in orange vests and work crew attire in an attempt to avoid detection by authorities.\\n\\nIn the days after that report, Fuerza Civil officers in Nuevo Leon spotted and chased two small SUVs that were conducting surveillance in the town of Doctor Coss along the highway that connects Monterrey with the border city of Reynosa.

That's why the DNC voted to shift power in the presidential primary process away from superdelegates and further towards our grassroots supporters — on the first ballot, our nominee will be selected by pledged delegates. We also established new rules for the state caucuses and primaries for 2020. For the first time, the DNC rules specify a preference for the use of primaries so that more people can participate in the presidential nomination process. Caucus states are required to provide absentee voting or some other method for those who cannot vote in person, have votes recorded on paper in case of a recount, and set the national convention delegates based on the first level of voting. The grassroots donor threshold meant that anyone who wanted to see a particular candidate on stage had the ability to help make it happen. Millions of grassroots donors were energized earlier than ever before in the process, and we saw increased engagement from supporters. Now, with voting underway, candidates who have secured just one pledged delegate or are polling above 10% can make the debate stage. I'm exceptionally proud of the reforms the @DNC has made to fulfill our promise to our voters and rebuild their trust in our party. These changes are all about the future. They're about growing our party, uniting our party, and earning the trust of committed Democrats like you.\\n\\nAs of 1:30 p.m. ET, Perez had yet to issue a statement addressing the confusion and concerns sparked by the massive delay in the Iowa caucus results, causing many on social media to blast the DNC and call for Perez's resignation."}

The packages often contain sources of information about the world outside of North Korea, such as radios and USB flash drives, and DVDs containing South Korean news and dramas.\\n\\nIn a 2019 survey by a Seoul-based activist group, more than 71 percent of 200 defectors said they had watched a South Korean drama or film before fleeing their homeland, mostly using a DVD or USB device at night when surveillance is weak, Reuters recalled on Monday.\\n\\nIn daytime, the population is shouting 'long live [North Korean dictator] Kim Jong Un,' but at night they all watch South Korean dramas and movies, Tae said at Reuters' January 11 conference.\\n\\nWhy stop the inflows of information? he asked.\\n\\nTae gleaned knowledge about the world outside North Korea from embassy communiqués posted in Europe while he worked as Pyongyang's deputy ambassador to Britain. He then based his decision to defect to South Korea on this new information.\\n\\nMy children learned that their lives were nothing but those of contemporary slaves if they go back to North Korea, he said at Monday's conference.\\n\\nMy sons knew everything, and I knew everything. It was my decision … and I wanted to give them the choice of freedom, he added.\\n\\nSouth Korea's parliament passed a bill on December 14 banning the launch of balloon care packages and leaflets to North Korea after Pyongyang expressed increased hostility toward Seoul last year for allowing the practice.\\n\\nAfter weeks of tense diplomatic relations between the North and South over instances of leafleting, Pyongyang said on June 8 that it was cutting off all communication with Seoul. The North's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Pyongyang's decision was part of the first step of the determination to completely shut down all contact means with South Korea and get rid of unnecessary things, referring in part to instances of leafleting in the weeks directly preceding June 8.\\n\\nThe South Korean authorities connived at the hostile acts against (North Korea) by the riff-raff, while trying to dodge heavy responsibility with nasty excuses, KCNA said.\\n\\nAmid increased pressure from Pyongyang, the South Korean government had attempted to crack down on leafleting by North Korean defectors and anti-Pyongyang activists residing in the country last year but were unable to prevent a handful of balloon launches."}

Tom Reed (R-NY), Young Kim (R-CA), Fred Upton (R-MI), John Curtis (R-UT), Peter Meijer (R-MI), and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) introduced a resolution in their attempt to hold the president accountable and try to calm the nation after the riots emerged while Congress certified the 2020 election results.\\n\\nThe House Republicans introduced the resolution as the House prepared to vote on a resolution calling on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. The House will vote later this week on Articles of Impeachment in another attempt to remove Trump. Both measures will fail, as Pence will not move to invoke the 25th Amendment and impeachment will likely fail in the Senate.\\n\\nThe House Republicans said in statements that they must hold the president accountable for his actions. Reed said:\\n\\nThis is an important step to hold the President accountable. Congress must make clear that it rejects extremism and condemns the President's actions. We will continue to push for Congressional leaders to work with us on investigating the events surrounding this dark period in our history and make sure it never happens again with the public's trust in our democratic institutions restored.\\n\\nFitzpatrick said:\\n\\nPresident Trump's attempts to undermine the outcome of the 2020 election have been unconscionable. The combination of a false information campaign coupled with inflammatory rhetoric led to the devastation that I was a personal witness to on the House Floor on January 6th. His actions threatened the integrity of our democracy, Congress, and his own Vice President. For months, President Trump has been lying to the American people with false information, and giving his supporters false expectations. The election is over.

President Trump's actions, behavior, and language are unacceptable and unbecoming of the office he holds for the next eight days.\\n\\nA peaceful transfer of power from one presidential administration to the next is the bedrock of the American republic.

These rioters must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. The president also misled many Americans to believe that the outcome of the election could change on January 6th, when that simply was not true, and must held accountable for his role.

{"original": "This morning's key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\\n\\nIn major policy shift, China will demolish thousands of migrant homes in cities\\n\\nMigrant workers built modern China, and are now being discarded\\n\\nIn major policy shift, China will demolish thousands of migrant homes in cities\\n\\n\\n\\nA rare street protest in Beijing against demolitions of migrant homes and businesses (Getty)\\n\\nThe mayor of China's capital city Beijing has announced that workers would demolish 15 square miles of homes used by low-paid migrant workers. Many migrants have lived in these homes for years or decades, but now the city is declaring the homes to be illegal structures. The migrants will be evicted and left homeless.\\n\\nOfficials are not saying how many migrant workers would be evicted by the demolitions this year. However, in general terms, Beijing would like to reduce the population of Beijing by 15 percent, and this would fall most heavily on the estimated 3 million migrant workers living in Beijing, or 450,000. Other reports estimate 8 million migrant workers in Beijing. The larger figure may include suburbs.\\n\\nIn December of last year, a demolition campaign evicted tens of thousands of migrant workers in just one month alone, so these figures seem to be credible.\\n\\nSome demolitions had been going on slowly for years, but when a shantytown fire on November 18 killed 19 people, the demolitions and evictions took on a shape that is being described a vicious and cruel.\\n\\nPeople were given only a few hours' notice before their homes were demolished, and they were forced into the sub-zero December temperatures. The demolitions included small businesses as well as homes, causing many migrants to lose their life savings as well as their source of income. Many migrants had been supporting their families by sending money back to them, but that source of support was cut off overnight.\\n\\nChinese intellectuals have petitioned the government to halt the evictions, calling them a violation of human rights. Even some state media have criticized the campaign. According to Yi Fuxian, a China population expert, the government has called migrants a low-end population – basically implying that they are inferior quality human beings. China didn't just say this. They actually wrote it into government documents. This is absurd, says Yi. Reuters and Shanghaiist (24-Nov) and BBC and NPR (4-Dec-2017)\\n\\nRelated Articles\\n\\nMigrant workers built modern China, and are now being discarded\\n\\nWhenever a large number of foreign migrants travel from one region to another, the reactions of the natives generally range from marginalization to open hostility to violence, sometimes ending in deportation. In Beijing, the migrants are not foreigners. They are ordinary Chinese from farms and rural areas who come to the city to improve themselves, or to earn money to send back to their families.\\n\\nAccording to China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), there are an estimated 282 million rural migrant workers in China, making up more than one-third of the entire working population of 807 million.\\n\\nMigrants workers are almost always marginalized and work in low-paid jobs. They are subject to various kinds of abuse, including forced overtime and non-payment of salaries. The vast majority of rural migrant workers are still employed in low-paid jobs in manufacturing, construction, and services. According to NBS figures, the employment by sector is as follows:\\n\\nManufacturing – 31 percent\\n\\nConstruction – 20 percent\\n\\nSales – 12 percent\\n\\nHousehold services etc. – 11 percent\\n\\nTransport and logistics – 6 percent\\n\\nHotel and catering services – 6 percent\\n\\nOthers – 14 percent\\n\\nThe millions of migrants living in Beijing, often for decades, were the laborers who built Beijing into the huge metropolis that it is today. Now their work is done, and they are being left cold, broke and homeless.\\n\\nAlthough news stories have focused mainly on Beijing, thanks to the shantytown fire on November 18, we are apparently seeing a major change in Chinese policy that affects all large cities, and possibly medium-sized cities as well.\\n\\nThe likely causes of this change of policy are as follows:\\n\\nBeijing and other large cities suffer from massive traffic jams and massive bouts of choking pollution, calling for a reduction in population.\\n\\nBeijing and other large cities need to build new roads and other infrastructure, requiring that the illegal homes of millions of migrant workers be demolished. Out with the old, in with the new.\\n\\nChina has recently changed its one-child policy to a two-child policy, threatening even larger population gains in the large cities.\\n\\nThere are signs of a great deal of xenophobia between the elite residents of the cities, and the low-paid migrants who do all the work.\\n\\nThis kind of major demographic policy change can only put strain on China's economy, which is already running on a huge debt bubble and a huge real estate bubble.\\n\\nFrom the point of view of Generational Dynamics, this split could be significant as the first signs of a new internal rebellion, for which China is overdue. China's history is filled with huge, massive internal rebellions (civil wars), the most recent of which were the White Lotus Rebellion (1796-1805), the Taiping Rebellion (1850-64) and Mao's Communist Revolution (1934-49). The leaders of China's Communist Party (CCP) are well aware of this history, and they are aware that a new internal rebellion is now due, and probably overdue.\\n\\nChina used to publish the number of mass incidents occurring in the country. The number of mass incidents of unrest recorded by the Chinese government grew from 8,700 in 1993 to about 90,000 in 2010, according to several government-backed studies. The government stopped publishing the figures in 2010, but it is reasonable to believe that the number of mass incidents per year is well into the hundreds of thousands. If even just one of these mass incidents occurred in America or Europe, it would be international news, so the fact that hundreds of such mass incidents occur in China EVERY DAY indicates how socially unstable China is.\\n\\nSo you already have an economy running on a huge debt bubble, with hundreds of thousands of mass incidents per year, and with millions of marginalized migrants scheduled to lose their homes and their jobs, when the country is well into a generational Crisis era. China's next, massive, historic internal rebellion is overdue, and this new policy could end up being one of the triggers.

The 2016-18 Big Chill was composed of two Little Chills, the biggest five month drop ever (February to June 2016) and the fourth biggest (February to June 2017). A similar event from February to June 2018 would bring global average temperatures below the 1980s average. February 2018 was colder than February 1998.\\n\\nTo put this temperature drop in context, consider that this is enough to offset by more than half the entirety of the global warming the planet has experienced since the end of the 19th century.\\n\\nSince the end of the Little Ice Age in the 1880s, the planet has warmed by about 0.8 degrees C. You might think that was not a particularly drastic rate of warming to worry about. You might also note that such a rate of warming is well precedented in periods throughout history, such as during the Minoan, Roman and Medieval warming periods. Nonetheless this 0.8 degrees C rise – 0.9 degrees C, at a push – is the terrible climatic event the alarmist establishment has been assuring these last few decades is the worst thing ever and something that should worry us awfully.\\n\\nSo is this sudden cooling an even-worse thing? Not necessarily. As Brown goes on to explain in his piece, you can't extrapolate trends from such a short time scale. Well, not unless you're a climate alarmist… As we know from long experience, if it had been the other way round – if the planet had warmed by 0.56 degrees C rather than cooled, the media would have been all over it.\\n\\nMy point is that statistical cooling outliers garner no media attention. The global average temperature numbers come out monthly. If they show a new hottest year on record, that's a big story. If they show a big increase over the previous month, or the same month in the previous year, that's a story. If they represent a sequence of warming months or years, that's a story. When they show cooling of any sort—and there have been more cooling months than warming months since anthropogenic warming began—there's no story.\\n\\nMeanwhile a study by Judith Curry and Nic Lewis – also largely unreported by the mainstream media – confirms what skeptics have been saying for years: that the computer models used by the alarmist establishment to predict global warming are running too hot.\\n\\nAccording to Investors Business Daily:\\n\\nIn the study, authors Nic Lewis and Judith Curry looked at actual temperature records and compared them with climate change computer models. What they found is that the planet has shown itself to be far less sensitive to increases in CO2 than the climate models say. As a result, they say, the planet will warm less than the models predict, even if we continue pumping CO2 into the atmosphere. As Lewis explains: Our results imply that, for any future emissions scenario, future warming is likely to be substantially lower than the central computer model-simulated level projected by the (United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), and highly unlikely to exceed that level.\\n\\nThis brings projected global warming from being potentially dangerous to being easily manageable. Which is why, of course, it is unlikely to get much attention from a scientific establishment and a complicit media that much prefers to ramp up the global warming scare – even when the evidence doesn't support it."}

Tactical Augmented Reality (TAR) replaces both NVGs and GPS while offering real-time visual cues and vital data directly to soldiers.\\n\\nRichard Nabors is an associate for strategic planning at U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command's Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center, or CERDEC. He spoke about TAR at the Pentagon's most recent Lab Day.\\n\\nNabors described the hand-held GPS system that most soldiers currently employ. It depends on geo-registering, a technology which allows soldiers to approximate their position if they have aligned an image they can observe with a reference image. The TAR system will handle this process automatically, allowing soldiers to more precisely know not only their own position but that of allied and enemy forces.\\n\\nStaff Sgt. Ronald Geer, a counterterrorism non-commissioned officer at CERDEC's Night Vision and Electronics Sensors Directorate, said soldiers won't even need an independent GPS device at all. Instead of fiddling with the accessory, they will simply see a map overlaid on the terrain in front of them through a helmet-mounted eyepiece.\\n\\nThe TAR is connected to a tablet on their belt, as well as the thermal sight on their rifle. This creates a seamless HUD with more similarities to video games than to anything we've seen in military tech thus far. The soldier can use the gun as a deadly periscope, lifting it above cover without exposing themselves to danger.\\n\\nThe device can split its screen to give feedback from both the eyepiece and the sight, so a soldier can also look in multiple directions simultaneously. In fact, these visuals can be shared with other soldiers, giving the entire squad a level of collective intelligence that could change the entire way in which we approach tactical situations.\\n\\nDavid Fellowes, an electronics engineer at CERDEC, expects the devices to both save lives and contribute to the success of future missions. It's not hard to see why. They have been working since 2008 to develop the necessary miniaturization technology to allow for these highly-detailed dynamic visuals to fit on the one-inch display.\\n\\nAfter nearly a decade of development, the U.S. Army is turning Ghost Recon into reality.\\n\\nFollow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both."}

{"original": "Shawn Carney, president and CEO of 40 Days for Life, said the pro-life side is the only side discussing science in the abortion debate, offering his remarks in a Monday interview on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow ahead of 2019's March for Life, scheduled for January 18 in Washington, DC.\\n\\nCarney explained his organization's origins.\\n\\n40 Days for Life started in 2007 and we hold peaceful prayer vigils outside of abortion facilities across America, said Carney. We're now in 50 countries. We do a campaign in the fall and a campaign in the spring, and this started in College Station, Texas.\\n\\nLISTEN:\\n\\n\\n\\nWe've helped 200 abortion workers leave their jobs. We've helped 15,000 moms with their babies. We've seen a tremendous amount of growth the last 11 years.\\n\\nMarlow invited Carney to describe 40 Days for Life's outreach tactics.\\n\\nCarney replied, We've had 800,000 volunteers participate and go out to the sidewalk and pray in front of a local abortion facility. The one thing that always blows me away is that 30 percent of those people tell us this is the first thing they've ever done in the pro-life movement, and I'm always like, 'Why?' This is the hardest thing you can do is go outside and publicly oppose this where it's going on.\\n\\nCarney continued, But the reason they do it is because it's law-abiding. It's peaceful. You don't get arrested. We've never had an incident or an act of violence at any of our vigils. It's professional, and we take it very seriously because abortion is a serious business. Planned parenthood certainly takes it seriously. We need to be organized at the grassroots level, and that was one of the criticisms from the ACLU is that we are highly organized at the grassroots level.\\n\\nMarlow asked why people who were previously sympathetic to abortion come to oppose the termination of unborn children.\\n\\nIt's seeing the reality of abortion, explained Carney.\\n\\nCarney recalled the story of Abby Johnson, a former Planned Parenthood abortion facility director. Johnson is now a pro-life advocate with 40 Days for Life.\\n\\nI knew Abby for eight years when she worked at Planned Parenthood, Carney said. She was the 2008 Planned Parenthood employee of the year, and she was at my local abortion facility. That was the one she was the director of. I knew her, and she walked right into my office in 2009 after she had a change of heart.\\n\\nCarney went on, They're making a movie about [Abby Johnson]. It'll be out March the 22nd. Abby is now on off the most outspoken advocates for the unborn, and I always point out to folks this is not a movement of a bunch of self righteous Christians trying to tell everybody how to live. Quite the opposite, it's a movement of people who have had an abortion, or have paid for or encouraged an abortion, worked at Planned Parenthood, doctors who have done an abortions; we have one on our board.\\n\\nCarney continued, It's really a movement of converts, and the gate only swings in one direction. You don't have parents, [or] a mom who has five kids who runs a pregnancy center or volunteers at her church and wakes up and is 55 and realizes she should've been managing an abortion facility her entire life. It really swings in one direction.\\n\\nMarlow and Carney speculated that any pro-lifer turned pro-abortion advocate would be quickly heralded by the left.\\n\\nThey'd be on a speaking tour in two seconds and they'd have a book out, quipped Carney.\\n\\nCarney remarked, We believe in freedom of speech, and we believe in God. If you go out there and you peacefully pray, you stand there in silence; look, nobody grows up wanting an abortion, and nobody grows up wanting to work in the abortion industry. There is already a tremendous amount of tension inside the walls of a Planned Parenthood facility in America, and when you go out there and you don't yell and you don't curse them to hell, they're going to respond.\\n\\nCarney explained, We've helped nearly 191 abortion workers. [Abby Johnson] was the 26th abortion worker to leave her job during the 40 Days for Life. They don't turn around the first week. They hate us, and they don't turn around the second week. But by the third and fourth weeks, when these wonderful Americans have been out there in cold and heat, they quit focusing on you and they focus on the reality of the work that they're doing.\\n\\nCarney assessed, It is amazing how uneducated many Planned Parenthood staff members are about abortion. It really is, and [Abby Johnson's] testimony shows that. She finally witnessed an abortion, and that led to her conversion.\\n\\nCarney said, Not only is it something we do, and we are a faith-based group, but this is a patriotic thing to do. I don't know of any movement that takes more advantage of freedom of speech than the pro-life movement in getting out there and calling attention to this.\\n\\nMarlow attributed the pro-life movement's growth, in part, to increasing awareness of neonatal development. There's a huge science component to why the pro-life movement is thriving, he said. The more people understand about abortion versus the more they understand how developed the fetus is typically at the time of abortion, the arguments to be pro-abortion get so much less persuasive; the more information you have.\\n\\nCarney concurred, There's only one side discussing science and it's the pro-life side. If you vaguely support abortion, they don't go anywhere near science. They don't go anywhere near reason. It's all personal, and we have seen out at our vigils, their response is just loud and it's noisy and it's angry. There's no more 'reproductive rights,' or 'health care,' or 'privacy,' or anything you would sit down and have a normal discussion with someone about. It's all this in your face angry; 'shout your abortion' mentality. It's bad for their cause, but it's definitely good for us, because we don't do those things, and we do discuss science and the humanity of the baby, and the impact that abortion has on the woman after the abortion.\\n\\nMarlow highlighted how Lena Dunham — star of HBO's Girls and a left-wing partisan Democrat activist — said in 2016, Now I can say that I still haven't had an abortion, but I wish I had.\\n\\nCarney stated, The numbers alone, 3,000 abortions a day in the United States. So prayer is the first response. We go out there. We pray silently. We don't shout at people. We do have trained sidewalk counselors, people who can offer medical alternatives locally. We do not shout our prayers.\\n\\nCarney added, I've helped dozens of children who were seconds away from being aborted. We just have to be so numb to what abortion does and who it does it to to talk about it so callously in this way, 'I wish I had an abortion,' or to say that this is just another surgery in America. You would have to be completely disconnected from reality, and you would have to be completely insensitive to those who are considering abortion, because they don't brush it off. It is a big deal, and when you're standing in front of a parking lot of a Planned Parenthood you realize they're not out in Washington, DC, supporting 'reproductive rights.' They never wanted to end up in the parking lot of a Planned Parenthood abortion facility, and now they're there, The idea that they're shouting their abortion is insensitive and simply untrue.\\n\\nCarney spoke optimistically of the pro-life movement's future.\\n\\nThe momentum is very much one-sided, declared Carney. One side depends on the government and Hollywood, and one side depends on real America, where the people actually live and where the abortions actually happen. The March for Life — 46 years of legalized abortion — every year the march gets larger and it gets younger. I'm 36 years old. I have seven kids, but I'm one of the old guys at the march. There are a lot of college students, a lot of high school students, and it's very encouraging. The former president of NARAL resigned after she witnessed March for Life in person. She cited her inability to motivate young people to support abortion.\\n\\nCarney added, It really is encouraging. Now we're seeing great things on the political front with a pro-life president.\\n\\nCarney encouraged people to participate in this year's forthcoming March for Life in the nation's capital.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's awesome to see the March for Life, exclaimed Carney, It's a very patriotic event, also, marching for life in Washington, DC. Go to a march wherever you are. If you have a local march or a state-wide march, it has a tremendous impact, and it definitely sends a message to the abortion industry.\\n\\nCarney concluded by explaining the selection of 40 Days as a part of his organization's namesake, We take that time period that God uses throughout scripture to bring about transformation, so we have a daily prayer and a daily scripture for 40 days, and that's the 40 Days for Life.\\n\\nBreitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\\n\\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter."}
{"original": "Cologne Police have arrested two men linked to the Islamic State, who may have been plotting terror attacks.\\n\\nThe suspected jihadists are said to have travelled to Syria from November to December of 2013 where the Federal prosecutor says that both men joined the Islamic state to wage jihad against the government of Bashar Assad.\\n\\nThe prosecutor reports the 25 year old man travelled to Syria in the autumn months of 2013, according to Spiegel on-line. He did not immediately join the Islamic state upon getting to Syria but rather joined a militia called Junud al-sham where he was to undergo combat training so that he could take up guard duties with the group.\\n\\nLater on the man would change his allegiance to the Islamic state. He received more training from ISIS who, according to German authorities, taught him how to commit acts of terrorism with the goal of sending him back to Germany as a sleeper agent ready to attack Europe when called on to do so. In December of 2013 he headed back to Germany.\\n\\nThe arrests of the men come after the federal prosecutors office accused three other men of being directly linked to the Islamic state in October of last year in Düsseldorf. The three men were brought before a court of appeal last month.\\n\\nThe men in that case were also in Syria around the same time and left shortly after though all of the men accused were part of the Junud al-sham organization before they were members of the Islamic state. It is unclear whether they knew each other but it is likely that police questioning of the suspects in Düsseldorf led to the information which in turn led to the arrests of the two men in Cologne.\\n\\nAgents of the Islamic State have been warned about by many right wing politicians since the start of the migrant crisis and Breitbart has reported on stories involving Islamic State militants sneaking into Europe.\\n\\nAlong with an ISIS commander who was found to be living in a migrant centre in rural Germany, two North African men were discovered in a migrant centre who also had direct links to ISIS.

That and the fact his kids were messing around caused Henrik to yell at them to behave themselves (at least I'm assuming as it was Swedish). It was refreshing to see a frustrated dad not try and fake adoration for his kids. Golf will continue to have plenty of syrupy sweet moments when the kids run on the green as dad wins a big tournament.\\n\\n2. Rickie Fowler is more popular with 12-year-old boys and girls than N'Sync ever was. Beatles level fame with that age group.\\n\\n3. The crowds at Sawgrass are insane. It's like an SEC meet-up party and the girls all look the same with their rompers that barely cover their derrière. Fathers, it's time to set some limits on this type of clothing.\\n\\n4. Kudos to the PGA for serving beer in the media center. They recognize that golf is a game and should be enjoyed with libations.\\n\\n5. Adam Scott is a handsome man but he makes the strangest expressions when he walks the course. He constantly purses his lips. I think it may be to ensure that he is not just judged on his looks.\\n\\n6. It can be annoying being a famous pro golfer. Following Rory McIlroy's group as he walked a rope line a bunch of kids who want to shake his hand and he has to do it or else he looks like an ass. Never mind the fact he just bogeyed the hole and is pissed. Well, he does it like a good soldier but there is a grown adult man who is at the end of the line and wants a fist bump for God's sake. So now Rory, already annoyed, has to change from regular handshake to a fist bump for this weird adult. Unacceptable behavior from anyone over the age of 12.\\n\\n7. J.B. Holmes, who shares the lead only hit five fairways. Amazing scrambling ability from the Kentucky boy. If you only hit five fairways out here, you should shoot 80.\\n\\n8.

{"original": "The centre left is dead in Europe.\\n\\nThis is the heartening the conclusion of a survey in the Economist which shows that electorates across Europe have lost patience with the squishy, soft-left, metropolitan 'Social Democrat' elite which has dominated their politics for the last seventy years.\\n\\nEarly in this century you could drive from Inverness in Scotland to Vilnius in Lithuania without crossing a country governed by the right; the same would have been true if you had done the trip by ferry through Scandinavia. Social democrats ran the European Commission and vied for primacy in the European Parliament. But recently their share of the vote in domestic (and Europe-wide) elections has fallen by a third to lows not seen for 70 years (see chart 1). In the five European Union (EU) states that held national elections last year, social democrats lost power in Denmark, fell to their worst-ever results in Finland, Poland and Spain and came to within a hair's-breadth of such a nadir in Britain.\\n\\nHere is the chart that says it all:\\n\\nTo read the Economist's accompanying commentary, you might think that this was a sad loss. But then the Ecommunist is the house journal of the Europhile corporatist and technocrat elite who were responsible for this Social Democratic stitch-up in the first place .\\n\\nThe Economist gets where the votes have gone:\\n\\nMany have been hoovered up by populists, typically of the anti-market left in southern Europe and the anti-migrant right in the north. But alternative left parties (feminists, pirates and greens, for example), liberals and the centre-right have also benefited. And so has the Stay On The Sofa party.\\n\\nWhat it doesn't seem to understand is why they have gone there. It comes up with a four-part explanation – its own success, structural change in the economy, a reduced fear of political extremes and the decline of monolithic class groups – which I'm afraid is so turgid I can't be bothered to elaborate, you'll just have to read the piece if you're interested which I really wouldn't recommend. (The Economist is designed to sit on your coffee table, impressing your visitors; not actually to be read).\\n\\nBut it's surely much simpler than that. Voters are going elsewhere because they can see that Social Democracy has failed them.\\n\\nIt has failed them economically – as the vast youth unemployment in countries like Spain, Italy and Greece can testify; not to mention the shrinking size of the Eurozone economy generally.\\n\\nIt has failed them socially by inflicting on them a wave of immigration by people from an alien culture which has no intention of assimilating with or showing any gratitude to the nations now hosting it.\\n\\nUnfortunately, because the same Social Democrat elite is running the European Union none of this is about to change any time soon. It just means that across Europe, voters are going to feel more and more frustrated with the unaccountable governing caste and will vent their frustrations by throwing in their lot with ever more extreme parties. This cannot but end very unhappily – which is ironic, given that the raison d'etre of Social Democracy, or so the Social Democrats keep telling us, is that it brings us all peace, consensus and stability.\\n\\nYeah right."}

{"original": "TEL AVIV — In recent days, Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other Palestinian jihadist factions opened their traditional summer camps in which Palestinian youth are indoctrinated with anti-Israel propaganda while some camps conduct weapons training and teach jihadist combat tactics.\\n\\nAccording to figures from Hamas alone, some 120,000 children attend the terrorist group's camps. Tens of thousands more children attend camps run by other Palestinian jihadist factions.\\n\\nIn addition, thousands of children participate in summer camps run by the Palestinian refugee welfare agency UNWRA, where the focus is more on educational activities than those of a religious or military nature. UNRWA's summer camps bear the name Summer Games, in contrast to the names of camps run by Hamas, Islamic Jihad, national resistance committees and other organizations that mostly use the names of Palestinian activists who died as martyrs – in other words, terrorists killed while committing attacks against Israel.\\n\\nAs part of the competition between the organizations for the recruitment of children into their camps, the weapons training and military exercises serve as the best promotional tool.

The group was established in 1909 as an all-male singing group. Since then, the Whiffenpoofs have maintained an all-male roster.\\n\\nNow, after a push for the group to go co-ed in the late 1980s, the Whiffenpoofs will finally introduce their first male member. I cried when I heard, David Code, a former member of the group said. I am thrilled. I am delighted. And most of all, I want to meet this girl. I want to hear her voice.\\n\\nThis is something I've dreamed about for years. The Whiffenpoofs should have gone coed in 1968, when Yale went coed. Finally, 50 years later, meritocracy is here — and it's long overdue, Code added.\\n\\nThis class of Whiffenpoofs is exceptionally talented, and Sofia is right there with them, Kenyon Duncan, the group's music director, said.

But if people judge Sofia based on her quality as a singer, they would reach the same conclusions that we have.\\n\\nOthers are skeptical of the change. C.

I think a downside of this is it might possibly change the sound of the Whiffs, which is an all-male, very robust sound. And that in turn could jeopardize the appeal of the Whiffs in their current marketplace, if you will.\\n\\nHowever, most members of the Yale community are celebrating the decision, looking to it as an indication of social progress.

If, in the face of such a straightforward, transparent, and thorough reality drama, some people's myths and obsessions about democracy, freedom, and human rights in the West cannot be shattered, then the only hope for the time being should be pinned on more rational analysis. Is democracy a means or an end or a combination of both? Should democracy solve the problem of fairness or efficiency? Should democracy safeguard procedural justice or substantive justice or give consideration to both? Mankind's exploration and thinking over democracy has never stopped.\\n\\nThe People's Daily was sporting enough to allow that American-style democracy might have played its due role in history when it comes to exploring the human system, but now the U.S. is dizzy from democratic arrogance boosted by economic power and the calculation of interests driven by global expansion.\\n\\nIt is evident that the negative consequences of the export of 'democracy' by the U.S. have appeared in many countries. The gunshot at the U.S. Capitol shows that the bitter fruit of 'democracy' will eventually have to be swallowed by the U.S. itself, the editorial concluded.\\n\\nA guest op-ed at China's state-run Global Times over the weekend by Martin Jacques, a senior fellow at both Cambridge University and Fudan University's China Institute, also argued that the Capitol riot will mark a fundamental change in how the world sees the United States.\\n\\nJacques wrote:\\n\\nAmerica likes to present itself as a model of democracy, an example for every other country in the world to follow. Yet the spectacle of armed demonstrators, with the encouragement of the outgoing president, breaking into Capitol Hill and seeking to disrupt the confirmation of the new president, is the kind of behavior we have associated in the past with a handful of Latin American countries.\\n\\nJacques argued the riot was the result of America's relative decline since the 1980s, by which he primarily meant a declining standing of living, rising income inequality, and the death of the long-standing and much-vaunted American Dream. He threw in a few big shout-outs to his Chinese hosts in the course of explaining why America is falling apart:\\n\\nFor a country that has been more or less on the rise for the whole of its history – in other words, for well over two centuries – this has come as a huge shock. Americans have thought of their country as the land of opportunity, God's chosen people, the leading country in the world. Given this backdrop, it is hardly surprising that Americans were totally unprepared for what has happened in the last twenty years: two failed wars, the 2008 financial crisis, a weakening economy, accelerated national decline and the rise of China. The consequence has been unhappiness and angst, profound uncertainty and loss of confidence about the future, and growing divisions.\\n\\nJacques thought a new Civil War could be in the offing, with nowhere to go but down for an America locked into rapid decline, rampant inequality, falling living standards for the majority, rising unemployment, and China on the verge of displacing the U.S. as the world's largest economy.\\n\\nWe cannot describe America as comprising two nations, but the bitter divisions that have opened up as a result of the Trump presidency, his veiled threats of a coup if he was not re-elected, and his deliberate encouragement of opposition bordering on insurrection, suggest that this could yet become America's future, Jacques warned. The Civil War offers a chilling historical precedent, with eleven states choosing to secede from the Union because of their refusal to accept the ban on slavery."}

{"original": "TEL AVIV – The meeting between President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu marked a symbolic reset of relations after eight years of tension between the two countries, a top American foreign policy expert said on Friday.\\n\\nSenior fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations Elliott Abrams said on a conference call organized by the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA),\\n\\nWe have come through a period of eight years of tension at various levels, but particularly the top level. It's clear that [former president Barack] Obama and Netanyahu didn't get along, didn't like each other. And that attitude was then communicated to the White House staff. You had a lot of backbiting, criticism of Netanyahu — all of that is over. We've returned now to the idea that there should be no daylight in public between the two governments. There will be plenty of disagreements, but those will be discussed in closed rooms and the relations at the top are obviously genuinely good. There is no artifice here about getting along.\\n\\nThat's a critically important thing, Abrams noted. The whole US government takes its cue from the relationship at the top.\\n\\nAbrams, who also served as deputy national security adviser to President George W. Bush, added, Other governments also pay attention. I've always believed that most governments, particularly in Europe, base their relationship [with Israel] on ours. They don't want to be quite as close to Israel. So if we're distant, they're more distant. If we're close, then they get closer.\\n\\nAbrams lauded Trump's ambivalence regarding the two-state solution as being the key to solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\\n\\nThe goal should never be a two-state solution, the goal is peace. And there are many ways of moving in that direction and there are several potential endpoints. And I think that it's useful to the Israelis and for us to remind everybody that the goal is peace. We should not let the means become more important than the end, and we should think about that goal, rather than saying there is no other possible arrangement ever than the two-state solution.\\n\\nAbrams said that Trump's request to Netanyahu to hold back on settlements for a little bit was not necessarily an instruction to stop building entirely.\\n\\nI think that [Trump was] moving back to the George W. Bush approach. And what was the Bush approach? Basically it was, don't change the footprint [and] don't expand the settlements geographically. Population growth, that's different. Build up and in. In built-up areas, if you want to build a new house, a new apartment, that doesn't affect the Palestinians or the chances of peace really. So the Google Earth map, if you put it that way, of the settlements doesn't change.\\n\\nWe had a deal with [late Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon that was basically no new settlements, no physical — territorial — expansion of settlements and no financial inducements to move to a settlement. I think this administration is moving back to that view, he added."}
{"original": "An Extra $59 Billion Could Solve a Lot of Problems\\n\\nBP just discovered a billion barrels of oil in the Gulf of Mexico. It was just another CNBC headline on January 8, and yet it highlighted a bigger trend: the surge in U.S. energy production.\\n\\nAnd in a way, it also highlighted a big counter-trend: the green left's desire to take it all away, in the name of fighting climate change.\\n\\nSo let's take a moment to drill down, pun intended, on that new discovery. At current prices, that new oil, in the waters south of New Orleans, is worth about $59 billion. For purposes of comparison, the GDP of the entire state of Louisiana in 2017 was $246 billion. Which is to say, $59 billion is an appreciable bump.\\n\\nIn fact, as CNBC noted, the new discovery will inspire $1.3 billion in investment to actually get the oil out. And that's good news for all the workers who will get jobs and overtime out of this additional economic activity; according to Zip Recruiter, energy jobs in the Gulf pay an average of $80,201 a year. And so there's good news, too, for families, neighbors, storekeepers, and stakeholders.\\n\\nAnd oh yes, it's good news, as well, for the United States, since energy security is a big part of national security. As any Baby Boomer remembers, all through the 60s, 70s, and 80s, we were told by the experts that the U.S. faced an energy crisis. Thus we needed to take dramatic steps to deal with this supposed shortfall—everything from cutting back on consumption to invading other countries to seize their oil.\\n\\nYet in the past two decades, all this expertise has gone to the trash heap, because, thanks to strong science and stronger entrepreneurship, we've enjoyed an energy miracle. This is in large part due to the new process of fracking; in 2018, the U.S., for the first time since World War Two, became a net energy exporter.\\n\\nMoreover, there's more happening with energy production than just fracking. To put it simply, there's a lot more energy in the earth than the experts thought possible.\\n\\nPart of this energy abundance is the simple working of the law of supply and demand. As every free-marketeer knows, if there's a market for something, some entrepreneur will find a way produce more of it. And if that requires exploration everywhere, well, that's exactly what's happened; around the world, proven oil reserves have nearly tripled since 1981.\\n\\nIndeed, some heterodox observers, such as the late Thomas Gold, argue that the earth is, in fact, making more energy, even now. That is, oil, gas, and coal aren't fossil fuels at all, in the sense that such fuels are supposed to be the decayed remains of dinosaurs and other prehistoric organisms. Instead, Gold argued, the internal heat of the earth is, as it were, constantly cooking up more oil. By this reckoning, so long as the core of the earth is hot, we'll never run out of carbon-based fuel.\\n\\nThis theory of the non-biological origins—abiogenesis–of oil goes back to the 19th century. And yet even today, among geologists, it's still a decidedly minority viewpoint. Still, every time we discover additional carbon-based fuel reserves, that's an indicator that we might be dealing with a lot more than just the remains of the Jurassic Period. (As an aside, we might observe that the debate over the origins of oil puts useful perspective on the question of whether or not there is truly such a thing as settled science.)\\n\\nWhatever the source, the reality is that we're all standing atop virtually incomprehensible quantities of untapped energy abundance. In 2014, Breitbart News noted that the value of oil and gas under federal lands and waters amounted to $128 trillion. That $128 trillion, we might add, is six times the GDP of the U.S. Once again, that's just federal lands and waters—a fraction of this country's total territory.\\n\\nThese energy realities could be the makings of a happy story of energy abundance, leading to both economic and national security for every American. After all, with that much money, we could provide good education, protect retirees, build infrastructure, improve our defenses, cut taxes—and still have trillions left over.\\n\\nHowever, as we know, there are some who don't want any of this to happen. In the name of fighting climate change, some green environmentalists seek to, in the words of top-dog enviro Bill McKibben, leave it in the ground. Or, in the case of that new $59 billion worth of oil in the Gulf of Mexico, leave it under the water.\\n\\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Green New Deal: Conquest? Or Compromise?\\n\\nThe argument over climate change has been raging for decades, and yet only in the past few years has it really gained momentum. The 2016 Democratic platform was ambitious; it called for getting 50 percent of our electricity from clean sources within a decade, and for reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 80 percent by 2050.\\n\\nSince then, the greens and the Democrats have upped the ante: In 2017, some Congressional Democrats introduced legislation eliminating carbon fuel emissions by 2035. More recently, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has rallied Democrats to the target of ending carbon emissions by 2030.\\n\\nFor perspective, we might interject that today, carbon fuels—oil, gas, and coal—account for 77.6 percent of U.S. energy consumption. And that's all supposed to go to zero in 11 years? Hmmm.\\n\\nWe can add that today, renewable fuels account for less than 13 percent of our energy consumption. And most of our renewable energy, by the way, is hydropower, and the greens are increasingly hostile to dams as well. And so if we look at the two forms of energy that the greens truly approve of, namely, solar and wind, well, those two sources account for only about three percent of U.S. energy.\\n\\nSo can we really expect to ramp up solar and wind, from three percent of our energy production, to 100 percent of what we need, and will need, as the population grows? In a little more than a decade? We all know the answer to that.\\n\\nIn the short run, the green goal is moot because Republicans control the White House and the Senate; there are, to be sure, differing opinions on climate in Republican ranks, but there's no appetite for anything like what the greens have in mind.\\n\\nOf course, all that could change after 2020, if the Democrats do well in the next election. If so, then the Democrats' green agenda, which is coming to be known as the Green New Deal, has a chance of becoming law. (This author has already written about the prospect of a Green New Deal, here, and here.)\\n\\nSo now we can see the makings of the next epic political fight: that is, the zeal of the greens vs. the determination of carbon-energy producers. In the U.S. today, about a dozen states are heavily dependent on carbon-energy production for their wellbeing; these states account for most of the 1.1 million employees in the energy sector.\\n\\nAre these states, and their elected officials, ever going to submit meekly to some green dictate that says leave it in the ground? That doesn't seem likely. And will lawmakers from, say, Louisiana—seeking to defend the new $59 billion worth of newly discovered oil, on top of the previously discovered $2.61 trillion, still waiting to be tapped—find a way to make constructive political alliances with those from states that don't produce energy, but merely consume it? That does seem likely.\\n\\nIndeed, it's quickly apparent: No matter what happens in the 2020 elections, the U.S. is not going to shut itself down for the sake of climate change. And neither, of course, is any other country in the world.\\n\\nSo it's entirely likely that we'll be in a political standoff: if not after the 2020 elections, then sometime soon enough. On the one side will the greens, and on the other side will be the carbons. Who will win in the end? There's no way to know, of course, but the greens' losing fight with France's yellow jackets should give them pause.\\n\\nOf course, not everything has to be a fight. This author has argued for years that the overlooked middle ground in the climate change debate is carbon capture: that is, sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide, preferably as a solid, so that it can't contribute to the greenhouse effect. One would bet that if the Green New Deal were ever to really get going, carbon capture would loom large, offering a win-win for both sides. That is, we put less CO2 in the atmosphere—or even start removing it—but we still get the energy benefit of our natural resources.\\n\\nThe Secret Split in the Green New Deal\\n\\nIt's clear that the Green New Deal has more impetus than just climate change. That is, Ocasio-Cortez and her allies see a Green New Deal as being about more than climate change—it's about changing America.\\n\\nTo be sure, some critics see this possible change in America as Venezuela-ification. And yet it's worth noting that key Green New Dealers see the change in a much different frame of reference. Here, for example, is Saikat Chakrabarti, top adviser to Ocasio-Cortez, tweeting on January 13, linking the Green New Deal to U.S. economic mobilization during World War Two:\\n\\nNo one is arguing against increasing productive capacity to go alongside increasing public investment. This is literally what we did to mobilize for World War 2, and @AOC has referenced that multiple times when talking about the economics of a Green New Deal.\\n\\nNo one is arguing against increasing productive capacity to go alongside increasing public investment. This is literally what we did to mobilize for World War 2, and @AOC has referenced that multiple times when talking about the economics of a Green New Deal. — Saikat Chakrabarti (@saikatc) January 14, 2019\\n\\nIn the words above, we see muscular words such as increasing productive capacity and mobilize, which aren't exactly the same as hugging trees and worshiping nature. In other words, the emphasis in Chakrabarti's tweet is economic, not environmental.\\n\\nWe might further observe that World War Two was many things—beyond, of course, the necessary and righteous defeat of fascism. World War Two was also about growing the economy; during the four years of fighting, America's GDP rose 48 percent. Of course, most of that growth went to war production, and yet even so, personal consumption rose 20 percent, as unemployment fell to one percent. Not bad.\\n\\nBut one thing we can say for sure about World War Two: It wasn't green. That is, all those factories, all those oil pipelines, all that technology—it was the opposite of the Al Gore worldview. (Or should we say, the world that Al Gore wants for us.)\\n\\nNow, of course, in the future, since we know so much more than we did then, we can make growth clean—that's the point about carbon capture, and other new technologies. And yet at the same time, clean growth is still growth, and that means more. Yet are the environmental greens, as opposed to the Green New Dealers, really on board with that? We'll have to wait and see if that split is real, and if it can be bridged.\\n\\nSo, down the road somewhere, if Green New Dealers still say they want to create 10 million new jobs, maybe the rest of us should say, That's great! Now, how're you going to pay for them?\\n\\nAnd at that point, that $59 billion in new oil money from the waters off Louisiana might come in handy. Yes, with new technology, it can be made as clean, but energy is energy, and so if the goal is to create more jobs and more wealth for people, then, for sure, we need to think hard about using all of it. That is, we must do the opposite of leave it in the ground. After all, we have a lot of children to educate, streets to protect, and elderly to take care of.\\n\\nThis need to use all our energy, including carbon fuels, becomes all the more apparent if it proves to be true that the earth is literally making more oil, coal, and gas—even as you read these words.\\n\\nIndeed, with a bit of whimsy, one might even ask: If Mother Nature is giving us a gift, should we not feel an obligation to accept it? Surely we wouldn't want to offend her by refusing such a gift. After all, as the classic TV commercial from the 70s, warned us, It's not nice to fool Mother Nature."}

{"original": "As the debate about the construction of a wall and other border security issues, here are 29 facts that you need to know. The topics came up during the most recent episode of Coffee with Scott Adams. Brandon Darby, the Managing Editor for Breitbart's Border and Cartel Chronicles, sat down with the famed creator of the Dilbert comics to discuss the intricacies of border security.\\n\\nScott Adams talks with Brandon Darby about the border situation, and I tell you my progress on climate. With coffee. https://t.co/cufXEZXpBW — Scott Adams (@ScottAdamsSays) January 8, 2019\\n\\n1) No one is proposing a wall between all of Mexico and the U.S.—the U.S. southern border is approximately 2,000 miles. The discussion is about 1,000 miles of physical barriers in regions that are heavily controlled by drug cartels.\\n\\n2) The Texas border is about 1,200 miles of the approximately 2,000 miles of the total southern border. Most of that border is the Rio Grande, a river which varies in intensity with respect to currents.\\n\\n3) Mexico has numerous states under the direct influence of drug cartels that have standing armies with access to RPGs, armored vehicles, artillery, and explosives. Most of Mexico has military forces patrolling streets to deal with cartel paramilitary forces.\\n\\n4) The most violent drug cartels operate south of the Texas border. Factions of Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel routinely allow their violence to spill over to the average person.\\n\\n5) The border city of Tijuana has some of the highest murder statistics in all of Mexico. Despite record-setting figures, most of the victims tend to be tied to drug trafficking.\\n\\n6) Border cities south of Texas like Reynosa, Tamaulipas, have much lower murder rates than Tijuana. Despite the difference, average citizens are often touched by cartels including shootouts, kidnappings, and other violent activities.\\n\\n7) Most of the efforts by drug cartels to control migration happens South of the Texas border. Criminal organizations like the Reynosa faction of the Gulf Cartel profit more from human smuggling than drug trafficking.\\n\\n8) The majority of tunnels are found on the Arizona and California borders. The tunnels are generally discovered in areas where there are population centers on both sides of the border and a wall or fence is already in place. Few have been found in Texas, where there is a river.\\n\\n9) Most tunnels are discovered thanks to informants; law enforcement technology has rarely been successful in locating border tunnels.\\n\\n10) Most of the border does not have a drug tunnel problem. They are typically found in Douglas and Nogales, Arizona, as well as Mexicali, San Diego/San Isidro, California.\\n\\n11) Cartels spend a lot of money building a tunnel–only to be discovered shortly after.\\n\\n12) Claims by Democrats about the low crime rates in El Paso are an example of walls working. In areas with considerable border barriers such as El Paso, the regional criminal groups turn more professional and shy away from illegal immigration to traffic harder drugs through ports of entry.\\n\\n13) The presence of physical barriers in cities like El Paso has led to fewer people coming over the border to commit petty crimes or bring loads of drugs on their backs. The criminal organizations in the area shifted toward corrupting U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials to smuggle harder drugs.\\n\\n14) A partially secured border is more deadly than an open or well-secured one. Previous administrations put barriers south of most cities in Arizona and California to funnel illicit traffic into areas that were easier to manage or too desolate to cross. This led to a spike in deaths since the desire of people to reach the U.S. pushes them to more remote and dangerous areas.\\n\\n15) Human smuggling and illegal immigration will continue to be a problem until economic opportunities improve in Mexico and in Central America.\\n\\n16) Mexican transnational criminal groups and their leaders have grown beyond the size and power of the American mafia from Prohibition Era and Al Capone. Cartels are integrated into the Mexican political culture and bureaucracy. Legalization would not stop them.\\n\\n17) The decriminalization of marijuana and the production of higher quality plants in the U.S. versus Mexico had a series of unspoken consequences. After marijuana from Mexico was not able to compete with U.S.-grown plants, some cartels shifted their model more toward human smuggling–becoming a factor in the 2014 migrant crisis and the current one at the U.S. border.\\n\\n18) After marijuana decriminalization in the U.S., cartels shifted to increase their cultivation of poppies and the production of black tar heroin. In order to compete with the Asian product, cartels use fentanyl–playing a role in the current opioid overdose epidemic.\\n\\n19) The U.S. State Department influences how hard authorities crack down on cartels. U.S. agencies have been told to measure their law enforcement priorities with the State Department's diplomatic concerns.\\n\\n20) A cartel's power in Mexico comes not from kingpins, but from politicians, financiers, lawyers, and money launderers. U.S. authorities and diplomats routinely focus on kingpins such as El Chapo and his lieutenants, but never go after the rest of the circle.\\n\\n21) The state of Tamaulipas, directly south of Texas, has two former governors currently indicted for their alleged roles in helping cartels. One remains in Mexico, while the other is in U.S. custody awaiting trial.\\n\\n22) U.S. diplomats are negotiating and playing along with the same Mexican politicians that protect cartels, in the interest of trade and diplomacy.\\n\\n23) Certain factions of drug cartels have crossed the line into terrorism and should classified as such. The designation would change the way the U.S. alienates them from banks, financial resources, and politicians. Other cartels would be forced to tone down their actions or risk similar consequences.\\n\\n24) Worries of Middle Eastern terrorists crossing the southwestern border are at times mitigated by cartel members who are informants for U.S. agencies that enjoy handsome incentives to turn people in.\\n\\n25) The more likely scenario for terrorism deals with people flying into Canada and then entering the U.S. with visas. Most people on the terror watch list who try to enter the U.S. across the southern border are Somalis or Kurds.\\n\\n26) Certain organizations like Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel present more of an imminent threat than foreign terrorists entering through the southern border.\\n\\n27) Mexico's ongoing cartel violence and drug war has led to more murders and disappearances than some international wars. Mexico has suffered more than 250,000 homicides and at least 30,000 disappearances since 2009.\\n\\n28) Up to 70 percent of the women and girls from Central America who come through Mexico to the U.S. are sexually assaulted en route. Most women who leave Central America for the U.S. have the expectation of facing multiple abuses at the hands of cartel-connected human smugglers.\\n\\n29) The State Department keeps U.S. law enforcement from being more aggressive against cartels. The State Department has everything to do with how law enforcement and intelligence agencies operate in Mexico–and any effort to secure the border without addressing the Department's timidity in Mexico will likely fail or be less successful than it otherwise could be."}
{"original": "Feb. 24 (UPI) — Deaths from the coronavirus passed 2,600 in China, and the number of cases surpassed 77,000, on Monday as countries worldwide rushed to contain the spread of the disease within their own borders.\\n\\nWorld Health Organization officials on Monday said they are not yet prepared to declare the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic, despite the continued rapid growth of the outbreak and new cases in Iran, Italy and South Korea.\\n\\nOutside of China, there have been 2,074 confirmed cases in 28 countries, including 23 deaths — counting the three new outbreaks.\\n\\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called the new outbreaks deeply concerning, but said that for the moment, we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus.\\n\\nThe decision is based on the agency's ongoing assessment of the diseases spread threat, and could change as facts on the ground change, officials said. With COVID-19 causing epidemics in different parts of the world, Ghebreyesus said individual countries require calm, tailored responses and declaring a pandemic too early could increase fear and hold back efforts to slow spread of the virus.\\n\\nThe WHO does not use a numerical threshold for determining a pandemic, rather eschewing to judgement based on the definition that an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people.\\n\\nMike Ryan, head of the WHO's emergency response program, said the fact that Chinese officials appear to have largely limited the outbreak to one region of the country and that numbers appear to be slowing or declining suggests COVID-19 is containable.\\n\\nAt the same time, he said, the continued spread to other countries, as well as lack of clarity on whether the coronavirus will remain endemic in humans or morph into a seasonal disease has officials exercising caution about any declaration.\\n\\nCOVID-19 in China\\n\\nChinese health officials have reported 150 new deaths from the deadly coronavirus over the previous 24 hours, increasing the death toll for mainland China to 2,618 since the epidemic began in December.\\n\\nChina's National Health Commission announced the new death toll in its daily update Monday morning, stating 149 of the newly reported deaths occurred in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak.\\n\\nThe health officials also said there were 460 new confirmed cases over Sunday, increasing the total of confirmed cases to 77,362.\\n\\nThe announcement of the new figures came as officials in Hubei's capital of Wuhan reversed an earlier decision to relax some of the tight restrictions placed last month upon the city of 11 million at the center of the outbreak. Hubei is where 2,495 people have died from the disease with 1,987 in Wuhan, the province said in a statement on Monday.\\n\\nIn a statement Monday afternoon, Wuhan government officials said the easing of lockdown restrictions was declared invalid as it was issued without consent from the main leaders.\\n\\nWe have seriously criticized the relevant personnel, the statement read.\\n\\nThe city was placed under a strict lockdown on Jan. 23 to clamp down on the virus' spread, and the city announced in a statement early Monday that non-residents who do not exhibit symptoms may finally leave Wuhan.\\n\\nIn the new statement issued hours later, the officials called on Wuhan to resolutely implement Chinese President Xi Jinping's orders to prevent the outbreak's spread.\\n\\nThe WHO said Monday that its joint mission to China has concluded, with its final report suggesting that the epidemic in China peaked and plateaued between January 23 and February 2, and has been in decline ever since.\\n\\nThe fatality rate linked to COVID-19 is estimated at 2 percent to 4 percent in Wuhan, and about 0.7 percent outside the city. Those with mild disease have recovered within two weeks, and people with more severe disease may need three to six weeks to completely recover.\\n\\nThe measures taken in China averted a significant number of cases, Ghebreyesus said, adding that China's situation suggests the virus can be contained in many countries.\\n\\nGrowing worldwide outbreaks\\n\\nMeanwhile, as the rate of infection appears to slow in China, other countries are scrambling to contain the disease.\\n\\nSouth Korea also announced more cases Monday, and Seoul's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported two new deaths raising the death toll to seven.\\n\\nAsian Airlines said it would suspend its Daegu-Jeju route from Tuesday and Air Busan said it canceled its Daegu to Jeju and Daegu to Taipei flights last week when concerns emerged.\\n\\nThe increase in infections also caused Australia to update its travel advisory for the Asian nation warning its citizens to exercise a high degree of caution visiting South Korea and to not visit Daegu.\\n\\nAustralia also warned residents to exercise a high degree of caution in Japan based on the advice of its medical officials due to a heightened risk of sustained local transmission of COVID-19.\\n\\nIn Europe, Italy has reported the largest outbreak outside Asia with 157, according to a tally kept by the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering.\\n\\nThe outbreak has forced the nation to suspend its famed Venice Carnival, ban public and private meetings through Saturday and cancel sporting events.\\n\\nIn the Middle East, Kuwait and Bahrain announced their first confirmed cases of the disease.\\n\\nThe Bahrain Ministry of Health said the infected Bahraini citizen arrived from Iran and was suspected of having contracted the virus as he exhibited symptoms, according to a statement carried by the Bahrain News Agency.\\n\\nThe patient was transferred to the Ebrahim Khalil Kanoo Medical Center where he was confirmed infected with COVID-19 and is currently receiving treatment in isolation, it said.\\n\\nThe government said it will be upping its measures to prevent contamination of the virus, including monitoring those who arrive from infected countries.\\n\\nIn Kuwait, health officials confirmed three people have been infected with the disease, the Kuwait News Agency reported.\\n\\nGlobally, the death toll from the virus reached at least 2,619 with more than 79,350 people infected, according to the tally by Johns Hopkins."}
{"original": "Police in Kenya arrested four Chinese nationals, local media reported on Sunday, after a shocking video began circulating of one of them publicly flogging one of his employees, a Kenyan national, for allegedly being late to work.\\n\\nThe man whipping the Kenyan, a chief identified as Deng Hailan, was working in Kenya illegally; he possessed only a tourism visa to be allowed in the country. Deng was working as a chef in a hotel. Simon Oseko, the man being whipped in the video, told local media he felt he had no choice but to accept the abuse as he needed money from the job.\\n\\nThe case has outraged Kenya, already reeling from a growing list of incidents of Chinese nationals being abusive and racist against their Kenyan peers. China has embedded itself deeply in the Kenyan economy through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), offering Nairobi millions of dollars in predatory loans the country is ill-equipped to pay back. Chinese Belt and Road workers have stood accused of building an apartheid system at construction sites for development projects, beating Kenyan workers and banning Kenyan engineers from any skilled jobs.\\n\\nChina has also poured at least hundreds of its citizens into Kenya to do work that Beijing promised would go to locals and enrich Kenyan communities. Many of these Chinese citizens have overwhelmed the Kenyan immigration system by applying for tourist visas and using their time in Kenya to work illegally.\\n\\nDeng, who police believe had done just that, was arrested alongside Chang Yueping, Ou Qiang and Yu Ling, three others working at the Chez Wou Restaurant at a hotel in Kileleshwa, a Nairobi suburb. Deng is believed to have been illegally working as a chef despite having a tourist visa. Chang and Ou were present in Kenya illegally, as their visas had expired. The fourth suspect, Yu, was also working at the restaurant with a visitors' permit, violating the law, according to Kenya's The Nation. A local officer told The Nation that the four Chinese will likely face charges of assault as well as illegally working in the country. The officer handling the case described them as flight risks and so should not be granted bail.\\n\\nDeng caught the police's attention through a video circulating on social media of a man believed to be him whipping Oseko, the waiter. Oseko pressed charges against Deng and claimed the assault occurred on February 2. He told police that Deng fired him after whipping him, without paying for the hours he had worked.\\n\\nThe video shows an Asian man urging the man identified as Oseko to bend over before whipping him, causing audible pain. Others can be heard laughing at the violence off-camera.\\n\\n\\n\\nI asked him why he was caning me and he bluntly asked me whether I wanted to continue working at the place, Oseko said in an interview with Kenya's The Standard. He said that similar beatings had occurred many times before Deng ultimately fired him.\\n\\nHe gave me two strokes. It was so painful because I could not sit down, he said. His boss then expected him to continue working.\\n\\nThe newspaper noted that remarks on social media indicated that many Kenyans wished to see the Chinese immediately deported, not punished within the Kenyan legal system at taxpayers' expense. Police reportedly stated, however, that those arrested would, if found guilty, have to face Kenyan justice.\\n\\nThe case is the latest in a string of increasingly outrageous incidents of Chinese citizens violating Kenyan law, often through engaging in openly racist behavior. The large numbers of Chinese entering Kenya began traveling there after Nairobi signed onto the BRI and China offered to build the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), an extensive rail line that would connect Nairobi to Mombasa, a port city on the Indian Ocean, and eventually connect Kenya to Rwanda, Uganda, and other neighbors. The first corridor of the SGR opened in July, over a year after reports began surfacing in The Standard and elsewhere of the Chinese workers creating an apartheid system at work sites.\\n\\nThe Standard published images in 2018 of Chinese workers banning Kenyans from sitting in the same eating spaces as the Chinese, banning them from sitting in the same transportation vehicles en route to work sites, and forcing Kenyan engineers with specialized degrees to perform unskilled labor. Chinese workers also refused to translate any instructions that come with equipment for building the railroad or controlling the rail line once it is built, ensuring that Kenya will need to constantly pay Chinese experts to keep the line running.\\n\\nReports of physical abuse of Kenyan workers at the sites also surfaced regularly, as did reports that a Chinese worker made a salary four times larger than a Kenyan for doing the same job. Those Chinese workers were conducting labor operations in Kenya illegally in many instances, officials later revealed.\\n\\nInsiders said besides the official numbers that have applied for work permits, there are hundreds of others behind the walls working using tourist visas who fly back home every six months for a short break, before jetting back in to pick up where they left, The Standard wrote in 2018, two years before police arrested the four Chinese workers at the hotel restaurant this week for violating the terms of their permit.\\n\\nIn response to the scandal, the Kenyan government accused its own citizens of having insufficient work ethic and urged them to be more like the Chinese.\\n\\nEven as we talk about the [railway] and the racism and all that, it might be necessary for us as a country to change our work ethic, government spokesman Eric Kiraithe said in 2018. What we are expecting those Kenyans to do, those with an opportunity, is to shift the focus on the challenge at hand.\\n\\nProblems have persisted since the railway opened. In May 2019, police arrested four Chinese railway workers after video surfaced of the Chinese gang beating a Kenyan government inspector who had visited their site to ensure compliance with the law. The Chinese workers first reportedly allowed the engineer on their site. When the engineer discovered they were using substandard building materials, the Chinese allegedly tried to bribe him, then beat him when that failed.\\n\\nOutside of the railway work, Chinese businessmen traveling to the country have been involved in racist spectacles that have triggered public outrage. Among the most prominent was a rant by businessman Liu Jiaqi, a motorcycle dealer, who a Kenyan employee recorded calling President Uhuru Kenyatta a monkey and demanding Kenyans be like white people.\\n\\nEvery one, every Kenyan … like a monkey, even [Kenyan President] Uhuru Kenyatta. All of them, Liu tells his employee's camera. I don't belong to [sic] here. I don't like here, like monkey people, I don't like talk with them [sic], it smells bad, and poor, and foolish, and black.

Iran, which has contracted me on television, too – a state that murders communists, where women have to wear burqas, but politics is like this. Some people have to work for Coca-Cola or Walmart.\\n\\nOn the Iranian backed-programme, Iglesias praised Chinese dictator Mao Zedong as astute, declining to mention the 60 million deaths that occurred under Mao's brutal reign. In another episode, he also lionized the Colombian terrorist group FARC, despite the guerillas being responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths.\\n\\nWhile Iglesias would presumably be too busy fulfilling his role as deputy prime minister of Spain to carry on hosting the show, Hispantv never announced that the Fort Apache programme was discontinued, and has given no indication Iglesias will not continue to host the show in the future.\\n\\nFollowing the vote that ensured his new position, Iglesias broke down into tears, delivering a bouquet of flowers to ailing Catalan MP, Aina Vidal, as supporters chanted Yes you can while raising their left fists.

{"original": "Zimbabwe's main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, organized a thousands-strong protest in the nation's capital Thursday calling for nonagenarian dictator Robert Mugabe step down after 28 years of iron-fisted rule.\\n\\nThe BBC estimates the anti-Mugabe crowd at two thousand people, though the local newspaper New Zimbabwe says the crowd swelled to ten thousand people. Marchers wore shirts calling for a new president and held signs up demanding the government deliver jobs Mugabe long ago promised. The more brazen signs read old clueless Mugabe must go.\\n\\nSpeaking before the crowd, MDC-T leader Morgan Tsvangirai made clear that the protesters were not calling for revolution, but merely fair elections. We are not demanding an overthrow of the government… We are demanding a dignified exit for the tired Mugabe, Tsvangirai said, adding, It's time Mugabe listens to the voice of the people. The people shall liberate themselves.\\n\\nTsvangirai has been the nation's most prominent opposition leader for more than a decade, running against Mugabe for president in 2002, 2008, and 2013. In 2008, he received more votes than Mugabe but not enough to win, according to the Mugabe government's electoral oversight officials. A license to organize his march Thursday had previously been denied, but the nation's High Court eventually permitted the assembly, which the BBC describes as largely peaceful, though police were equipped with water cannons to disperse the crowd if necessary.\\n\\n@263Chat showing #MDCTDemo in Harare today.

Harare Central police officer Newbert Saunyama issued a statement before permits were given for the march that it could hurt daily life in Harare, and the government-owned newspaper The Herald has published a piece after the event claiming some bystanders suffered physical harm.\\n\\nA CHOPPIES Supermarket security guard was hospitalised yesterday after sustaining serious injuries at the hands of rowdy MDC-T supporters, The Herald claims, citing a police spokesman who said the protesters blocked traffic for about an hour and also disturbed some Harare City Council officials who were conducting their work along the road before they attacked the security guard. The security guard was allegedly attacked on the corner of Harare's Robert Mugabe Road.\\n\\nThe MDC-T has made clear this is the first in a long string of protests. Upon receiving the permit, the party's secretary general Douglas Mwonzora described the party as very excited that we have trampled the Mugabe regime as the judgement passed today (Wednesday) by the courts allows us to march in Harare and all the other cities and towns around the country.\\n\\nMugabe's ruling party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), has responded to the protests alleging that the elections Tsvangirai lost to Mugabe were free and fair, and prove Mugabe can still govern.

If they (the MDC) want him to go, then they should campaign and go for elections and win, that is the democratic way of changing the government.\\n\\nCritics have alternatively referred to the 2013 Zimbabwe presidential election as a sham, a huge farce, and a masterclass in electoral fraud."}

Patrick Leahy (D-VT) predicted if the GOP leadership in the Senate didn't allow a vote on that nominee, the Democratic Party would win back the U.S. Senate.\\n\\nPartial transcript as follows:\\n\\nDANA BASH, CNN ANCHOR: The sudden death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has huge implications, and it sent both parties scrambling. President Obama last night pledged to nominate a replacement.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: These are responsibilities that I take seriously, as should everyone. They're bigger than any one party. They are about our democracy. And they're about the institution to which Justice Scalia dedicated his professional life and making sure it continues to function as the beacon of justice that our founders envisioned.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBASH: I'm joined now by the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Patrick Leahy of Vermont. Senator, thank you so much for joining me. I will just start with what the Senate majority leader, Republican Mitch McConnell, said last night. He laid down the gauntlet, saying the Senate will not confirm anybody until after the presidential election. Your thoughts.\\n\\nSEN. PATRICK LEAHY (D), VERMONT: Well, I think he's making a terrible mistake. And he's certainly ignoring the Constitution and ignoring responsibilities. President Obama is doing the same thing that President Reagan did. At the end of his term, he nominated a Supreme Court justice. The confirmation was in the last year of President Reagan's term. The Democrats controlled the Senate. None of us intended to play politics with something as important as a Supreme Court nomination. And the Democratic-controlled Senate voted 97-0 in favor of President Reagan's nominee in the last year of his presidency. The fact is, when you elect a president, you have to assume, if there's Supreme Court nomin — vacancies, he is going to make the nomination.\\n\\nBASH: But…\\n\\nLEAHY: And the — it would be a sheer dereliction of duty for the Senate not to have a hearing, not to have a vote. You know, we have got…\\n\\nBASH: But, Senator, I want to ask you about — about something called the Thurmond rule, which is an informal agreement in the Senate that the party not in the White House blocks all judicial nominees during a presidential campaign season.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK) BASH: You subscribed to that when it was the opposite, so why is it different now?\\n\\nLEAHY: Well, there is no such thing as a Thurmond rule. I used to tease the Republicans about it. But I will give you an example. For the last two years of President George W. Bush's term, Democrats were in control of the Senate. By this time, we had confirmed two or three times as many judges of George Bush's than the Republicans have of President Obama's. They're playing politics, the same way they did when they killed about 70 of President Clinton's judges by their pocket veto. The fact of the matter is, a Supreme Court justice, let's have a vote. Let's have a debate. The Senate has more recesses scheduled, more holidays scheduled this year than I have ever seen in my time there.\\n\\nBASH: Right, but…\\n\\nLEAHY: We ought to go forward, have a debate.\\n\\nBASH: You know that the Republicans are arguing it's not about time spent in Washington. It's about which president gets the chance to nominate the pick. You know, I have been covering you in the Senate for a very long time. And I just know from experience, as do you, where you sit on these issues depends on where you stand. And if there were a Republican in the White House, Democrats were in charge of the Senate right now, I bet you would be arguing to move forward on the Supreme Court nominee. Fair?\\n\\nLEAHY: No. In fact, I was there when the Democrats were in charge of the Senate in the last year of President Reagan's term, a member of the Judiciary Committee, and I urged that we go forward with President Reagan's nomination. And we did. So, I mean, I'm pretty clear where I am. Now, Justice Scalia was a friend of mine. We disagreed on a lot of things. I had a lot of respect for him and his family. In fact, his youngest son and our youngest son used to play soccer in grade school on Saturday mornings. Justice Scalia, Nino — we would call him Nino — and I would stand there in our old clothes watching the kids playing and joking back and forth. So, I mean, this has to be a terrible blow to his family. Let's not add to that blow by politicizing this. Let's do exactly what President Obama, what Democrats did for President Reagan and have the vote.\\n\\nBASH: Senator Leahy?\\n\\nLEAHY: Yes, go ahead.\\n\\nBASH: Do you think that — do you think that if Republicans continue down this road, that they say they're not going to bring up whomever the nominee is for a vote, would you recommend to the president a recess appointment?\\n\\nLEAHY: I don't even think we're there. I think the president — and I have talked to the White House last night — I think the president has to nominate somebody, nominate a qualified person, a highly qualified person.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBASH: But would you rule — would you rule it out if things don't change the way they are now?\\n\\nLEAHY: Well, I don't even think — I don't even think we're there. I think what we ought to do is nominate somebody. If the Republican leadership refuses to even hold a hearing, I think that is going to guarantee they lose control of the Senate, because I don't think the American people will stand for that. They want us to do our job. They can see us doing recess after recess, time off all year long. Tell us to come back, cancel one of those recesses, come back and have the hearing and have a vote. That's what the American people expect the Senate to do."}

{"original": "Officials at the Kansas Secretary of State's office have confirmed that Angus Woolley, a three-year-old Wirehaired Vizsla is not eligible to run for governor.\\n\\nTerran Woolley of Hutchinson, Kansas, filed papers for his dog to run for governor after a report by the Kansas City Star said that the state had no law laying out requirements for gubernatorial candidates, according to The Hill.\\n\\nThe Secretary of State's office, though, pulled the leash on the pup's candidacy, saying that little Angus was ineligible.\\n\\nA dog will not be allowed to file and put its name on the ballot, state spokesman Bryan Caskey said.\\n\\nThere's several laws that reference that the governor has to be an individual or a person, and so we are relying on that, and if a dog comes in to file for office, we will not allow that, Caskey added.\\n\\nCaskey may have brought the dog's application upon himself when he told the Star that he was unsure of how the state would handle a non-human candidate trying to run for office.\\n\\nI'm not sure how to answer that, Caskey said when asked what would happen if a dog filed to run for governor. Because I cannot point to a law that sets any qualifications to run for governor. So a dog has never tried to file — I don't know what would happen if one tried to. … I can't point you to a law that says anything about the qualifications to run for governor.\\n\\nAfter Angus Woolley filed, though, it appears that officials found their reason quickly enough.\\n\\nThe 2018 election had already garnered national attention when six teenaged boys filed to run for Kansas's top office. The candidacies set the state scrambling to put new rules in place laying out requirements for office.\\n\\nCurrent Kansas law lays out no minimum requirements for gubernatorial candidates. In the Star article, Caskey noted there are no qualifications, no age, no residency, no experience. Nothing.\\n\\nLawmakers, though, were brought to heel and are now rushing to change that with the debacle unfolding before their eyes.\\n\\nLast week a legislative committee hastily introduced a bill that would bar people under age 18 from running for statewide office.

{"original": "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is helping U.S. graduates by ending the lottery for H-1B foreign workers that has allowed Fortune 500 CEOs to import mid-skilled, poorly-paid foreign graduates for the starter jobs needed by U.S. graduates.\\n\\nThe new process will allocate the annual supply of 85,000 H-1B visas to corporations that offer the highest pay. The ranking system will end the economic incentive to hire mid-skilled H-1B foreign workers instead of younger American graduates. Currently, companies, universities, and hospitals keep roughly 1 million H-1B non-immigrant contract workers in jobs which sidelined, unemployed, or underpaid American professionals need.\\n\\nWhat this new policy will do is encourage companies to only ask for H-1Bs to fill higher salary jobs, not to fill the starter and mid-career jobs needed by Americans, said Kevin Lynn, the director of U.S. Tech Workers. Under her current [lottery] system, we encourage companies to recruit the lower-wage workers, so denying jobs to new U.S. graduates, he said.\\n\\nThe policy may help employers in lower-cost states, help sidelined American medical graduates get jobs, reduce universities' ability to get foreign students into U.S. jobs, and also exclude all of the lower-skill, lower-wage foreign workers who got H-1Bs in prior years, according to Greg Siskind, a prominent immigration lawyer who opposes the new rule.\\n\\nHowever, the beneficial reform may be trashed before it reshapes the huge H-1B graduate outsourcing program because it faces fierce opposition from Democrat-allied immigration lawyers, as well as many of President-elect Joe Biden's allies in the Fortune 500, on Wall Street, and in the university sector.\\n\\nThe reform does not cover the 2021 award of 85,000 new visas because it was processed so late in President Donald Trump's administration.\\n\\nThe H-1B temporary visa program has been exploited and abused by employers primarily seeking to fill entry-level positions and reduce overall business costs, said Joseph Edlow, the policy director at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) agency. He continued:\\n\\nThe current H-1B random selection process makes it difficult for businesses to plan their hiring, fails to leverage the program to compete for the best and brightest international workforce, and has predominately resulted in the annual influx of foreign labor placed in low-wage positions at the expense of U.S. workers.\\n\\nA USCIS statement added:\\n\\nThe final rule will be effective 60 days after its publication in the Federal Register. DHS previously published a notice of proposed rulemaking on Nov. 2, 2020, and carefully considered the public comments received before deciding to publish the proposed regulations as a final rule.\\n\\nThe rule was applauded by Daniel Costa, at the left-wing Economic Policy Institute.\\n\\nThis rule comes from an admin we all hate, he tweeted, but the substance takes a lottery that randomly allocates H-1B visas & instead prioritizes them for the highest-paid workers, which incentivizes better pay for migrants. Someone will have to explain to me why that's bad. Notably, Costa did not discuss the possible benefits for American graduates.\\n\\nThe H-1B visa, however, is just one part of a huge pyramid of imported labor that is used by U.S. investors to spike stock values and to corral their control over the technology sector.\\n\\nThe imported labor force exists because Congress allows companies to provide green cards to roughly 70,000 foreign workers each year. As a result, at least 1 million foreign graduates are competing in U.S. workplaces for those green cards or are waiting for promised green cards.\\n\\nThis foreign labor force, which is dubbed the Green Card Workforce, is often preferred by executives because the dangled green cards ensure that the foreign workers will work long hours for lower wages. In addition, the workers have no legal protections in the workplace and have no professional authority to disagree with CEOs, who can also gain personally when Wall Street welcomes each outsourcing decision.\\n\\nCompanies also crimp and slow technological domestic competition by hiring visa workers instead of American graduates. In the early 2000s, the federal government broke up an illegal no-poaching cartel by tech companies who were trying to prevent their American workers from changing jobs and so sharing their expertise with rival companies. This strategy is legal if the workforce consists of H-1B workers who cannot change jobs without their managers' permission.\\n\\nMany U.S. and Indian employees tell Breitbart News that American graduates are excluded from competing from many Fortune 500 jobs so that the jobs can be traded by hiring managers to foreign workers who want to win green cards.\\n\\nIn 2011, for example, a California-based health insurance company fired 40 Americans to hire a larger and more expensive workforce of H-1B workers, according to testimony from a company employee in a subsequent lawsuit. In 2020, Facebook was sued by the federal government for hiring policies that discriminate against American graduates.\\n\\nThe labor pyramid includes H-1Bs hired by the companies and by their subcontracting companies. The categories of workers also include J-1s, TNs, OPTs, B-1/B-2s, and foreign graduates who overstay their visas. Most work for Fortune 500 companies, but they are also prominent in tech firms, universities, and increasingly in the healthcare sector.\\n\\nThis huge imported workforce ensures that executives rarely have to compete for American graduates by offering higher wages, even when profits are growing. A 2020 report by the Federal Reserve said median salaries for U.S. graduates fell by two percent from 2016 to 2019 as blue-collar salaries rose amid President Donald Trump's border policies.\\n\\nThere is some evidence that the increasing use of visa workers is reducing U.S. technological capability, even as Chinese companies take the lead from investor-driven U.S. companies.\\n\\nThis growing use of this Green Card Workforce is ignored and misunderstood by the largely powerless white-collar reporters in the corporate media. Many media companies — such as the Washington Post — are owned by firms or investors who want to grow the Green Card Workforce. Other white-collar reporters choose to view the visa workers via the lens of progressive immigration politics, even though the H-1B workers are foreign contract workers who replace white-collar Americans and who do not become immigrants until they receive a green card."}

{"original": "An incredible 27% of U.S. cable TV subscribers plan to end their subscriptions by the end of 2021, which is nearly double the 15% that did so in 2020 and a big jump from the 3% annual decline [in] 2020, reports TV Technology.\\n\\nThis is another disaster for left-wing Hollywood and the fake news media, for it is through the cable TV racket that naïve Americans pay a monthly fortune for channels they never watch. And it is this racket that allows failing left-wing outlets like MTV, CNNLOL, and ESPN to hold on.\\n\\nYep, whether you watch them or not, all of these left-wing channels receive a piece of your cable bill, and it is this unearned money keeps them afloat.\\n\\nStreaming TV is a very different thing. Outlets like Netflix and Amazon actually survive on merit. No one forces you to pay for Netflix. Whereas with cable TV, if you want to watch a certain channel, you have to pay for dozens of others. It's obscene, it's left-wing affirmative action, and only through canceling your cable (or satellite TV) can you bring this obscenity to an end.\\n\\nSo here's why people are eager to cancel their cable TV, per this stunning new report…\\n\\n[S]treaming consumption now accounts for 68% of TV viewing versus 28% for traditional TV viewing.\\n\\nCan you believe that? Do you know how remarkable that is? That kind of massive behavior change in just a short period of time? Wow.\\n\\nOh, and then there's the sports issue… In the past, one of the biggest reasons people held on to their obnoxiously-priced cable TV package was news and sports. Streaming was not so hot when it came to live programming. It's still not, but it has improved. There are all kinds of live news channels now, if that's your thing. But sports was the biggest factor in holding people back.\\n\\nWell, now that sports has become more available via streaming and also has (although the report doesn't say so, but let's use our brains) become so politicized and divisive, people are willing to let go…\\n\\nWhat is widely seen as the biggest draw for traditional TV, live sports, is seeing its importance waning. The Trade Desk found that only 30% of U.S. consumers cite live sports as a reason to maintain their cable TV subscription; Trade Desk says nine months prior that number was at 60%. Since the pandemic, Trade Desk says that 39% of sports viewers are watching live sports either through Connected TVs or social media.\\n\\nA drop from 60 percent to just 30 percent. Again, remarkable.\\n\\nTwo other important bullet points. The first one speaks for itself…\\n\\nCOVID has accelerated cord-cutting trends that were already underway, to a point where less than 50% of U.S. households today have a cable subscription.\\n\\nFewer than 50 percent of households currently pay for cable TV, and if these numbers hold as far as cancellations this year, that number could drop to 40 percent by next year.\\n\\nSecond bullet point… The report says:\\n\\n[T]there is still a limit to what people are willing to spend on streaming services. Just above half of U.S. consumers (51%) say they would not spend more than $20 on streaming subscriptions. Also, consumers are more than five-times as likely to prefer free or low-cost streaming TV with ads over services with higher monthly subscription fees with no ads (72% vs. 14%), Trade Desk found.\\n\\nThis means a lot less money for Hollywood and the fake news media.\\n\\nRight now, if you are silly enough to still pay for cable (I canceled five years ago), you are subsidizing pretty much every major media conglomerate out there, because at least some of their channels are forced onto your package. Streaming, on the other hand, means you are only funding those companies that have won your business through merit, by actually having something to offer.\\n\\nFinally, you are also going to find a lot more free streaming outlets popping up, places like IMDB TV and Pluto, that offer all kinds of TV and movies, and all for free if you are willing to sit through a few commercials (Pluto is great, like a free cable package).\\n\\nRight now you're besieged with 20 minutes of ads per hour on cable TV, and you're paying through the nose for that. These streaming outlets with ads do not have anywhere near that amount of ads, and they are free.\\n\\nSo, honestly, what is stopping you from canceling your cable TV?\\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

{"original": "The Scottish National Party (SNP) has been slammed over guidance which claims that supposedly offensive terminology like British values could inspire terror attacks.\\n\\nThe concept [of British values] can cause offence and could play into the hands of groups who seek to assert that there is an inherent conflict between being British and being Muslim, Scottish teachers have been told. Defending the move, a spokesman said using the wrong words in the classroom could amplify the rhetoric used by terrorists and violent extremists.\\n\\nUK Security Minister Ben Wallace accused Education Scotland of putting PC [politically correct] politics before children's safety when the directive — which stresses the importance of using appropriate and accurate terms when discussing terror — came to light at the weekend.\\n\\nDrawn up in partnership with the Scottish government, the Education Scotland document provides what it calls an overview of language which should and should not be used during classroom discussions on terror attacks and violent extremism, reports The Sun.\\n\\nFeaturing a list of terms divided into columns labelled safe and problematic, the Holyrood guide urged teachers to think carefully before selecting the right words.\\n\\nWith British values appearing in the problematic column, juxtaposed with the safe term shared values, educators learn from the paper that the former term could cause offence.\\n\\nTeachers should refer to shared values rather than British because pupils must be moulded into responsible citizens who respect other people, different beliefs and cultures, said the Scottish document, which called to mind the SNP regime's enthusiasm for PISA's announcement that international education rankings would begin testing for how well schools are nurturing globalist attitudes.\\n\\nEducation spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives, Liz Smith, warned that parents would be astonished and very angry at the edicts, asserting that British values are part of our history and are important to this country's culture.\\n\\nAccording to official SNP advice, it is 'dangerous' for educators to refer to the word Islamist — frequently used to refer to fundamentalist adherence to Islam — as it risks non-expert audience linking the phenomena to ordinary Muslims in some way.\\n\\nAll audiences will make a connection to the Muslim faith.

{"original": "North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un delivered his much-anticipated New Year's address in the early hours of Tuesday morning. As expected, the speech was largely focused on North Korea's economy but included some mixed messages about denuclearization.\\n\\nKim said he remains committed to eliminating nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula and is ready for a second summit with President Donald Trump, but also warned he will find a new way to settle peace on our peninsula if the United States misinterprets our people's patience, and makes one-sided demands and continues down the path of sanctions and pressure on our republic.\\n\\nIf the United States takes sincere measures and corresponding action to our leading and pre-emptive efforts, then relations will advance at a fast and excellent pace through the process of implementing definite and groundbreaking measures, he said.\\n\\nThe New Year's address is an annual event in North Korea dating back to the reign of Kim's grandfather, Kim Il-sung. It is designed for domestic consumption, somewhat like the State of the Union address in the United States, but is closely watched by foreign observers for clues to the dictatorship's attitude and intentions for the coming year.\\n\\nLast year's speech was seen as especially significant because it presaged North Korea's diplomatic opening in 2018, a shift to better relations with South Korea and a more positive international outlook that appears set to continue in 2019, judging from Kim's latest address.\\n\\nForeign analysts found significance in the setting for the speech, with Kim dressed in a business suit and seated at a desk instead of speaking from behind a lectern, signaling a focus on commercial interests instead of militaristic belligerence.\\n\\nDuyeon Kim of the Center for American Security told CNN he found Kim's message confident, normal, sophisticated and reminiscent of the feel of the Singapore summit setting when Kim met with Trump last summer.\\n\\nBut he still sent a very firm word of caution, bordering a nuanced threat, that if Washington doesn't keep its Singapore promise and continues with sanctions, then he has Plan B in mind and will go his separate way. He's exuding confidence that his country isn't hung up over the US, that they can still prosper without Washington, the analyst added.\\n\\nOverall, Kim's speech seems to have landed on the high side of analysts' expectations, with Kim claiming he is no longer interested in nuclear weapons research (he said North Korea has reached all of its goals in that regard) and might be willing to cap weapons production if the United States reciprocates in some unspecified manner. North Korea always interprets denuclearization to mean removing or limiting all nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula, including those deployed to protect South Korea.\\n\\nAlthough he said he wished to pursue economic development instead of nuclear missiles, Kim threatened to change course if the United States does not begin granting sanctions relief and making other reciprocal gestures in 2019. The United States has firmly insisted North Korea must achieve complete and verifiable denuclearization before sanctions will be lifted and views Pyongyang's disarmament measures to date as largely symbolic.\\n\\nIf the US does not keep its promise made in front of the whole world… and insists on sanctions and pressures on our republic, we may be left with no choice but to consider a new way to safeguard our sovereignty and interests, Kim said, as translated by the BBC.\\n\\nNorth Korea also interprets the pathway to peaceful relations on the Korean Peninsula as requiring an end to military cooperation between South Korea and the United States and its allies. To that end, Kim used his New Year's address to call for a permanent end to joint military drills between the U.S. and South Korea. The drills were scaled back in 2018 to encourage North Korea's turn towards diplomacy.\\n\\nKim also signaled a willingness to continue improving relations with South Korea. Let's usher in a heyday of peace, prosperity, and reunification of the Korean Peninsula by thoroughly implementing the historic North-South declarations! he said, referring to the declarations issued after his summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\\n\\nKim made offers to resume the joint economic project with South Korea at Kaesong and resume South Korean tours to the North Korean resort at Diamond Mountain. Noting that neither would be possible under current sanctions, the New York Post speculated Kim is still interested in driving a wedge between the U.S. and South Korea by making offers that will push Seoul to demand sanctions relief for the North or unilaterally defy the sanctions.\\n\\nSouth Korean business leaders immediately welcomed Kim's offer to resume operations at Kaesong and insisted such activity would not violate sanctions.\\n\\nAdam Mount of the Federation of American Scientists saw the Kim speech overall as a counter-offer in what the North Koreans see as ongoing negotiations over how much of their nuclear capability they will give up, and the rewards they will demand in exchange. He suggested the U.S. consider taking the offer Kim appeared to put on the table Tuesday morning.\\n\\nU.S. negotiators should move decisively in the new year to find out how far Kim is willing to go toward a verified cap on his arsenal. Discussions on reducing or eliminating that arsenal come later, said Mount.\\n\\nThis would make Kim's speech the first real test of U.S. resolve on the path to denuclearization. North Korea spent 2018 trying versions of the stonewalling tactics and tricks it has used successfully against previous U.S. administrations, including supposedly historic concessions that actually did little to reduce its research capabilities or could be easily reversed.\\n\\nAccepting a cap now and working toward denuclearization later, as Mount advised, could be taken by the North Koreans as a signal of weakness because the U.S. has insisted on swift and complete denuclearization. The Trump administration fears that if sanctions are loosened now, the maximum pressure needed to compel denuclearization will never be restored.\\n\\nThere are views that North Korea wants a quick second summit because it thinks it can win major concessions from Trump that they probably couldn't from lower-level U.S. officials, who are more adamant about the North committing to inspections and verification, the New York Post observed.\\n\\nSouth Korea's presidential Blue House responded positively to Kim's address. Chairman Kim's firm commitment is expected to have a positive effect on resolving the Korean Peninsula issue smoothly in the new year, a presidential spokesman said on Tuesday morning.\\n\\nYonhap News quoted South Korea's ruling Democratic Party saying Kim's speech brightens the prospects for North Korean negotiations with the United States and looked forward to epoch-making progress in the year ahead.\\n\\nThe opposition Liberty Korea Party, on the other hand, noted Kim's speech promised no concrete progress toward denuclearization and contained threats to abandon peace efforts if North Korea's demands are not met. Liberty Korea also insisted it would be impossible to resume joint economic projects with North Korea unless substantive progress is made in dismantling Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal."}
{"original": "President Donald Trump told reporters he wants technology companies to import and hire more foreign graduates for prestigious white-collar jobs sought by American graduates.\\n\\nBut Trump also used the same press conference to celebrate the rising blue-collar wages caused by his Hire American policies in his expanding economy. Those policies are pressuring companies to hire Americans instead of imported visa-workers or cheap illegal migrants.\\n\\nThe zig-zag policy comes as the rising blue-collar wages boost Trump's Midwest ratings for 2020, while the stalled white-collar salaries hurt his suburban ratings in 2018 and 2020.\\n\\nIf Trump allows Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Google, Intel, and other leading-edge companies to hire even more foreign graduates, they will hire fewer American graduates and pay them less before the 2020 election.\\n\\nIt is contradictory that Trump wants to raise wages for American and also bring in more workers who will cut salaries, an American technology professional told Breitbart News. It is political suicide … because the tech workers believed [in 2016] he was the only one who stood up for them, said the professional, who fears he will be blackballed by major companies' subcontractors if his identity is revealed.\\n\\nIn the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to reform the H-1B program. Since then, business-first appointees in his administration have blocked proposed reforms by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services division of the Department of Homeland Security.\\n\\nCompanies use various visa worker programs to keep roughly 1.5 million non-immigrant foreign graduates in the United States. Many of those foreign workers are employed by small contracting firms to fill a series of short-term contracts, so minimizing the major companies' payroll costs.\\n\\nTrump's showed his zig-zag policy in the January 4 press conference just after the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that wages rose by 0.4 percent in January, setting the stage for a 4 percent rise in wages throughout 2019. Trump praised the wage growth and the resulting return of sidelined Americans to the job market:\\n\\nOne of the things that is so beautiful to watch is 3.2 percent wage growth. That hasn't happened in so long for our country. That's an incredible thing. That means people are actually getting more money, taking home more money, and that's something that is really nice to see. A lot of you have been following me when we were on a thing called the campaign — that was an exciting campaign, a great campaign — and I used to talk about wages going down, not going up, but going down for years. Nineteen years. And now they went up 3.2 percent and yet there's no inflation because other things are going down, like the price of your gasoline at the tank. It is low and that doesn't happen by luck. I worked hard on that. That's like a tax cut for people. So a lot of good things are happening. Labor participation rate increased to 63.1 [percent]. That's an incredible number also.\\n\\nBut Trump also then reversed himself and said companies should be allowed to hire the foreign graduates from U.S. universities:\\n\\nWe need people. We have to have people because we have all these companies coming in. We need great people. But we want them to come in on a merit basis. They have to come in on a merit basis. They can't come in the way they've been coming in for years. I get calls from the great tech companies and they're saying we don't allow people at the top of their class at the best schools in the country, we don't allow them to stay in our country. So they end up going back to China and Japan and so many other countries all over the world, and we don't keep them. They get educated at our finest schools and then we don't allow them to – through a various set of circumstances — to have any guarantees of staying. So we lose out on great minds. We can't do that. We have companies, if we don't change that, and we're working on that and we discussed that with the Democrats and I think they agree. We're working on that. But we don't want to lose our great companies because we have a ridiculous policy that we won't accept smart people. So call it politically correct or not, but we have to let these great, brilliant companies have the smartest people in the world.\\n\\nThe 2013 Gang of Eight amnesty included a stealth provision which allowed companies to hire an unlimited number of foreign graduates of U.S. universities. If that plan had been implemented, U.S. employers and universities would have permanently flooded the white-collar labor market with millions of very cheap foreign graduates.\\n\\n\\n\\nRoughly 1.5 million foreign visa-workers hold college-graduates jobs in the United States via the various H-1B, OPT, CPT, L-1, J-1, E-3, H4EAD, TN, and O-1 visa programs. Companies are allowed to hire these foreign workers no matter how many young Americans are applying for the same jobs.\\n\\nDespite corporate claims, the vast majority of these foreign workers are lower-skill graduates performing starter jobs that could help Americans launch their careers. In fact, the huge H-1B and OPT programs have created an army of staffing contractors which is used by many Americans companies to lock many American graduates out of starter jobs in software, science, and engineering.\\n\\nWorse, these foreign workers — most of whom are employed as contractors by little-known foreign-0wned staffing companies — usually accept lower wages than Americans because they hope to be paid by winning the hugely valuable deferred bonus of green cards from the U.S. government. Americans cannot get that federal bonus because they are already citizens.\\n\\nMany of the foreign workers are mid-tier graduates doing work that can be easily accomplished by experienced U.S. graduates.\\n\\nOnly a small percentage of the visa workers are elite people who cannot be replaced even if U.S. companies tried to hire similar American experts away from other Americans companies.\\n\\nSome of these elite workers are imported via the 0-1 visa program which has no cap. The O-1 visa rules say:\\n\\nThe O-1 nonimmigrant visa is for the individual who possesses extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics … … To qualify for an O-1 visa, the beneficiary must demonstrate extraordinary ability by sustained national or international acclaim and must be coming temporarily to the United States to continue work in the area of extraordinary ability. Extraordinary ability in the fields of science, education, business or athletics means a level of expertise indicating that the person is one of the small percentage who has risen to the very top of the field of endeavor.\\n\\nThe companies' demand to hire the best foreign graduates is belied by their mass hiring of lower-skill and mid-tier foreign graduates, said the U.S. professional. If the best-ranked foreign graduates are really that good, they can meet the O-1 requirements, he said, adding they are not the best and brightest … [because companies] want the indentured workforce and the cheap labor.\\n\\nIn 2016 testimony to the Senate, Howard University professor Ron Hira testified that:\\n\\n41 percent of the [H-1B] workers approved [in 2015] by the government were at wage Level 1 [which is defined as] a basic understanding of the occupation. These employees perform routine tasks that require limited, if any, exercise of judgment … Level I wages are typically 40% below the average wage. Almost another forty percent of approved H-1B applications were at second lowest wage level, Level II, which is typically 20% below the average wage for Americans in those occupations. So, nearly 4-in-5 H-1B applications were approved by the U.S. Department of Labor for the lowest two wage levels, providing large discounts to employers.\\n\\nThe companies' massive use of H-1B workers can be tracked at H1Bfacts.com, MyVisaJobs.com, and at some government sites. For example, Google sought to hire 4,875 H-1B workers in 2018, sponsored 764 other foreign employees for green cards, and employed 1,501 foreign OPT workers in 2017, even as top managers developed plans to block conservatives' use of the Internet.\\n\\nThe 1.5 million foreign workers are heavily used by major technology companies and many software companies, banks, insurance companies, universities, consulting companies, accountancy, and engineering firms. The employers are concentrated in California, Texas, and New York, but are also used through the country. For example, many visa workers are being used by banks and insurance companies in Connecticut and North Carolina, even as middle-aged U.S. workers are being fired.\\n\\nExecutives at brand-name companies, including the fiercely-anti-Trump executives at the information technology companies, are pleading with Trump to let them import more workers, and are fighting against plans to eliminate the H4EAD visa-worker program for 100,000 spouses of visa workers.\\n\\nTech Billionaires urge fast-track green cards for 400,000 contract visa-workers – and many more later. Just guessing here, but maybe most Americans prefer fewer visa workers for biz & higher salaries for their families? https://t.co/yXhMswXOXK — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) December 8, 2018\\n\\nTheir pleas come as rising salaries eat into corporate profits and stock values. In January, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that salaries for information workers rose by 5.7 percent from December 2017 to December 2018. That rate was much higher than the 3.2 percent rise for all workers.\\n\\nThese visa worker programs are little recognized by most voters but are very unpopular among white-c0llar professionals who have seen their colleges get replaces by foreign workers. That unpopularity helped defeat Kansas GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder in November after he alienated college graduate voters in his suburban district by supporting a back-door country caps expansion of the visa worker programs.\\n\\nGOP Reps. are still pushing Rep. Yoder's middle-class outsourcing bill to put 600K Indian visa-workers & families on fast-track to US jobs/voting. It would help CEOs import more Indians for US college-grad jobs – w/o any benefit for US workers or even GOP. https://t.co/LD8q3SjYRg — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) December 3, 2018\\n\\nNationwide, the U.S. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\\n\\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\\n\\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland."}
{"original": "Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) told Breitbart News exclusively that Democrat challenger Jon Ossoff's pledge to grant amnesty to every illegal alien in America is a threat to American workers struggling to recover from the coronavirus pandemic and, as such, would be unfair to American citizens and legal immigrants.\\n\\nAppearing on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel this weekend, Perdue lit into Ossoff's pledge to grant a blanket amnesty to all illegal aliens in America, deeming it an affront to legal immigrants and struggling American workers alike.\\n\\nHe not only wants to give them amnesty, but he said he wants illegals to be able to vote, Perdue told Breitbart News. He doesn't see anything wrong with undocumented people in this country voting and having access to benefits. He has said he will give a blanket amnesty. So, what does that say to the millions of people who have come to our country and gone through our immigration protocol properly and done it the right way and earned their citizenship? I know hundreds of people who just here in Georgia did that and they're outraged by his position because it totally denigrates what they did. The second thing is it's a threat to the American worker right now. We've got a situation where we've got to grow our economy and we've got to get over Covid [Chinese coronavirus], and a blanket amnesty just opens the door.\\n\\nIn addition to the economic devastation an open borders policy that Ossoff champions — which he laid out at a LatinX for Ossoff event last week — would create, Perdue said the public safety concerns with the leftist vision of defunding police combined with sanctuary cities is a recipe for disaster for Georgians who should want checks and balances in the U.S. Senate rather than a blank check to the open borders lobbyists.\\n\\nCombine that with what they want to do with open borders, sanctuary cities, and defunding the police, Perdue said. Explain to me how that makes our cities safer. If you want to see what Georgia would look like, and you've said this before, under a Democratic regime in Washington, just go to California. Look at the anarchy in the streets of Portland, Oregon, today. Atlanta is now tied with Chicago as the murder capital of the world on a per capita basis. This is not something Democrats will own up to, that they do not want to talk about, so he is pandering to that Latino community and my question is the same thing I would ask the African American community: What have they done for you lately? President [Donald] Trump has just passed tremendous things that help both communities. We passed opportunity zones, which brings millions of dollars into these economically challenged areas in both the Latino and the African American communities. We've funded HBCUs, our historically black colleges and universities, and we passed a criminal justice reform act that we've been trying to do forever to correct the Joe Biden bill from 1994. The Latino community is smarter than these Democrats think. We did very well with them in the general election and we're going to do well with them on Tuesday. We've just got to get all Republican voters out on Tuesday. It is absolutely essential that every person who's concerned about the future of America must hold the line here. If we win Georgia, we indeed save America.\\n\\nPerdue faces off against Ossoff on Tuesday, while Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) faces Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock, in the Georgia Senate runoffs. These seats will determine control of the U.S. Senate, as Republicans currently have at least 50 seats and Democrats currently have at least 48 seats. If the Democrats take both of these seats, then Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the deciding vote in the U.S. Senate — and Democrats would control the Senate floor and all the committees. The importance of these races is highlighted by the fact that both President Donald Trump and President-elect Joe Biden are heading to Georgia on Monday, the day before the election, to give last-minute boosts to their parties' candidates.\\n\\nThe most dramatic thing I can tell your listeners is if we lose these two seats in Georgia, then [Sen.] Bernie Sanders [I-VT] would be chairman of the Budget Committee, Perdue said. It doesn't get much further left than that. But the Senate, if we hold these seats, we can be the balance of power in Washington that keeps the Democrats from perpetrating this leftwing leftist agenda that's too dangerous for our country. We get to advise and consent on all nominees. That's Justice nominees, that's cabinet members, a lot of people that go into an administration have to come through the Senate to get confirmed. So we can control and get some of the more radical people out of the government. That's why you have checks and balances. It's worked in our country extremely well for 230 years. Democrats now just believe that America is wrong. Obama apologized for America all during his administration. So what is at stake here is if they get these two seats they will perpetrate the agenda and load up the cabinet with very liberal people who have no idea how this economy works and want to perpetrate their own agenda and then the courts will be absolutely decimated. They will stack the courts and not just the Supreme Court but the appellate courts and federal judges and they want to increase the number of seats until they get the balance that they want. We won't ever get that back. They'll change the filibuster rule which as you know is very difficult and we'll never be able to get that back and that means they are creating a single-party system. This is what was tried in Cuba and Venezuela and North Korea and Iran and all the places we know it's failed. They want total control. AOC said that 'we want to win these two seats so we don't have to negotiate.' Then, defund the police, open borders, sanctuary cities, amnesty, higher taxes, socialization of our healthcare, and the Green New Deal. All of this becomes our reality if in fact we don't hold these two seats.\\n\\nPerdue did express some confidence, too, that Republicans will be successful if the GOP base turns out to vote on Tuesday.\\n\\nWhat's at stake here is absolutely critical. We are holding the line here for the country to maintain a balance of power, Perdue said. If you look at what we have to do, it's simply to get our vote out. Five million people voted in November. There were nefarious activities that went on allegedly, and we have done a lot to add to the integrity of that by putting poll watchers in and we've got cameras on these drop boxes, so on and so forth. We're doing everything we can to make sure every vote is counted legally and accurately on Jan. 5. But what we've really got to do, we've only gotten 3 million out to vote so far. That's off from where we were in November — I think some 3.6 million had voted already by this point in November. So we've got a ways to go but we've got to get our vote out. We also know that Republicans win on election day. If there's any Republicans out there, any conservatives out there, any independents or libertarians out there who haven't voted it, they owe it to their children and grandchildren to help us hold the line against this radical socialist agenda. That's what's at stake here, pure and simple. I know that sounds like trite words, but this is not the typical election where you can just correct it in two or four years. If these things get done, we will not be able to help self-correct this. We have to maintain a balance of power in Washington to avoid this left-wing agenda that the Democrats are trying to perpetrate.\\n\\nLISTEN TO SEN. DAVID PERDUE ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY:"}

{"original": "President Joe Biden's amnesty bill will try to accelerate the conversion of amnestied migrants into U.S. voters, according to Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.\\n\\nWe're going to reduce the time from what is now, what has been [in prior amnesty legislation] 13 years to eight years, Harris told Univision, a Spanish-language TV station January 12. She continued:\\n\\nWe're going to be tightening up the whole process for green cards, and making sure that we give people a very defined period of time, from the time that they actually apply for a green card through the time of obtaining citizenship.\\n\\nThe current law says that people who win green cards can become citizens and vote in just five years. Prior legislation also set a multi-year delay — around eight years — between an amnesty and the receipt of green cards.\\n\\nIf Congress were to approve a seven-year gap between amnesty, green cards, and citizenship, it could allow many of the huge population of illegal aliens to vote in the 2028 presidential election, when Harris may be running for president.\\n\\nHarris also suggested that Biden's team would try to get citizenship for people who got Temporary Protected Status (TPS) from President Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, or Barack Obama.\\n\\nThe immigration process is going to be about shortening the time by creating more and greater efficiencies, allowing people who have Temporary Protected Status — and in particular dreamers and TPS holders — to automatically get green cards.\\n\\nHarris's statement was vague, but her comment about automatic green cards for TPS migrants suggests Biden may push for a law that allows every group of TPS migrants to get citizenship, said Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies.\\n\\nThe value of Americans' citizenship would be reduced because Presidents would simply be able to give citizenship out to anybody after first selecting them for TPS, said Krikorian. He could award green cards — which permit citizenship — to anybody he wants from any country in any number — it is appalling.\\n\\nA TPS-to-citizenship rule would further reduce American' power over who gets to be an American, Krikorian said:\\n\\nIt's a dangerous thing because Congress can change immigration law anyway but that has to be done through a process of debate and deliberation and people have to vote on it, and those people are accountable to voters [every two years]. The President, of course, is accountable to voters but this would make any political control over immigration much more difficult … A president would be tempted to use it for whatever purpose they want at the time. It could be to serve business interests. It could be to serve foreign policy interests, to promote the political objectives of the President.\\n\\nChanges like this would represent Congress dissolving the American people and importing a new one — [that is] a little bit of an exaggeration, but that's where this is headed, Krikorian said.\\n\\nHarris did not suggest that the amnesty be coupled with protection for Americans, so the proposed TPS-to-citizen rule would also invert political power in Wahington, Krikorian added;\\n\\nThe current rule is that the President can keep out anyone he thinks necessary but needs Congress's permission to let people in. This would be the other way around — the President would be barred from keeping people out [by the amnesty] and be empowered to let in anyone he felt like [via the TPS rule].\\n\\nBiden's nominee to run the Department of Homeland Security is Alejandro Mayorkas. When he worked at the department during Obama's tenure, Mayorkas pressured officials to ignore fraud and rapidly grant visas and green cards to migrants.\\n\\nHarris' promise of more amnesty — and therefore, more workers and lower wages — come as millions of Americans struggle to pay their bills. The New York Times reported January 13 about the rising number of women who display themselves nude to raise funds:\\n\\nA restaurant worker in Billings, Mont., Ms. Eixenberger, 22, has been laid off three times during the pandemic and was so in need of cash by October that she had to drop out of dental hygiene school. After donating plasma and doing odd jobs, she still didn't have enough to pay her bills, so at the suggestion of some friends, she turned to OnlyFans. She has made only about $500 so far. … Elle Morocco of West Palm Beach, Fla., was laid off from her job as an office manager in July. Her unemployment checks don't cover her $1,600 monthly rent, utility bills and food costs, so she joined OnlyFans in November. … She has made just $250 on the platform so far, despite sometimes spending upward of eight hours a day creating, posting and promoting her content. Ms. Morocco also worries that her presence on the platform will make it more difficult for her to be hired for traditional jobs in the future. If you're looking for a 9 to 5, they might not hire you if they find out you have an OnlyFans, she said. They may not want you if they know you're a sex worker.\\n\\nJoe Biden's would-be immigration chief says a 'comprehensive' immig. deal would raise wages.\\n\\nNobody believes that Wall St. cover story – except the people paid to promote it & the estb. journos whose editors don't want them to follow the money.\\n\\nSee here: https://t.co/t6NqxK7Azv — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) December 9, 2020\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, Biden's pro-migration, cheap-labor policies are very unpopular, especially among legal immigrants whose wages, jobs, and neighborhoods are at most risk.\\n\\nMany polls show that the public — white, brown, or black — personally welcomes legal migrants but also much prefers that new jobs go to Americans first.\\n\\nIn April 2020, a Washington Post poll showed that 69 percent of Hispanics said yes when they were asked, Would you support … temporarily blocking nearly all immigration into the United States during the coronavirus outbreak? Just 30 percent of Hispanics opposed the border shutdown.\\n\\nThe polls also show that the public strongly opposes the white-collar visa-worker programs that boost Fortune 500 stock prices by suppressing technological competition and job opportunities for American graduates.\\n\\nJoe Biden's 2020 plan promises to let companies import more visa workers, to let mayors import temporary workers, to accelerate the inflow of chain-migration migrants, to end migration enforcement against illegal aliens unless they commit a felony, and to dramatically accelerate the inflow of poor refugees to at least 125,000 per year.\\n\\nMigration moves money from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from children to their parents, from homebuyers to real estate investors, and from the central states to the coastal states.\\n\\nMigration also allows investors and CEOs to skimp on labor-saving technology, sideline U.S. minorities, ignore disabled people, exploit stoop labor in the fields, shortchange labor in the cities, impose tight control and pay cuts on American professionals, corral technological innovation by minimizing the employment of American graduates, undermine labor rights, and even get many progressive journalists to cheerlead for Wall Street's priorities."}

That's when police say the illegal alien shot Singh. Over his police radio, Singh called out shots fired, and as police arrived at the scene of the traffic stop, they found the officer with a gunshot wound.\\n\\nSingh was transported to a nearby hospital, where he later died, leaving behind his wife Anamika and their newborn five-month-old son.\\n\\nPerez Arriaga was arrested in December 2018 for the killing of Singh — a legal immigrant from Fiji — but was officially charged with the murder of a law enforcement officer last week. The illegal alien, whom authorities said is a known gang member, had been caught by police after a more than 50-hour manhunt.\\n\\nAccording to federal documents, Arriaga had allegedly quickly paid a human smuggler — the same one that helped his family members enter the U.S. illegally years before — about $400 in a wire transfer to cross him back from California to Mexico to evade arrest and charges for Singh's murder.\\n\\nSeven of Arriaga's friends and family members were arrested and charged by authorities for allegedly helping him try to evade arrest and escape from the country. All of the seven individuals are illegal aliens and they include:\\n\\nArriaga's brother, 34-year-old Conrado Virgen Arriaga\\n\\nArriaga's brother, 25-year-old Adrian Virgen\\n\\nArriaga's girlfriend, 30-year-old Ana Leyde Cervantes\\n\\nArriaga's co-worker, 35-year-old Erik Razo Quiroz\\n\\nArriaga's family member, 59-year-old Bernabe Madrigal Castaneda\\n\\nArriaga's family member, 57-year-old Maria Luisa Moreno\\n\\nArriaga's co-worker, 36-year-old Erasmo Villegas\\n\\nThe affidavit of the alleged murder and attempted escape detailed a family affair where Arriaga's pickup truck — which police found with a bullet hole — had been covered up in a family member's garage with plywood allegedly by his brother, Conrado Virgen Arriaga, and co-worker, Erik Razo Quiroz.\\n\\nArriaga's gun that he allegedly used to murder Singh was purchased just two months before, according to the suspect's girlfriend. The 9mm Smith and Wesson gun was stolen out of Washington state, police said. The suspect's girlfriend told police that after the illegal alien told her he had shot a police officer, she packed three changes of clothes for him.\\n\\nThe affidavit alleges that Arriaga, his brother, and co-worker planned to go to a construction site for a job following the murder but instead headed to their uncle's Stockton, California, ranch but were asked to leave by the aunt and uncle.\\n\\nIn the meantime, police said Quiroz, the suspect's co-worker, threw away Arriaga's gun in a trash can at the ranch.\\n\\nAdrian Virgen, Arriaga's brother, picked him up and took he and the co-worker to an aunt's house in Buttonwillow, California, to stay for the night. The next day, the aunt asked them to leave after finding out that her nephew was wanted for murder, the affidavit claims.\\n\\nVirgen said he lied to his aunt's husband in order to get him to loan him $400 that Arriaga then allegedly wire transferred to a human smuggler at the U.S.-Mexico border to help him escape the country.

{"original": "NEW YORK (AP) — Brent Musburger is calling it a career at ESPN after being the play-by-play man in the booth at sporting events enjoyed by millions of Americans, most prominently when he was the lead voice for CBS Sports in the 1980s.\\n\\nMusburger, who is 77, said he's leaving active sportscasting to help his family get a sports handicapping business started and to use some of the millions of airline miles he's earned for some fun travel.\\n\\nHis last game will be the Kentucky-Georgia men's basketball game on Jan. 31. That takes him back to Rupp Arena, where he called Villanova's historic NCAA championship upset over Georgetown in 1985.\\n\\nBoth Musburger and ESPN say comments about Oklahoma football player Joe Mixon that were criticized as insensitive during the Sugar Bowl earlier this month had nothing to do with his exit. Musburger said he hoped Mixon, who had been suspended for a year after punching a woman and breaking her jaw, would make the most of his second chance and did not initially talk about his victim.\\n\\nA former sportswriter, Musburger's broadcast fame took off through his work on NFL Today, the pro football pregame show. He broadcast the NBA, college basketball, the Masters and tennis — most of CBS' marquee events.\\n\\nHe was behind the mike for one of college football's most memorable plays, Doug Flutie's hail Mary pass that beat Miami for Boston College in 1984. He confessed to Flutie later that it took him awhile to identify Gerald Phelan, Flutie's roommate, as the receiver for that pass — and Flutie told him he didn't know, either, until he had run off the field.\\n\\nMusburger was abruptly dropped by CBS in 1990 in what was perceived as a salary dump, then came to work for ABC and ESPN.\\n\\nBrent made every event feel larger, said Stephanie Druley, ESPN senior vice president for events and studio production. To me, there is probably not a greater storyteller as a play-by-play person. He can spin a yarn like nobody else and it made games definitely more enjoyable to watch.\\n\\nMusburger's opportunities for national exposure grew more limited in recent years when ESPN assigned him to its SEC network for college football. But he still called college basketball regularly and even though ESPN has been trying to save money lately by cutting higher-cost talent, Druley said the network had no interest in seeing him leave.\\n\\nSportscasting today has become more and more numbers-driven, advanced statistics and everything, Musburger said. That's fine. I was never going to change because I'm a people guy. I like pulling up a chair in a saloon with a cold beer and telling stories.\\n\\nMusburger took heat for backward thinking in 2013 when he extolled the attractiveness of an Alabama quarterback's girlfriend, a controversy he finds silly. I called a beauty queen beautiful, he said. Are you kidding me?\\n\\nHe said he hoped people felt comfortable listening to him.\\n\\nNot everyone approved of everything I said, he said. I understand that. I come from a sportswriting background and I'm not afraid to take a position on certain things from time to time. But for the most part, I thought people should be coming to a game to escape for three hours and forget about what their individual problems are.\\n\\nHe said he's not ready to fully retire (I don't do shuffleboard well, he said), but his decision lets ESPN escape from an uncomfortable decision. Having a broadcaster of college games publicly identified with a sports handicapping business wouldn't fly. That accounts for the odd timing of his departure in the middle of the college basketball season; his family wants the site fully operational by the NCAA men's basketball tournament.\\n\\nIf anything, the move will force Musburger to change a pat answer when he's approached by fans.\\n\\nThey always ask me my favorite game and I always say, 'The next one,' he said.\\n\\nAfter next Tuesday, that will no longer be applicable."}

They will file suit and seek to stop the implementation of the executive gun controls based on their conviction that Obama lacks the authority to change the legal definition of who must obtain a dealer's license.\\n\\nAnd Freedom Watch will almost certainly not be alone. Gun rights groups are also expected to file suits to stop Obama's actions on the grounds that he has no authority to take them.\\n\\nReuters believes Obama might avoid lawsuits only by issuing executive orders that are advisory in nature rather than binding.

{"original": "Democrats have grabbed several concessions from President Donald Trump in the border wall talks, but continue to claim that economic migrants from Central America should be welcomed as refugees who deserve humanitarian aid from taxpayers.\\n\\nThe Trump concessions include a quiet Christmas request for $2.5 billion instead of the current request $5.7 billion for wall construction in 2019, Trump's decision to drop plans for a concrete wall, and Trump's offer to restart former President Barack Obama's Central American Minors program that was intended to shuttle youths and children from Central America to their illegal migrant parents living in the United States.\\n\\nThe Trump concessions were acknowledged January 7 by Vice President Mike Pence as he briefed reporters on the progress of negotiations. But Pence complained that the Democrats had not offered any concessions of their own:\\n\\nThe question that I have is: When are the Democrats going to start negotiating? We made the position of the President very clear, not only in terms of what our proposal is; we've integrated some of their proposals … We stand ready to sit down with the Democratic leadership.\\n\\nDemocrats have offered nothing in exchange, said Rosemary Jenks, policy director at Numbers USA.\\n\\nThe President went to the negotiating table in good faith. He started with a far smaller [wall funding] number than the original $25 billion and was willing to negotiate further. The [Democratic] response was crickets. At this point, Republicans need to stop negotiating with themselves and wait for the Democrats to come to the table with a offer.\\n\\nThe Democrats' refusal to negotiate was spotlighted by the failure of January 9 talks between Trump and top Democrats.\\n\\nJust left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy, a total waste of time. I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye, nothing else works! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2019\\n\\nIn their response to the President's January 8 address to the nation, Democrats charged that Trump is motivated by malice and claimed the flow of wage-cutting economic migrants deserves a compassionate, welcoming response.\\n\\nMuch of what we heard from President Trump during this senseless shutdown has been misinformation and even malice, said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The migrants are a humanitarian challenge, a challenge that President Trump's own cruel and counter-productive policies have only deepened, she said.\\n\\nIn his January 8 address to the nation, Trump described his decision to drop his proposed concrete wall as a concession to Democrats. At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall, he said.\\n\\nIn his January 7 briefing, Pence explained the short-lived compromise offer of a $2.5 billion wall request was immediately rejected by Democrats.\\n\\nI can neither nor deny the numbers that have floated around about what was offered on the first day of the shutdown [before Christmas]. But I can assure you, it came from the President of the United States. And Senator [Chuck] Schumer knows that. They were provided with documentation of that, that day, to Senator [Mike] Leahy's office and to Senator [Richard] Shelby's office … after Christmas that we were informed there would not be a counteroffer.\\n\\nPence described additional budget proposals as concessions, even though White House officials welcomed the extra spending. He said:\\n\\nWe incorporated ideas that Democrat leaders and Democrat staff had brought to our attention over the course of meeting of principals and over the course of the staff meeting. And we were able to clear with the President those things that the administration was prepared to support. We added those to our request.\\n\\nThose changes included extra funding for technology to detect drugs in vehicles as they pass through the border, plus extra medical support for migrants arriving at the U.S. border. He said:\\n\\nWe have vetted $800 million to address enhanced medical support, transportation, and consumable supplies … we believe that increasing that by $631 million over the '19 level would meet the need of providing the kind of non-intrusive technology to allow us to get at — and not just narcotics, but also, most especially, about human trafficking issues at the border.\\n\\nThe least recognized concession to the Democrats was the proposed restoration of Obama's CAM program, which was quickly frozen in February 2017 by Trump's deputies. Pence said:\\n\\nAnother proposal that was brought to us by the Democratic leadership and that, frankly, I've heard about in my meetings with leaders of Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. And that is, they made a request that we consider allowing children to apply for asylum at our embassy in those countries, as opposed to only being able to apply for asylum by making the long and dangerous journey north.\\n\\nHowever, the restoration of the CAM program would not automatically ensure the delivery of any migrants to their illegal parents in the United States unless the Democrats also demanded a minimal number of transfers each year.\\n\\nPence coupled the CAM concession with Trump's call for legal reforms which would allow the federal government to return younger migrants who lose their court appeals for asylum. He said:\\n\\nThe President and the Secretary of State and I met over that issue, and the President has endorsed that reform that obviously would require a statutory change, along with reallocation of State Department resources in the State Department appropriations bill, but it's one that we're prepared to support. And we also believe that we should match that with one other statutory change that the Secretary just alluded to, which is unaccompanied children who apply for asylum, who, after due process, are determined not to be eligible for asylum … We cannot return them, even if their families request them to be — we cannot return them to their families in Honduras, El Salvador, or Guatemala.\\n\\nThe reciprocal reform, he said, would cut the economic incentive for the cartels to smuggle children and youths into the United States:\\n\\nSo we think — what the Secretary described, is that pull-factor. We think that — by allowing children to apply for asylum in those countries [via the CAM program] and by making it clear that those that are not eligible for asylum will be returned to the countries, we think that we will take part of the incentive that human traffickers use to take thousands of dollars cash to take children on a long and dangerous journey, oftentimes facing physical and sexual abuse along the way north, to attempt to come into our country to take advantage of loopholes in our laws.\\n\\nSince Trump's deputies canceled the CAM program, they have also stepped up identity checks of illegals migrants who pay the cartels to deliver their children to shelters run by the Department of Health and Human Services. Democrats loudly oppose those changes and say migrant youths should be quickly delivered to illegal-migrant sponsors in the United States without any checks on their legal right to live in the United States.\\n\\nIn his talks with the media, Trump has also hinted at broader concessions, including a huge immigration bill that would provide business with more workers and Democrats with more future voters. In his January 19 exchange with reporters, Trump said:\\n\\nI would love to do a big immigration bill where we really repair the situation. … Right now we have a problem, we have to take care of this and it's quicker and easier to do this individually. But we would like to see real immigration reform in this country because we need it and it could be a beautiful thing. With all of the companies coming into our country … we have many car companies and other companies that are going in. Best job numbers … We have the best job numbers, we need people, we need great, qualified people. We want them to come in. So I think it's a great time right now, because of this. … Everybody wants to see immigration reform. It's just, it's overdue. It's always been very political. Maybe this [shutdown crisis] will turn out to be a blessing in disguise … We need strong borders and we need immigration reform, beyond that, we need immigration reform.\\n\\nAny broader immigration reform would be a very risky step by Trump, partly because it would likely put an instant freeze on pay raises before the 2020 elections.\\n\\nCurrently, companies are raising wages for blue-collar workers because they have begun competing for employees in a tight labor market. That market is created by the combination of a growing economy and Trump's Hire American policy of lower migration.\\n\\nWages for white-collar workers are growing slower, in part, because companies already have outsourced jobs to roughly 1.5 million non-immigrant visa workers throughout the United States.\\n\\nDemocrats reject Trump's call for border security – then call for acceptance of more refugees as a humanitarian challenge. IOW, Dems won't recognize that economic migration is a threat to their voters' blue-collar wages & civic equality, See California https://t.co/DLgg0vTMav — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 9, 2019\\n\\nThe Democrats are not negotiating at all, said Rosemary Jenks of NumbersUSA. They're not at the table, and that is why we are in Day 19 of the shutdown. [For Democrats] this isn't a negotiation — this is 'We're going to slap the face of the entire country and we don't give a damn.' she said.\\n\\nThe Democrats' no-concessions policy is being aided by the establishment media, Jenks said. Reporters are yelling questions to the president saying 'How long as re you going to let the shutdown go on?' When are they going to ask the Democrats to do that?\\n\\nBut Democrast will not budge until they feel more pressure from supporters and voters, she said:\\n\\nUntil either the federal workers' unions — which have a lot of sway — put more pressure on them, until the American people start getting in touch with Democratic politicians, I think the Democrats will refuse to move, despite the fact that what they are doing is against the interests of the American people and of America.\\n\\nNationwide, the bipartisan establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\\n\\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\\n\\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland."}

In their own words. Now we know why Obama carried out this completely treasonous deal with the Iranians. It's not about stopping Iran's nukes. It's not about non-proliferation. It's because it fits his academic, philosophical world view. Unfortunately, we have to live in that world after Obama leaves office. And we're going to live in a world with Iran nukes and it's all because of the Manchurian President.\\n\\nAccording to Klein, the New York Times indicates the Iran nuclear deal was partially about a re-orientation of the Middle East.\\n\\nKlein continued:\\n\\nThis seems to me almost a change of the world power scheme after post-World War II. This seems to be the rise of Russia. And now really we have to ask these questions given what they are saying. Is it simply that Obama abandoned the Middle East, abandoned Syria and now Russia is on the rise? Or is this the Manchurian President, who went through with the Iran nuclear deal, according to the aides themselves, because it fit with a certain agenda that Obama has been spinning for almost a decade? Is Obama also deliberately handing the region, or parts of the region, over to adversaries, including Russia?\\n\\nIndeed, in the Times profile, Rhodes himself reveals some of the motivation for the Iran nuclear deal – that the agreement advances Obama's general academic foreign policy philosophies.\\n\\nRhodes related: We can do things that challenge the conventional thinking that, you know, 'AIPAC doesn't like this,' or 'the Israeli government doesn't like this,' or 'the gulf countries don't like it.' It's the possibility of improved relations with adversaries. It's nonproliferation. So all these threads that the president's been spinning — and I mean that not in the press sense — for almost a decade, they kind of all converged around Iran.\\n\\nOne section cites Rhodes, Tanya Somanader, the director of digital response for the White House Office of Digital Strategy, and Robert Malley, senior director at the National Security Council, explaining the genesis and execution of the marketing plan to sell the Iran deal, which the Times describes as using particulars that are often misleading or false.\\n\\nThe Times reports:\\n\\nThe way in which most Americans have heard the story of the Iran deal presented — that the Obama administration began seriously engaging with Iranian officials in 2013 in order to take advantage of a new political reality in Iran, which came about because of elections that brought moderates to power in that country — was largely manufactured for the purpose for selling the deal. Even where the particulars of that story are true, the implications that readers and viewers are encouraged to take away from those particulars are often misleading or false.\\n\\nThe Times reports the almost fictional narrative shaped by Rhodes:\\n\\nThe story of the Iran deal began in 2013, when a moderate faction inside the Iranian regime led by Hassan Rouhani beat regime hard-liners in an election and then began to pursue a policy of openness, which included a newfound willingness to negotiate the dismantling of its illicit nuclear- weapons program.\\n\\nIn reality, reported the Times, the talks began in mid-2012, a critical timeline since this was before the so-called moderate camp were chosen in an election among candidates handpicked by Iran's supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\\n\\nThe Times related that the idea of a supposed newly moderate leadership in Iran was politically useful to the Obama administration. Malley explained experts were utilized to create an echo chamber that disseminated administration claims about Iran to hundreds of often-clueless reporters in the news media.\\n\\nIn the spring of last year, legions of arms-control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often-clueless reporters. We created an echo chamber, he admitted, when I asked him to explain the onslaught of freshly minted experts cheerleading for the deal. They were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.\\n\\nRhodes asked Somanader to create a rapid response Twitter account to disseminate reactions to criticism of the Iran nuclear deal.\\n\\nSomanader admitted that The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg and Laura Rozen of Al-Monitor helped to sell the administration narrative to the public.\\n\\nFor those in need of more traditional-seeming forms of validation, handpicked Beltway insiders like Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic and Laura Rozen of Al-Monitor helped retail the administration's narrative. Laura Rozen was my RSS feed, Somanader offered. She would just find everything and retweet it.\\n\\nRhodes told Times reporter David Samuels that the marketing strategy took advantage of the absence of rational discourse.\\n\\nWhen I suggested that all this dark metafictional play seemed a bit removed from rational debate over America's future role in the world,Rhodes nodded. In the absence of rational discourse, we are going to discourse the [expletive] out of this, he said. We had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like Ploughshares, the Iran Project and whomever else.

{"original": "Given Big Tech's flagrant interference in the 2020 election — a steal, out in the open, in front of everyone — it's tempting to welcome any regulatory or legal action that might punish them.\\n\\nSome, like the efforts of Texas attorney general Ken Paxton, bode well — Paxton's multi-state antitrust case would prevent Google from using its monopoly on digital ads to arbitrarily punish websites.\\n\\nBut as another recent antitrust case filed against Facebook by the New York attorney general shows, Democrats want to use the power of government to pressure for more censorship, not less.\\n\\nBuried on page 70 of the lawsuit is a section that reveals a key aim of the Democrat-led suit: to use antitrust as a cudgel to demand stricter content moderation from Facebook (as if it could get any stricter!)\\n\\nVia the lawsuit:\\n\\nDue to Facebook's unlawful conduct and the lack of competitive constraints resulting from that conduct, there has been a proliferation of misinformation and violent or otherwise objectionable content on Facebook's properties. That content has harmed users and reduced the quality of advertising on those properties for advertisers who value the health and safety of their brand. Indeed, numerous advertisers have expressed concerns about brand safety on Facebook. Internally, Facebook executives recognized that their advertising customers valued brand safety and understood that advertisers do not want their ad placements associated with disturbing content. Even so, Facebook does not provide advertisers with meaningful ways to ensure that ads are distanced from content that could harm a brand's reputation.\\n\\nRepublican-led efforts to tame Big Tech, even if they have so far been unsuccessful, aim at the opposite objective: less censorship and more freedom. To achieve this objective, Republicans must ensure tech companies are more afraid of them than they are of the Democrats.\\n\\nA legitimate criticism of the Trump administration is that not enough was done sooner. Indeed, the USMCA trade bill, pushed by the administration, contained legal protections for Big Tech companies that were even stronger than Section 230, the law that shields tech companies from legal liability for censoring their users. Despite a bipartisan effort to stop it, these protections remained in USMCA.\\n\\nBut in the final year of Trump's first term, thanks to the efforts of staffers loyal to the President's interests, the administration made huge strides towards taming big tech — in the right way.\\n\\nJames Bacon, the youngest commissioned officer in White House history, led efforts to clinch a number of federal appointments and nominations that brought Big Tech to the very brink of losing their coveted censorship shield.\\n\\nOne such appointment was Adam Candeub, a law professor who had previously sued Twitter in free speech cases. Candeub, once appointed to the Trump administration, drafted the proposed FCC rulemaking change that would have tamed Silicon Valley's censors.\\n\\nReading Candeub's proposed rulemaking change, one can see how his priorities were the diametric opposite of the New York attorney general's. Not more censorship of objectionable, content, but less:\\n\\nCongress wanted platforms to comment as they wish without bearing the crippling legal liability for defamation and other unlawful statements that their users might make—or at least not penalize good actors. In contrast, commenters seek to use section 230 to protect their affirmative editorial decisions to censor, de-platform, shape, and control users content. … Otherwise objectionable is also ambiguous. While most courts read [Section 230] following the canon of ejusdem generis so that it refers to other matters of the kind enumerated prior in the list, some commentators (and courts) argue that the phrase refers to any material that a platform considers objectionable. Resolving the ambiguity as commenters urge—allowing platforms to remove any content they subjectively deem objectionable undermines the statute's text, the purpose and structure.\\n\\nIn addition to the appointment of Candeub, Bacon also led efforts to nominate Nathan Simington as commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) — the regulatory body that has the power to approve Candeub's proposal. Despite opposition from senators and industry groups, Bacon's efforts were successful — Simington is now serving a five-year term on the Commission.\\n\\nIt is a testament to the failure of the American system to defend the interests of its citizens that it took so much bureaucratic maneuvering just to get the government in a position to curb Big Tech's undermining of the First Amendment.\\n\\nAnd it will prove an immense source of anger and frustration that those titanic efforts may come to naught: although there is a last-ditch effort underway for the FCC to enact Candeub's proposal, time is slipping away. It is unclear if the chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, will support the fast-tracked rule change proposed by his colleagues.\\n\\nIf Biden takes office in January, expect the bureaucratic maneuvering to go the other way. Like the New York attorney general, his administration will use the power of government to bully Big Tech and other corporate giants into even more aggressive assaults on the free expression rights of Americans.\\n\\nOver the past four years, Breitbart News has exposed Big Tech's election interference again and again. There's a mountain of leaks, data, and smoking guns proving Silicon Valley's political bias.\\n\\nThe Democrats know this exists. They just don't care.\\n\\nThe Big Tech fight over the next four years will not be about who can expose the tech giants (they've already been exposed), but who can effectively wield power against them.\\n\\nThe efforts of Bacon and Candeub show the path for Republicans — the threat of government action against tech companies must be coupled with a clear demand to restore the original promise of the internet: limitless free expression, with users rather than hyper-progressive corporations deciding what content they consume.\\n\\nThis may yet become a reality. While the FCC may lack the time necessary to enact Candeub's plans, Democrat attorney generals aren't the only ones who can file antitrust suits.\\n\\nAllum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.

{"original": "In 2007, University of Pennsylvania Professor J. Scott Armstrong challenged former U.S. Vice President Al Gore to a bet on what would happen to global average temperatures over the following 10 years.\\n\\nArmstrong's challenge was in response to Gore's warning of a looming dangerous tipping point in global mean temperatures. His proposal of a $10,000 bet was intended to draw attention to the need to assess the predictive validity of climate forecasts in an objective manner. Armstrong issued his challenge based on the knowledge that predictions of dangerous global warming were the product of methods that violated 72 of 89 forecasting principles relevant to the forecasting problem.\\n\\nEmails to Gore were unproductive: after several attempts at engagement, his staff informed Armstrong that Gore did not take bets. The important question of whether public policies should be based on the alarming projections remained, so Armstrong commissioned theclimatebet.com site to track how the bet would have turned out had Gore accepted.\\n\\nAt the time of the challenge, Gore warned that the climate was warming at such a rate that, without immediate action, disasters would occur. His book Assault on Reason — published in April 2007 — stated that: Many scientists are now warning that we are moving closer to several 'tipping points' that could — within as little as ten years — make it impossible for us to avoid irretrievable damage of the planet's habitability for human civilization.\\n\\nFormulating the Climate Bet\\n\\nGore's warning was not directly testable: he failed to provide a quantitative forecast. The 2001 U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report's business as usual projection of 3°C per-century was used to stand for Gore's forecast. Adopting the IPCC projection favored Gore, as it was less extreme than his tipping point alarm.\\n\\nArmstrong bet that the global mean temperature would not change; in other words, that temperature increases and decreases would tend to balance out over time. That forecast is consistent with a statement in the aforementioned IPCC technical report: In climate research and modeling, we should recognize that we are dealing with a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore that the long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.\\n\\nThe bet was monitored monthly using satellite data on lower troposphere temperatures from researchers at the University of Alabama at Huntsville. In contrast to surface data, these satellite data cover the whole Earth, are fully disclosed, and are not contaminated by poor maintenance and location of weather stations, changes from mercury to electronic measurement, and unexplained adjustments.\\n\\nIn calling for the rapid implementation of expensive policies, Gore was presumably highly confident about his alarming forecast. Armstrong was not: a simulation using 150 years of temperature data suggested that, due to natural variation in global temperatures, his chance of winning a bet for as short a period as ten years was only 70 percent.\\n\\nFindings\\n\\nGore's warning of dangerous warming was based on the predictions of experts. Experts, however, have a poor record in forecasting. Politicians are not exceptions. As Winston Churchill observed, The most essential qualification for a politician is the ability to foretell what will happen tomorrow, next month, and next year, and then to explain afterwards why it did not happen.\\n\\nThe most effective way to compare the accuracy of forecasts from different forecasting methods is the relative cumulative absolute error. By that measure (measure 1 in the table), the no-change forecast errors were 12 percent smaller than those of the IPCC dangerous warming projection. Seven other measures are provided to help readers draw their own conclusions as to whether, with the benefit of hindsight, it would have been better in 2007 to plan for a tipping point, or no change, over the next decade.\\n\\nTen More Years\\n\\nLonger is better for assessing climate forecasts, and so Armstrong has agreed to extend the bet for another ten years, sticking with the original 2007 global mean temperature as the starting point. This time he has reason to be more confident. Validation tests published two years after the original bet compared no-change model forecasts with IPCC dangerous warming forecasts for horizons from one to 100 years, and found that no-change forecasts were considerably more accurate; especially over longer horizons. That study, followed all of the relevant scientific forecasting principles, with only a minor exception. To our knowledge, the study remains the only peer-reviewed paper published in a scientific journal that provides scientific forecasts of long-term global mean temperatures.\\n\\nKesten C.

{"original": "Democrat voters must determine if Joe Biden is mentally fit to serve as President of the United States given the former vice president's frequently slurred speech and regular misstatements, assessed Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Joel Pollak in a Wednesday interview on 55KRC with host Brian Thomas.\\n\\nBiden's Super Tuesday performance — winning 566 delegates relative to Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-VT) 501 delegates — is not the result of a strengthening campaign but of a division among Democrat primary voter support between Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), determined Pollak.\\n\\nPollak then highlighted questions of Biden's cognition given the former vice president's behavior:\\n\\nBiden doesn't look to be any stronger a candidate than he was throughout this campaign.

He didn't seem sharper or any better than he has been the entire campaign.\\n\\nHe did remember the Declaration of Independence, but I believe he was reading it off a teleprompter, noted Pollak, referring to Biden's failure to recall the best-known clause of one of America's founding documents.\\n\\nPollak continued:\\n\\nI'm being serious, here. I'm not trying to be mean. The question facing voters in the fall is going to be whether Joe Biden — should he become the nominee — is mentally fit to serve in the office, and the Democratic Party may choose a vice presidential nominee very carefully with that in mind, but it does show you that Democrats are not going to roll over in 2020. They're going to do whatever it takes to be competitive.\\n\\nPollak added, Biden is simply not seeming to be up to the job.

They did not like Biden. They really didn't like Pete Buttigieg. They don't like Elizabeth Warren. Early surveys suggested that the Sanders voters were the least likely to stick with the party nominee. \\n\\nWhat we do know is that right now the Bernie Sanders camp feels that they're the victims of a coup, Pollak added, noting Marianne Williamson use of the term. They feel the Democratic establishment has maneuvered once again to try to steal the election from them, and they're fighting that.\\n\\nPollak stated, It's very clear — if it wasn't before — the Democratic establishment is pulling a lot of strings behind the scenes and really, they're barely even trying to hide it anymore.

It is sin, which makes us die inside. Only he can save us from this evil, but he needs our cooperation, for each one of us to say: 'Jesus, forgive me, give me a heart like yours, humble and full of love.'\\n\\nThe pope said that this interior conversion that God asks of us requires a willingness to change, to let go of what holds us back from being true Christians.\\n\\nI ask you: Are you willing to listen to Jesus and change something of yourselves? If you're here, I think you are, but I can't take it for granted and I don't want to, he said. Each one of you must reflect within yourself, in your heart: Am I willing to make Jesus' dreams my own? Or am I afraid that his dreams may 'disturb' my dreams?\\n\\nJesus' dream is what is called the Kingdom of God in the Gospels, the pope said. The Kingdom of God means loving with God and loving one another, forming a great family of brothers and sisters with God as Father, who loves all His children and is full of joy when one is lost and returns home.\\n\\nThis is Jesus' dream.

{"original": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Friday declared that Senate Republicans, who successfully blocked the Democrats' demands for additional witnesses in the impeachment trial, have given President Trump permission to conspire with foreign governments to undermine votes.\\n\\nSenate Republicans on Friday effectively stiff-armed the Democrats' demands for additional witnesses in the Senate impeachment trial. Only two Republicans, Sens. Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Susan Collins (R-ME), voted alongside Democrats in favor of additional witnesses. Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), two senators Democrats were hoping to win over, ultimately sided with their own party. Murkowski attributed her decision to the partisan nature of the entire process, noting that the House chose to send articles of impeachment that are rushed and flawed.\\n\\nGiven the partisan nature of this impeachment from the very beginning and throughout, I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate. I don't believe the continuation of this process will change anything, she added.\\n\\nThe GOP's success in blocking the Democrats' calls for additional witnesses effectively paved the way for a speedy acquittal, which is expected to take place next Wednesday. As a result, Warren claims Republicans have let the American people down and touted the debunked left-wing talking point, proclaiming that the GOP has given the president permission to conspire with foreign governments to undermine your vote.\\n\\nAs Breitbart News has consistently reported throughout the impeachment process, Trump did not condition aid to Ukraine on an investigation, or an announcement of an investigation, into the Bidens. Ukraine received a call, meeting, and aid without any of the so-called demands Democrats claim Trump made. Nevertheless, lead House impeachment manager Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) also made the same claim on the Senate floor this week.\\n\\nAs Breitbart News detailed:\\n\\nLead House impeachment manager Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) laid out the case against President Trump in opening arguments on Wednesday in the Senate impeachment trial. The core of his claim was that Trump withheld a White House meeting from new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as essential military aid, unless and until Ukraine announced investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and 2016 interference in the U.S. election. Every part of that claim is untrue, and directly contradicted by the evidence that emerged in the House's own inquiry. Schiff is clearly relying on the testimony of U.S. Ambassador to the E.U. Gordon Sondland, who made the surprise announcement in his prepared statement for the public impeachment inquiry in the House Intelligence Committee that there had been a quid pro quo — a White House meeting in exchange for an announcement of investigations. Under questioning, however, Sondland admitted that he had no direct knowledge of a quid pro quo. In fact, he testified that when he asked President Trump what he wanted from Ukraine, he said nothing and no quid pro quo. Moroever, as the transcript of Trump's first call with Zelensky in April showed, the president had already invited Zelensky to the White House with no conditions whatsoever — a fact that Schiff neglected to mention in the Senate. As for the second call, there was never any discussion of withholding aid, or of the 2020 presidential election. The U.S. aid that was temporarily withheld was security assistance — not the all-important Javelin anti-tank missiles, which Trump provided earlier (and President Barack Obama had not). The hold had to do with future funding and had no effect on the flow of funds to Ukraine during the summer of 2019, when the temporary hold was in place.\\n\\nWarren also continued to tout the same narrative.\\n\\nThe GOP has shown where they stand—and it's not with you, she said on Friday.\\n\\nThe only force that's powerful enough to stop Trump and the Republicans is us—the American people.

{"original": "A shocking new report from the Hollywood Reporter on Friday reveals that the site of the Cannes Film Festival in France sits just 600 meters from a mosque linked to Islamic jihadi terrorism.\\n\\nFrom the Hollywood Reporter:\\n\\nThirty-seven years ago, at the age of 32, Moustapha Dali quit show business. An Algeria native, he'd begun to build an acting career in France but tired of his Paris agents telling him he'd have to change his name to one less Arabic, more French. As Dali recounts it, I told them I wanted to keep my name. I said Omar Sharif didn't change his name, but they said, 'He's not a French actor, he works in Hollywood.' \\n\\nToday, at age 69, the scholarly, erudite Dali is the soft-spoken but righteous rector of the Mosquee Al Madina, the main mosque in Cannes, which sits above the Croisette, just 600 meters from the Palais des Festivals. Although he once dreamed of being in their company, Dali watches the annual influx of movie stars descending on the Croisette as if they are a bunch of martians landing. We're so near, but I know they have no idea of what's really going on here.\\n\\nDali inhabits another world, one far removed from the festival's red carpets, swank parties and luxury suite wheeling-dealing: Instead, he lives on the front lines of France's increasingly explosive relationship with its more than 5 million Muslim residents. His mosque was used — without his knowledge, he says — in 2012 as a rendezvous point for one of the most dangerous terrorist cells in French history. And in late 2015, his mosque's imam, or prayer leader, was rousted from his home in the early hours of the morning, accused of encouraging radicalism and told he no longer could work there — although the charge later was dropped and the young man received an apology.\\n\\nWhile relations between France and its Muslim population long have been tense, the tension has escalated as the Cannes Film Festival gets underway amid heightened security in the wake of terrorist bombings in Paris and Brussels. Recent reports from Senegal via Italian intelligence warned of possible terrorist attacks on beaches in the South of France and Italy, raising the specter of small bombs, planted under deck chairs and hidden inside cans of energy drinks, just waiting to detonate."}
{"original": "At the top of his Tuesday broadcast, Fox News Channel's The O'Reilly Factor host Bill O'Reilly reacted to President Barack Obama's executive order announcement regarding firearms and the added restrictions Obama wants to put in place in the name of gun safety.\\n\\nAccording to O'Reilly, Obama has it wrong by focusing on gun control and not stricter laws regarding gun crime.\\n\\nTranscript as follows:\\n\\nMr. Obama is sincere in his quest for more safety but he is missing the big picture. According to the latest FBI stats, slightly more than 8,000 people were victims of firearm murders in 2014. There were 118,000 robberies involving a firearm. And almost 150,000 aggravated assaults involving guns.\\n\\nThe population of the USA is approaching 330 million, so you can see there is not a gun-crime epidemic and the vast majority of these heinous crimes are committed by hardcore criminals, not civilian shooters. Right now there are more than 300-million firearms currently on the streets of America so there will be a thriving black market for guns no matter what kind of registration laws are passed. As far as terrorist-related firearm killings in the USA, there have been 88 in the past 10 years. Again, not an epidemic.\\n\\nNow Talking Points understands public safety and reasonable gun registration laws should be on the books. But perspective is important and restricting law-abiding Americans from acquiring guns is obviously unconstitutional. Again, the gun-violence problem primarily lies with criminals, so where is the federal law that mandates strict prison time for anyone using a gun in the commission of a crime?\\n\\nWhere is that law, Mr. President?\\n\\nYou cannot leave sentencing to local judges if you want to control gun violence on a national level. Talking Points has said it before – anyone convicted of a gun-related crime should get 10 years in prison on top of what they get for the crime whether it's assault, murder or robbery. That would send a meaningful message.\\n\\nThe truth is terrorists are not going to submit themselves to background checks. Neither are dangerous felons or insane people. They'll buy the guns on the black market and no registration law will prevent that. On the other side, the NRA and gun owners should be reasonable.\\n\\nThe FBI should background check anyone buying a firearm in the USA – that just makes sense. If you are paranoid and believe the government is stockpiling information so they can come to your house and take your guns, that's your problem. But the government has an obligation to enhance public safety.\\n\\nAnd that brings us back to harshly punishing people who violate the law with guns. Registration – not going to solve much. Zero tolerance toward gun-crime – things might change quickly.\\n\\nThink about it, Mr. President."}

{"original": "Starbucks promoting a transgender youth charity through the sale of Mermaids cookies is incredibly sinister says author Douglas Murray.\\n\\nThis is the crossover of one of the ugliest bits of capitalism with one of the most sinister things in our time, says Murray.\\n\\nMurray, who dedicates a significant chunk of his most recent bestseller The Madness of Crowds to discussing the hijack of transgender issues by the radical left, expressed his fury that so controversial an issue should be so casually used for marketing purposes by an international hot beverage chain.\\n\\nStarbucks — the British branch — is currently donating 50p of each Mermaids cookie it sells to the British charity Mermaids.\\n\\nAccording to the Mail:\\n\\nMermaids was set up by Susie Green, who took her son Jack – now Jackie – to Thailand for sex-change surgery at 16, because the NHS would not operate on someone so young. The charity advises Government agencies, schools, the police and social workers. But critics say its advice is not objective, because it is run largely by parents with a transgender child.\\n\\nMurray believes the association between Starbucks and Mermaids is toxic.\\n\\nMermaids is a British charity which is actually quite notorious. It should be interrogated far more than it is. It claims to be supportive of young people who don't know what gender they are and to advocate for transgender youth […] I'm very sceptical about this whole thing. We're allowing something utterly mad to go with the adults giving up. This idea that because you're feeling a bit feminine one day and a bit masculine on another and it's all so confusing — no, I don't accept all of this. I offer a weeks' supply of actually edible croissant from any of Starbucks' competitors to anyone who can actually define for me what 'non-binary' actually means. Mermaids is an incredibly sinister organisation. I don't accept that there's such a thing as transgender youth. I think the adults have left the room on this and it is not for a major multinational like Starbucks to jump on board something on which so little has been thought about ethically and practically.\\n\\nHe added:\\n\\nTelling confused and unhappy children that their lives can be solved by going through incredibly difficult hormonal therapies including puberty blockers and then at a later stage being made into an approximation of the body of the opposite sex? No. No. No!\\n\\nStarbucks has backed up its campaign with a TV commercial in which a crop-haired girl called Jemima deliberates as to what she's going to call herself when she orders her soy latte from Starbucks. Jemima eventually plumps for the name James and the viewer is clearly meant to be full of admiration for her stunning bravery in choosing to give herself this (admittedly very splendid) new Christian name.\\n\\nBut Murray believes this is just another case of glib corporate virtue-signalling by a multinational which can't even do one job properly.\\n\\nThere is just one thing Starbucks needs to do right — make coffee — and it can't even do that. I don't like the counter of inedible products — croissant that look like rock cakes. It is a great failure that such a dreadful chain should perch in every town in the world. I already had an instinctive, vitriolic loathing of Starbucks. But in the last week, my prejudice against the chain has been ramped up to category ten.\\n\\nWhy is Starbucks doing it? For the same reason all the most evil and hateful banks and multinationals do it — as a cheap way of deflecting flak from their many critics who see themselves as the unacceptable face of capitalism.\\n\\nMurray says:\\n\\nWhat these companies are doing are very loud, ostentatious appeals to show that they are on board with the zeitgeist. Barclays Bank, for example, after 2008 had lots of things it should have done and a lot of blame it should have got. The cheapest way you can get is to soak up the woke agenda and do it very visibly. So Barclay bank goes for LGBT Pride Month in a HUGE way.

{"original": "State lawmakers are examining model campus free speech legislation that will address what has become a top issue for college administrators in the New Year: how to ensure free speech while keeping students safe and security costs down.\\n\\nIt's the No. 1 topic of the year, I would say, for folks in my business, Kevin Kruger, president of the Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education, told Politico at the end of December.\\n\\nViolent protests on college campuses throughout the country, including Evergreen State College, University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Virginia, have led think tanks that seek to protect the First Amendment rights of all students to provide model bills to state lawmakers.\\n\\nStanley Kurtz, a senior fellow at the Washington, DC-based Ethics and Public Policy Center, is the co-author of a model campus free speech bill that has been published by the Goldwater Institute – a libertarian/conservative think tank in Arizona.\\n\\nKurtz explained the Goldwater bill in an interview with Breitbart News:\\n\\nWe've put out what I think is the most comprehensive and toughest bill on campus free speech. What this bill does is ban so-called free speech codes, and free speech zones, as it also discourages administrators from disinviting controversial speakers who have already been invited by students and faculty members. That's what most of the other model bills do. But, what the Goldwater model adds to all that is insistence on punishment for students who shout down visiting speakers, or rip down posters for the talk that a speaker is going to give, or in any way interfere with the free speech rights of others. Right now, that's really the heart and soul of the free speech crisis. Even though I think it's absolutely essential that we ban these free speech zones and these restrictive speech codes, if you were to do all of that today, and still let these shout-downs take place, I think we'd still have a campus free speech crisis.\\n\\nThe Goldwater Institute summarizes its model legislation:\\n\\nIt creates an official university policy that strongly affirms the importance of free expression, nullifying any existing restrictive speech codes in the process.\\n\\nIt prevents administrators from disinviting speakers, no matter how controversial, whom members of the campus community wish to hear from.\\n\\nIt establishes a system of disciplinary sanctions for students and anyone else who interferes with the free-speech rights of others.\\n\\nIt allows persons whose free-speech rights have been improperly infringed by the university to recover court costs and attorney's fees.\\n\\nIt reaffirms the principle that universities, at the official institutional level, ought to remain neutral on issues of public controversy to encourage the widest possible range of opinion and dialogue within the university itself.\\n\\nIt ensures that students will be informed of the official policy on free expression.\\n\\nIt authorizes a special subcommittee of the university board of trustees to issue a yearly report to the public, the trustees, the governor, and the legislature on the administrative handling of free-speech issues.\\n\\nThe Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) has also published a model bill that is being considered by state lawmakers. FIRE is largely positive about the Goldwater bill, while it points out some differences:\\n\\nFor instance, FIRE believes students should have access to the active assistance of counsel in most disciplinary cases, as opposed to only those with a potential penalty of greater than 30 days' suspension or those involving expressive conduct. The bill draft also addresses a few items about which FIRE does not take a position, and which FIRE would therefore not address through its own efforts. But there is little doubt that passage of this model legislation would represent a real improvement in free speech protections in states that do not already include such protections in state law.\\n\\nKurtz tells Breitbart News that simply characterizing college students who claim they need to be in safe zones, as snowflakes minimizes the real issues at stake:\\n\\nThe snowflake idea is true, but incomplete. The snowflake idea addresses that these students have helicopter parents who didn't want to see them get hurt in any way, who coddled them, and didn't get them used to the hard knocks of life. I think there's some real truth in that. So – when they hear someone who disagrees with them – they sort of want to shrivel up and die, which makes them want to silence people. But, I think that this psychological explanation underplays the importance of ideology in all this. If you look at what's happened to the university over the last few decades, they've really been taken over by the studies programs – African-American studies, Latino studies, women's studies, environmental studies, gender studies – and sometimes they literally have studies that teach activism. These studies programs are generally built around political assumptions, and their classes are teaching leftist politics.\\n\\nKurtz further explains that, today, even courses in the conventional departments – such as history, English, biology, etc., are cross-listed with other studies departments and share the common ideology.\\n\\nThe rise of the studies programs and the political orientation behind them has an awful lot to do with the campus free speech problem we're seeing, he says.\\n\\nHe notes the gradual acceptance of the teaching of Marxist ideology in American colleges and universities:\\n\\nIn my day, I must have had three or four courses where we read On Liberty, by John Stuart Mill, which taught the basics of free speech and why we need it. It was very common to read John Stuart Mill and other defenses of free speech in the tradition of classical liberalism – such as what the Founders practiced. This is not taught today. Instead, people teach about so-called white privilege and other ideas that, in an indirect way, are ultimately derived from Marxism or what you might call neo-Marxism, where the basic idea is that individual rights are just an illusion, and you really have just a bunch of powerful classes. Instead of an economic class nowadays they talk about it as an ethnic or a gender class. And those powerful classes dominate and they create ideas like free speech that pretend to be neutral and fair to every individual, but they really aren't. They're just disguising the power of the class. That ideology comes from Marx, but it's been spread out and used in this new frame with ethnicity and gender. So, this is the ideology that dominates the ethos of the studies programs.\\n\\nKurtz points out that the Goldwater legislation also has an educational component:\\n\\nOne of the things our campus free speech bill does, in addition to insisting the colleges adopt good statements defending free speech and explaining the meaning of free speech, we insist there be a section of freshman orientation where the students are taught about these statements, and that they're taught about the policy that disciplines people who shut down speakers. So, there is an educational element in our legislation, but ultimately legislation can never be a complete solution. There has to be a change in which we start to really educate students again in the principles of free speech and what classical liberalism of the kind the Founders practiced are all about. If we don't do that, this generation is going to be lost and the country is going to be lost.\\n\\nKurtz has also been a vocal opponent of the Common Core standards and changes to the College Board's Advanced Placement U.S. History curriculum that reflect the leftist ideology. He explains that the latest controversy is over the College Board's AP European History curriculum:\\n\\nThat has the same problem as the AP U.S. History curriculum. It focuses on group conflict – exactly the sort of thing that you find in the studies departments. And there's even a neo-Marxist element to the AP U.S. History standards – they're very materialist. The AP European History standards imply that the original liberals, like John Locke and Hobbs, and the Parliaments that brought modern democracy to England, were somehow motivated by class interest, and the implication is there's something inauthentic and not very believable about classical liberalism. So, there's no doubt that the curriculum the College Board has put in place has been adding to and exacerbating the underlying problem that we're experiencing on free speech.\\n\\nPeople who wish to remain non-partisan emphasize the 'snowflake' thing, and others have taken it up, but the truth is there is a one-sidedness in the ideology of colleges that have become so far-left that they have broken from classical liberalism, Kurtz concludes. If we don't acknowledge that's at the root of the problem, then we'll never solve it.\\n\\nA Goldwater-based bill has already become law in North Carolina. Additionally, another has cleared the state House in Wisconsin and has already been adopted by the Board of Regents at the University of Wisconsin."}
{"original": "Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-GA) warned this weekend in an exclusive Breitbart News interview that if the Democrats take the U.S. Senate majority on Tuesday then they will follow House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's lead and outright ban gender-specific terminology.\\n\\nPelosi this past week banned in the House rules for the new Congress terms such as mother, daughter, father, and son, because they are gender-specific. Blackburn warned that if the Democrats take the majority in the Senate by winning both of Georgia's runoff elections that the Senate Democrats, led by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), would do the same in the U.S. Senate. On Tuesday, GOP Sens. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) and David Perdue (R-GA) will face off against Democrats Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff respectively in races that will determine which party controls the upper chamber of Congress. Currently, Republicans have 50 seats and Democrats have 48, meaning if both Warnock and Ossoff were to win the Senate would deadlock at 50-50 and Harris would be the tie breaking vote. That means Democrats would control the chamber, and all the committees, and be able to write rules like they did in the House banning terms that are gender-specific just like Pelosi did.\\n\\nAsked about this on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel, Blackburn warned of the dangers of a Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate, saying that they would absolutely implement such absurd and ridiculous rules.\\n\\nMy mother is 96 years old and I am grateful every single day that I have her, Blackburn said. My dad died eight years ago and I miss him every single day. They are my parents. I have a brother. I have a sister. I have a daughter. I have a son. These are facts of life if you will. You are not going to change that and this political correctness of saying that we can't use a gender specific term. We cannot honor our men and women our sons and daughters, our mothers and fathers, and refer to them and the lessons they have taught us when we are speaking on the floor of the House or the Senate. This is absurd and ridiculous and if the Democrats win these seats in Georgia, you are going to see gender specificity eliminated—completely eliminated.\\n\\nIt's not gender specificity on the line, however. Blackburn said literally every issue hangs in the balance based on what happens on Tuesday.\\n\\nYou cannot overstate the importance of this. We are at a crossroads in this country and, of course, you've got those on the left and they're led by Pelosi and Schumer and Bernie and AOC and they're trying to push us onto a socialistic path, Blackburn said. As Chuck Schumer has said, they're using Georgia to do this and these runoffs in Georgia. They are out there pushing to make states out of D.C. and Puerto Rico, give voting rights to felons, take away your health insurance you get from your employer or Medicare that goes to 57 million Americans and would put everybody into Medicaid and have the federal government in charge of it, they're going to take away the Trump tax cuts that have been such a blessing to those in Georgia. You look at how business has grown in Georgia and you say why would anybody want to get rid of this? Well, those that want to keep you out of work and locked in your house and kids out of school, that is their goal to take those tax cuts away and they also want to begin implementing the Green New Deal and run up the cost of electricity, making it more difficult for people to actually use efficiency to heat and cool their home and in automobiles they want to just completely ban fracking and then oil products, you know, and along the way, they would be banning hamburgers because they want to ban cattle. So there you go, this is their version of things. They don't want you making your decisions, they want government making decisions for you and telling you what you can do where you can live where you can work where you can get an education what you're going to do for a job. They want to be the decision maker and tell you how to live your life.\\n\\nIf Georgians want to keep the gains that were made during President Donald Trump's administration, such as the tax cuts and more, Blackburn said they need to re-elect Loeffler and Perdue because otherwise the Democrats will control the U.S. Senate committees and be able to rip apart the president's achievements. What's more, if voters care about election integrity or holding President-elect Joe Biden and his family accountable for their various scandals, she said that the Democrats controlling the committees would sweep these issues under the rug.\\n\\nPeople that want to preserve President Trump's agenda need to go vote for Kelly and David, because, as you said, if the Democrats win, they control the gavels, which controls the agenda in the committees, she said. If they control those committees, there's not going to be any oversight on the election fraud … you'll never hear another word about Hunter Biden and his scandals. You're not going to hear anything about what happened with Ukraine. You're not going to hear about some of this participation between the Biden family, Biden incorporated in China. All of that will be swept under the rug. You're never going to get an answer and complete the investigation of what happened in 2016 with the elections there. All of these are reasons you want to make certain that we win these seats in Georgia.\\n\\nLISTEN TO SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY:"}
{"original": "The principal of a Christian school in Hagerstown, Maryland says that after countless hours in prayer and discussion, his board's decision to bar a pregnant teen from walking at her graduation ceremony is holding her accountable for her immorality and is the best way to love her.\\n\\nThe case of Maddi Runkles, an 18 year-old senior at Heritage Academy, has taken the nation by storm over the past week. Runkles was interviewed Wednesday on CBS This Morning, and her story has been featured at media outlets such as the New York Times, the New York Post, and Cosmopolitan.\\n\\nThe school's principal, David Hobbs, released a statement regarding the situation of the teen, who has a 4.0 gradepoit average and was president of the Student Council when she discovered she was pregnant in January.\\n\\nMaddi is being disciplined, not because she's pregnant, but because she was immoral, Hobbs said in a statement posted on the school's website, explaining that students at the school sign a scripturally-based pledge that states they will protect their bodies by abstaining from sexual immorality and from the use of alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs.\\n\\nHeritage is also pleased that she has chosen to not abort her son, he continued. However, her immorality is the original choice she made that began this situation.\\n\\nIn an interview with Breitbart News, Runkles said that while other students at Heritage Academy have broken some of the other rules of the pledge, They've never suffered a punishment as severe as mine.\\n\\nHobbs, she said, initially decided he would tell the entire school that she had broken the rule about pre-marital sex. She was also stripped of her leadership positions and informed she would not be permitted to complete her senior year at school, but would finish her classes at home.\\n\\nRunkles said she decided, however, that she wanted to publicly confess to the school herself about her pregnancy. She made her confession with her father at her side.\\n\\nI decided I wanted to confess what I did and ask for forgiveness from my school, she continued, but the other kids who had broken other rules – even when they were caught – they still lied about what they had done. It just seems unfair. I tried to make it right, but was still shot down.\\n\\nSubsequently, Runkles' parents and about 25 classmates and other parents appealed to Hobbs, asking that she be permitted to remain in school and graduate with her classmates. Ultimately – after several days of suspension – she was told she could return to school to complete her classes, but would still be prohibited from graduating with her class.\\n\\nA wise man told me that discipline is not the absence of love, but the application of love, Hobbs says in his statement. We love Maddi Runkles. The best way to love her right now is to hold her accountable for her immorality that began this situation.\\n\\nRunkles's situation was brought to light by pro-life organization Students for Life of America (SFLA), which asserts the teen is being unfairly punished, since she already admitted her mistake, confessed it before the school, and accepted relinquishing her leadership roles. SFLA says Christians who claim to be pro-life should offer support to a teen who admits her error and accepts the consequences of going through with her pregnancy instead of having an abortion.\\n\\nDisciplining Maddi is not the issue, states SFLA president Kristan Hawkins. Her discipline was decided, communicated, and executed. For the most part, this was done so with care for the family's privacy and with fair response to the pledge broken (i.e. 'abstaining from sexual immorality and from the use of alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs').\\n\\nHawkins continues:\\n\\nHowever, my primary and continued complaint is that the disciplinary actions of the administration has extended far beyond accountability for the broken pledge regarding premarital sex. That accountability was served justly and humbly in Maddi's confession, her suspension, and her removal from leadership positions. What was initially a punitive and learning moment has transformed into a public lesson (before this even was announced to the media). By banning Maddi from walking at graduation, the administration and board collectively decided on a disciplinary measure of an obviously public nature. From what we've learned thus far, no other student in the school's history has been banned from walking at graduation for failing to abstain from sexual immorality and from the use of alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs. Maddi is the only student, past or present, banned from walking at graduation. In a class of only 15 students, her absence will be obvious and can only be explained in that her immorality is visible (unlike the errs of past and present students).\\n\\nIn his statement, Hobbs does not address how the board handles the violations of other students, but states, Each Heritage family deserves confidentiality. He indicates that the Runkles family chose to make her behavior a public matter, and that he would have preferred to handle Maddi's disciplinary situation privately.\\n\\nNeither Heritage Academy nor Hobbs returned Breitbart News's request for an interview or comment.\\n\\nRunkles's story has launched a debate about how pro-life Christian churches handle the situation of unplanned pregnancies among single women.\\n\\nA study posted in November of 2015 at Care-Net found that more than 40 percent of women who had an abortion regularly attended church.\\n\\nVice president of LifeWay Research Scott McConnell said the results suggest a church culture that is lacking grace. Among those women who have had an abortion:\\n\\nTwo-thirds (65 percent) say church members judge single women who are pregnant. A majority (54 percent) thinks churches oversimplify decisions about pregnancy options. Fewer than half (41 percent) believe churches are prepared to help with decisions about unwanted pregnancies.\\n\\nWomen are perceiving judgment from the church, and that's probably partly because there are clear teachings in the Bible including about how and why we make judgments, McConnell said. However, if they don't start experiencing something different than what they've seen in the past, these numbers aren't going to change.\\n\\nThe Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List) – a national pro-life organization – states Runkles's decision to have her baby deserves compassion and support.\\n\\nThe decision to choose life is not always easy, and certainly not always popular with a culture that promotes convenience over personal responsibility, the group says. Maddi made a courageous choice to love and protect her unborn son and she deserves compassion and support, especially from fellow Christians.\\n\\nWe urge Heritage Academy to reconsider their decision not to allow Maddi, a 4.0 student, to walk with her peers at graduation, SBA List continues. This extended punishment – doled out months after Maddi told her school she was pregnant and asked for compassion – sends a terrible message about the Christian community's response to teen pregnancy and unexpected pregnancy."}
{"original": "President Donald Trump's Department of Labor has released an updated set of rules to protect the wages of American graduates from the damage done by CEOs' use of H-1B visa workers.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Labor is taking these steps to strengthen wage protections, address abuses in visa programs, and protect American workers from being undercut by cheaper foreign labor, said U.S. Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia said in a January 12 statement. He added:\\n\\nThese changes help ensure that these important foreign worker programs function as Congress intended, while securing American workers' opportunities for stable, good-paying jobs.\\n\\nThe wage rules cover the H-1B program, which allows CEOs to keep roughly 900,000 foreign, mid-skilled, contract workers in the United States. The H-1B program also keeps roughly 150,000 spouses in white-collar jobs, and it helps attract roughly 300,000 foreign workers into white-collar jobs via the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program.\\n\\nThe labor department rules set the wage floors for the imported H-1B workers, and so hinder companies from hiring cheaper foreign workers instead of American graduates. The rule says:\\n\\nA primary purpose of the restrictions on immigration created by the INA, both numerical and otherwise, is to preserve jobs for American workers. Safeguards for American labor, and the Department's role in administering them, have been a foundational element of the statutory scheme since the INA was enacted in 1952.\\n\\nLawsuits from business groups blocked a prior version of the rule.\\n\\nThe prior rule required companies to pay entry-level H-1B workers the same wage as the 45th percentile of entry-level American graduates. The new rule lowers that wage floor to just the 35th percentile — which is far higher than the current floor at the 17th percentile.\\n\\nSkilled foreign workers — described as being in Levels 2, 3, or 4 — must be paid above the median wages level earned by skilled U.S. graduates, according to the rule.\\n\\nThe new rules are disappointing but an improvement, tweeted Ron Hira, a Howard University expert on the visa worker programs. The Level 1 wage [for entry-level workers] remains roughly 20% discount on median [market wages]… Corps still have [a] huge profit incentive to replace US workers, he wrote.\\n\\nThe changes from the initial version greatly reduced the harm from the [prior version of the] rule, but it is still a terrible rule that will harm the U.S. economy, said a tweet from David Bier at the Cato Institute, which favors laws that would allow U.S.-based companies to hire and import foreign workers in place of Americans.\\n\\nThis rule is the last gasp of the Trump administration to restrict legal immigration, complained Stephen Yale-Loehr, a lawyer at Cornell Law School.\\n\\nThe H-1B visa workers are not immigrants but can win green cards to become immigrants.\\n\\nA more important protection was set last week when the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced it would use salary offers to allocate the annual corporate supply of 85,000 H-1B visas. The DHS process will allocate the annual supply of 85,000 H-1B visas to corporations that offer the highest pay. The ranking system will end the economic incentive to hire mid-skilled H-1B foreign workers instead of younger American graduates.\\n\\nHowever, President-elect Joe Biden is filling his administration with many executives and advocates in the Fortune 500 and the tech sector. These appointees — such as DHS nominee Alejandro Mayorkas — may push to help their prior employers by deep-sixing Trump's labor protections.\\n\\nBut the agency announcement is an Important opportunity for Biden and Democratic-controlled Congress to step up and support this common-sense rule, Hira said.\\n\\nTrump lost his election campaign, in part, because he postponed H-1B reforms until late 2020 — and then declined to tout those white-collar gains on the campaign trail.\\n\\nTrump zig-zagged on migration issues throughout his administration amid intense and emotional opposition from business and progressive groups. Finally, in 2019, Trump moved to block blue-collar migration via Mexico, but his white-collar reforms came too late to offset a sharp 2020 loss in support among college graduates.\\n\\nThe H-1B visa is just one part of a huge pyramid of imported labor used by U.S. investors and the Fortune 500 to spike their stock values and corral their control over the technology sector.\\n\\nThe imported labor force exists because Congress allows companies to provide green cards to roughly 70,000 foreign workers each year. As a result, at least 1 million foreign graduates are competing in U.S. workplaces for those green cards or are waiting for promised green cards.\\n\\nThis foreign labor force dubbed the Green Card Workforce is often preferred by executives because the dangled green cards ensure that the foreign workers will work long hours for lower wages. In addition, the workers have no legal protections in the workplace and have no professional authority to disagree with CEOs, who can also gain stock-market gains when Wall Street analysts welcome great use of visa workers.\\n\\nCompanies also use visa workers to crimp and slow domestic competition by minimizing the hiring of American graduates who may use their work experience to join or create rival companies. In the early 2000s, the federal government broke up an illegal no-poaching cartel by tech companies who were trying to prevent their American workers from changing jobs and so sharing their expertise with rival companies. This strategy is legal if the workforce consists of H-1B workers who cannot change jobs without their managers' permission.\\n\\nMany U.S. and Indian employees tell Breitbart News that American graduates are excluded from many Fortune 500 jobs so that the jobs can be traded by hiring managers to foreign workers who want to win green cards.\\n\\nIn 2011, for example, a California-based health insurance company fired 40 Americans to hire a larger and more expensive workforce of H-1B workers, according to testimony from a company employee in a subsequent lawsuit. In 2020, Facebook was sued by the federal government for hiring policies that discriminate against American graduates.\\n\\nThe labor pyramid includes H-1Bs hired by the companies and by their subcontracting companies. The categories of workers also include J-1s, TNs, OPTs, B-1/B-2s, and foreign graduates who overstay their visas. Most work for Fortune 500 companies, but they are also prominent in tech firms, universities, and increasingly in the healthcare sector.\\n\\nThis huge imported workforce ensures that executives rarely have to compete for American graduates by offering higher wages, even when profits are growing. A 2020 report by the Federal Reserve said median salaries for U.S. graduates fell by two percent from 2016 to 2019 as blue-collar salaries rose amid President Donald Trump's border policies.\\n\\nThere is some evidence that the increasing use of visa workers is reducing U.S. technological capability, even as Chinese companies take the lead from investor-driven U.S. companies.\\n\\nThis growing use of this Green Card Workforce is ignored and misunderstood by the largely powerless white-collar reporters in the corporate media. Many media companies — such as the Washington Post — are owned by firms or investors who want to grow their Green Card Workforce.\\n\\nOther white-collar reporters choose to view the visa workers via the lens of progressive immigration politics, even though the H-1B workers are foreign contract workers who replace white-collar Americans and who do not become immigrants until they receive a green card."}

{"original": "Twitter has posted their first profitable quarter in 12 years, but the company is still lagging behind in monthly user metrics.\\n\\nThe Verge reports that Twitter has finally posted a profitable quarter after operating at a loss for almost 12 years. Twitter posted a profit of $91 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, a massive increase on the $167 million loss the company posted a year previously in the fourth quarter of 2016. The company told investors last year that they expected their first profitable quarter soon due to cost-cutting measures implemented by the company. Twitter also saw a two percent rise in their revenue this quarter, up to $732 million in comparison with last year's $717 million.\\n\\nHowever, not all of Twitter's latest metrics are positive. The company has a growing issue on its hands — specifically in active monthly users. While the company's monthly users grew by approximately 4 percent each year, that growth was stalled every quarter settling at a number around 330 million. Even more worrying for Twitter, the number of active monthly U.S. users has actually shrunk from 69 million to 68 million. This is the second time in one year that the number of active U.S. users has dropped. It seems that Twitter's growth internationally has been slow but steady but the company is failing to convince their American users to stick with the platform.\\n\\nTwitter has laid some of the blame for their slow user growth on Apple's doorstep, pointing to a change in Safari's third-party app integrations. Twitter stated that they lost approximately two million monthly users as a result of the change, one million of these users were US based. The company does believe that their change in the length of Tweets that users can post has been a positive though, stating that it's responsible for users spending more time on the platform and returning to it at higher rates.\\n\\nDespite their profitable quarter, Twitter continues to lag behind their social media competitors such as Facebook and Instagram. Facebook boasts a whopping 2.2 billion active monthly users while Instagram has approximately 800 million monthly users. However, it is likely that Twitter's latest earnings report will take some pressure off CEO Jack Dorsey despite the company's continued failure to convince people to use the platform."}
{"original": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal is lipstick on a pig.\\n\\nOcasio-Cortez – Occasional Cortex, as she's known, because she's so thick she doesn't even know how stupid she is – is the lipstick, obviously.\\n\\nAnd the pig is the Green New Deal itself which isn't remotely new, or particularly green, and which is far too expensive and damaging to merit the flattering term 'deal'.\\n\\nBut since with the telegenic dancing congresswoman promoting it it's not going to go away, perhaps we'd do well to examine it in more detail.\\n\\nNatural Gas Now blog has the dirt.\\n\\nThe Green New Deal is just a warmed-over version of Bernie Sanders's 2015 Keep It in the Ground Act.\\n\\nOn November 4, 2015, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) introduced the Keep It in the Ground Act which, according to The Weekly Standard, would enact [350.org founder Bill] McKibben's vision in toto. Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) introduced a companion bill in the House a few months later. But soon after, the #NoDAPL protests at Standing Rock—which were supposed to galvanize public support behind the Keep It in the Ground movement and usher in the dawn of the post-fossil fuel era—turned violent. Recognizing that extreme activism was not generating the public support they needed to upend U.S. energy policy, the leaders of the KIITG movement made a deliberate decision to change their tactics. Almost overnight, orchestrated militant actions were replaced with promises of guaranteed green jobs for all. Since then, Sanders and Rep. Huffman have abandoned the Keep It in the Ground campaign entirely and instead now publicly and enthusiastically endorse the Green New Deal.\\n\\nIt's part of a wider movement orchestrated by veteran Canadian eco-agitator Bill McKibben and his 350.org network.\\n\\nA month after the election, Sanders hosted the National Town Hall on Climate Change Solutions—featuring Bill McKibben, activist Van Jones, and Representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez—to introduce the Green New Deal to the world. While this event looked like a gathering of disparate groups throwing their support behind this new movement, it was actually a gathering of compatriots working together to promote their common agenda. Specifically:\\n\\nBill McKibben was one of just five people Sanders named to the Platform Drafting Committee at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.\\n\\nVan Jones , who served as President Obama's environmental adviser and who wrote The Green Collar Economy, was hand-picked by McKibben to be one of only 20 messengers for 350.org, who acted as global spokespeople espousing 350.org's Keep It in the Ground philosophy.\\n\\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez who found her political awakening fighting the constructionof the Dakota Access pipeline at Standing Rock, was a campaign organizer for Sanders' 2016 presidential run and campaigned with him in the summer of 2018.\\n\\nThe shock troops of the Green New Deal are known as the Sunrise Movement, which sounds like a new thing but it's not. It's simply a repurposed version of an old, failed campaign of 350.org's – the college divestment network.\\n\\n350.org is so invested in the Green New Deal that it is quietly transforming its college divestment campaign, the Fossil Fuel Divestment Student Network, into the Sunrise Movement, which serves as shock-troop protesters for the Green New Deal. For example, as college divestment campaigns close up shop, they encourage their followers to check out Sunrise Movement! In addition, two co-founders of the Sunrise Movement, Sara Blazevic and Varshini Prakash, left the Fossil Fuel Divestment Student Network to create the Sunrise Movement. Sunrise activists have protested on Capitol Hill and, encouraged by Ocasio-Cortez, have engaged in sit-ins in congressional offices, including three in the offices of Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), to push House Democrats to create a special committee next year focused entirely on climate change initiatives.\\n\\nUltimately, this campaign is a throwback to the worst of the Obama era – and betrays the hallmarks of one of the Obama era's most notorious and discredited figures, Van Jones, who wrote the book The Green Collar Economy on which the Green New Deal is based.\\n\\nVan Jones was one of the early proponents of the Green New Deal concept, which he outlines in his 2008 book, The Green Collar Economy: How One Solution Can Fix Our Two Biggest Problems. An Amazon book review describes the book as a re-imagining of FDR's original New Deal that makes the government 'a partner' of the people, and sets about defining the principles of a 'smart, supportive, reliable' partnership. This also happens to be exactly what Ocasio-Cortez promises in her version of the Green New Deal. Wiki said, The book is a detailed proposal for a 'Green New Deal.' In 2009, Jones resigned from the White House under a cloud for supporting the view that President Bush was complicit in the September 11 terror attacks, and his treatise on the Green New Deal failed to get traction.\\n\\nHere's why, even though the House Democrats have shown no immediate interest in pursuing it, the Green New Deal remains a clear and present danger.\\n\\nUnder the Green New Deal, Congress must develop a plan for the transition of the United States economy to become carbon neutral by 2030. And to accomplish that, the U.S. will need to make big investments today to jump-start and develop new projects and sectors to power the new economy, which are estimated to be in the tens of trillions of dollars. Some of these activists are hoping to get that money by diverting the trillions of dollars needed to build and upgrade our current energy and transportation infrastructures to entirely rebuild the U.S. economy to suit their Utopian and unrealistic world view. With hundreds of state and local officials and likely 2020 presidential candidates signing on to support the Green New Deal, this campaign isn't going anywhere. And neither is its supporters' strong aversion to the oil and natural gas that has made the US a leader in affordable energy, environmental progress, and economic advancements.\\n\\nThis is why I call Ocasio-Cortez a Care Bear Communist. She comes across as ditzy, cute, approachable but the policies she wants to enact are pure hard-left poison.\\n\\nAnd she really shouldn't be underestimated. She has youth on her side: imagine the damage she's capable of doing between now and the time she's Nancy Pelosi's age! And, as Laura Perrins notes here, she knows how to exploit her beautiful woman privilege to the max:\\n\\nOcasio-Cortez is a looker and I hazard a guess has had the privilege of turning men into gibbering idiots for most of her adult life. I have little doubt she has been trotting out utter nonsense and yet can make it look convincing and credible because she has hardly ever been challenged on it. This is what happens when beautiful women grow up in Leftist circles and are rarely called out for mixing up a billion with a trillion. This builds confidence and sense of entitlement and soon you end up with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Then suddenly when she enters Congress and her policies are examined by people on the Right, she thinks this is down to sexism. No. it's not your sex we have a problem with; it's the socialism.\\n\\nAmen, sister."}

Those are expensive so we thought we'd all chip in and ride together, Sanders said, ultimately conceding that he does not know if the idea will come to fruition. That's greener. That's greener, sir, Colbert noted.

{"original": "The independent outlet Cubanet published a video Tuesday of a long line in Havana, Cuba, in which distressed citizens complained of waiting outside in close quarters for hours for their government-allotted food rations, exposing themselves to potential carriers of the Chinese coronavirus.\\n\\nThe Cuban communist government claimed to have confirmed 57 cases of Chinese coronavirus on the island as of Wednesday. It identified another 1,479 people hospitalized with symptoms that could indicate a coronavirus infection. The Castro regime claims that Italian tourists brought the virus to the island nation, despite the consistent traffic of people between Cuba and its fellow communist nation China, where the virus originated.\\n\\nCuba initially announced it would launch a tourism initiative to attract people whose vacations had been canceled by much of the rest of the world instituting quarantines and lockdowns to combat the highly contagious disease. It also refused to shut down schools; due to severe water and soap shortages in the country, schools requested that parents send each child to their classrooms with a small amount of soap – that parents complained they could not afford or find in any stores.\\n\\nThe Castro regime has since yielded to popular demand to shut down schools, cut traffic from abroad, and shut down bars, night clubs, and other businesses that attract crowds. Other than these measures, however, it has done little to change the daily realities of the average Cuban that make each highly vulnerable to a viral infection.\\n\\nParamount among these are the perennial ration lines, where Cubans can spend most of a day waiting for chicken drumsticks, stale bread, or a small allotment of laundry detergent. As the footage published by Cubanet shows, the ration lines do not conform to public health experts' social distancing guidelines, which suggest people maintain a six-foot distance between each other to keep from spreading the airborne virus.\\n\\nMany on the lines appear to be wearing homemade masks, which the communist government has encouraged without providing any access to medical masks that can actually block pathogens. Others appear to have made makeshift masks for their children.\\n\\nWe have been out here fighting over a little bit of chicken for hours, one person on the line protests.\\n\\nAnother person, a woman, complains about the use of homemade masks.\\n\\nKnock it off with the craziness with the face mask, that stuff is microscopic, that's a lie that the face mask blocks it, get away from me, the exasperated woman says.\\n\\nA man attempts to explain to the crowd that the person in charge of chicken distribution is using a new method to help with social distancing: rather than let individual pick up their bag of chicken at the front of the line, they will be handed a bag chosen by the government worker.\\n\\nThey are just going to give packs of chicken to people because, before, people chose their own chicken and that takes too long, the man says, noting that the line has not stretched around the block.\\n\\nSomeone apparently in charge or affiliated with the government in some way walks over to the person with the camera and requests that those around try to make a space of one meter between them, or about half the recommended distance by public health experts.\\n\\nReports in other outlets this week have indicated that growing concern over a potential shutdown of critical distribution centers has created agitated crowds at ration centers. The lines for the little soap available and items like dish and laundry detergent have been especially tense this week.\\n\\nIn addition to the usual product shortages, people in western Cuba, particularly the greater Havana area, are facing a water shortage. The Castro regime revealed this week that it believes nearly half a million people in and around Havana have no access to water, making it impossible for them to wash their hands. Havana officials claim insufficient rain is to blame for the shortages.\\n\\nThe Castro regime also provides barely any access to basic medications, including antibiotics and drugs used to treat cold symptoms, which many colds have in common with the Chinese coronavirus. In July, medical professionals warned that upwards of 40 medications common in global pharmacies are either unavailable or rare to find throughout the island. Cubans suffering fevers and other symptoms that may indicate a coronavirus infection told Radio Martí this week that they have had to resort to the black market to find drugs their doctors prescribed them.\\n\\nThere are no medicines to lower fevers or to calm pain, Lázaro Yuri Valle, whose wife, Eralidis Frómeta, was prescribed azithromycin for fever and body aches, told Radio Martí. People have no food, no personal goods, and the little that [the government] brings out makes people crowd up in stores, and that is what spreads the disease. There is no way of preventing the propagation of this virus.\\n\\nFrómeta had spent hours in a line to buy soap before running a fever. The government has not identified her as a coronavirus carrier. The couple could not find azithromycin, a common antibiotic, in any legal pharmacy and resorted to the black market.\\n\\nThe Castro regime has not acknowledged the Chinese origin of the virus. The Communist Party newspaper Granma published an article suggesting that the virus is an American-made biological weapon.\\n\\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."}

Maréchal-Le Pen said she wanted more time to spend with her young daughter away from the stresses of political life.\\n\\nWhen a brave leader leaves his troops it is always very sad, but she is very young and we are sure that she will come back even stronger, Durox said in reaction to the news of Maréchal-Le Pen's decision.

It uses the Huawei's powerful Kirin chipset, giving it more power and performance than even more expensive competitive devices. Its only disappointment, according to reviewers, is that the camera isn't as powerful as those on competitive phones.\\n\\nI have spent a part of my career as a senior software engineer developing chip-level operating system software for embedded systems, so I know exactly how any chip or any electronic device can be turned into a tool for espionage. Furthermore, I can tell you that not only is it doable, it is not even particularly difficult for someone with the right skills.\\n\\nThis could not be detected by tests, because the chip would work normally until a backdoor is activated by receiving, say, a secret 1024-bit code. Then it will execute commands sent to it by Chinese engineers. Thus, the Chinese are then in control of any devices with Huawei chips, and it cannot be detected until it is too late. And since Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei was previously an officer and engineer in China's People's Liberation Army (PLA), there is little question that these steps have been taken.\\n\\nChina's biggest natural resource is its population of 1.4 billion. China sends them overseas to work or get educated and controls them by the United Front Work Department (UFWD). China's officials even call them secret weapons. China's fleet of fishing boats in the South China Sea and East China Sea have crews that have been trained by the military for espionage, and even to fight in battle.\\n\\nThis is how China works, and now China's Huawei is launching low-cost smartphones to be purchased by the millions around the world, and which can be controlled by China's military, at the right time.\\n\\nAs I have written in detail in the past, if Huawei really wants to convince Westerners that their products do not contain secret backdoors, then they should invite American and Western engineers to work side-by-side with Chinese engineers in development centers in China, so that American engineers can examine all the internal code and scripts, just as Chinese workers work in development centers in America. Expert Reviews and IDC (11/2/2018) and Bloomberg\\n\\nRelated Articles:\\n\\nPoland arrests Huawei employee on spying allegations\\n\\nPoland's Internal Security Agency (ISA) has arrested two individuals. One is a Chinese national going by the name Weijing W or Stanislaw Wang, who works as a sales director for Huawei in Poland. The other is a Polish national, Piotr D, a former high-ranking officer of Poland's ISA. Both were charged with spying against Poland for China. ISA officers raided the homes of both suspects on Tuesday morning. They also seized documents and electronic data from the offices of Huawei and mobile phone operator Orange Polska, where Piotr D had worked recently.\\n\\nThis comes after the December arrest by the Canadian police, at the request of the United States, of Ms. Meng Wanzhou (Sabrina Meng), the chief financial officer (CFO) of China's Huawei Technologies, which was founded by her father Ren Zhengfei. According to reports, China has retaliated by arresting as many 13 Canadian citizens.\\n\\nAt the same time, many European countries are becoming more aggressive at prohibiting the use of Huawei technology, since it might have backdoors that permit espionage or control. This is increasingly becoming a more serious tit-for-tat escalation of actions that shows no sign of ending and may spiral into something much bigger.\\n\\nRelated Articles:\\n\\nChinese economic expert Xiang Songzuo warns that economy shows signs of crashing\\n\\nIn a speech given in early December by Professor Xiang Songzuo, Deputy Director and Senior Fellow of the Center for International Monetary Research at China's Renmin University in Beijing, he said:\\n\\nYou can look at the history: only the Wall Street Crash of 1929 can compare to the steep decline that the Chinese stock has experienced this year. Many stocks are down 80 or even 90 percent.\\n\\nIn his speech, Xiang backed up his concerns with numerous facts and figures. Such speeches are normally dismissed, but in this case, the speech has so alarmed Chinese officials that it was banned from the internet, though it was translated into English and posted outside of China before it was banned. Furthermore, a number of financial firms are taking Xiang's conclusions very seriously.\\n\\nAs many problems as the U.S. economy has, China's economy is much worse because of real estate bubbles, ghost towns, shadow banks, and a hugely leveraged credit bubble that could crash at any time. While I can make a general statement like that, Xiang has backed up those concerns with specifics.\\n\\nMany people believe that since China is a Communist dictatorship, they cannot have a recession because the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) will control the economy enough to prevent it. It does not work that way. Like every socialist economy, China's economy was headed for disaster until it was opened to free markets in the 1970-80s. In fact, every socialist economy has either opened up to free markets to some extent or ended in disaster and massive bloodshed. Today, only Venezuela and North Korea have refused to open up to free markets, and both of those are disasters, with bloodshed in the future.\\n\\nChina today is subject to the same market forces and the same generational forces as every other country. People fool themselves into believing that politicians can actually change things. In China, only the politics will be different, but the outcomes will be the same. China Change (28-Dec-2018) and National Interest and Naked Capitalism and Don Tai (29-Dec-2018)\\n\\nXiang's Headline statistic: At most 1.67 percent GDP rate of growth\\n\\nThe headline statistic in Xiang's speech is his claim that China's GDP rate of growth is at most 1.67 percent, or may even be negative. China's official National Bureau of Statistics claims that China's rate of GDP growth is at 6.5 percent. This one statistic alone could explain why the CCP felt it necessary to censor Xiang's speech.\\n\\nNobody is surprised that China lies about statistics. Mao Zedong lied about agricultural statistics during the Great Leap Forward in 1958-59, with the result that tens of millions of Chinese died from starvation or were executed.\\n\\nThe problem is that you can lie about statistics only for a while, and then reality causes a financial crisis, which is what Xiang is predicting.\\n\\nSince the CCP can pump money into any business at will, it would seem that any financial crisis can be prevented. The problem is that any business that can count on being bailed out has no motivation to become efficient, and so loses money.\\n\\nXiang says that this has happened with almost all Chinese businesses:\\n\\nLook at our profit structure. To put it plainly, China's listed companies don't really make money. Then who has taken the few profits made by China's more than 3,000 listed companies? Two-thirds have been taken by the banking sector and real estate. The profits earned by 1,444 listed companies on the SME board and growth enterprise board are not even equal to one and half times the profit of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. How can this kind of stock market become a bull market? When we buy stocks, we are buying the profits of the company, not hype and rumors. I recently read a report comparing the profits of China's listed companies with those in the U.S. There are many U.S. public companies with tens of billions dollars in profits. How many Chinese tech and manufacturing companies are there that have accomplished this? There is only one, but it's not listed, and you all know which one that is. [Xiang is referring to Huawei, the Chinese tech company.] What does this tell us?\\n\\nXiang says that there are major risks in the economy, and major battles to be fought:\\n\\nChina's economic decline indicates that there is a major issue with the focus on expansion and growth: It has deviated from the fundamental and moved to speculation. … What are our current financial risks? They are hidden, complex, acute, contagious, and malevolent. Structural imbalance are massive, and violations of law and regulations are rampant. … We have rampant speculations everywhere, in too many aspects.\\n\\nAccording to Xiang, Basically China's economy is all built on speculation, and everything is over-leveraged. This is significant, because when a company is over-leveraged, then when there is an economic downturn it will not be able to meet its debt payments. If every company is like that, then when one company goes bankrupt, it will create a chain reaction that sends every company into bankruptcy.\\n\\nThis is the basis of Xiang's statement that China's stock market is facing a huge crash greater than America's 1929 crash.\\n\\nChina's Five phases of consumption\\n\\nAccording to Xiang, in the four decades following economic reform, China has undergone five phases of consumption:\\n\\nSolve the food problem.\\n\\nThe New Big Three: short for refrigerator, color TV, and washing machine.\\n\\nConsumption of information\\n\\nautomobiles\\n\\nreal estate\\n\\nAccording to Xiang:\\n\\nBut these five waves have essentially all come to an end. Car sales have dropped sharply and real estate spending is also substantially decreasing, so we are facing serious problems. This is the crux of the six stabilities called for by the Politburo [stable employment, stable finance, stable foreign trade, stable foreign investment, stable investment and stable expectations], or as some internet users have joked, the six tender kisses [kiss, is a homophone for , stability].\\n\\nXiang says that China made a historic mistake by relying on consumption:\\n\\nLook at these numbers. That China faces a long-term economic downturn is not a problem by itself. But you may have noticed that the consumption and the service sectors now make up 78.5 percent of GDP. Going by the government's logic, this should be a good thing, since it means the economic transition to a consumption economy has been successful: we used to rely on investment and export, now we rely on consumption and the service sector. This sounds reasonable, but think about it: in a country like China, as investment slows dramatically, how can we maintain economic stability by solely relying on consumption?\\n\\nXiang says that consumption and services comprise 78.5 percent of GDP, which is good news to some extent, but it is far eclipsed by negative implications of low investment.\\n\\nMajor misjudgments about China's economy\\n\\nXiang says that in the past year, China has made major misjudgments about the economy.\\n\\nThe first misjudgment was vastly underestimating the negative effects of the US-China trade war on China:\\n\\nFirst, the trade war between China and the U.S.. Did we make some inaccurate assessment? Did we underestimate the severity of the situation? Let's recall some slogans from the mainstream media at the beginning of the year: In the trade war between U.S. and China, the Americans are lifting rocks only to smash them on their own feet\\n\\nChina is sure to win.\\n\\nChina will win the trade war without a doubt, be the battles big or small. What's behind this kind of thinking? To this day, we keep suffering from a cognitive dissonance between our understanding of the Sino-U.S. trade war and the international reality. This calls for deep reflection.\\n\\nThe second misjudgment has caused private businesses to lose confidence in the national leadership, with the result that investment by private business owners has fallen substantially. According to Xiang, this has occurred because the Chinese media have been suggesting that the economic reforms of the past 40 years will be reversed, and there will be a return to full-scale socialism:\\n\\nSince the beginning of the year, though, all kinds of ideological statements have been thrown around: statements like private property will be eliminated,\\n\\nprivate ownership will eventually be abolished if not now,\\n\\nit's time for the private enterprises to fade away, or\\n\\nall private companies should be turned over to their workers. Then there was this high-profile study of Marx and the Communist Manifesto. Remember that line in the Communist Manifesto? Abolition of private property. What kind of signal do you think this sends to private entrepreneurs?\\n\\nWith regard to the trade war, Xiang says that it is really a clash of value systems, with no solution in sight:\\n\\nIn addition to this, there are three major external challenges. The first is the trade war, which is in fact no longer a trade war but rather a clash between two opposed value systems. It can be said with certainty that the Sino-U.S. relationship has come to a crossroads right now and faces significant historic challenges. What are we to do? To be honest, I don't think we have really found much of a solution. You are aware that Huawei's CFO Meng Wanzhou was recently detained in Vancouver. In the past two days, mainstream media such as BBC and CNN have been reporting on how the U.S. is going at Huawei on all fronts. What this tells us is that this issue is not simply about trade or economics.\\n\\nUnless the date is postponed, China and the U.S. have until March 1 to reach agreement on a huge list of trade and trade secret protection issues, before the U.S. substantially increases tariffs on Chinese imports.\\n\\nWhat this almost certainly means is that the can will be kicked down the road. This could mean that the March 1 date will be postponed, or it could mean that president Trump will simply increase the pressure on China by increasing tariffs by a small amount.\\n\\nRelated Articles\\n\\nKEYS: Generational Dynamics, China, Huawei Technologies, Ren Zhengfei, People's Liberation Army, PLA, Meng Wanzhou, Sabrina Meng, United Front Work Department, UFWD, Poland, Internal Security Agency, ISA, Weijing W, Stanislaw Wang, Piotr D, Xiang Songzuo, Renmin University\\n\\nPermanent web link to this article\\n\\nReceive daily World View columns by e-mail"}

Sitting in a dimly lit room crowded with fellow Christian refugees, Stephanos Giorgis could be forgiven for wanting a future outside the Middle East.\\n\\nThis young man had escaped from his home town of Rableh in western Syria after a ransom was paid following his abduction by an Islamist group.

The exodus has been replicated in so many Syrian towns and cities, as we discovered when our small delegation from Aid to the Church in Need, the Catholic charity for persecuted and other suffering Christians, visited the region.\\n\\nA central finding of our trip was that unless there is a radical change in Syria's fortunes, time is running out for the country's Christian community.\\n\\nWe found that Christians in Syria are fleeing their homes at a far higher rate than hitherto reported. Almost every Christian we spoke to on the subject said they were avowed supporters of President Assad, and many went further, claiming that unless he emerged victorious in Syria's civil war the country's Christians would drain away.\\n\\nIf this is true, then the government's apparent triumph over ISIS in the ancient city of Palmyra over the Easter weekend could be a crucial turning-point in the survival of Syria's Christian community.\\n\\nIn the eyes of many, such military success could not come a moment too soon. When, a year ago, a European Parliament motion on the conflict in Syria claimed that 700,000 of Syria's 1.25 million Christians had fled, there was widespread concern that the figures were exaggerated.\\n\\nBut the research we conducted while we were there suggested that the figure for the number of displaced and refugee Christians could now be nearer a million.\\n\\nProportionately, this is far higher than the exodus figures for the Syrian population as a whole. We spoke to our project partners in those centres where Aid to the Church in Need is providing urgent help (food, water, medicine and shelter), and they were able to give us some realistic figures.\\n\\nUntil the war broke out in spring 2011, Aleppo was home to the largest number of Christians, but we were told that the faithful had now dwindled from 200,000 to close to 35,000 – a decline of 85 per cent.\\n\\nThe second-largest Christian community in Syria before the war was in Homs, but when we visited the city, at a time of continuing insecurity, Church leaders said the numbers had slumped by an astonishing 95 per cent – 40,000 down to barely 2,000. Even in regions where the Syrian government had largely succeeded in the struggle against militants, the decline was still very marked."}

As they begin to understand themselves, there's been a strength that's moved into the water, and out of the water. That's been the excitement.\\n\\nNaturally, Barnes had to shift from Ryan's complaints, and the Michigan swim team's reaction, to politics.\\n\\nIt is a simple change but not an easy one. Ryan's presence asks the complicated question, of what does inclusion of non-binary athletes look like in an athletic system defined as a binary? There is no simple answer to that question, and it is one being grappled with across the United States. At times the lack of understanding of trans identity is used as a cudgel to ostracize trans people, as seen in North Carolina with HB2 and more recently in Texas with Mack Beggs and the consideration of SB6.\\n\\nBut as Newsbusters' Jay Maxson notes, there has been a lot of use of the cudgel to ostracize Americans who want to continue recognizing biological and traditional gender identifications, not to mention those who have safety and religious concerns.\\n\\nSo, while ESPN's Barnes slams the country for this obsession with gender, she indulges her own obsession with rewriting the rules for how we address gender.\\n\\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com."}
{"original": "Rebecca Friedrichs, plaintiff in the 2016 Supreme Court case Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, said ongoing teachers strikes in California are about more money for teachers unions' far-left politics. She offered her remarks in a Monday interview on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.\\n\\nThe interview took place during Los Angeles's ongoing teachers' strike in Los Angeles, the first of its kind in 30 years in California's largest city. Roughly two-thirds of children are out of school, creating hardship for tens of thousands of families; many of them poor, working-class, or minority households.\\n\\nIn Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, Friedrichs challenged the Supreme Court's 1977 decision in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, which held that public sector unions may impose dues on non-members working for government agencies whose employees they ostensibly represent. Abood v. Detroit Board of Education was overturned by the Supreme Court's 2018 Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31 decision.\\n\\nFriedrichs argued in her lawsuit that mandatory union dues imposed on teachers — and other education professionals — via compulsory unionization violated First Amendment protections.\\n\\nFriedrichs said, Everything the unions do in a public school setting is political. Even collective bargaining is political because the unions are on both sides of the table. People they've placed into office are sitting on the opposite side of the table. So the taxpayer never has a voice, but the taxpayer pays the bills. So it's all political.\\n\\nLISTEN:\\n\\nFriedrichs said, Now you know why there are teacher strikes all across the country, because during oral arguments in that case, the union lawyers literally said, and I quote, if the Janus case won and people like myself are freed from being forced to fund unions, the unions would, quote, 'raise an untold specter of union unrest throughout the country because,' quote, 'union security is the trade-off for no strikes.' That's why we have teacher strikes today.\\n\\nPollak shared, I have a teachers' union member in my family. My sister is a teacher. Public school, private school, she's moved back and forth. She likes the union. She feels like the union protects her from abusive administrators and whatnot. We've got this strike. Nobody can figure out exactly what it's about. We're told the Los Angeles strike is about salaries and classroom sizes, but you think it's really about politics. Tell us more.\\n\\nFriedrichs replied, It's about politics. First let me address your sister. Most teachers are like your sister, because they like their local association; their friends that stand together against a corrupt system. Teachers don't realize their schools are corrupt thanks to state and national teachers' unions that teachers are funding in the billions every year. So your sister likes her local, I guarantee it. But if she knew what the state and national [teachers' unions] were doing with her money, like funding divisive things like masculinity being toxic — teachers' unions fund all that stuff push all that divisive rhetoric — she probably wouldn't like that. She just doesn't know she's funding it.\\n\\nFriedrichs added, Teachers' unions in L.A. have been offered a six percent raise. They've been offered more nurses, counselors, librarians — who would all pay dues, by the way — and they've even been offered the smaller class sizes they want. They're continuing to strike because they've been convinced by state and national teachers' unions that they need to push for a moratorium on charter schools and push for full unionization of charter schools. So those teachers are denying school choice to the very little kids who need it.\\n\\nFriedrichs went on, Teachers, most of them are good people who just don't get it, that they're being used to push an agenda. Why do state and national teachers' unions want a moratorium on charter schools? Because most charter schools are not unionized, so teachers' unions don't get teachers' dues money out of those schools. Bottom line.\\n\\nPollak invited Friedrichs to respond to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's (R-NY) expressed support for striking teachers in opposition to privatization of education.\\n\\nThese LA teachers striking against privatization + demanding smaller classrooms/more support for their students is a whole 2019 mood\\n\\n💃🏿💃🏼💃🏽 pic.twitter.com/iMska5whpH — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) January 14, 2019\\n\\n[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] just repeated a union talking point, replied Friedrichs. You can find it in all the union documents. There is no such thing as the privatization of public schools. They just make that up because it fits their narrative. it's very confusing to parents on the ground, because parents don't understand what's going on.\\n\\nFriedrichs explained, Here in California we've tried three times to push for school choice. The best thing for every child and every parent is to have school choice, to pick the school that's best for your child; best for your child's learning style or maybe a school closer to your work; whatever it is you need. But the teachers' unions continue to come up with these horrifying talking points, and people buy into it and believe them and vote against their own values. That's exactly what this is about. It's about more money for teachers' unions, more money for teachers' unions far-left politics, and more teachers paying union dues. That's what this is all about. It has nothing to do with the children. In fact, it's harming many children.\\n\\nFriedrichs recalled, I served as a union leader for three years in my school district because I thought, stupidly, that I could hope to change things from within, because all of my teacher friends agreed with me. None of us wanted to be involved with politics. We got into teaching to teach children, not to be political or to be used as pawns in a political match. So I joined.\\n\\nMy husband and I went to a state-level California Teachers Association conference and we were stunned, recollected Friedrichs. We walked into the expo center and w thought we were in the wrong conference because every single table was covered with politically charged materials favoring the far left. For example, there were tables all about pro-abortion, all about LGBT rights and LGBT student rights. Anything you can dream up, the far left was on those tables. We couldn't find anything that had to do with helping us teachers become better educators.\\n\\nFriedrichs continued, We learned at that conference, I was in this large room and a teacher dared to ask a question. She said, 'Hey, I'm here representing my teacher colleagues, and we are concerned that so much of our money is being spent on political ideology. We're against a lot of it, and we just don't think our dues money should be spent on politics. What can we do about that?' They shut her down so thoroughly and with such cruelty from the stage that 300 teachers in that room were dead silent; terrified; stuck to our seats. That's how they control teachers; with angry rhetoric and shutting us down if we dare to question them. Everything they talk about is far-left politics, and boy, if you don't agree, you get squashed.\\n\\nFriedrichs states, The sad thing about public school teachers is that they are unaware that they are funding the demise of their profession and the demise of their schools, because the teachers' unions are the ones who are pushing for all of the policies [and] leaders across the state of California that are causing the very problems you just listed off.\\n\\nFriedrichs dismissed narratives of class sizes compromising pedagogical quality.\\n\\nIf there's good discipline in a school, I can teach any class size, stated Friedrichs. The problem is when there's a lack of discipline. The teachers' unions have brought in a total lack of discipline with their radical [and] divisive racial equity discipline policies. That's a whole other interview, just to understand that, but teachers' classrooms are falling apart and they don't understand that's it's the unions' fault. That's why they want smaller class sizes.\\n\\nFriedrichs noted the volume of state budgets being consumed by ever-increasing teachers' unions' financial demands for members' compensation.\\n\\nThe district in which I live in southern California, now 100% of our funding goes to paying pay and pensions, highlighted Friedrichs. Teachers don't understand that their defined benefit pension programs — which taxpayers are on the hook for paying those pensions whether the money is there or not — are a big part of the problem. They are trillions and trillions of dollars of unfunded pension liabilities across the country. So these teachers don't understand that because their unions refuse to work with really smart folks who understand math to fix these pensions; not to cheat teachers but to do it in a way that actually makes sense and where we can all afford to fund them. Because they won't listen, the schools are now spending all their money on pay and pensions. There's nothing left for the kids. How can you have smaller and smaller class sizes when all of your resources have been used up for pay and pensions?\\n\\nFriedrichs concluded, In addition, 52 percent of the California state budget is already used towards education. The governor just offered; I just watched a television program where he offered some more billions. I don't know how many, they said $24 billion. I don't know if that's the total or what, but he's offering more, and the unions said that's an insult, it's not enough. What about our roads? What about other public needs besides what the teachers' unions want?\\n\\nBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.\\n\\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter."}
{"original": "The Twilight Zone economy we are currently experiencing could implode if interest rates were to ever normalize.\\n\\nEven mere whispers of this possibility can never be publicly acknowledged by any currently serving central banker; to do so would seriously undermine their legitimacy in the eyes of the public, who have become accustomed to their spoon-fed propaganda. These experts are the ones who are ultimately responsible for the problems we now face. They allow politicians to spend beyond their respective countries' means, then give them blank checks to bail them out whenever they get into too much trouble.\\n\\nBuilt upon an ever-increasing mountain of debt, any significant uptick in rates could bring the whole financial system down. Most existing borrowers, be they individuals or institutions, would likely be unable to handle higher payments if forced to refinance at pre-2008 levels.\\n\\nHave you ever met a lender or real estate broker who tried to get you to spend LESS money?\\n\\nHow many of you reading this right now could make payments on a new 30-fixed rate home mortgage if rates rose from the current 3.6% to 5.0%? What if they increased to 6.0%, where they were in the summer of 2008?\\n\\nOn a much larger scale, from businesses and entire nations, the hard choice of living within one's means has been rejected by short-sighted voters who seemingly aren't doing the math or thinking of the implications beyond just a few years.\\n\\nNo one above an elementary school education can deny that it is mathematically impossible to pay down our current debt bubble with sound currency or without using questionable accounting methods. The world's financial system has crossed the Rubicon in its ability to fix this problem without all future growth and productivity gains being consumed by interest rate expenses.\\n\\nLook at the two charts below, taken from the U.S. Debt Clock, and note the debt per taxpayer sections (a 14x jump from 1980 to 2016). During this timeframe, income has failed to keep pace with the mounting debt.\\n\\nMarch 16, 1980\\n\\nMarch 16, 2016\\n\\nThis next two chart show how the Keynesian shell game has worked since we adopted the fiat money system on August 15, 1971. Debt has grown at more than twice the rate of GDP. This is nothing short of a debt-based Ponzi scheme that has entered the terminal stages. Everything has its limits, even debt. The recent adoption of negative interest rates by over 20 advanced countries as some solution to this failure is akin to financial chemotherapy that will likely damage or kill, rather than provide the needed cure.\\n\\nThe economy would be in an official financial depression if not for the world's central banks conspiring to push rates down—effectively stealing from savers. This policy is no different than cutting off your leg to feed yourself when on the brink of starvation—you may no longer be hungry, but you'll still bleed out. When the Fed drops rates to benefit people purchasing and refinancing homes, for example, savers have to resort to eating into their principal. This one action is likely going to be the cause of the next mounting financial crisis: pension and insurance failures.\\n\\nSince Home Mortgage rates peaked in October of 1981, the U.S. economy has experienced an unrelenting tailwind. This fall in interest costs has allowed everyone in the economy, from public to private, to borrow and refinance. This cycle, as depicted in the chart below, highlights just how far rates have fallen since October of 1981.\\n\\nRather than use the savings gained from the lower rates to pay down the principal on the debt, the opposite has occurred—it has encouraging even more reckless borrowing. The central bankers are playing with fire by allowing this debt to continue to expand. A day of reckoning is on the horizon; one which will likely start in Japan and be followed by Europe. These two economies are in the worst financial shape, hamstrung by falling birth rates and debt loads well above 100% of GDP.\\n\\nBut aren't corporations doing well?\\n\\nCorporate earnings are being propped up by rolling (refinancing) their debts into lower and lower rates, and borrowing to buy back outstanding shares. If a firm can purchase 10% of their outstanding stock, then earnings get a nice boost without them ever having to increase sales. This buyback strategy has buoyed some of the largest firms all over the world, as they are the ones able to borrow at the most favorable rates.\\n\\nLooking at a real world example, one might wonder what might necessitate a company like Apple to borrow money. The most profitable publically traded company in the whole world, with a pristine balance sheet and billions in cash holdings, is borrowing money and buying back stock. This is NOT a recommendation on the purchase of Apple stock, but instead an observation about that nature of what low-interest rates do to pervert the capitalist system. Historically, firms once borrowed to invest in new equipment and R&D. Today, they are engaging in a buyback orgy that is significantly larger than equity purchases by institutions and retail investors.\\n\\nThe chart below shows how fund flows have been negative for five quarters now, and that even when they have been positive, they are dwarfed by corporate purchases. The largest buyers of stocks have been and continue to be corporations. This is what has been fueling the Fed's wealth effect manipulations. This begs the question: What would happen if this buyback bonanza significantly slowed or stopped?\\n\\nThe solution to all of this is to stop the manipulation of interest rates and begin the painful reversal by beginning to live within ones means. Stagnation is the best we can hope for going forward. The longer this game of manipulating interest rates go on, the larger the future problems we will have to face. No one likes pain. No one likes change. Nevertheless, those days of whistling past the graveyard have passed. If we act now, the hope of living through this, rather than it crumbling all around us, increases exponentially. We must face reality and own up to our obligations by paying our debts. We must accept responsibility for our misguided collective mindset of choosing to have our cake and eat it too—the philosophy that has led us to this point and that we can no longer afford to indulge.\\n\\n***Nothing in this article should be taken as an endorsement to buy or sell any security."}

{"original": "Those who best realize the social doctrine of the church at this time are the Chinese, Archbishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo told the Italian newspaper La Stampa last Friday. They seek the common good, subordinating all things to the general good.\\n\\nJohn Zmirak, senior editor of The Stream, joined Tuesday's edition of SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight to discuss Sorondo's praise of China. Sorondo heads the Vatican's academies of science and social science.\\n\\nOne of the pope's right-hand men, Archbishop Sorondo from South America, he is the head of the Vatican's office on science and social sciences. He actually said a couple of days ago that China does a better job living out Catholic social teachings than the United States, said Zmirak.\\n\\nSorondo pushed left-wing narratives of climate change and capitalism in his praise of the Chinese state's policies.\\n\\n[Sorondo] is saying that they're defending the climate; they're avoiding reckless capitalism, said Zmirak. It's staggering. This is a country that still forces women to get abortions after their second child. This is the head of the Vatican's congregation for science and social sciences. He is saying that because the Chinese government is more responsible, supposedly, on climate change and because it doesn't allow capitalism, it's better than the United States.\\n\\nPope Francis abandoned the underground Catholic church in China in favor of legitimizing an ostensibly Catholic church alternative controlled by China's communist government, said Zmirak.\\n\\nThe Vatican just cut a deal with the collaborationist Chinese communist party-controlled Catholic church, said Zmirak. There's a real church, which has been underground and illegal since Mao Zedong, and then there's been kind of like a Vichy French collaborationist wing, where they work for the government. The government appoints the bishops. The government controls everything. The Catholic church always condemned that as a communist front group. The Vatican just made a deal with the communist front group that they are going to be regarded as the real church, and the underground church has to resign and just go join the communist church.\\n\\nMansour described Pope Francis's about-face towards communism as a 180-degree reversal of Pope John Paul II's approach.\\n\\nRight now, the Chinese communist government is blowing up the churches of evangelical Protestants, and now, what are we doing? asked Zmirak. We're siding with the government that's blowing up these people's churches and putting them in prison. I guarantee you, if this continues, in thirty or forty years, when Christianity is continuing to spread through China, Pope Francis is guaranteeing that it will be Protestant rather than Catholic. So, my Protestant friends, you should thank Pope Francis for guaranteeing that, eventually, China will be largest Protestant country on earth, not Catholic.\\n\\nA former cardinal from China, Joseph Zen, has criticized the Vatican for selling out Catholicism via its overtures to Beijing.\\n\\nThere's a cardinal, Cardinal Zen, I believe, who spent a lot of time in a communist prison, and he feels completely betrayed by the fact that they're making a deal with his persecutors, said Zmirak. Vatican officials are saying, 'Oh, [Joseph Zen is] out of touch. He doesn't know what he's talking about.' They're dismissing the guy who lives in the country and has been in its prisons while they sit in their little Italian hideaways eating gnocchi, drinking wine, and imagining that they're great realpolitik practitioners.\\n\\nShantytown-caliber poverty is non-existent in China, said Sorondo, following a state-supervised visit to the authoritarian country.\\n\\nI found an extraordinary China, said Sorondo. You do not have shantytowns. You do not have drugs. Young people do not have drugs. There is a positive national consciousness. They want to show that they have changed.

{"original": "Berlin has begun restricting private property rentals through Airbnb and similar online platforms, threatening hefty fines in a controversial move meant to keep housing affordable for locals.\\n\\nThe German capital fears that the growing trend of people letting out apartments to tourists through sites such as Airbnb, Wimdu and 9Flats is cutting into a limited property supply and driving up rents.\\n\\nFrom May 1, the city-state will enact a new law known by the German mouthful of Zweckentfremdungsverbot, or prohibition of improper use.\\n\\nIt is a necessary and sensible instrument against the housing shortage in Berlin, said Andreas Geisel, Berlin's head of urban development.\\n\\nI am absolutely determined to return such misappropriated apartments to the people of Berlin and to newcomers, he said.\\n\\nRents in Berlin shot up 56 percent between 2009 and 2014, although at around 10 euros per square metre this year, they are relatively low compared to other major European cities.\\n\\nGiven that it is more profitable to rent out whole apartments for short holiday lets, some investors are holding on to apartments for such rentals rather than having long-term tenants.\\n\\nSan Francisco-based Airbnb.com — short for the business's original name AirBed & Breakfast — is the biggest of several sites that allow people to offer and find such rental accommodation worldwide.\\n\\nWhile Berlin has become one of Europe's top travel destinations, with 30.2 million overnight stays last year, the Airbnb trend has also impacted the local hotel industry.\\n\\nAccording to research firm GBI, the private online bookings represent a parallel market of an additional 6.1 million overnight stays a year.\\n\\n– 'Denouncing neighbours' –\\n\\nThe new law was passed in 2014 and provided for a two-year transition period that ended on April 30, after which owners are only allowed to rent out rooms via such portals, not entire flats or houses.\\n\\nOffenders can face fines of up to 100,000 euros ($113,000).\\n\\nTo catch them, the city has even appealed to the civic spirit of its residents and asked them to anonymously report any suspected misuse online.\\n\\nTim Boening, a 41-year-old artists' agent who rents out a loft in the trendy Kreuzberg district, said he wasn't shocked by the new law, given the practices he has witnessed.\\n\\nThere is, for example, the nice couple with two small apartments who move in together into a bigger place and keep the two apartments to rent them out on Airbnb, he told AFP.\\n\\nI don't think that's good, it should be stopped, he said, as these apartments are not available to normal tenants.\\n\\nMarika, 48, couldn't agree less and is furious about the change, having long rented out four apartments near the centre of Berlin via Airbnb.\\n\\nShe believed that the city is making Berliners pay for its failed housing policy while serving the needs of the hotel industry.\\n\\nThis is unfair, we are forbidden from doing our work, said Marika — not her real name.\\n\\nThe only impact, she argued, would be that some groups, especially families, will simply stay away.\\n\\nShe was especially angry about the request to turn in offenders, saying that in Germany, of all places, maybe we should reconsider this kind of thing, in reference to the Nazi and former East German communist dictatorship in which denouncing others was common practice.\\n\\n– Berlin's positive image –\\n\\nAirbnb Germany said Berliners want clear and simple rules for home sharing, so they can continue to share their own home with guests.\\n\\nThe practice differs from other types of accommodation and helps many Berliners pay their rent, spokesman Julian Trautwein told AFP in a statement.\\n\\nWe will continue to encourage Berlin policy-makers to listen to their citizens and to follow the example of other big cities such as Paris, London, Amsterdam or Hamburg and create new, clear rules for normal people who are sharing their own homes.\\n\\nWimdu has meanwhile filed a suit, arguing the law breaches the constitution of the city-state of Berlin.\\n\\nAnd the owners of start-up 9Flats said they had sold the brand to a Singapore company.\\n\\nWe face a law in Berlin that would drive us into bankruptcy, its boss Roman Bach told the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.\\n\\nSeveral property owners who use Airbnb have formed the Apartments Allianz to push back against the charge they are evil capitalists growing rich on the backs of fellow Berliners.\\n\\nRather, they say, they have offered an attractive, varied range of beautiful and individual apartments, and have through their personal hospitality significantly contributed to a positive image for Berlin.\\n\\nThey say they are not international players, but working in Berlin for Berlin."}
{"original": "Brazil's new president, Jair Bolsonaro, was sworn in on January 1. He won a landslide election in October on a platform that's pro-business, pro-gun, pro-United States, and pro-Israel. At the same time, his platform was also anti-crime, anti-political correctness, anti-Cuba, and anti-Venezuela.\\n\\nIn his inaugural address, Bolsonaro made it clear that his views haven't changed. For instance, pledging his strong support for the police and the military, he recalled the words Ordem e Progresso, emblazoned on his country's flag: The national motto is order and progress. No society can develop without respecting these:\\n\\nA recent poll showed his approval rating to be 75 percent.\\n\\nYet at the same time, Bolsonaro has plenty of enemies, especially in the international media. Although he embraces the label Tropical Trump, the media escalate from there; it's common to see him characterized as a neo-fascist, or just a plain old fascist.\\n\\nYet Brazilians will likely judge Bolsonaro on that most familiar of metrics: the economy. The country is, after all, poor—it ranks 110th in the world—and it shouldn't be.\\n\\nBy territory, Brazil is the fifth-largest country in the world, and on that land, and under that land, are vast natural resources. It's been estimated, in fact, that Brazil's natural wealth—much of it gold and uranium—is worth $21.8 trillion. That's a lot of money, about $103,000 for every Brazilian man, woman, and child.\\n\\nIt is, of course, important that some equitable plan for resource development be put in place. That is, a plan that rewards risk-taking and entrepreneurship but also assures workers and citizens a piece of the action. We might note that one of the signal successes of the previous left-wing regime was its program of family allowances, aimed at the poor and working poor. Such conscious spreading of the wealth is, of course, good politics, and yet it's also good policy because every citizen deserves a fair shake and because it's important to preserve social peace.\\n\\nYet if fairly dividing the pie is important, strongly expanding the pie is even more important. There's wealth in Brazil, but not nearly enough of it—at least not now.\\n\\nAnd part of that problem is that Brazil is remarkably undeveloped. If we look at a map showing where the nation's 211 million people are located, we see that they are mostly huddled along the Atlantic Ocean. We might compare this situation to that of the U.S.; imagine what our prosperity would be like today if we had never pushed across North America, to Texas, California—and everywhere else west of the Atlantic seaboard.\\n\\nSo why haven't Brazilians gone west, as we did? Part of the answer is that the territory is mostly Amazonian rain forest, and as such, for most of Brazil's history, it has been inhospitable to settlement, let alone development.\\n\\nYet by the time that new technologies to foster development in Amazonia had come along—including air conditioning, mosquito abatement, and the helicopter—a new and hostile political attitude had taken hold.\\n\\nThe new thinking focused on preservation, of both the land and the native people. Some of this new thinking was guilt about past ill-treatment of indigenous folk, leading to the present-day idea that they should remain in their environment, living as they always had. And some of it, too, was an emerging ecological consciousness; Amazonia is, undeniably, a fascinating and abundant region, and as such, it has become a preoccupation of Greens around the world.\\n\\nAs a result, much of Brazil's land became off-limits to development. Today, indigenous tribes account for .4 percent of Brazil's population, and yet they inhabit 13 percent of the land. To put that another way, natives are about 32 times more land rich than the average Brazilian. Admittedly, there are often violations of these pro-native restrictions, as illegal poachers and loggers seek quick profits in no-go zones. And yet because these violations are illegal, they are episodic, not offering the potential economic benefits of permanent settlements and systematic development—that is, of the kind that could offer good jobs at good wages to all Brazilians.\\n\\nCombined with other environmental restrictions on land use, Amazonia has become something of a giant national park, and that fencing off of resources has helped to impoverish the nation. And, of course, nobody is poorer than the indigenous tribes; one wonders if people living in huts are really happy living that way—and many do, in fact, flee.\\n\\nIndeed, if we want a quick measure of which countries are rich and which aren't, we might view a nighttime map of the world. Where we see dark, not light, there's not many people, nor much prosperity. And Brazil has plenty of people; the problem is that they lack the wealth to purchase that obvious indicator of economic progress, lights at night.\\n\\nWe can say that Brazil today is a bit like what the U.S. would be like if the land west of the Appalachian Mountains was mostly proscribed from economic development. (In fact, the U.S. federal government owns a prosperity-crimping 28 percent of the land in this country, although that's a tale for another time.)\\n\\nMoreover, as we all know, in recent years there's been a sudden surge of attempted restrictions on economic activity in every country in the world—namely, international mandates to clamp down on carbon dioxide, all aimed at doing something about climate change.\\n\\nThe average Brazilian doesn't consider climate change to be a very important issue, especially not in relation to truly terrible problems such as poverty—or the crime rate, which is even more terrible. Indeed, Brazil is rated as having the highest crime rate in the world, and street crime is terrifyingly rampant.\\n\\nYet still, before Bolsonaro, leftist Brazilian governments had meekly accepted the Western Green agenda, even if it hurt economic development. Such is the power of ideas—and of foreign aid with strings attached to it.\\n\\nThen came Bolsonaro. His campaign platform included a pledge to withdraw from the 2015 Paris Climate Framework, and he has named Ernesto Araújo, a leading critic of climate activism, his foreign minister. Araújo has been unsparing in his critique of foreign influence on his country; as he wrote in October, The tactic of the Left essentially consists of the following: To sequester legitimate causes and noble concepts and to pervert them to serve their political project of total domination:\\n\\nSo we can see that in his fierce antagonism toward foreign hegemonists, Araújo almost sounds like a leftist himself. And yet he's not: he's simply a Brazilian nationalist, tired of other countries imposing their will on his country.\\n\\nIn December, Bolsonaro himself made the case for more economic growth: Environmental politics can't muddle with Brazil's development. Today, the economy is almost back on track thanks to agribusiness, and they are suffocated by environmental questions.\\n\\nYet in addition, Brazil's potential wealth extends far beyond the resources that have already been identified.\\n\\nAs Bloomberg News has reported, Bolsonaro carried chunks of metal with him on the campaign trail, all to make a point about the value of mining. One of those chunks was of niobium, which is one of the rare-earth elements that undergird the modern economy. Because it is needed to strengthen steel and semiconductors, niobium is precious; it sells for about $42,000 a ton. Brazil has 40 million tons of niobium, and if we do the math, that's $1.68 trillion—which is a lot for a country whose annual GDP totals barely more than $2 trillion. The metal is already being mined in Brazil, but Bolsonaro's point is that there's a lot more niobium in the country–and many other rare earths, too; Brazilians just have to find them and get them out of the ground.\\n\\nAs an aside, we might note that rare-earth elements are a key strategic concern of the U.S., since they are vital to our military technology, as well as to our civilian tech. And yet today, the U.S. is 100 percent dependent on China for 29 minerals.\\n\\nIf such dependency on a potential foe doesn't seem to be a good idea, that's because it isn't. The Trump administration has emphasized the need for domestic rare-earth production, but with distinctly limited success, at least so far. And so in the meantime, it would be enormously helpful if we could import rare earths from Brazil.\\n\\nNeedless to say, the thought of digging up Amazonia in pursuit of minerals is horrifying—horrifying, that is, to Western environmentalists. Yet for their part, Brazilians seem okay with it; after all, they just voted Bolsonaro into office. As this author has argued in the past, if a resource is sitting there, it only makes sense that hungry people will wish to see it utilized. Green elites may sentimentalize poverty as living in harmony with nature, but the poor would rather have refrigerators, automobiles, and good health care.\\n\\nGiven this reality—that people won't willingly stay poor while wealth sits under their feet—one might think that Western Greens would be well advised to work with Brazil, so that the nation's mineral wealth can be developed responsibly. That is, resources could be mined using best practices, such that environmental damage is minimized and then the land completely reclaimed. After all, mine reclamation has made huge advances; with proper techniques, the wealth can be extracted and the land made as good as ever.\\n\\nYet instead, it seems as though Western Greens are saddling up for a major confrontation with Bolsonaro. On December 27, the Sierra Club magazine headlined a story, What Will It Take to Rein in the Trump of Brazil? Brazil's president-elect threatens the planet. In that article—which reads exactly like the lefty imperialism that Ernesto Araújo was railing against—the Sierra Club declares, Bolsonaro has shown a responsiveness to economic and international pressure, which could be one way to contain him.\\n\\nWe might pause over that word: contain. That is, the people of Brazil just elected a new leader, knowing full well of his pro-growth agenda. And yet now, the Sierra Club, and other Western Greens, seek to contain him—and, by extension, to contain the Brazilian standard of living.\\n\\nWill Brazilian nationalists be pleased to discover that the Greens are actively using international financial levers against their country? And how will ordinary Brazilians respond to these threats to their standard of living? It will be interesting to see what happens in this looming standoff.\\n\\nLike Donald Trump in North America, Jair Bolsonaro in South America is an experiment. Both are conservative economic nationalists, both promised during their campaigns to unleash prosperity. Both are challenging the entrenched forces of orthodoxy, including Green orthodoxy, at home and abroad:\\n\\nTrump has his track record, and Bolsonaro is starting his. Mindful of the high stakes, other economic nationalists, in other countries, should be paying close attention."}
{"original": "Cuban dictator Raúl Castro surfaced Tuesday to deliver a speech marking the 60th anniversary of the Cuban Revolution, which succeeded on New Year's Day 1959. He chose the moment to blame the United States and its merciless neoliberal policies for poverty in Latin America.\\n\\nCastro addressed a crowd of Communist Party officials in the eastern city of Santiago de Cuba, the Castro family's hometown and where late dictator Fidel Castro is buried.\\n\\nWhile Castro, the head of the Cuban Communist Party and commander-in-chief of the nation's armed forces, dedicated much of his speech to praising late brother Fidel, the main message of his address was that Cuba's youth must remain ever vigilant against the United States, particularly under the current Trump administration. America, Castro alleged, has spent 12 administrations unceasingly putting effort into forcing regime change in Cuba using one method or another, with more or less aggression.\\n\\nNow, once again, the American government appears to take the route of confrontation with Cuba and present our peaceful and allied country as a threat to the region, Castro claimed. High-ranking administration officials, with the complicity of some lackeys, disseminate new falsehoods and once again attempt to blame Cuba for all the ills of the region, as if these were not the consequence of merciless neoliberal policies.\\n\\nHe blamed the United States not just for hardships in Cuba, but for the collapse of the socialist establishment in Brazil, where the ruling Workers' Party (PT) fell to a small conservative party led by now President Jair Bolsonaro. They, Castro said without specifying, managed to imprison Comrade Lula da Silva and deprive him of his right to be a presidential candidate.\\n\\nLula da Silva, former PT president, was arrested in 2017 on charges of taking over $1 million in bribes and, after multiple appeals, was sentenced to 12 years in prison last year. Supporters insisted that his prison sentence should not keep him off the ballot to reclaim the presidency despite the law banning politicians convicted of corruption from running.\\n\\nCastro claimed that neoliberal policies, by which he means capitalist, free-market economics, lead to poverty, hunger, inequality, organized crime, drug trafficking, political corruption, abuse, and the deprivation of workers' rights.\\n\\nCuba in 2019, he concluded, was a free and independent country, master of its own destiny.\\n\\nCastro made his remarks amid a collapsing economy where the average Cuban spent hours on market lines to buy bread for the holidays, as the regime failed to meet the necessary wheat quotas to feed the country. Miguel Díaz-Canel, Castro's deputy and president of Cuba, blamed President Donald Trump for the food shortages, though the government's official explanation for the wheat shortage was that several mills nationwide broke down in December and the government had no way of procuring replacement parts for them.\\n\\nDíaz-Canel delivered a year-end speech on Monday with a much more somber outlook on the future of Cuba, particularly regarding its failed socialist economy. Addressing the national legislature, he ordered high-ranking communist leaders to practice austerity in their expenses while doing their job, asserting, we don't need a lot of resources to get the job done.\\n\\nThe leadership of the Cuban Communist Party decidedly backs the pronouncements and actions ordered by Comrade Díaz-Canel, Castro said on Tuesday, referring to the austerity comments. He urged Cuban officials to reduce all non-essential costs and save more, increase and diversify exports, elevate efficiency in the investment process, and attract more foreign investment.\\n\\nLike Díaz-Canel, Castro blamed the United States for the need to rethink Cuba's economic policies, particularly regarding government spending.\\n\\nIt remains unclear whether this new austerity program will affect all, or any, of the Castro regime's highest-ranking members. Díaz-Canel's comments followed the worldwide publication of photos of Mariela Castro, Raúl's daughter and head of the government's LGBT agency, eating at lobster feast this month with Spanish pop singer Pastora Soler. Observers condemned the optics of the daughter of a dictator eating a lavish dinner in a country where the monthly average salary is $30 a month.\\n\\nIn addition to Mariela, brother Alejandro Castro Espín runs the nation's spy agency and holds a high ranking in the nation's Interior Ministry.\\n\\nRaúl Castro ended his speech with a warning to the United States and opponents of his dictatorship: we are not intimidated by strength or threats, they did not intimidate us when the revolutionary process was not consolidated, and they will not even remotely be able to do so now that the unity of the people is an indestructible reality.\\n\\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."}
{"original": "Single-sex bathroom privacy has robust, bipartisan support, despite silence by the establishment media and bullying by transgender advocates, says the Washington state mom who is leading a campaign to help women and children regain privacy-protecting bathrooms and shower rooms.\\n\\nKaeley Triller Haver is heading Just Want Privacy, the group which is collecting signatures and donations to get Initiative 1552 on the ballot in Washington state. She needs 330,000 valid signatures by July 6, and she's already got 164,1000 signatures.\\n\\nIf approved in the November election, her petition would allow Washingtonians to reverse a pro-transgender edict from an appointed state commission which eliminated government-run single-sex bathrooms and showers in the state. The ballot initiative would ensure that all public school facilities such as restrooms, bathrooms, locker rooms, showers, or changing areas that are for use by more than one person at a time [be] designated for use by females only or for use by males only.\\n\\nWhat's unique about this issue that is distinct from most hot-button social issues we encounter is that it has such robust, bipartisan support, she tells Breitbart News. But you will never hear that the media or from politicians, she added.\\n\\nMultiple polls show that a large majority of Americans want to preserve single-sex facilities, even as most also try to be polite and friendly to the very few transgender people who wish to live as members of the other sex.\\n\\nThe state's predator loophole was created in late 2015 by the appointed, five-member, Washington Human Rights Commission. The group quietly drafted an edict allowing transgender people to use the locker rooms, showers, spas, and restrooms that match their gender expression or gender identity, regardless of their actual male or female sex.\\n\\nThe edict enforced the transgender ideology, which claims that each person's gender identity may be different from their male or female body, and that people should be allowed to switch their legal sex. The commission passed the edict even though nobody has proven the measurable existence of gender identity, and even though some people periodically and temporarily look and act like they are members of the opposite sex.\\n\\nThe establishment media and politicians are hiding the civic problems created by the commission's edict allowing transgender people to change their legal sex, said Haver. The media and politicians want to claim that only conservatives oppose mixed-sex bathrooms and shower rooms in schools and bathing facilities, she said, adding:\\n\\nWe built this national coalition now – called Hands Across the Aisle – with women from the far left who are also on our side of this issue and who are not getting a word in and are routinely getting shut down. So, the country's being invited to see this as some sort of conservative, bigoted kind of thing, when the reality is this is a women's issue. 'Gender identity' essentially erases women's rights.\\n\\nShe says her motivation comes from the fact that she is the mother of young children in a public school, and she was sexually abused for ten years, mostly in the shower.\\n\\nOnce she protested the elimination of single-sex facilities, she was fired from her job as a communications professional at the YMCA, which aligned itself with the state's Human Rights Commission. I had actually caught sex offenders at the Y, so I know how they work, she says. My concern is now they would have even easier access. In one month, she caught three sex offenders, she said.\\n\\nHaver explains her superiors at the Y told her she was closed-minded when she voiced her objections to their plan to eliminate single-sex facilities. They told me I had two options – either I could resign with severance as long as I agreed not to tell anyone what was happening with the Human Rights Commission, and the Y's involvement with that, or I could just be fired on the spot, she says. So I said, 'Fire me.'\\n\\nShe stresses that even far-left women are losing their jobs and being otherwise dismissed over this issue. I don't think anyone knows how intense the leftwing] pushback is, she explains.\\n\\nThe bullying is very effective, she asserts about the left-wing support for the transgender agenda. Nobody wants to be [called] a 'bigot.'\\n\\nAmid the media silence, many people do not realize that children as young as age 11 are getting medicated with cross-sex hormones and puberty blockers that will likely cause them to be sterile, she said.\\n\\nTransgender advocates claim that they are facing the same discrimination suffered by African-Americans, but that claim is an offensive conflation, she said. Transgender people already have equal rights to every single bathroom as anybody of the same biological sex, Haver asserts. They haven't been lynched or denied the right to vote. It's such an offensive comparison.\\n\\nTo read more about the transgender ideology, click here."}

The facility is named after Margaret Court, the holder of a record 24 Grand Slam singles titles earned during her tennis career during the 1960s and 70s.\\n\\nControversy arose last week when the 74-year-old Court, who is now a Christian pastor, made comments critical of Qantas Airlines because the company has become an active promoter for same-sex marriage, ESPN reports.\\n\\nAfter her comments, the sports community in Australia became embroiled in condemnation of Court's comments, even though she has been an open critic of gay marriage for decades.\\n\\nNavratilova attacked Court for her views and said she was trying to take away people's rights. She then demanded that the arena stop honoring Court by naming its facilities after her despite her still-unsurpassed athletic record.\\n\\nWhen you were named after Margaret Court, it seemed like the right thing to do, Navratilova wrote in her open letter to Court Arena.

I had long ago forgiven Court for her headline-grabbing comments in 1990 when she said I was a bad role model because I was a lesbian.\\n\\nIt is now clear exactly who Court is: an amazing tennis player, and … a homophobe. Her vitriol is not just an opinion. She is actively trying to keep LGBT people from getting equal rights (note to Court: we are human beings, too). She is demonizing trans kids and trans adults everywhere, Navratilova added.\\n\\nWe should not be celebrating this kind of behavior, the former number one ranked player insisted.\\n\\nAnother Aussie tennis player agreed with Navratilova but went a step further to urge players to boycott any match scheduled for Court Arena. 2011 U.S. Open winner Sam Stosur, said, I think everyone can have their opinion.

{"original": "News Corp. founder and arch-globalist Rupert Murdoch recently proposed an idea to tame the tech giants: an algorithm review board, to guard against algorithmic abuse on the part of Facebook, Google, and other Silicon Valley masters of the universe.\\n\\nAlgorithms are the mathematical models used by online platforms to determine what users see on their newsfeeds, and in what order. Changes to algorithms can have dramatic ramifications for news outlets and public figures: an algorithm change by Facebook in January boosted the mainstream media at the expense of conservative media, and cut engagement (likes, shares, comments, etc) on President Trump's Facebook posts by 45 percent.\\n\\nTo those who think the masters of the universe in Silicon Valley need more oversight to ensure their platforms are a level playing field, Murdoch's idea, on the face of it, sounds good. In theory, an algorithm review board could monitor the tech giants and identify when an algorithm change is causing some media outlets to be favored at the expense of others.\\n\\nHowever, that's probably not what Murdoch has in mind.\\n\\nThe media mogul, whose company operates multiple established news outlets around the world, including Fox News, the New York Post, the Wall Street Journal, the Times of London, and the Sun, doesn't want an equal playing field. Earlier this year, Murdoch accused social media platforms of promoting scurrilous news sources, and urged Facebook to pay trusted news sources a carriage fee, similar to cable companies.\\n\\nFar from ensuring an equal playing field, this would create a two-tiered system on social media, in which Facebook executives — not ordinary users — get to decide what news is trusted, and thus gets a prominent position on the site. Murdoch's vision for social media is a return to the dominance of establishment media — and Mark Zuckerberg appears to be listening to him.\\n\\nZuckerberg's recent changes to Facebook were designed to promote what he calls broadly trusted news sources. Although less obvious than Murdoch's carriage fees, the methodology Facebook uses to determine a broadly trusted news source is designed to favor established outlets like CNN and the New York Times while downranking conservative media. And that's exactly what happened after the algorithm changes were implemented.\\n\\nFacebook has avoided the question of why users aren't allowed to determine what news they trust, by liking and following pages. That would expose the lie behind Facebook's algorithm: they aren't doing this because of pressure from users; they're doing it because of pressure from the establishment.\\n\\nIn the early days of the internet, small, one-man blogs were able to compete with multinational media empires like News Corp. Information no longer needed to be filtered through a well-paid presenter in a million-dollar TV studio before it reached the public. The establishment is determined to bring those days to an end, and restore the power of elite gatekeepers. If an algorithm review board is set up with the specific purpose of preserving the level playing field that existed in the early days of the internet, that's great — but it's not what Rupert Murdoch wants.\\n\\nAllum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.

Trump https://t.co/vwxdcibO1r pic.twitter.com/b1gMStPgg7 — CBS News (@CBSNews) January 31, 2020\\n\\nBolton shot to the top of the Democrats' witness wish list after a New York Times report alleged that his forthcoming book — The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir — contains allegations that President Trump sought to make U.S. military aid to Ukraine conditional on investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter Biden. President Trump vehemently denied the report and call the book nasty & untrue.\\n\\nHouse Democrats' impeachment managers failed to convince enough moderate Republicans to cross the aisle, falling short of the 51 votes need for more witnesses. Late Thursday evening, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) revealed that he will join the overwhelming majority of his colleagues to vote against hearing from others.\\n\\nI worked with other senators to make sure that we have the right to ask for more documents and witnesses, but there is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven and that does not meet the United States Constitution's high bar for an impeachable offense, the retiring Tennessee Republican said in a statement.\\n\\nDespite Alexander's opposition, Democrats still had a glimmer of hope if Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) voted their way, which would have set up Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts to decide on casting the tie-breaking vote. However, Roberts' aversion to politics had always made the prospect of him voting highly improbable.\\n\\nHowever, Murkowski announced Friday that she will oppose hearing from other witnesses. In a pointed statement, Murkowski slammed the impeachment process's partisan nature and said Congress had failed to do its job.\\n\\nI worked for a fair, honest, and transparent process, modeled after the Clinton trial, to provide ample time for both sides to present their cases, ask thoughtful questions, and determine whether we need more, said Murkowski. The House chose to send articles of impeachment that are rushed and flawed. I carefully considered the need for additional witnesses and documents, to cure the shortcomings of its process, but ultimately decided that I will vote against considering motions to subpoena.\\n\\nGiven the partisan nature of this impeachment from the very beginning and throughout, I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate. I don't believe the continuation of this process will change anything. It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed, she added.\\n\\nOnly two Republicans — Sens. Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Susan Collins (R-ME) — voted in favor of the motion for more witnesses, with the former saying he believes that it was important to hear from Bolton.\\n\\nShortly after Alexander's announcement, Collins said she would vote for witnesses as the most sensible way to proceed.\\n\\nI believe hearing from certain witnesses would give each side the opportunity to more fully and fairly make their case, resolve any ambiguities, and provide additional clarity. Therefore, I will vote in support of the motion to allow witnesses and documents to be subpoenaed, Collins said.\\n\\nIf this motion passes, I believe that the most sensible way to proceed would be for the House Managers and the President's attorneys to attempt to agree on a limited and equal number of witnesses for each side. If they can't agree, then the Senate could choose the number of witnesses, added the senator.\\n\\nSen. Joe Machin (D-WV) voted in favor of extra witnesses. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) also voted in favor.\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) issued a statement after Friday's vote, predicting that the trial will draw to a close in the coming days.\\n\\nA majority of the U.S. Senate has determined that the numerous witnesses and 28,000-plus pages of documents already in evidence are sufficient to judge the House Managers' accusations and end this impeachment trial. There is no need for the Senate to re-open the investigation which the House Democratic majority chose to conclude and which the Managers themselves continue to describe as overwhelming and beyond any doubt, said McConnell.\\n\\nNever in Senate history has this body paused an impeachment trial to pursue additional witnesses with unresolved questions of executive privilege that would require protracted litigation. We have no interest in establishing such a new precedent, particularly for individuals whom the House expressly chose not to pursue, the Kentucky Republican added.\\n\\nSenators will now confer among ourselves, with the House Managers, and with the President's counsel to determine next steps as we prepare to conclude the trial in the coming days, he concluded."}

Brian Kemp, squaring off with President Trump, a narrator says at the opening of the ad.

Johnny Isakson (R-GA). But the most interesting part of the ad may be how it opens: I'm Raphael Warnock and I approved this message.\\n\\nThat's right: the Rev. Raphael Warnock, the Democrat nominee for one of Georgia's U.S. Senate seats—both of which are up for grabs in Tuesday's runoffs—is running advertisements trying to depress the turnout of his opponent's base. The voter suppression effort seems to be an indication of where everyone knows this race will be decided: by President Trump's supporters. Do they follow his guidance and show up to back Loeffler and Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) on Tuesday? Or do they do as the Democrats want them to and stay home? It's anybody's guess, but a lot rides on whether traditional GOP base voters turn out on election day in Georgia or if they sit this one out.\\n\\nOne person who seems particularly worried about the outcome, at least privately, is President-elect Joe Biden. According to a report Tuesday morning from Politico, the Democrat presidential candidate who became the first since Bill Clinton in the early 1990s to flip Georgia—Biden finished barely ahead of Trump on Nov. 3, and Trump contends he still won the state and that fraud led to Biden's victory—believes that both Warnock and Jon Ossoff will lose their races on Tuesday.\\n\\nThe leak, which came just hours after Biden himself campaigned for them in the Peach State ahead of Trump's rally for Loeffler and Perdue late Monday night, was brutal. Biden's team, Politico wrote, is privately skeptical about Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock's chances. Losses by the two Democrats, too, will drastically change what Biden is able to accomplish in his administration once he takes office on Jan. 20.\\n\\nAnd though confidants say that the incoming team's core priorities for that 100-day agenda will remain the same regardless of the outcome — the pandemic, the recession, climate change and racial inequality — they concede that the scale of their plans could change dramatically come Tuesday evening, Politico's Tyler Pager and Megan Cassella wrote on Tuesday.\\n\\nRepublicans concede that the only way they lose these races is if the president's base does not show up. The Washington Post's Jacqueline Alemany quotes anonymous GOP officials on Tuesday in her Power Up newsletter to express that concern. The anonymous Republicans claim that Trump's nonstop voter fraud allegations in Georgia have hurt Loeffler's and Perdue's chances by causing Trump base voters to question the legitimacy of elections and consider not voting. Trump's been generally unhelpful throughout this whole process, the anonymous GOP senate aide said, warning that Republicans should be prepared for a bad night.\\n\\nThe concern is that base voters may or may not turn up. But while Trump has expressed his disdain over the Nov. 3 election, he has been equally clear to Georgians in two different rallies and a number of other public statements that he needs and wants them to show up and vote for Loeffler and Perdue.\\n\\nSo that leaves open the question, if Trump is telling his supporters to vote, who is telling his supporters not to vote? Well, in addition to the actual Democrat candidates—as evidenced by the new Warnock ad—it's Democrats, as Breitbart News has previously reported earlier in the campaign, and it's also Never Trumpers at the Lincoln Project who are basically Democrats at this stage.\\n\\nThe Lincoln Project is running a new ad in Georgia, according to the New York Times, that quotes attorney Lin Wood questioning why Georgians would vote in this election when they believe the last one was rigged:\\n\\nThe Lincoln Project is running this ad in Georgia on Facebook encouraging Republicans not to vote, featuring Lin Wood, among others https://t.co/4UWYCTd7fk pic.twitter.com/63QCmZFxrC — Shane Goldmacher (@ShaneGoldmacher) January 4, 2021\\n\\nWood has presented himself a pro-Trump attorney, and while he has donated to Trump and Republicans this election cycle, his political donation history as previously revealed by Breitbart News paints a very different picture: He is a longtime Democrat donor having backed Democrats for office at the federal and state level in Georgia in particular for years and years. He also previously opposed Perdue, backing his Democrat opponent with financial contributions.\\n\\nAnd while it's unclear who paid for it, signs like this appeared outside the Trump rally in Dalton on Monday night:\\n\\nThere is no cell service or working WiFi at the Trump rally here in Dalton, but I'm going to see if this will work from the perimeter… There were several of these signs in the mile or so leading up to the rally site. pic.twitter.com/Mjr3wOqTD9 — Andrew Desiderio (@AndrewDesiderio) January 4, 2021\\n\\nBut a Democrat Super PAC has been very publicly behind a billboard campaign in Georgia with essentially the same message, as Breitbart News reported earlier in the campaign.\\n\\nIn other words, this all means it's the Democrats who are trying to suppress the vote in Georgia—at least part of the vote, the part from the pro-Trump areas—as part of their last-ditch effort to win control of the U.S. Senate in races their president-elect does not even think they have a shot at, which the Politico article sums up nicely.\\n\\nPrivately, Biden's team does not expect to win the races, according to Democratic officials, but they are more optimistic about their chances than they were weeks ago, Pager and Cassella wrote. Though the president-elect narrowly won the state in November, they attribute that to a powerful anti-Trump sentiment that did not translate down the ballot. Perdue received about 88,000 more votes than Ossoff, and the top two Republicans combined got more than 636,000 votes than Warnock in the special election. One former Democratic official said few Democrats, if any, are preparing for victory. It's not 'their organizing principle,' the official said of the incoming transition team, adding that their planning has focused on Democrats not having control of the Senate."}

The only uncertainty is due to the timing but let us not doubt that He will answer.

{"original": "Democrats are looking to put the state of Georgia on a fast-track to becoming their next deep blue stronghold like California, primarily due to mass immigration that has increased their voting blocs.\\n\\nIn a report by the Guardian, Democrats said they are fiercely courting the votes of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders — 3-in-4 of which were born outside the United States — in Georgia's pair of runoff races on January 5 where Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) faces a challenge from Democrat Raphael Warnock and Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) is facing Democrat Jon Ossoff.\\n\\nWhen you think about California, what it was like 30 or 40 years ago, that's Georgia. It's on a trajectory of change, an Asian American social justice activist told the Guardian. A Republican presidential candidate has not won the state of California since 1988. The Los Angeles Times has credited immigration to California with helping turn the state blue.\\n\\nNow, for the Senate runoffs, Democrats said they want to replicate foreign-born voter turnout for Biden in Georgia for Ossoff and Warnock.\\n\\nThe Guardian reports:\\n\\nHistoric turnout among Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) voters – who make up the fastest-growing segment of Georgia's electorate – helped Joe Biden become the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state since 1992. According to national exit polls, nearly two-thirds of Asian American and Pacific Islander voters cast their ballot for Biden. [Emphasis added] … Now Democrats hope to replicate their success among Asian Americans in a pair of runoff elections on 5 January that will determine control of the US Senate. The campaigns for Democratic Senate candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock say they view the AAPI community as critical to winning their races. Both teams have hired AAPI constituency directors to lead multilingual and multicultural outreach programs, that includes campaign visits to AAPI-owned small businesses and advertising in ethnic media. [Emphasis added]\\n\\nSpecifically, data published by the Guardian indicates that Georgia's Asian American population has grown nearly 140 percent since the year 2000 as the U.S. has admitted roughly more than 1.2 million legal immigrants a year for the last three decades.\\n\\nGeorgia's Asian Americans include those from India, China, Korea, and Vietnam and about 8-in-10 said they do not speak English at home. Their arrival has helped shift county electorates in favor of Democrats.\\n\\nMany of these newcomers have made their homes in the sprawling suburbs around Atlanta, helping to turn these once-Republican strongholds into political battlegrounds, The Guardian reports.\\n\\nThe New York Times and a Washington Post columnist have recently acknowledged that Democrats are leaning heavily on the results of mass immigration to Georgia to flip the state blue as they have done in Virginia and Orange County, California.\\n\\nThe emergence in Georgia of Asian-American voters is a potential bright spot for a Democratic Party counting on demographic changes to bring political wins across the country, the Times reported last month.\\n\\nDemocrats Relying on Results of Mass Immigration to Flip Georgia Blue https://t.co/eC2WFakg6j — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) December 21, 2020\\n\\nAnalysis by the Atlantic's Ronald Brownstein has previously revealed that congressional districts with a foreign-born population above the national average, a little more than 14 percent, have a 90 percent chance of being won by Democrats over Republicans.\\n\\nThe number of foreign-born voters and their voting-age children in Georgia has boomed by 337 percent between 2000 to 2020. Meanwhile, the native-born voting-age population in Georgia has increased by just 22 percent over that same period.\\n\\nThe drastic demographics changes, as described by multiple establishment media outlets, has made the electoral map increasingly easier for Democrats.\\n\\nThe Washington Post, New York Times, the Atlantic, Axios, the Los Angeles Times, and the Wall Street Journal have all admitted that rapid demographic changes because of immigration are tilting the nation toward a permanent Democrat dominance.\\n\\nThe single biggest threat to Republicans' long-term viability is demographics, Axios acknowledged last year. The numbers simply do not lie … there's not a single demographic megatrend that favors Republicans.\\n\\nAt current legal immigration levels, the U.S. is on track to import about 15 million new foreign-born voters by 2040. Those 15 million new foreign-born voters include about eight million who will have arrived through the process known as chain migration where newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S.\\n\\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

{"original": "WASHINGTON (AP) — With a single drone strike, President Donald Trump did more than just take out an avowed enemy of the United States. He may have have also upended a central element of his foreign policy.\\n\\nThe Friday strike that killed the most prominent Iranian general may have ended any chance that he would get the United States out of the endless wars in the Middle East that he has railed against since taking office.\\n\\nThe killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad has the world bracing for a possible retaliation, with many fearing it could lead to a wider conflict.\\n\\nIt is probably the most profound escalation that the United States could have taken, said Ned Price, who served on the National Security Council under President Barack Obama.\\n\\nTrump has been on a confrontational path with Iran since even before he took office, when he pledged to end the Iran nuclear deal signed by Obama. He insisted he doesn't want war and the killing of Soleimani wasn't meant to provoke the Islamic Republic.\\n\\nWe took action last night to stop a war, Trump sad. We did not take action to start a war.\\n\\nNonetheless, the targeting of Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force, was arguably the most provocative military action in the Middle East since President George W. Bush launched the 2003 Iraq war to topple Saddam Hussein.\\n\\nThe killing of Soleimani, regarded as the second most powerful official in Iran, came as Trump has sought to apply increased pressure on Iran through economic sanctions to abandon its nuclear weapons program, while Iran has countered with provocative attacks on U.S. military and oil facilities in region.\\n\\nBy taking out Soleimani, Trump signaled to Iran that his patience has worn thin over the long, simmering conflagration.\\n\\nThe shadowy general who was in command of Iran's proxy forces was responsible, according to the Pentagon, for the deaths of hundreds of American troops in Iraq during the height of the war there. White House officials said Trump decided to take action because Soleimani was plotting unspecified future attacks targeting Americans as tensions between the U.S. and Iran have reached a boil.\\n\\nTrump said Friday he wasn't interested in further escalating the conflict, but warned the regime that his military advisers have already drawn up plans to retaliate should Iran attack.\\n\\nIf Americans anywhere are threatened, we have all of those targets already fully identified and I am ready and prepared to take whatever action is necessary, and that in particular refers to Iran, Trump said.\\n\\nTrump's aggressive approach with Iran is remarkable considering his oft-repeated desire to avoid expensive military entanglements. His aversion to long-term military presence has led to him butting heads with his top advisers as he has sought to end the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan and Syria.\\n\\nYet, for much of his nearly three years in office, Trump has buffeted between demonstrating restraint and sending warning flares to Iran that the U.S. is prepared for military confrontation.\\n\\nIn June, after Iran shot down a U.S. drone, Trump said he gave top Pentagon officials permission to carry out military strikes against Iran before changing his mind 10 minutes before the operation was to be carried out.\\n\\nTrump said he had a change of heart after being told by a general that the strikes would cause up to 150 Iranian casualties.\\n\\nIn September, with French President Emmanuel Macron serving as a go-between, Trump reportedly made an unsuccessful attempt to persuade Iran President Hassan Rouhani to speak with him by phone from the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.\\n\\nThe next month the Pentagon announced it was deploying 3,000 U.S. troops to protect Saudi Arabia. (The Pentagon on Friday announced following Soleimani's killing that it would boost its presence in the region with an additional 3,500 U.S. troops.)\\n\\nThe October boost in forces came after a drone attack on a Saudi oilfield. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Iran of being behind unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply.\\n\\nThe tit-for-tat between the U.S. and Iran rose to a whole new level in recent weeks.\\n\\nLast week, after months of massive street protests in Baghdad by demonstrators urging both Iran and the U.S. to cease interfering in Iraqi affairs, the Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah group fired a barrage of rockets at a military base in Kirkuk, killing a US contractor and wounding several US and Iraqi troops.\\n\\nOn Sunday, Trump struck back with airstrikes on Iran-affiliated militia bases in western Iraq and Syria.\\n\\nThen on Tuesday pro-Iranian militia members marched on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, leading to diplomats holing up in the sprawling compound as protesters burning the embassy's reception.\\n\\nStill, before attending a New Years Eve party at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump told reporters that he didn't see war coming and that he wanted peace with Iran. The president, however, warned that if the U.S. were to go to war with Iran it wouldn't last very long.\\n\\nLess than 48 hours later, Trump ordered the strike that took out Soleimani.\\n\\nPresident Trump may be genuine in not wanting war with Iran, Price said. At the same, it is fair to say that he doesn't seem to understand the implication that an action like this could foretell.\\n\\nJames Carafano, a national security analyst at the conservative Washington think tank Heritage Foundation, argues that that there's no disconnect between Trump's disdain for endless wars and his efforts to increase pressure on Iran.\\n\\nThis is clearly not an escalation, this is clearly an act of self-defense, Carafano said. The president has also never said we're walking away from the Middle East. What he says he wants is a sustainable security architecture in place which means we're going to protect our interest and we're going to expect others to do more to protect theirs.\\n\\nIran says it is already plotting revenge.\\n\\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that harsh retaliation is waiting for the U.S. after the airstrike and called Soleimani the international face of resistance.\\n\\nAs thousands of worshipers in the Tehran took to streets after Friday prayers to condemn the killing and chant Death to deceitful America, the State Department issued an alert urging American citizens to leave Iraq immediately.\\n\\nOver the course of presidency, Trump's hawkishness on Iran has lacked coherence and has, in no small part, been informed by his desire to do away with the fragile peace brokered by Obama, said Abbas Kadhim, a Middle East analyst at the Atlantic Council in Washington.\\n\\nTrump won the White House after pledging as a candidate to undo the Obama-administration brokered agreement to limit its uranium enrichment program in exchange for an easing of sanctions. He and other critics felt the deal gave too many economic benefits without doing enough to prevent Iran from eventually developing a nuclear weapon.\\n\\nTrump followed through on his campaign vow in May 2018 by officially withdrawing from the treaty and reimposing crippling sanctions on Tehran.\\n\\nHe exited from the deal because it was an Obama deal, and he did believe in his heart of hearts that he could come up with a better a deal, Kadhim said. He thought Iran would now be facing the greatest dealmaker. But I think he miscalculated the stubbornness of the Iranians."}

{"original": "Years of crippling socialist policies have left Venezuela so bereft of food, average Venezuelans must spent up to six hours waiting in line to received their allotted rations of basic goods like vegetable oil, flour, or milk. Musician Jonathan Acosta has offered to help ease the frustration by visiting supermarkets and performing for those waiting in line.\\n\\nAcosta, from the Venezuelan state of Lara, has so far only made local appearances, singing songs of hope and offering hugs to those waiting patiently in line. He has launched a hashtag campaign called #ÁnimoVenezuela, or #EnergyVenezuela, looking to inspire hope in those looking to improve their daily life situation, and hopes to visit the capital, Caracas, with his music soon.\\n\\nThere is a need to bring a message of hope and a song of encouragement before the struggle Venezuelans live through today… let's go and give these people some energy, Acosta says he thought when first launching the project in an interview. Acosta is a licensed attorney by day but has always enjoyed performing music, and he says he has found that engaging Venezuelans with music has a positive emotional effect on those spending hours on supermarket lines in order to feed their children.\\n\\nHe notes his effort is bipartisan, and he has rejected overtures from the government of socialist president Nicolás Maduro to perform at government functions. He steadfastly refuses to participate in politics. This, he admits, has resulted in infuriated Venezuelans waiting on lines complaining that Acosta's singing does nothing to solve the shortages facing the oil-rich nation.\\n\\nThere are people who have told us our songs are pretty, but why haven't we brought any rice or sugar, he admitted. I tried to shake a man's hand once and the man refused. I finally decided to hug him and when he received the hug, he cried, Acosta says. He has insisted that his music is an attempt to stunt any emotional paralysis that may occur from ongoing suffering.\\n\\nSupermarket lines lasting from four to six hours have been the norm in Venezuela for at least two years, since President Maduro took over the nation following the death of dictator Hugo Chávez. To combat inflation when the nation's inflation rate was 60 percent, Maduro implemented a ration card system that prohibited families from buying the food they deemed necessary for their families, instead imposing a government standard. Venezuela has ceased officially documenting its inflation rate, but experts estimate it to current be near 800 percent.\\n\\nThe supermarket lines have spawned their own industry: professional line-sitters who will wait in line for their clients for a price, usually about $100. The line-sitters offer the added service of monitoring local supermarkets to keep track of what products can be found where. Sometimes we will find milk, sugar, or coffee in one place, but flour, rice, diapers, or shampoo in another, one line professional told AFP in January 2015. That same month, police began to enforce new regulations preventing Venezuelans from using cameras or phones to take photos of the alarmingly empty shelves in their supermarkets.\\n\\nMaduro has proposed to Venezuelans living in urban centers that the solution to the ongoing supermarket crisis is to avoid the supermarket entirely and grow one's own food. [First Lady] Cilia [Flores] and I have 50 egg-laying chickens, and all the yolks we eat, we produce, Maduro told an audience in January.\\n\\nA month later, Venezuela's legislature declared a national food emergency, proclaiming it had officially run out of food.\\n\\nMaduro's inability to manage the economy has outraged Chavistas as much as his anti-socialist adversaries. Socialist Tide, an alternative left-wing party in the country, has called for Maduro to resign, as have a number of soldiers who are considered by the Maduro government national heroes for participating in a failed coup against Venezuela's last democratically-elected government, an attempt to lodge Hugo Chávez in power.\\n\\nOn Monday, the National Assembly announced a campaign to remove Maduro from power, noting that legislators will use all mechanisms available constitutionally to oust him, including a national referendum or constitutional amendment for removal.

Many people blame the flood of refugees on the welcoming remarks of Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel earlier this year. Merkel has been increasingly criticized, even by people in her own party, and her poll ratings have fallen.\\n\\nIn her New Year's Eve speech to the nation, Merkel stood firm and responded to her critics, calling the influx of refugees an opportunity:\\n\\nNext year is about one thing in particular: our cohesion. It is important we don't allow ourselves to be divided – not into generations, not into social groups, and not into those that are already here and those that are new citizens. […] It is crucial not to follow those who, with coldness or even hatred in their hearts, lay a sole claim to what it means to be German and seek to exclude others. Our values, our traditions, our sense of justice, our language, our laws, our rules, [apply] to all who wish to live here. [The efforts put in to cope with the challenges would be worth it in the end because] countries have always benefitted from successful immigration, both economically and socially. […] I am convinced that, handled properly, today's great task presented by the influx and the integration of so many people is an opportunity for tomorrow.\\n\\nHer reference to those who, with coldness or even hatred in their hearts, referred to Pegida, an anti-immigration party considered by many to be xenophobic, but which has been rising in the polls. Deutsche Welle and Expatica Germany\\n\\nUN refugee czar Guterres calls for mandatory funding for refugees\\n\\nAfter ten years, December 31 is the last day in office for UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Antonio Guterres. In an interview with the BBC, Guterres had a great deal of criticism for the European Union and for other nations, who were not responding to appeals for money to provide food and help for refugees.\\n\\nI take note of the fact that although the audio portion of the interview is available on the BBC web site, there is no transcript available, and even the BBC news stories that quote Guterres only quote two or three sentences. Since I have become an exceptionally jaded and cynical person, I cannot help but wonder if the BBC is playing down the interview because what Guterres said was so fantastical.\\n\\nAt any rate, what follows is my transcription of excerpts from the interview. He starts with harsh criticisms of the European Union, especially those countries that try to make themselves look as bad as possible, so that refugees will want to go to other countries:\\n\\nFor the first time in meaningful numbers, refugees and other migrants came to Europe, and Europe was totally unprepared for that. But not only was Europe unprepared then, it's still unprepared today. And it was unable to get its act together, and the divisions in Europe do not allow for a European response. to this situation. The first thing one needs to look at is what the reality is, not what the perceptions are. We reached one million people that have crossed the Mediterranean. But we are talking of the European Union of more than 500 million people. So we have less than two refugees per thousand people in the European Union. Now if you go to Lebanon, we have one refugee for each 3 or 4 Lebanese. So it is clear that this problem could have been managed, but to be managed it would be necessary to have all European countries assume a common responsibility. First of all, doing their best to address the root causes, doing their best to contribute to the peace in Syria or of other crises. But at the same time recognizing that many will come, preparing that arrival with adequate reception conditions at entry points, making sure that people at entry points could be welcomed, could be given shelter. This would require an important investment if proper reception conditions would be in place. And a fair distribution of people by plane in normal circumstances to all European countries, this crisis would have been perfectly managed. Now, what we are seeing is that countries are trying to solve the problem by themselves, trying basically to avoid refugees to come into their borders, and to go into the neighbors' one. And some countries that are trying to have a regime that is a little bit worse than the neighbor's regime, to make sure that the refugees go into the neighbors, and not their own country.\\n\\nFrom the point of view of Generational Dynamics, Guterres is wishing for a return to the 1990s, a time when people were wealthier and the mood was egalitarian. Today, in this generational Crisis era, people in America and Europe are sharply divided politically, and nationalism and xenophobia are rising.\\n\\nGuterres was asked whether he was receiving all the money necessary for his work, and he said that countries have been contributing only about 50% of the needed amounts.\\n\\nThe BBC reporter asked him which countries disappointed him, because they could afford to pay more. He was obviously looking for criticism of the US or Britain, but Guterres surprised him:\\n\\nEverybody, to a certain extent. There is a number of countries that are now emerging as new relevant economies in the world that are not also coming with their expectable share of responsibility of the new emerging economies. I would hope that they would be able to increase their contributions too.\\n\\nSo Guterres was apparently criticizing China, not the US, which was certainly a surprise to me.\\n\\nGuterres thinks it is strange that the global public good is funded by voluntary contributions, and he is looking for ways to make the contributions mandatory – a system such that every country in the world has to contribute in way that is predictable and is fair.\\n\\nFrom the point of view of Generational Dynamics, the most interesting part of the interview was the end, where he described a world spiraling down into total chaos:\\n\\nIt's important to be aware that we are just looking at just one of the symptoms of a deeper problem, and a central question is, the reason why [the refugees] are fleeing. It's this dramatic multiplication of conflicts in the world. It's the fact the international community has lost much of its capacity to avoid conflicts, to prevent conflicts, and then to timely solve them. And this what leads in my opinion to have a surge in diplomacy for peace. Ten years ago, we had about 38 million people displaced by conflict in the world. Now we have about 60 million people. According to the numbers of the first semester of this year, things are still getting worse in 2016. 5% more people displaced, 80% more individuals by requesting help. And worse than that, ten years ago, we were helping one million people go back home every year. Now in the last year, we only helped 130,000 people go back home, which means we are having more and more people forced to flee, and less and less people being able to find a solution for their plight. We are like a nurse that provides an aspririn to a patient. we are able to alleviate the pain, but we don't solve the problem. That is the political dimension of the humanitarian crisis. Humanitarians need to be impartial, neutral, to abide by humanitarian principles, not to be political. But we need to be humble enough to recognize that there is no humanitarian solution for this problems. The solution is political.\\n\\nHis desire to have a 'surge' in diplomacy for peace is somewhat amusing. Of course he is contrasting to the American troop surges in Iraq and Afghanistan, and suggesting that diplomats should surge as well. This is something that might have been possible in the 1990s, but is completely impossible in today's generational Crisis era. BBC and United Nations\\n\\nThe 'dramatic multiplication of conflicts in the world'\\n\\nA couple of sentences from Guterres' interview are worth repeating: It's this dramatic multiplication of conflicts in the world. It's the fact the international community has lost much of its capacity to avoid conflicts, to prevent conflicts, and then to timely solve them.\\n\\nHe could not have chosen better or more accurate words to describe what happens in a generational Crisis era. Guterres pointed out that the number of refugees in the world now exceeds 60 million, but in the last year his agency was able to help only 300,000 of them, a much worse ratio than ten years ago.\\n\\nFor most countries, the current generational Crisis era began around 2003, 58 years after the climax of World War II, a time when the retirement of the survivors of WW II accelerated and caused them to lose almost all influence over the rising generation, Generation-X.\\n\\nI happen to have in my archives a Boston Globe article from August 29, 2004, that says that the number of war deaths has been decreasing substantially:\\n\\n[T]he number killed in battle has fallen to its lowest point in the post-World War II period, dipping below 20,000 a year by one measure. Peacemaking missions, meantime, are growing in number. International engagement is blossoming, said American scholar Monty G. Marshall. There's been an enormous amount of activity to try to end these conflicts. For months the battle reports and casualty tolls from Iraq and Afghanistan have put war in the headlines, but Swedish and Canadian non-governmental groups tracking armed conflict globally find a general decline in numbers from peaks in the 1990s. The authoritative Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, in a 2004 Yearbook report obtained by The Associated Press in advance of publication, says 19 major armed conflicts were under way worldwide in 2003, a sharp drop from 33 wars counted in 1991. The Canadian organization Project Ploughshares, using broader criteria to define armed conflict, says in its new annual report that the number of conflicts declined to 36 in 2003, from a peak of 44 in 1995.\\n\\nSo as most of the world ended its generational Unraveling era, when the last of the WW II survivors were in charge, and entered a generational Crisis era, things changed.\\n\\nSince then, we have had four or five wars among the group consisting of Israel, Hezbollah, the Palestine Liberation Organization, and Gaza. We have had a huge surge of Muslims killing Muslims through the Mideast, in Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Syria and Iraq, following the Arab Awakening. That includes President Obama's new Iraq war, following the rise of the so-called Islamic State (IS or ISIS or ISIL or Daesh). Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed Ukraine's Crimea, the first such peacetime action in Europe since Adolf Hitler's Nazi army had invaded, occupied and annexed a portion of Austria (the Anschluss) on March 12, 1938.\\n\\nThere is also the surge in Afghanistan, and African wars in Mali, Central African Republic, and South Sudan. We would also have to count the slaughter of Muslims by Buddhists in Myanmar (Burma). And while the world seemed very prosperous ten years ago (the middle of the real estate and credit bubble), we've had to endure a financial crisis after the bubbles imploded.\\n\\nThe Outlook for 2016\\n\\nWill there be any more conflicts in 2016? Almost certainly. Let's take a look at the current situation:\\n\\nTV financial analysts have been talking all week that 2015 was the year of the global financial slowdown, led by China. Of course, these analysts almost always say that growth will begin again next year, but indications are that the downward trend will continue, and may accelerate into a full scale financial panic and crash.\\n\\nRussia's recent military intervention in Syria has been a major game-changer, and has substantially increased tensions in the Mideast. Turkey and Russia may be at war in 2016. Tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia are increasingly boiling, largely because of Iran's nuclear deal with the West. A sectarian Sunni vs Shia war could break out in 2016.\\n\\nYoung Palestinians in the West Bank have launched a new kind of terrorism against Israelis, using knives to kill in public places. There are also been some violence by young Israelis against Palestinians, in the form of price tag attacks. Israel and the Palestinians were last in a major war in 2014, but that could change anytime.\\n\\nChina is becoming militarily aggressive in the East and South China Seas, using military power to annex regions historically belonging to other countries, once again following the example of Adolf Hitler. Any one of China's neighbors, including Vietnam, Philippines or Japan, could have a military confrontation with China that could spiral into war. China also could make its long-awaited move against Taiwan.\\n\\nThe last possibility is something unexpected, something that nobody could foresee, but ends up in war anyway.\\n\\nThe thing that makes a generational Crisis era unlike other eras is that, with rising nationalism and xenophobia, something that might be considered trivial at other times could be a cause for war now. In 1914, a Serb, Gavrilo Princip, shot and killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian empire, and his pregnant wife Sophie. Assassinations were not uncommon in the world, then or now, but to most of the world's complete astonishment, this assassination triggered World War I.\\n\\nA similar thing could happen 2016, in any region of the world.\\n\\nHappy New Year!\\n\\nKEYS: Generational Dynamics, Germany, Angela Merkel, Antonio Guterres, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, European Union, Lebanon, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Project Ploughshares, Serbia, Croatia, Gavrilo Princip\\n\\nPermanent web link to this article\\n\\nReceive daily World View columns by e-mail"}

Since a suit cannot be brought over hypothetical future damages based on climate prophecies, the legal team will be obliged to link the behavior of oil companies to real events — such as Hurricane Sandy.\\n\\nAccording to Politico, the de Blasio administration is suing for reparations from Sandy damages, and seeks to force the companies to pay for the city's resiliency efforts, which have taken years to complete since 2012, when the storm devastated the city, killing 53 people across the state costing more than $19 billion.\\n\\nClimate change advocates have recently insisted, however, that record cold temperatures in North America cannot be used as an argument against anthropogenic climate change, since no direct causality can be established between singular weather phenomena and climate change.\\n\\nEvent attribution — linking a given weather event to man-made global warming — is exceedingly speculative at best and completely unreliable at worst, even according to true believers.\\n\\nAt a meeting of climate scientists at Oxford in 2012, one participant argued that, given the insufficient observational data and the coarse and mathematically imperfect climate models used to generate attribution claims, they are unjustifiably speculative, basically unverifiable and better not made at all.\\n\\nThe science journal Nature felt compelled to conclude (with unusual modesty) that better models are needed before exceptional events can be reliably linked to global warming.\\n\\nOr, as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) declares, extreme event attribution can't tell us whether global warming 'caused' a specific event.\\n\\nA recent survey of climate change literature for 2017 revealed that the alleged consensus behind the dangers of anthropogenic global warming is not nearly as settled among climate scientists as people imagine.\\n\\nAuthor Kenneth Richard found that during the course of the year 2017, at least 485 scientific papers were published that in some way questioned the supposed consensus regarding the perils of human CO2 emissions or the efficacy of climate models to predict the future.\\n\\nAccording to Richard's analysis, the 485 new papers underscore the significant limitations and uncertainties inherent in our understanding of climate and climate changes, which in turn suggests that climate science is not nearly as settled as media reports and some policymakers would have people believe.\\n\\nMayor de Blasio has drawn comparisons between oil companies and the tobacco industry, which knowingly profited from behavior they knew to be harmful. The difference, of course, is that numerous deaths were convincingly attributed to cigarette smoking. Whereas people have died from severe weather events since the beginning of recorded history, no death has yet been ascribed to manmade global warming.\\n\\nAlong with suing oil companies, the mayor has also announced his intention to sell off $5 billion in fossil fuel investments from city pension funds. According to officials, securities of fossil fuel companies currently make up less than three percent of New York's $189 billion pension fund, which will eventually be reduced to zero.\\n\\nOfficials warned that the divestment process could take several years.\\n\\nFollow Thomas D.

Scott, which asks the justices to reconsider a precedent that requires property owners whose property has been taken by the government to fully exhaust all avenues available to them through a state government before they can claim a violation of their constitutional rights in the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause, a process that can take years.\\n\\nGovernment can take private property via eminent domain to build highways, public buildings, or something like a wall along America's southern border. The Constitution's Takings Clause provides that the government cannot take a person's property for public use unless the government gives the owner just compensation – such as fair market value – for the property.\\n\\nThis is the latest Supreme Court case brought by Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF), which has had several major cases in recent years. PLF has won key victories for property rights in recent years such as the 9-0 decision in Sackett v. EPA, providing homeowners with the right to sue to stop a certain type of Environmental Protection Agency actions. Another PLF case, Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky, was argued just last week.\\n\\nThe justices also granted review in Gundy v. United States, considering whether the Sex Offender Notification and Registration Act's (SORNA) delegation of authority to the U.S. attorney general to issue certain regulations violates the Nondelegation Doctrine.\\n\\nThat doctrine provides that a law is unconstitutional when Congress delegates its lawmaking authority to the executive branch. The Court has not invalidated a federal law under that doctrine since 1935.\\n\\nDuring the 1930s, the justices invoked that doctrine to strike down parts of President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. Reviving that doctrine has long been a priority for judicial conservatives, as it would require Congress to spell out the details of laws and then answer directly to the voters, rather than empower bureaucrats to impose legal obligations through creating regulations. Reviving the nondelegation doctrine could significantly curtail the power of the administrative state.\\n\\nKnick and Gundy should be argued this fall after the Court begins its next annual term in October.\\n\\nKen Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

As Speaker of the House, he is supposed to be non-partisan. Bercow's idea of non-partisanship where Brexit is concerned is to turn up to work in a car (with the personalised number plate B13RCO) with a rear window sticker that says BOLLOCKS TO BREXIT.\\n\\nBercow is an unpleasant piece of work — a vicious, careerist, small-minded martinet, as Quentin Letts once put it — who should have been forcibly ejected long ago from the Speaker's chair he has repeatedly disgraced.\\n\\nIn October last year, it seemed finally as if the poisonous dwarf were going to get his comeuppance, after a damning report by Dame Laura Cox into bullying and harassment in Parliament.\\n\\nAs the Guardian reported:\\n\\nThe former judge said she found a culture of deference, subservience, acquiescence and silence and recommended that people in management roles, including Bercow, should consider their positions. The Speaker has been the subject of multiple bullying allegations, which he denies.\\n\\nBut instead of pursuing these allegations — which normally it would have done, especially in the post #MeToo witch hunt climate — our virtue-signalling parliamentarians have proved oddly reluctant to boot out this charmless bruiser. Why? Because Bercow has made it his business to sabotage Brexit and most MPs, whatever they may think of him personally, are Remainers.\\n\\nBercow, Tom Harris drily notes at Cap-X, is about as even-handed and impartial on the matter of Brexit as Jacob Rees-Mogg.\\n\\nAnd Parliament's support of this creepy character demonstrates the most shaming hypocrisy:\\n\\nVirtually every Labour MP in the Commons, formerly proud advocates of women's and workers' rights to workplaces free from bullying, chose to suspend that particular principle last year when serious accusations against the Speaker, from more than one reliable source, emerged. Normally – and especially if such allegations had involved a Conservative minister – Labour would have demanded immediate action. But in Bercow's case – as lucidly explained by Dame Margaret Beckett MP – the cause of opposing Brexit trumps any less important issue such as the rights of Commons members of staff.\\n\\nAs Isabel Hardman observes at the Spectator, Bercow has become a law unto himself.\\n\\nToday Speaker Bercow told the House of Commons that he could disregard precedent and change procedure as he wished, while admitting that he hadn't fully thought through the implications of this.\\n\\nImagine, for a moment, if the Speaker's bias had been towards Brexit; imagine if the two MPs whose obstructive amendments the Speaker had encouraged had been ardent Brexiteers like, say, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Andrew Bridgen.\\n\\nCan you imagine the scandalised response it would get from the BBC and most of the rest of the mainstream media?\\n\\nThere would be calls for Bercow's resignation; endless why oh why? editorials about the decline of parliamentary standards; indignant commentary that Parliament's sovereignty was being suborned by narrow cliques…\\n\\nBut because Bercow's dirty tricks are in accord with where most of the Establishment is on Brexit — i.e. wanting it derailed by whatever means necessary — you're scarcely going to hear a peep of protest…\\n\\n…Except, of course, from those members of the silent majority who are feeling increasingly let down by a democratic system which they see so blatantly being rigged against them. They voted Brexit to get rid of this venal, self-serving Establishment.

Everyone must know that it is a false hope to think that Germany would simply wave people in, he told Die Welt daily.\\n\\nMerkel's strident critics in the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the CSU, also piled on the pressure after the regional polls, which serve as a key test ahead of general elections in 2017.\\n\\nThe main reason for the poor CDU showing is the refugee policy. It makes no sense at all, CSU chief Horst Seehofer said at a party meeting on Monday.\\n\\nDemanding changes, Seehofer said: It can't be that after such an election result, the answer to the electorate is: everything will go on as before.\\n\\n– 'Black Sunday' –\\n\\nIn the aftermath of the vote described as Black Sunday for the CDU by news website Spiegel Online, Merkel also came in for criticism for unwittingly allowing the AfD to flourish.\\n\\nFor most of the past decade, Merkel enjoyed stellar popularity ratings as she pushed middle-ground policies which helped her party capture voters from the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD).

Am dying to build it. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 26, 2017\\n\\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has fallen by over 10 percent in the last two weeks, and about 20 percent, or about $12 billion, in the last three months as Wall Street analysts have slashed sales and earnings estimates. Those cuts have come despite Musk promising a string of new vehicle projects that include a Tesla all-electric semi-truck and a second-generation Roadster.\\n\\nMusk tweeted a week ago that Tesla was rated as having the highest customer satisfaction of any vehicle in America, and later promised the company would soon produce new all-electric Model Y cross-overs and full-size pick-up trucks. But Musk has been silent about Consumer Reports rating Tesla's Model X as the absolute least reliable vehicle made.\\n\\nTesla stock fell by over 1 percent on Dec. 29 after KeyBanc Analyst Brad Erickson lowered his earnings estimate and rating on Tesla on the morning of Dec. 29, based on the company tracking in the December quarter to deliver only 5,000 Model 3 units, versus the revised 15,000-unit guidance in November, which was down from a July guidance of 80,000 units.\\n\\nErickson's estimate cuts didn't change his financial projections much. He cut his quarterly revenue estimate by $370 million to $2.87 billion, but his expected loss per share was cut by 3 cents to $1.98. He also slashed 2018 revenue projections by almost $4 billion to $16.21 billion, based on 108,000 Model 3 deliveries versus his prior estimate of 300,000.\\n\\nMusk has done a superb job of promoting 500,000 preorder deposits of $1,000 each for his Tesla Model 3 affordable car.

Congress has the authority to rewrite Title IX and redefine its terms at any time [and] To date, however, Congress has chosen not to do so,  said the memo, which was sent to Kimberley Richey, the acting assistant secretary for civil rights.\\n\\nFederal law permits schools to provide separate bathrooms, locker rooms, and showers 'on the basis of sex,' as long as the school provides comparable facilities for 'each sex,' the memo says.

Gorsuch joined with the bloc of progressive justices to declare that Congress's 1964 law against workplace sexual discrimination also endorsed the recent claim that each person's gender identity should be more legally important than their biological sex.\\n\\nThe memo will help Americans block the efforts by pro-transgender activist groups to remove government recognition of the two sexes. For example, these groups have persuaded Democrats in Congress to adopt sex-less gender terminology in place of traditional terms such as father and mother.\\n\\nDemocrats censor mention of people's biological sex, via a party-line House vote.\\n\\nThe language policing promotes the very unpopular 'transgender' claim that each person's sense of stereotyped male- or female-ness is more important than their actual sex. https://t.co/HIEJBQlfpC — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 5, 2021\\n\\nWe are grateful that there is further clarity into what Title IX [sex discrimination law] means and what it does not, said a statement from Save Women's Sports.\\n\\nAllowing males to compete in female sports is not progressive; it is abusive, the group, run by female powerlifter Beth Stelzer, asserted.\\n\\nSingle-sex sports are essential, the organization continued. Sports should not be the platform for political ideologies that would destroy the definition of female sports… The Save Women's Sports team will continue to fight for fair sports and safe locker rooms for females. \\n\\nThe department's memo was denounced by groups that deny the importance of the two sexes' different biologies. For example, the Human Rights Campaign issued a January 11 statement saying:\\n\\nThe new guidance categorically denies that Bostock applies to Title IX despite the clear words of the majority opinion that it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.\\n\\nDuring the 2020 campaign, President-elect Joe Biden embraced the radical transgender' claim that the government should treat each person's biological sex as subordinate to their claimed transgender cross-sex status.\\n\\nIn practice, the transgender claim eliminates single-sex institutions — such as female-only jails for women, female-only sports leagues, female-only changing rooms, and showers — because it says any man can claim a female legal identity without even undergoing surgery or dressing in stereotypical female appearance.\\n\\nIf that view is adopted by the court or Congress, men will be able to call the FBI to force women to accept their claim of female identity.\\n\\nBiden has repeatedly said he will support men's claim to female identity and women's claim to male identity.\\n\\nI will flat out just change the law — I will eliminate those Executive Orders, Biden said October 15, during a televised town hall meeting when he was questioned by the mother of a woman who said her young child is transgender.\\n\\nBiden is expected to use his regulatory powers in government agencies to enforce that view. For example, he has said that men should be allowed to stay in women-only prisons if they claim to have a female gender identity.\\n\\nHe has also announced his opposition to Trump's Pentagon rules. Trump's rule does not bar people who claim to be transgender but do require each service member's recorded gender market to match the bright line' of their biology. A 2018 Pentagon report set the policy, saying:\\n\\nLow rates of full sex reassignment surgery and the otherwise wide variation of transition-related treatment, with all the challenges that entails for privacy, fairness, and safety, weigh in favor of maintaining a bright line based on biological [male or female] sex — not gender identity … After all, a person's biological sex is generally ascertainable through objective means.\\n\\nBut Biden's opposition will allow men to registers themselves as women in the military's records as women. Once that change is made, female service members would have to submit to the men's demands to be addressed as women in accommodations, promotion, fitness requirements, and the showers.\\n\\nTransgender people comprise far less than 1 percent of the population, and very few men — and servicemembers — who declare they are transgender undergo genital surgery.\\n\\nCurrently, few GOP legislators publicly support the popular view that laws should recognize the inherent distinctions between men and women or girls and boys."}
{"original": "Democrat Jon Ossoff is running for one of two U.S. Senate seats up for grabs in the Georgia runoffs on January 5. Should he and his comrade, Rev. Raphael Warnock, defeat Republican incumbents David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, respectively, they will create a 50-50 deadlock in the Senate, giving Democrats control on President-elect Kamala Harris's tie-breaking vote.\\n\\nOssoff is something of an enigma, having never held public office — though not for lack of trying. He would also be one of the youngest people ever elected to the U.S. Senate, with the least experience, and a litany of potentially compromising problems.\\n\\nHere are seven key facts about Ossoff:\\n\\n1. He inherited a fortune from his grandfather. The Washington Post noted recently that Ossoff has declined to say how much he inherited from his grandfather, who was co-owner of a Massachusetts leather factory. Whatever the amount, it was enough for Ossoff to lend $250,000 to a friend's company in London. His net worth is estimated as up to $8.8 million. And while Ossoff has attacked Perdue for trading stocks while in Congress (legally), Ossoff has not released his own tax returns.\\n\\n2. He inflated his resumé, claiming more national security credentials than he actually had. In 2017, Ossoff claimed: I've got five years of experience as a national security staffer in the U.S. Congress. Politifact investigated that claim and found that it was only half-true. Two of those years were part-time work while he was a student. While Ossoff claimed he had security clearance, that was only true for a few months. One expert described Ossoff as committing resumé inflation.\\n\\n3. His company, Insight TWI, worked with Al Jazeera and a Hong Kong distributor partly owned by a company linked to the Chinese Communist Party. Ossoff's company received around $1,000 through a distributor for two investigations it made on Islamic State war crimes that were rebroadcast by PCCW in Hong Kong. PCCW has financial ties to the Chinese government, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Ossoff initially failed to disclose the payment.\\n\\n4. He has refused to release his tax returns. Though Democrats have complained for years about President Donald Trump not releasing his tax returns, Ossoff refuses to release his own. The Washington Post reported: Ossoff has declined to say how much he inherited [from his grandfather], and he has not released his tax returns. Ironically, Ossoff and his party are running on the idea that he represents a change from the financial self-dealing and opacity of Washington politicians.\\n\\n5. He is running on a promise to grant amnesty to illegal aliens. As Breitbart News reported, Ossoff offered amnesty to those who otherwise follow the law at a recent Latin Meet & Greet. He said: I will work to pass comprehensive immigration reform that establishes a path to legal status for those who lack documentation and otherwise follow the law. He also said that Dreamers — illegal aliens who came the U.S. as minors — are every bit as American as any of us.\\n\\n6. He lost a 2017 race for Congress, the most expensive in history. In 2017, Ossoff ran against Republican Karen Handel in a special election to represent Georgia's 6th congressional district in suburban Atlanta. Thanks to help from Hollywood, Ossoff raised four times as much as Handel in what remains the most expensive House race in history. But the fresh-faced millennial did not actually live in the district. That did not disqualify him, but it hurt his chances and he went down to defeat.\\n\\n7. He welcomed support from Bernie Sanders in 2020, after running as a moderate in 2017. Sanders, the democratic socialist from Vermont, endorsed Ossoff — and Ossoff told CNN that he welcome[d] his support, praising Sanders for for putting the interests of working families over corporate interests. But in 2017, Ossoff campaigned as a moderate when he ran for Congress. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution noted Ossoff's shift as a sign that Georgia Democrats are moving left.\\n\\n8. He would support new shutdowns of the economy. Ossoff told CNN in November that he would support a renewed shutdown of Georgia's economy if recommended by experts to control the coronavirus pandemic. It's time to trust the experts, he said. Georgia is currently experiencing a surge in coronavirus cases, similar to that experienced in many other states. Earlier this year, it was one of the first states to reopen its economy as the initial surge in cases began to subside.\\n\\n9. He wants to ban semi-automatic rifles and require licenses for handguns. Ossoff is taking a hard line on gun control, demanding a ban on semi-automatic rifles, which he labels assault weapons, and requiring licenses even for ordinary handguns. For semiautomatic weapons, whether they are rifles or handguns, we need strict licensing requirements, he told MSNBC last year. Nearly half of Georgia residents live in homes where a member of the household owns a firearm.\\n\\nJoel B.

{"original": "Alarmist scientists have found a terrifying new ' climate change' threat: mutant transgender turtles.\\n\\nTheir study, titled Environmental Warming and Feminization of One of the Largest Sea Turtle Populations in the World, warns that global warming could turn the world's sea turtle populations female, possibly leading to their extinction.\\n\\nThe study authors, from NOAA's Marine Mammal and Turtle division in La Jolla, California, analyzed sea turtle populations on beaches at the northern and southern ends of Australia's Great Barrier Reef.\\n\\nHere is WWF's account of their findings:\\n\\nBecause incubation temperature of turtle eggs determines the animal's sex, a warmer nest results in more females. Increasing temperatures in Queensland's north, linked to climate change, have led to virtually no male northern green sea turtles being born. For the study, scientists caught green turtles at the Howick Group of islands where both northern and southern green turtle populations forage in the Great Barrier Reef. Using a combination of endocrinology and genetic tests, researchers identified the turtles' sex and nesting origin. Of green turtles from warmer northern nesting beaches, 99.1% of juveniles, 99.8% of subadults, and 86.8% of adults were female. Turtles from the cooler southern reef nesting beaches showed a more moderate female sex bias (65%–69% female).\\n\\nIf global warming continues, the study concludes, then so many turtles may turn female that there will be no males with which to mate. Extinction will then be inevitable.\\n\\nWith warming global temperatures and most sea turtle populations naturally producing offspring above the pivotal temperature [14], it is clear that climate change poses a serious threat to the persistence of these populations.\\n\\nThis all sounds very worrying, until you realize that the study was actually co-produced by the WWF itself, probably with a view to reaching this conclusion:\\n\\nMore ambitious climate change targets must also be adopted and enforced in order to save the Great Barrier Reef, its natural treasures and unique wildlife.\\n\\nIn other words, like so many environmental studies these days, it is more of a political artefact than a scientific one.\\n\\nAs Paul Homewood notes, the story falls down for a number of reasons.\\n\\nFirst, the idea that the turtles' breeding grounds in Queensland are going to carry on getting hotter is purely speculative. It is not a trend backed up by real-world data.\\n\\nSecond, turtles have been around for some time, are widespread and resilient.\\n\\nGreen turtles are in fact remarkably widespread, and are found in tropical, subtropical and temperate waters around the world. They certainly are not dependent on a narrow set of weather conditions. In Australia alone, there are seven regional populations of green turtles that nest in different areas; the southern Great Barrier Reef, the northern Great Barrier Reef, the Coral Sea, the Gulf of Carpentaria, Western Australia's north-west shelf, the Ashmore and Cartier Reefs and Scott Reef. They have also been around for more then 100 million years, so the idea that they will all die out if it gets a bit warmer is palpable nonsense.\\n\\nThird, Australia's turtle populations are doing just fine.\\n\\nThough it can't resist a brief nod to the Narrative – research suggests that the northern and southern stocks may be exhibiting characteristics of populations under threat – the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority admits that the bottom line is this:\\n\\nTo date, there have been no detectable declines in the number of nesting green turtles at Great Barrier Reef nest monitoring sites.\\n\\nThat'll be why they call sea turtles the polar bears of the south, then. Or if they don't, maybe it's time they did."}

{"original": "Beijing (AFP) – The death of a whistleblowing doctor whose early warnings about China's new coronavirus outbreak were suppressed by the police has unleashed a wave of anger at the government's handling of the crisis — and bold demands for more freedom.\\n\\nOphthalmologist Li Wenliang was among a group of people who sounded the alarm about the virus in late December, only to be reprimanded and censored by the authorities in central Hubei province.\\n\\nAfter Li's death was confirmed early Friday, the 34-year-old was lionised as a hero on social media, while officials were vilified for letting the epidemic spiral into a national health crisis instead of listening to the doctor.\\n\\nBut many also used the occasion to demand more liberties in the Communist Party-ruled country, with the hashtags I want freedom of speech and we demand freedom of speech appearing on Twitter-like Weibo before being censored.\\n\\nChinese people are only allowed one kind of freedom, and that is the freedom given by the country and the Communist Party, commented one Weibo user.\\n\\nBut clearly it is us who should be the masters of this country's laws.\\n\\nLocal authorities in Hubei and its capital Wuhan, the city at the epicentre of the crisis, had already faced rare, uncensored criticism online in recent weeks for initially downplaying the magnitude of the outbreak.\\n\\nWhile the World Health Organization and some experts have heaped praise on China, saying it took decisive steps to try to contain the virus, critics say precious time was lost by the early inaction of the local government.\\n\\nHubei and Wuhan officials held key political meetings in the first weeks of January. The death toll and number of cases only began to soar afterwards, going from one fatality on January 11 to more than 630 barely four weeks later.\\n\\nLi, who was diagnosed with the virus on February 1, said in a Weibo post in late January that local police had forced him to sign a statement agreeing not to commit any more law-breaking actions.\\n\\nHe said police had summoned him after he had seen test results from some patients suggesting SARS in December, and decided to remind his colleagues in a group chat to take stronger precaution measures.\\n\\nAfter the Wuhan Central Hospital confirmed on Weibo early Friday that Li had joined the growing number of victims, mourners left hundreds of thousands of eulogies.\\n\\nEverything in the world can be suppressed except grief, a blogger said on the Chinese website Baidu.\\n\\n– 'Strong emotions' –\\n\\nThe public sadness appears to have caught the Chinese government's usually tightly-controlled propaganda apparatus on the back foot.\\n\\nState broadcaster CCTV and the Global Times tabloid had reported his death on Weibo late Thursday but they deleted their reports soon after the news became the top search item on the platform with 12 million hits.\\n\\nThe hospital later issued a statement saying Li was undergoing emergency treatment before confirming his death early Friday.\\n\\nDali Yang, a political science professor at the University of Chicago, said authorities likely ordered the delay to show there was an effort to save the doctor because there was such an outpouring of emotion and they wanted to give a sense of hope.\\n\\nClearly, there was a effort nationally to channel these very strong emotions from across the country, Yang told AFP.\\n\\nBut the government also did not want to let it get out of hand and instead move the grief in the direction that the leadership wants it to go, he said.\\n\\nThe party wants to show that only under its leadership can the country overcome the crisis, he said.\\n\\nPresident Xi Jinping has called the fight against the virus a people's war, while China's ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, on Friday described Li's work as part of our joint efforts fighting against the virus.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, censors had allowed Weibo users to criticise Hubei officials — a move that placed attention on them instead of the central government.\\n\\nChina's anti-graft agency said Friday it was sending investigators to Wuhan to look into issues related to Li.\\n\\nAfter Li's death, criticism went far beyond the anger directed at local officials, with users questioning the nature of the Communist state itself.\\n\\n– 'Don't worry' –\\n\\nSome Weibo users used historical references, pointing to Wuhan as the birthplace of the 1911 revolution that ended thousands of years of imperial rule in China.\\n\\nThe Qing dynasty has been dead for 100 years, how can there still be such bloody tragedies? wrote one user.\\n\\nBy Friday morning, multiple hashtags related to freedom of speech and Li's death had been scrubbed from Weibo's search results.\\n\\nIf they delete it, post it again.

{"original": "On Tuesday, the L.A. Clippers J.J. Redick suggested it is time for the Second Amendment to evolve to allow gun control.\\n\\nHe referenced the Second Amendment while talking about collegiate sports, contending that NCAA basketball players ought to be paid. In fact, Redick jumped from announcing the end of amateurism in collegiate sports to declaring the end of a Second Amendment that protects 21st century firearms.\\n\\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, Redick said:\\n\\nThe idea of amateurism, it doesn't exist anymore. And so if you're going to do what you're doing, then you just need that complete overhaul. It's got to be something radical. It's not just, 'Oh, let's just pay every player $5,000.' It really requires something really radical. And maybe that's getting rid of college athletics as we know it.\\n\\nHe paraphrased a Thomas Jefferson quote to segue to guns, saying, I go back to the Thomas Jefferson quote — I'm going to butcher it, but it's something we've all read. 'You wouldn't expect a little boy to wear the pea coat he wore as a boy as a grown man.' You need to change with the times.\\n\\nRedick then addressed gun control, saying laws should evolve in the same way he wants to see collegiate sports evolve. He said:\\n\\nLaws should reflect that [change], rules, regulations, especially as we know more. Gun control. I don't want to get political, but gun control. That's something that should evolve as technology evolves. When the 2nd Amendment was created, we had to worry about bears, people lived on the frontier and it took a minute to load a muzzle. I think laws should reflect where we are with guns.\\n\\nIronically–just one day before Redick made these comments–Independent Institute's Dave Kopel wrote that gun control arguments framed around musket arguments show a lack of historical knowledge. Writing in The Washington Post, Kopel said:\\n\\nGun-control advocates often argue that gun-control laws must be more restrictive than the original meaning of the Second Amendment would allow, because modern firearms are so different from the firearms of the late 18th century. This argument is based on ignorance of the history of firearms. It is true that in 1791 the most common firearms were handguns or long guns that had to be reloaded after every shot. But it is not true that repeating arms, which can fire multiple times without reloading, were unimagined in 1791. To the contrary, repeating arms long predate the 1606 founding of the first English colony in America. As of 1791, repeating arms were available but expensive.\\n\\nKopel's historical observation helps the reader better understand the Supreme Court's majority opinion in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008). In that opinion, late Justice Antonin Scalia pointed to judicial precedent to show the Second Amendment protects guns in common use at any given time. In other words, at all times the Second Amendment protects the guns commonly owned and used by law-abiding citizens. This means protection for the very 21st century firearms J.J. Redick believes justify more gun control.\\n\\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

Although Kondabolu identifies as a comedian, he used this doc as a means to bully the iconic television show The Simpsons into doing things his way, specifically with the beloved character Apu Nahasapeemapetilon.\\n\\nAlthough Apu is a beloved and sympathetic character, America's fascist humor police are angry because they see him as a caricature of an Indian immigrant (I think we are supposed to say South Asian now — it is hard to keep up). Because of his accent, his propensity to say Thank you, come again, and the fact that he runs a Kwik-E-Mart, the Joke Gestapo is on the march. An additional sin is that Apu is voiced by Hank Azaria, who is a white guy (and has won three Emmys for his work).\\n\\nApu holds a Ph.D. in computer science. His decision to run the mini-mart is purely a voluntary one, a desire to stay in contact with his customers, many of whom, are his friends. Apu is not just a joke machine. Over 29 seasons, The Simpsons has devoted a number of storylines and episodes to Apu, and as a result, he is a fully-fleshed out, multi-dimensional character.\\n\\nNevertheless, because the humor police have nothing better to do than to feign offense, The Simpsons' producers felt the need to respond, and to their everlasting credit, did so by telling the Satire Stasi to pound sand.\\n\\nA disappointed Entertainment Weekly described the response this way:\\n\\nThe scene in question involved an exhausted Marge reading The Princess in the Garden [a book filled with stereotypes] — or at least a version of the book that she has edited to make [politically] acceptable for 2018 — to Lisa. This new Clara sounds like she starts out pretty perfect, Lisa says to her mom. But since she's already evolved, she doesn't really have an emotional journey to complete… Kinda means there's no point to the book. Well, what am I supposed to do? asks Marge. It's hard to say, answers Lisa, turning to the camera. Something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive is now politically incorrect. What can you do? As she says that last line, she looks at a nearby picture of Apu featuring Bart's catchphrase, Don't have a cow! Some things will be dealt with at a later date, says Marge. If it all, adds Lisa.\\n\\nNaturally, the left-wing fascists in the social justice movement were quick to put and rage over not getting their way:\\n\\nI think the fact that they put this argument in the mouth of Lisa's character, the character who usually champions the underdogs and is supposed to be the most thoughtful and liberal, is what makes this the most ridiculous (as in worthy of ridicule) and toothless response. — W. Kamau Bell (@wkamaubell) April 9, 2018\\n\\nKondabolu, predictably, is very unhappy that his emotional blackmail failed to result in censorship:\\n\\nIn 'The Problem with Apu,' I used Apu & The Simpsons as an entry point into a larger conversation about the representation of marginalized groups & why this is important, the offended comic tweeted. 'The Simpsons' response tonight is not a jab at me, but at what many of us consider progress.\\n\\nIn The Problem with Apu, I used Apu & The Simpsons as an entry point into a larger conversation about the representation of marginalized groups & why this is important. The Simpsons response tonight is not a jab at me, but at what many of us consider progress. — Hari Kondabolu (@harikondabolu) April 9, 2018\\n\\nUsing prose that has never been so purple, some accused the show of losing its way:\\n\\nMany have done their best to pinpoint exactly what The Simpsons lost after its first decade on air. At first, it was hard to put a finger on, but now you can point at virtually any gag in any recent episode and you'd find an example of how the show has utterly given up on itself. The show's most recent episode, No Good Read Goes Unpunished, is a gaping wound where the show's funny bone used to be. A malignant tumor in its brain blocking the path of any possible introspection whatsoever.\\n\\nThe scene that so many have taken issue with is a thinly-veiled response to the criticisms of the character Apu Nahasapeemapetilon that arose from Hari Kondabolu's 2017 documentary The Problem with Apu\\n\\nAs expected, the far-left Vox pretty much had a cow over the show's reply:\\n\\nAnd why on earth is Lisa — the Simpsons character who's always been the most passionate about sticking up for people and issues that get less attention and care than others — the one to deliver this tired, anti-PC culture blow? Most importantly: This throwaway scene makes no effort to consider that the book — and by proxy, Apu — may not have been applauded and inoffensive to everyone. It's very clear that this scene is written from and for the perspective of people who weren't challenged on their assumptions before, and now find the idea of revisiting those assumptions annoying and unnecessary.\\n\\nNRP used our precious tax dollars to freak out:\\n\\nFurthermore, Apu is not appearing in a 50-year-old book by a now-dead author. Apu is a going concern. Someone draws him, over and over again. Azaria makes money to keep imitating Peter Sellers imitating an Indian man. Scripts are still being written. What if Marge were confronted not with reading Lisa an old book, but with reading a new book in the same series that continued to embrace the same racist portrayals it did 50 years ago? Is Marge really supposed to relax and read Lisa a new racist book because she loved an old racist book?\\n\\nThis is not about sensitivity, it is about bullying. The quickest way to strut your own phony moral superiority is to assume the role of victim, to say something should not be allowed because it is hurtful.\\n\\nSorry, but there is nothing inherently wrong with stereotyping. What matters is the approach. Is it affectionate and sympathetic, or is it mean-spirited, an attempt to denigrate.\\n\\nChristians, southerners, white guys, and conservatives, are mercilessly stereotyped in popular culture. As someone who is in all four of those groups, I know the difference between a hilarious stereotype like Al Bundy or Cousin Eddie, and this. Even when it comes to other cultures, because of our shared humanity, I know the difference between this and this.\\n\\nRegardless, I would never demand those who use denigrating stereotypes of me and mine censor themselves. Instead, I do this — watch something else. Seriously, it works like magic. I certainly will, though, point out that the stereotyping of me and mine is the only acceptable form of bigotry still allowed in our country, and bigotry is what it is when you are singled out.\\n\\nThe truth though is that nothing would make me happier than to go back to the Norman Lear era when everyone was fair game, when there were no sacred cows. That era was not only funnier and smarter, it helped bring us together. There was also no crybabying. We could all take a joke and we were stronger for it.\\n\\nStereotypes are usually stereotypes for a reason. There is some truth to them and the best humor comes from truth. Are satirists supposed to ignore the fact that a disproportionate number of Indians run convenience stores and speak with an accent?\\n\\nHere is my suggestion for those offended by Apu or anything: If you don't like, don't watch it.\\n\\nNo one is forcing you to sit there and get offended. Change the channel. There are about 500 of them now. That is the American way to respond to such a thing. The un-American way is to try to bully and emotionally blackmail artists into creating the art you want. This is called censorship.\\n\\nHere is an even better idea: Instead of spending a half-hour a week getting offended by a cartoon, turn off the TV and use those thirty minutes to create your own art, something to compete with The Simpsons.\\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

{"original": "The House of Representatives is considering a bill that would prevent the NSA from conducting warrantless searches through U.S. citizens' e-mail accounts.\\n\\nRepresentatives Tulsi Gabbard (D-HA) and Scott Perry (R-PA) have presented a bill which seeks to permanently codify protections on Americans' privacy. It has been introduced to the House to cement a policy change announced by the NSA in April, ending surveillance of e-mail based on keywords related to foreign targets of spying, unless they were specifically to or from concerned parties. This catch-all form of spying is known as about surveillance, and both Gabbard and Perry want to ensure it doesn't make a comeback.\\n\\nIn a statement, Gabbard asserted that the NSA has been defying the rights and liberties granted to us under the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution. She criticized the 2008 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act — namely Section 702 — for bringing on a massive government-led exploitation of personal privacy. She says that the bill will keep our country from backtracking on this progress by permanently codifying this policy change and banning this privacy-invading collection from taking place again.\\n\\nPerry said that collection of electronic communications … that merely mention a foreign target of surveillance has been used as an end-around the Fourth Amendment, commending the NSA for finally aligning their collection efforts with the Constitution. It is an important win for the American people that their bill seeks to protect from the decisions of future administrations.\\n\\nThis bill is the first step in reforming Section 702, a change that Neema Singh Guliani, a legislative counsel at the ACLU, advocated for in the wake of the April decision:\\n\\nThe announcement today underscores the need for Congress to significantly reform Section 702. While the NSA's policy change will curb some of the most egregious abuses under the statute, it is at best a partial fix. Congress should take steps to ensure such practices are never resurrected, and also end policies that permit broad, warrantless collection of Americans' communications.\\n\\nBoth Gabbard and Perry are veterans of the Iraq War. They are members of the Fourth Amendment Caucus, and co-chair the Post-9/11 Veterans Caucus. And while they have particular motivation to protect the freedom of Americans, this is a bill that addresses real and ongoing concerns with the state of U.S. citizens' privacy on both sides of the aisle.

{"original": "Malaysian King Sultan Muhammad V abruptly abdicated on Sunday after wearing the crown for only two years. The former 15th king of Malaysia did not explain why he departed early, but there is speculation it had something to do with his personal life.\\n\\nHis Majesty tells the people of Malaysia to continue to be united to maintain unity, tolerance, and work together, said the statement announcing the abdication.\\n\\nThe Associated Press noted on Sunday that the king just returned from a two-month medical leave in which he evidently journeyed to Moscow and married a 25-year-old former Russian beauty queen. The wedding has not been confirmed by either the royal palace or Malaysia's elected government, but foreign tabloids and websites have published photos of the ceremony.\\n\\nThe beauty queen in question, Oksana Voevodina, took the Miss Moscow title in 2015. She reportedly met the Malaysian king while he was traveling in Europe in 2017 and she was modeling luxury watches.\\n\\nAccording to the Singapore Times (ST), Voevodina converted to Islam, changed her name to Rihana Oxana Gorbatenko, and married the king in an alcohol-free ceremony with halal food where the bride and groom donned Malay traditional outfits. Wedding photos posted on social media showed the bride wearing an Islamic headscarf.\\n\\nThe ST cited reports that the couple has visited a fertility clinic in Germany because Sultan Muhammad's first marriage was childless and he is desperate to start a family. Muhammad seemed quite healthy and vigorous otherwise, with a penchant for extreme sports such as off-road driving, horse riding, football, and endurance challenges.\\n\\nMuhammad V was the 15th king of Malaysia since it peacefully separated from the United Kingdom in 1957 and the first to abdicate. If he had remained on the throne, the 49-year-old monarch would have served only three more years, because Malaysia has a unique rotational monarchy in which the ceremonial royal office is passed between nine sultans. The throne has little practical power but great ceremonial importance, including the king's role as symbolic head of Islam in Malaysia.\\n\\nMalaysians expressed surprise and distress over the abdication on social media. We Malaysians pray for his health and that he is protected by Allah. Long live the King! former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak said on Facebook.\\n\\nThe South China Morning Post saw a game of thrones getting underway in Malaysia as the Conference of Rulers, a body comprised of the nine eligible candidates for the crown plus a few non-voting provincial governors, meets to decide who the next king will be. The Conference of Rulers is scheduled to vote on January 24 and swear in a new king on January 31, although there is no legal deadline for installing a new king.\\n\\nThe SCMP explained why the decision may not be as simple as confirming the current acting king to hold the rest of Muhammad V's term or tapping the next scheduled king to take over early:\\n\\nUnder the rotational system, the Sultan of Pahang state, Ahmad Shah, is next in line although the sultan is ailing according to local media, a rumour the palace has strenuously denied. Johor's Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar and Sultan Nazrin Shah of Perak, who is currently the deputy king and is carrying out the functions of the king until a new one is elected, are the next two names in the rotational system. Although the functions of the king are largely ceremonial, he also serves to safeguard Islam in Muslim-majority Malaysia, and must assent to the appointment of individuals for various senior government roles including that of prime minister. Under the constitution, there are only three instances in which the ruler who is next on the list can be denied the position: if the royal is a minor, if the Conference of Rulers by secret ballot resolves that he is unsuitable by reason of infirmity of mind or body or any other cause to exercise the functions of king, or if he declines to take the position. The ballot would then move to the next ruler on the list. In 2016, the Sultan of Johor claimed he had been offered the role of king, bypassing both Kelantan – Muhammad V's home state – and Pahang, saying he had rejected the offer out of respect for the rotational system.\\n\\nMalaysian political experts speculated that Sultan Ahmad Shah might abdicate his own position, citing his poor health, allowing his son to become sultan and king, or that Sultan Ibrahim Ismail of Johor might take the job he declined in 2016. One problem with that scenario is that Ismail supposedly does not get along well with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has a long history of attempting to limit the powers of the monarchy and remove its immunity from prosecution.\\n\\nThe South China Morning Post recalled a few clashes between the prime minister and Muhammad V as well:\\n\\nIn May, after the general election that saw former governing coalition Barisan Nasional toppled for the first time in its 61-year rule, there was widespread speculation that the palace had delayed Mahathir's swearing in as prime minister. In June, the government and the Agong reached an impasse regarding the appointment of ethnic Indian lawyer Tommy Thomas as attorney general, a position normally reserved for a member of the Malay-Muslim majority race – although the constitution does not specify a specific race, gender or religious requirement for the role. The Agong consented to the appointment after two weeks of the stand-off. Muhammad V was also the ruler who handed democracy icon and prime minister-in-waiting Anwar Ibrahim a royal pardon in May, wiping clean his record of multiple charges of sodomy and corruption and releasing him from prison.\\n\\nCNN reported on Monday that at least six members of the Conference of Rulers have already met to discuss who will succeed Muhammad V, and in fact might have prodded him to abdicate, either because they were unhappy with his choice of fiancee or because they thought he was not well-suited to handle an era of fundamental change in Malaysia."}

{"original": "Lawmakers in North Dakota are taking up legislation that would allow competing in sports in high school and college based on one's biological sex.\\n\\nIf it becomes law it would mean that girls or boys could not participate in sports based on their preferred gender, they would have to compete based on their actual sex.\\n\\nThe Grand Forks Herald reported on the bill:\\n\\nHouse Bill 1298 would prevent publicly funded institutions, like high schools and universities, from allowing any individual who was assigned the opposite sex at birth to participate on an athletic team that is designed exclusively for females or exclusively for males. Additionally, the bill would outlaw any state-owned athletic facility from hosting a competition in which an athlete competes against anyone outside of the gender they were assigned at birth. But while LGBTQ advocates argued the bill would have far-reaching implications for transgender people in North Dakota, its lead sponsor, Rep. Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo, said the legislation has nothing to do with transgender athletes. Instead, Koppelman said he is pursuing changes to the law out of a concern for fairness in sports and to prevent women from being disadvantaged by having to compete against men. While transgender athletes are not explicitly noted in Koppelman's bill, critics argued that it clearly targets the transgender community. House Minority Leader Josh Boschee, D-Fargo, said he couldn't think of any other reason that this bill would be introduced.\\n\\nI kind of dismiss the idea that it should be about trans, because it's not about trans — it's about fair competition, Koppelman said. What it's based on is science that says, 'Here are the physiological differences between people when they are born.' And these are irreversible things.\\n\\nI don't know the problem that's trying to be solved, Koppelman said.\\n\\nRight now under a North Dakota High School Activities Association 2015 statute transgender students taking hormonal supplements can compete in sports under their gender identity on a case by case basis.\\n\\nUnder this policy, a student who has transitioned from female to male may compete in boys sports but is no longer eligible to compete in girls sports, the Tribune reported. A student who has transitioned from male to female may continue to compete in boys sports and is eligible to compete in girls sports after completing one year of testosterone suppression.\\n\\nThe Tribune interviewed opponents to the legislation, including Libby Skarin, a regional campaign director with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), who said the bill is an attack on transgender North Dakotans.\\n\\nEither don't compete at all, or compete in a sport that doesn't match their gender identity, Skarin said.\\n\\nSen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, is a co-sponsor on the bill and said it was about women's rights and disagrees.\\n\\nI would never want my daughter to play in sports and have a guy beat her out in track or out in javelin, where she has no chance, Myrdal said.\\n\\nUnlike a transgender athlete bill defeated in the South Dakota Legislature in 2019, Koppelman's bill also applies to collegiate athletics, a difference that Skarin said could put North Dakota out of step with national governing bodies like the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the Tribune reported.\\n\\nThe NCAA supports athletes competing according to their perceived gender rather than their biological sex.\\n\\nMydral said in the report that students have to make choices, including whether they want to pursue athletics.\\n\\nPeople will scream and holler and say, 'Oh, you denied them being in sports,' she said. Yeah, maybe we do. So maybe by making that choice to try to change your gender, you lose some opportunities. But you're not going to take all women and girls' opportunities away just because you wish to do that.\\n\\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.com"}
{"original": "Democratic legislators dodged in the House when Republicans spotlighted their unpopular effort to scrub the male and female sexes from the language allowed by congressional committees.\\n\\nShow me where it says in writing that we're canceling Mother's Day or that you can refer to yourself as a husband or father or mother or grandmother, said a flustered Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA), the chairman of the House Committee on Rules. The committee set the ban for all committees on words and terms that acknowledge the male or female sex of people, such as fathers or mothers.\\n\\nMcGovern continued, Give me a break. Enough is enough. We have to stop this. And we have to focus in on solving the problems that face the American people.\\n\\nThis [rules] package honors all gender identities by changing pronouns in the House written rules. So they are gender-neutral. Look, we made this change for the sake of inclusion, not exclusion, McGovern insisted.\\n\\nMcGovern's response came as several GOP legislators highlighted the language barring references to a person's sex.\\n\\nI'm a proud husband, proud father of a son and a daughter — they don't even want you to be able to say that anymore, said GOP whip, Steve Scalise (R-LA).\\n\\nThe Democrats rule package takes out words like mother and father and brother and sister in their quest to not offend anyone, said Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-AZ). They're offending, almost all of America, Lesko added.\\n\\nThe new language is included in the new rules for the congressional committee in 2021 and 2022. The Democrats drafted the rules and pushed them through Congress on Monday, via a 217 to 206 party-line vote.\\n\\nThe rules comply with the gender identity ideology that denies the male or female sex of each person and insists on the so-called gender-neutral language that hides the male or female sex of people.\\n\\nThe gender language is usually advocated by those who claim that the law should treat a person's sense of their gender as more important than their biological sex. For example, a man who claims that he is transgender should be allowed to race in women's athletic competitions, say the advocates for transgenderism.\\n\\nFor example, the rules require the committees to use the plural pronoun themself instead of the singular pronouns, the male himself or the female herself.\\n\\nThe Democrats' new rules also say:\\n\\nIn clause 8(c)(3) of rule XXIII, strike ''father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, first cousin, nephew, niece, husband, wife, father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, stepfather, stepmother, stepson, stepdaughter, stepbrother, step-sister, half brother, half sister, grandson, or grand-daughter'' and insert ''parent, child, sibling, parent's sibling, first cousin, sibling's child, spouse, parent-in-law, child-in-law, sibling-in-law, stepparent, step-child, stepsibling, half-sibling, or grandchild.\\n\\nI've noticed the dangerous trend against free speech in recent years, responded Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), who denounced the language rules and also the Democrats' decision in the rules package to prevent extended debates on bills by filing a Motion to Recommit during a floor debate:\\n\\nIt began in our schools on college campuses where our students are taught the absurd notion that free speech is about privilege and power, and not open debate and rational deliberation. For our constituents, taking away means freedom of speech is silent and good ideas are stifled. … The resolution strips all mentioned the words of father, mother, son, daughter, brother, mother in law, daughter in law. I'm a proud father. I'm an extremely proud son. But we're going strike them from the rules. First we take your speech away. Then we take what you can say.\\n\\nThe Democrats' increasing determination to hide the biological differences between men and women, or to recognize the complementarity of the two sexes, is driven by the growing clout of the well-funded transgender movement among progressives.\\n\\nPolls show that Americans do not want to be hostile to people who wish to live as members of the opposite sex. But the polls also show that the policy changes required by the transgender ideology are deeply unpopular and are increasingly opposed by conservatives and feminists. Breitbart News reported in October 2020:\\n\\nThe poll, which surveyed 3,500 likely voters across geographic regions, ethnicity, sex, and political affiliation, showed how unpopular such policies are in America, despite activist and media attempts to normalize them. Even liberal voters, according to the poll, disapprove of efforts to undermine biological sex with gender ideology. Overall, results found 66.93 percent of those polled say they strongly disagree with gender identity policies, including a majority of liberal voters.\\n\\nIn 2019, House Democrats passed a bill that would establish the transgender ideology by giving people the legal right to force other people to treat them as members of the opposite sex. The draft bill is called the Equality Act and will get another vote in 2021.\\n\\nIn the United Kingdom, the right-of-center Conservative Party has rolled back plans to promote the transgender ideology. The shift was caused by rising opposition from a wide range of voters and by increasing evidence of medical damage to girls and boys, women and men."}

{"original": "Wednesday on Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson Tonight, host Tucker Carlson reacted to the President Donald Trump's impeachment articles issued by the House of Representatives earlier in the day.\\n\\nCarlson honed in on the reaction from some Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).\\n\\nTranscript as follows:\\n\\nCARLSON: So it looks like they are impeaching Donald Trump again for the second time in four years, a week before he leaves office. With strong bipartisan support, leaders of both parties appear in favor of this.\\n\\nNo matter how angry you may be at Donald Trump tonight and many of his voters are angry at him, watching this happen may confuse you. The chaos of an impeachment trial is hardly the peaceful and orderly transition of power both parties assure you they want. So why are they doing this? There has to be a reason and indeed there is one.\\n\\nFirst, let's be clear about what that reason is not. Legitimate moral outrage will play absolutely no role whatsoever in whatever impeachment proceedings occur, no matter what you hear, no matter how many times Jim Clyburn goes on television and talks about the Civil Rights Movement; no matter how often you see the frail, but determined Nancy Pelosi read lines like this.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nREP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): We know that we face enemies of the Constitution. We know we experienced the insurrection that violated the sanctity of the people's Capitol and attempted to overturn the duly- recorded will of the American people, and we know that the President of the United States incited this insurrection, this armed rebellion against our common country.\\n\\nHe must go. He is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: Oh, the nation we all love, of course, yes, that lovable irredeemably immoral nation that must change by force immediately and forever because it is so disgusting and stained by your sin.\\n\\nYes, they really love it here. It is defended by Donald Trump.\\n\\nRight? Remember that for decades and not that long ago because we recall it vividly, the two most powerful Democrats in the United States Senate were Ted Kennedy and Robert Byrd. Ted Kennedy left a young woman to drown in a drunk driving accident; Robert Byrd was a recruiter for the Ku Klux Klan.\\n\\nDemocrats did not seem bothered by any of that. They never said a word.\\n\\nThey praised Kennedy and Byrd at every turn including at their funerals, so no, Democrats are not actually outraged in any moral sense by Donald Trump. They never have been. They're too cynical to have feelings that authentic.\\n\\nAs if to prove that point, they've named as one of their so-called impeachment managers the young, Eric Swalwell of California who was a sitting Member of Congress who had sex with an actual Chinese spy. So please, ladies, spare us the self-righteous indignation.\\n\\nWhat's happening here instead is old-fashioned hard-eyed politics. Democrats have every practical reason for wanting to see Trump impeached during his final days in office. The first and most obvious reason is to make Republicans weaker.\\n\\nEvery loss diminishes a political party, and impeachment is nothing if not a loss, so there's that. But there's also another thing. Democrats need to keep talking about Donald Trump, next week and forever if they're going to keep their own party together.\\n\\nMost political coalitions are built on shared interests. The Democratic coalition is built on shared genetics. The basic idea is that everyone who is not a straight white man must be united as one in unshakable solidarity. The problem is that can't happen because it's not true.\\n\\nIn real life, many Democrats have nothing in common with each other. Once Donald Trump leaves the scene, the great unifier, and it's time to divvy up the spoils of the United States Treasury to begin the great pinata party of 2021. Various components within the Democratic Party, the fabled communities you hear so much about will turn on each other with feral ferocity. You can see glimpses of it now, it's going to be highly ugly.\\n\\nDemocrats would like to delay that disaster as long as they can, so they need to keep Donald Trump at the center of the conversation. They are impeaching him so they can continue to give speeches about him. It's that simple.\\n\\nBut why are Republicans playing along? They don't really have a sound political rationale for any of this. They are just dumb and guilty. Honestly, that's the reason.\\n\\nHere's how it works: from the perspective of the Republican leadership, it would be best if Donald Trump just went away forever. He is embarrassing. They don't want to talk about him. They'd like him to disappear.\\n\\nSo that's their plan with impeachment: make it so that Trump can never run for office again — not that he actually plans to run for office again — and then disgrace Trump so thoroughly that he cannot appear in public ever again, then pretend that Donald Trump never happened. Call it the suburban Connecticut denial strategy. Whatever you do, don't talk about mom's alcoholism, just act like it's not happening and maybe it'll go away. Good luck with that.\\n\\nThere are a couple of obvious problems with this approach. The first problem is, it won't work. By impeaching the President during his final week in office, Congress will not succeed in discrediting Trump among Republican voters; in fact, it will enhance Donald Trump among Republican voters, obviously.\\n\\nWho does your average Republican voter trust more? Donald Trump or the many people who hate Donald Trump? Donald Trump or Mitch McConnell? Donald Trump or CNN? Come on, you know the answer. It's not complicated.\\n\\nBut apparently, it's too complicated for the dummies in the Republican Party who think impeachment will help them in the long run, they are that stupid. Maybe you shouldn't be surprised by that. These are the very same people who still defend the war in Iraq, the ones who will tell you with a straight face that Iran is the single biggest threat we will ever face as a nation. Iran.\\n\\nNot your falling wages or the runaway healthcare costs you can't pay or the financialized hollowed out economy that feels like it's about to collapse, not the Chinese fentanyl that just killed your nephew. No, none of that. Iran? An isolated faraway country you could not find on a map at gunpoint. That's the real threat.\\n\\nThe amazing thing is, they mean it when they say it. They are dead serious. That's how stupid and brainwashed they are.\\n\\nAnd by the way, they are so dumb they assume you agree with them. They have no idea what you really think. They haven't spent five minutes wondering why you voted for Donald Trump in the first place, and by the way, they don't care.\\n\\nThe sad thing is, a smart party could do a lot for itself and for the country with a moment like this.\\n\\nA week ago, a violent mob attacked the capitol. Republicans should have no problem opposing that. It ought to be consistent with what they have been saying for decades. Republicans are for law and order.\\n\\nSmash a cop in the face with a fire extinguisher, go to jail. Break windows, hit people with flag poles, the same thing, jail.\\n\\nWe are Republicans. We have no tolerance for that kind of crap. This is a civilized country. We won't put up with it.\\n\\nThe next time a mob gathers outside the U.S. Capitol Building, and by the way, outside a Wendy's in Minneapolis, or a Federal Building in Seattle or occupies a commercial district in Portland, Oregon by force, Republicans can say, loudly and with a clear and consistent conscience, we are against that.\\n\\nIn America, laws are real. They apply to everyone equally. That is the Republican position. It is not hard.\\n\\nBut apparently, it is hard. Because for the last week, slow learners like Mitch McConnell have missed it completely. They've allowed themselves instead to be led into rhetorical cul-de-sacs on the question of Donald Trump's personal character as a man.\\n\\nAt no point does it seem to have occurred to McConnell or any of these sort of geniuses clustered around him that what is really at stake right now is not the future of Donald Trump. He is elderly and retiring next week, but instead the future of his voters, tens of millions of them, American citizens who in the space of the last seven days have seen themselves redefined as domestic terrorists, that has happened.\\n\\nRepublicans in Washington don't seem to have noticed that it happened.\\n\\nJust today, the former MLB pitcher, Curt Schilling announced that he has had his personal insurance policies cancelled by his insurer. Why? Because Curt Schilling wrote a social media post defending Donald Trump, and in 2021, that's not allowed. You could lose your insurance for that.\\n\\nYou could also lose your bank account, your website, your access to e-mail and social media, your ability to communicate with the outside world and there's nothing you can do about it because you can also lose your lawyer. No legal representation for.\\n\\nYou how long before they cut off your water and electricity? Before UPS won't deliver your packages, and not to wreck your day, but guess what? Amazon is now one of America's biggest grocery providers. Good thing you don't need to eat.\\n\\nBut no problem says Mitch McConnell, the real problem is Donald Trump and once he is gone, everything will be fine."}
{"original": "The fall of ESPN is still a hot topic in sports media, but former ESPN commentator Jason Whitlock has a unique point to add to the litany of reasons for the famed cable sports network's troubles. Whitlock says that left-wing sports blog Deadspin caused ESPN to veer left, and that was the seed that caused the network's downfall.\\n\\nDeadspin, a popular but far-left website that forms part of the Gawker chain of sites, has targeted ESPN for political correction for several years with a long list of posts aimed at forcing ESPN to toe the political line of the extreme progressive left. And, according to Whitlock, Deadspin's campaign to liberalize ESPN has not only worked, but it has helped lead to the near death of the 38-year-old sports network.\\n\\nIn an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, Whitlock acknowledged that much of ESPN's problem is the penchant of many customers to cable cord-cutting. But, Whitlock says this assessment is accurate but incomplete and shouldn't be offered as the only reason ESPN is failing.\\n\\nWhitlock thinks that one of ESPN's main problems is, The decade-long culture war ESPN lost to Deadspin, a snarky, politically progressive sports blog launched by Gawker's Nick Denton in 2005.\\n\\nWhile the mainstream media has failed to document the extent of Deadspin's rout of ESPN, I haven't, Whitlock noted. I worked at ESPN twice, BD and AD. Before Deadspin (2001-06) and After Deadspin (2013-15).\\n\\nWhitlock pointed out that the pre-Deadspin era at ESPN was marked by much innovation, sparked by the energetic leadership of network executive Mark Shapiro. That period saw a surge in ESPN's influence and creativity. But, it wasn't to last, as the left-wing meddling of Deadspin kicked into high gear:\\n\\nDeadspin significantly elevated the price of implementing change at ESPN. The often-caustic blog mastered search-engine optimization and Twitter 's ability to gin up faux outrage. Its writers trolled ESPN talent and executives, getting plenty of attention along the way. The site particularly delighted in exposing alleged sexual malfeasance among ESPN employees.\\n\\nWhitlock went on to list a number of Deadspin stories based on dubious and often outright false claims, all aimed at bullying the network to adopt a liberal point of view.\\n\\nThe firing of commentator Curt Schilling seemed to cap Deadspin's victory over ESPN, Whitlock said. It all led to a knuckling under by the sports network:\\n\\nRather than sue [Deadspin's] bullying internet pirates into submission the way tech billionaire Peter Thiel did, ESPN chose to acquiesce and adopt progressive ideology and diversity as groundbreaking business innovations. ESPN is the exact network Deadspin desired. It's diverse on its surface, progressive in its point of view, and more concerned with spinning media narratives than with the quality of its product.\\n\\nThe channel has become too handcuffed by politics to protect its most experienced and loyal employees, Whitlock wrote. It's a massive symbol of everything that fueled Donald Trump's bid for the presidency.\\n\\nThe former ESPN employee and current Fox Sports commentator ended his piece with a telling paragraph:\\n\\nESPN NFL reporter Ed Werder, one of the most prominent faces among the layoffs last month, said in a podcast that he heard quality of work would not be a consideration when employees were let go. He lamented that it seemed to me that quality work should be the only consideration. Not in this America, the one ruled by social-media perception and dismissive of the real world.\\n\\nPlainly, Whitlock feels that ESPN has allowed liberal politics to dictate its every move. And, many sports fans agree.\\n\\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com."}

{"original": "COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Joe Biden is facing increasingly formidable competition in South Carolina, a state his campaign has long assumed was safely in his column and one he's repeatedly described as a firewall in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.\\n\\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and billionaire activist Tom Steyer are challenging the former vice president's standing in South Carolina. The Feb. 29 primary is the first contest in the South on the 2020 election calendar and serves as an important gauge of black support.\\n\\nSanders has generated enthusiasm from younger black voters in South Carolina. That could help him avoid a repeat of his dismal showing in the 2016 primary, when African Americans overwhelmingly backed Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nSteyer, meanwhile, is flooding the South Carolina airwaves with millions of dollars in ads, building a robust staff and making numerous visits, including on Sunday and Monday, while Biden and others are in New Hampshire. The approach appears to have paid off: His support grew significantly in a Fox News poll last month, consistent with a steady momentum of endorsements that began in the final weeks of 2019.\\n\\nSteyer is also seizing on Biden's fourth-place finish in last week's Iowa caucuses to undermine Biden's argument that he is best positioned to defeat President Donald Trump. That's important because many black voters in South Carolina have said they would back Biden because they view him as the most electable candidate in a crowded field.\\n\\nThe presumptive front-runner who was leading in the national polls by 20 or something at one point, basically had a really bad night, Steyer told The Associated Press. That means that his firewall in South Carolina doesn't exist. That means that really this race is going to come down to who can build a national, diverse coalition.\\n\\nBiden was on top in a January Fox News survey of South Carolina voters and polling suggests his standing among black voters remains steady. He has compiled the most endorsements from black lawmakers and other officials, and he's tied with Sanders for the most supporters among the state's Legislative Black Caucus.\\n\\nBut with his Iowa disappointment and the middling results expected in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, Biden probably will need a commanding victory by the time the Democratic contest reaches South Carolina. Any shifts in voter sentiment could narrow a hoped-for win or, in a nightmare scenario, relegate him to second place, threatening the viability of his campaign.\\n\\nWith three weeks to go, there are warning signs.\\n\\nThe campaign was caught off guard in January when Dalhi Myers, a Columbia lawyer who is vice chair of the Richland County Council, switched her support from Biden to Sanders.\\n\\nWhat's best for all of us is electrifying enough people … who will go to the polls, said Myers, who is black. I don't think honestly that Joe Biden can electrify the 400,000 African Americans in the state of South Carolina.\\n\\nTravis Lincoln, a 44-year-old from Charleston, attended Biden's first rally in Columbia last May and said he was all in for the former vice president. But as the primary approaches, Lincoln said he has shifted his backing to tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.\\n\\nAlthough I have enormous respect for Biden, I have been disappointed in his lack of empathy on issues such as assistance for veterans or a criminal justice overhaul, Lincoln said. I've grown weary of politicians. The same old formula will not defeat Trump.\\n\\nBefore a Steyer town hall in Hartsville last month, 19-year-old Coker College student Alexis Schaub said she liked the activist's focus on climate change and felt his campaign was an honest effort to appeal to South Carolinians.\\n\\nHe feels genuine, Schaub said. I don't want someone that I don't really think I can trust.\\n\\nState Rep. Ivory Thigpen, a member of the Legislative Black Caucus who has endorsed Sanders, said Sanders is the only candidate who has made genuine strides to foster substantive connections within South Carolina's black voters instead of relying on past support.\\n\\nThe African American vote cannot be taken for granted, said Thigpen. Just the idea that we are a firewall, that our vote is already cemented. … I won't go so far as to say it's offensive, but I think it might be misconceived.\\n\\nBiden's aides remain confident in his chances in South Carolina. Paige Hill, Biden's South Carolina spokeswoman, said, We've always known that the results of the first early voting states were not going to determine what happens here.\\n\\nAnd at the end of the day, no one in this race can or should win the nomination without proving they have sweeping support from African American voters, she said. Vice President Biden is the only candidate who has already done so.\\n\\nStill, the emerging skepticism is frustrating for a candidate who views his ties to the black community — built over decades in the Senate, and solidified by serving as the No. 2 to the first black president, Barack Obama — as a central pillar of his candidacy.\\n\\nBiden's standing in South Carolina has long gone unquestioned, so much so that two prominent black candidates — Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey — dropped out of the race in part because Biden's strength in the state created insurmountable barriers.\\n\\nThe campaign is beginning to make some moves, announcing a shake-up of its senior ranks last week. Biden emphasized the importance of diversity in the Democratic Party during weekend campaign events. In an interview with ABC's This Week that aired Sunday, he took particular aim at Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, for failing to attract black voters.\\n\\nHe hasn't been able to unify the black community, Biden said of Buttigieg, who essentially tied for first place in Iowa with Sanders.\\n\\nStill, Biden is being outspent and sometimes outmaneuvered by rivals with deeper pockets.\\n\\nWhile Biden was in overwhelmingly white New Hampshire on Saturday, billionaire Michael Bloomberg was courting black voters in Alabama, which is among the states that vote on Super Tuesday in early March. Bloomberg toured the late Martin Luther King Jr.'s church, spoke at a Democratic party luncheon and held a rally at Alabama State University, a historically black college and university.\\n\\nSanders has made a $5.5 million ad buy in states that include South Carolina. Steyer has hired the chair of South Carolina's Legislative Black Caucus to serve as an adviser, a $10,000-per-month gig that drew criticism among those who found it curious that a campaign would be paying a state lawmaker while receiving his endorsement.\\n\\nA challenge for Biden is that he and his campaign has spent months raising expectations for South Carolina, in part to offset losses they anticipated in states that vote earlier and are less diverse. Biden has argued that his campaign would essentially begin in South Carolina, where a win would propel him into the clutch of states that vote in March where black and Latino voters will be key.\\n\\nPeople talk about South Carolina being a firewall, Biden told the AP in October. I kind of view South Carolina being a diving board. It's going to catapult me into the Super Tuesday areas that are a lot of the South, from Georgia to Texas to Florida, across the board.\\n\\nHis supporters say this strategy is still workable.\\n\\nState Sen. Marlon Kimpson, a member of the Legislative Black Caucus who has endorsed Biden, said he was a little disappointed in Biden's Iowa finish but was confident in a strong result in the state Biden needs the most.\\n\\nPeople are still fired up for Joe Biden, said Kimpson, who on Friday said he attended an NAACP meeting where energy for Biden was high. When I walked through through the office, folks were high-fiving me, for having given my endorsement. I've seen no one who is despondent.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAssociated Press writer Sara Burnett in Montgomery, Alabama, contributed to this report.\\n\\n__\\n\\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP\\n\\n___\\n\\nCatch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, Ground Game."}

{"original": "Tariffs are taxes on consumers is a popular mantra among critics of the Trump administration's trade policies.\\n\\nBut it is hard to support based on price data released in the months since the Trump administration began imposing tariffs on imported steel, aluminum, and nearly half of goods imported from China.\\n\\nIn the October through December period alone, the U.S. Treasury collected $8 billion in tariffs, 83 percent more than it did a year earlier. But consumer prices have barely budged. The Department of Labor's consumer price index was just 1.9 percent higher in December than it was a year ago and on a month-t0-month basis, prices actually fell.\\n\\nExcluding volatile food and energy doesn't change the picture very much because core inflation was also very low. Core CPI climbed just 0.2 percent for the month, exactly as it had a month earlier, and is up 2.2 percent from a year ago. That is in-line with November's 2.2 percent, October's 2.1 percent and September's 2.2 percent 12-month increases. The Federal Reserve says it targets inflation of 2 percent.\\n\\nIf tariffs were acting as taxes on consumers prices would be higher. At the very least, prices on items subject to tariffs would be higher.\\n\\nYet prices of most items subject to the metals and China tariffs have either declined or advanced on pace with or slower than inflation and wages. In other words, prices for most tariff impacted items fell in inflation-adjusted terms. Only major appliance prices are clearly showing evidence of tariff pressure.\\n\\nSteel and Aluminum Consumer Goods\\n\\nTake the price of soup and beer. Breitbart News has been closely following the prices of soup and beer ever since Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross confronted critics of tariffs back in March on CNBC while holding up a can of Budweiser and a can of Campbell's soup. The prices of these items, Ross argued, would hardly be affected at all by the 10 percent tariff on aluminum. Critics had argued that the rising the price of the metal would win up pinching consumers by raising prices in the grocery aisle.\\n\\nThe price of soup rose 2.5 percent in December, a large month over month increase. But this is a very volatile category on a monthly basis, thanks in part to seasonal adjustments. In the prior two months, soup prices fell 1.7 percent and rose 1.4 percent. Without adjustments, soup prices rose just 1.6 percent from November. But more importantly, prices of soup at home–largely canned soup–are down 1.4 percent compared with a year ago. No tariff pressure there.\\n\\nOne reason soup may have jumped in December is that vegetable prices were up sharply. Fresh vegetable prices were up 2.6 percent for the month and 4.6 percent compared with a year ago. This pushed up prices on canned fruits and vegetables, another category of consumer goods that was widely predicted to see prices rise because of increased aluminum costs, by 1.5 percent. That reversed two months of monthly declined. Compared with a year ago, this category's prices are up 3.1 percent. But, as with soup, this appears to be driven not by the price of cans but what is in them.\\n\\nThe price of beer consumed at home was unchanged for the month and is up just 1.9 percent compared with a year ago. This is not all cans, of course. But since cans and bottles are close substitutes, the overall price level of beer at home is the relevant category. (And the only one the government tracks.) If canned beer were rising but bottled beer were falling by equivalent amounts, keeping the overall price category unchanged, consumers would be no worse off.\\n\\nThe upward pricing pressure on beer consumed in bars and restaurants, which was notable because the price of beer kegs has reportedly gone up because of the aluminum tariffs, is no longer showing up. Beer consumed prices outside out the home are up just 2.2 percent compared with a year ago, a deceleration from the 2.6 percent recoreded in November. For the month, the price of beer consumed outside of the home was flat.\\n\\nCar and truck prices also show no signs of tariff-driven inflation. Prices of new cars fell a seasonally adjusted 0.2 percent in December and are up just 0.2 percent for the year. That's another deceleration in price gains, down from a 0.8 percent annual gain in November and a 1.2 percent annual gain October. The price of new trucks was flat in December, November, and fell after in both October and September. Compared with a year ago, truck prices are down 0.7 percent, a substantial acceleration of deflation from the 0.1 percent annual decline recorded in November.\\n\\nConsumer Technology and Other Imports\\n\\nMany of the categories of consumer goods that are largely manufactured abroad also saw steep declines.\\n\\nTools and hardware continue to defy the tariffs are taxes on consumers narrative. Prices on these rose 1.6 percent in December, following a 0.1 percent decline in November and a 0.4 percent decline in October. Compared with a year ago, tools and hardware prices are up just 2 percent.\\n\\nThe cost of televisions fell again in December, dropping by a seasonally adjusted 0.8 percent. This is the fifth consecutive monthly decline for televisions. Compared with a year ago, television prices are off 11 percent. The steep drop may reflect sluggishness in the housing market since a lot of television sales accompany home purchases.\\n\\nThe price of personal computers rose 1.4 percent in December, reversing two months of declines. Compared with a year ago, they are down 3 percent. Phone prices fell again, for at least the fourth consecutive month, and are now down 11.2 percent compared with a year ago.\\n\\nEarlier this year, prices of major appliances were up sharply but this was largely driven by the steep climb in the price of laundry equipment, which in turn was driven by a specific anti-dumping tariff imposed in January of last year that were intended to drive up the price from artificially depressed levels. Those washing machine gains, however, are tapering. Prices of laundry equipment were up just 13.2 percent compared with a year earlier, down from an annual gain of 15.5 percent in November.\\n\\nAnd so, not surprisingly, the broader major appliance category is no longer seeing higher prices. On a monthly basis, prices fell 0.3 percent. Compared with a year ago, prices are up just 4.7 percent.\\n\\nMade in China 2018\\n\\nThe tariffs on Chinese-made goods also do not seem to have had much of an effect on consumer prices. Initially, these applied to $50 billion of imports from China and were largely focused on technology goods. In late September, however, the China tariffs were broadened to cover $250 billion and a wider array of consumer goods.\\n\\nThe prices of furniture and bedding, one of the largest categories of China-made imports, rose just 0.5 percent in December and are up just 1.7 percent annually. Toys, another big import category, saw prices rose 0.8 percent in December. For the year, toy prices are down 9.0 percent. Sports equipment prices rose 0.7 percent, the second monthly increase after several months of declining prices. Compared with a year ago, however, sports equipment prices are down 2.7 percent.\\n\\nClothing and shoe prices were unchanged on a seasonally adjusted basis in December and are down 0.1 percent compared with a year ago.\\n\\nAuto parts prices have not risen sharply. On a year over year basis, auto parts are up 2.2 percent and rose 0.4 percent in December. Excluding tires, however, auto parts fell 0.4 percent in December, reversing the gains of the previous three months. Ex-tires auto parts prices are now up 2.9 percent from a year ago–another slowdown in year over year prices from the steeper 3.6 percent recorded in November. It's possible that the steeper gains seen earlier were due to metals or China tariffs or both but that now seems less likely. The December decline suggests a larger role for the storms that flooded some areas of the South this fall, pushing up demand for parts as consumers repaired storm-damaged cars.\\n\\nOnce again, the consumer price data has largely demolished the notion that tariffs are squeezing consumers. That does not mean that prices will remain low or tariffs will never push prices up. It just demonstrates that they have not yet done so.\\n\\nCoupled with the news that the U.S. Treasury collected $8 billion in tariffs from October through December, however, the low prices may indicate that the burden of tariffs are falling on foreign producers. This can happen when export prices fall in reaction to tariffs, either because foreign manufacturers seek to maintain market share but discounting their goods or because foreign currencies decline against the dollar. So prices may not go up at all for U.S. consumers."}

Barack Obama\\n\\nThe bill before us will certainly do some good, said then-Senator Obama in 2006, adding that the Secure Fence Act would provide better fences and better security and that it would make headway against the tide of illegal immigration in this country.\\n\\nReal reform means stronger border security, said Obama several years later as president, during his 2013 State Of The Union.\\n\\nIndependent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost one trillion dollars in the next two decades, said Obama during his 2014 State Of The Union, bringing up his alleged concern about stopping illegal immigration once again.\\n\\n2.

Bill Clinton\\n\\nA decade earlier, Hillary Clinton's husband and then-president Bill Clinton affirmed his own beliefs that illegal immigration should be stopped in his 1995 State Of The Union, stating that all Americans were right to be disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering [the United States], adding that illegal aliens impose burdens on [U.S.] taxpayers.\\n\\n4. Chuck Schumer\\n\\nSchumer, who also voted in favor of the Secure Fence Act, elaborated on his pro-border security stance a few years later in a speech at the Georgetown University Law Center, in which the senator told his audience that referring to illegal aliens as undocumented is unacceptable.\\n\\nIllegal immigration is wrong, plain and simple, said Schumer, When we use phrases like 'undocumented workers,' we convey a message to the American people that their government is not serious about combatting illegal immigration, which the American people overwhelmingly oppose.\\n\\nIf you don't think it's illegal, you're not going to say it. I think it is illegal, and wrong, and we have to change it, added the senator.\\n\\n5.

{"original": "In this time of coronavirus and social distancing, simple questions have suddenly become complex\\n\\nNEW YORK (AP) — Can my kids go on a play date? Is it OK if I visit the gym?\\n\\nIn this time of coronavirus, once-easy questions have suddenly become complex.\\n\\nHere are some questions and answers about the social distancing efforts to slow the epidemic in the U.S.\\n\\nWHAT IS SOCIAL DISTANCING?\\n\\nSocial distancing are practices implemented by public health officials to keep contagious diseases from spreading.\\n\\nThe measures are aimed at trying to cut down the amount of virus spreading around, and ultimately protect those most vulnerable, including the elderly and people with weakened immune systems.\\n\\nWHAT MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN?\\n\\nGovernments have closed borders, and millions of workers and students have been ordered to stay home. On Monday, U.S. officials recommended that older people and those with underlying health conditions stay home and away from other people. The U.S. is also telling people not to gather in large groups.\\n\\nAnd experts also recommend people try to stay at least 6 feet (about 2 meters) away from each other.\\n\\nWHY 6 FEET?\\n\\nExperts believe the virus is mainly spread through droplets that come out of your mouth and nose. When an infected person speaks or exhales or coughs or sneezes, the droplets travel about 3 to 6 feet (1 to 2 meters) before gravity pulls them to the ground.\\n\\nThey fall pretty quickly, said Dr. Jill Weatherhead, an infectious disease expert at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.\\n\\nIt's important to try to block coughs or sneezes with a tissue or your sleeve, so as to not send those droplet flying directly toward someone nearby.\\n\\nCAN I GO OUTSIDE AT ALL?\\n\\nYes, with some exceptions. And the guidelines vary based on where you live.\\n\\nWe're not being told to stay at home and lock the doors, said Dr. Willam Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University infectious diseases expert. We're not there yet, and I don't think we'll get there.\\n\\nPeople who have coughs and sneezes should stay home as much as possible, and call ahead to the doctor's office if they're planning to get their illness checked out, he added.\\n\\nPeople who have confirmed coronavirus illness should stay home, as should those who were in close contact with a confirmed case.\\n\\nWHERE CAN I GO?\\n\\nOptions are becoming limited, with school, gym and restaurant closures in some places, and work-from-home edicts.\\n\\nOfficials in six San Francisco-area counties on Monday told nearly 7 million people to stay inside and venture out only for necessities.\\n\\nIf you live someplace without such restrictions, it's best just to use good judgment. If restaurants are open, it's OK to go to eat. But go in a small group and try to get a table away from others.\\n\\nIt's necessary to buy food. But try to go to the supermarket at times when it's less crowded, stay 6 feet away from other shoppers as much as you can, and wash your hands thoroughly when you get home.\\n\\nCAN I GO TO THE GYM?\\n\\nExercise is important. But maybe stick to the machines, wiping them down before and after you use them, and skip games of basketball or other activities that put you in close physical contact with others. If possible, cut back on the gym and go for jogs, walks or bike rides instead, experts said.\\n\\nWHAT ABOUT SOCIAL GATHERINGS?\\n\\nThe CDC on Sunday recommended that for the next eight weeks, organizers put off events that would draw at least 50 people. On Monday, the number was reduced to 10.\\n\\nThat could ice a lot of weddings, family reunions and birthday parties.\\n\\nDr. Deborah Birx, who is coordinating the federal response to the virus, said the change from 50 to 10 was influenced by research that tried to estimate the impact of different possible steps.\\n\\nA CDC official, Dr. Jay Butler, said Monday there's no hard-and-fast rule. Officials are simply trying to set a reasonable parameter to increase social distancing while not creating social isolation, he said in an interview streamed by the Journal of the American Medical Association.\\n\\nCAN I GO ON DATES? OR SEND MY KIDS ON PLAY DATES?\\n\\nThere's some debate among experts about dates and play dates.\\n\\nAdults who are not sick or considered to be at risk can still date, Schaffner said. But skip the bars, concerts and crowded theaters, and instead think about an intimate dinner at home.\\n\\nFor kids, play dates can be OK, especially if they're outside in parks and involve a small number of kids, he said. Of course, kids who are sick or who are particularly vulnerable to respiratory illness should not go, he added.\\n\\nWeatherhead had different advice, saying play dates are not recommended. Children generally have had more mild COVID-19 illnesses and therefore might spread the disease before anyone realizes they are sick.\\n\\nWILL SOCIAL DISTANCING WORK?\\n\\nIt will be tricky to prove these measures made a difference.\\n\\nTesting for the coronavirus was delayed in the U.S., but it is now starting to come online. That means a lot of new cases may be diagnosed in the coming days, as labs finally find infections that happened weeks ago.\\n\\nWe're going to see increasing (case) numbers, and that's going to be frustrating to people who are doing social distancing. But that doesn't mean social distancing isn't working Weatherhead said.\\n\\n___\\n\\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

{"original": "Two Army Green Berets are fighting for their military careers after being associated with an anonymous email that accused their commanders of lowering standards to enable more soldiers — particularly female — to graduate from its prestigious Q-course.\\n\\nThe anonymous email, signed, A concerned Green Beret, accused the leaders of the school of moral cowardice for lowering the standards, and weakening instructors' ability to discipline students as they look to get further through the pipeline.\\n\\n[The school] has devolved into a cesspool of toxic, exploitive, biased and self-serving senior officers who are bolstered by submissive, sycophantic, and just-as-culpable enlisted leaders, the email said. They have doggedly succeeded in two things; furthering their careers, and ensuring that Special Forces [are] more prolific but dangerously less capable than ever before.\\n\\nOne of the specific complaints was that the Special Forces Qualification Course (SFQC), commonly referred to as Q-course, was restructured so that there were no physical barriers to earning the coveted Green Beret.\\n\\nThe email, which was blasted out to the entire U.S. Army Green Beret force in November 2017, became known as the letter heard around the world. It was then published by a news site started by former special operations forces, and it generated stories from the Associated Press, NPR, and other major news outlets.\\n\\nMaj. Gen. Kurt L. Sonntag, the commander of John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School, which runs the course, responded at the time that the selection process before the Q-course, known as Special Forces Assessment and Selection (SFAS), has evolved into a proven, challenging process that allows the training regiment to predict whether a Green Beret candidate will be successful operationally.\\n\\nIf SFAS is correct, and we believe it is, the SFQC is not a place where high attrition rates should occur. Instead, the mission of the SFQC cadre is to train to standards, he said at the time. Sonntag also said no fundamental SF standard has been removed, but that some comments in the email warrant further evaluation.\\n\\nBut in the months since, soldiers have been quietly punished for the email, according to the two Green Berets.\\n\\nThe commander of the company of instructors was relieved around April, and later given a 15/15 on his Officer Evaluation Report, the lowest score one can get, affecting his chances for promotion, and thus, staying in the military.\\n\\nThe author of the email was given an Article 15 around June for disrespecting a general grade officer. An Article 15 is an administrative, non-judicial punishment, according to the United States Code of Military Justice, which hurts one's ability to be promoted and to stay in the military.\\n\\nNow, the two additional Green Beret instructors, Sergeant First Class Micah J. Robertson, 33, and Sergeant First Class Michael Squires, 31, say they are being punished by association.\\n\\nRobertson said in an interview that after the email was sent out, commanders put together a list of about seven suspects, including them. He said he believes they were suspected because they had previously brought up concerns during town halls with leaders that were held to solicit their feedback.\\n\\nBoth have been instructors since 2016, before Sonntag took command in June 2017, and say they have witnessed the changes.\\n\\nAlthough Micah and I had nothing to do with it, it spoke true to what's happening in the regiment. This guy Sonntag, who's basically the one who's trying to screw us over — he's trying to make his career about putting a female through the course, Squires said. He added that he did not oppose women in Special Forces, but opposed lowering the standards.\\n\\nNot only doing that, he's changed it to where the guys who are coming through the Q-course are not even the same quality of guys we had back in the day. Guys who should have been kicked out for several different things … As instructors, they took our power away.\\n\\nBoth Robertson and Squires were also served with Article 15s related to the email, as well as to an online app they started building in September 2017 named Kayu, aimed at helping travelers and veterans with similar interests connect.\\n\\nThe Article 15 accused both men of using their positions as instructors for the purposes of personal gain by sourcing information from students that had no relevance to training, or having their students sign up for the app. Robertson called that hogwash.\\n\\nRobertson and Squires rejected the Article 15 and requested a court martial — which they knew was a risky course of action, given the potential for a more severe punishment. However, they said they were so confident of their innocence they wanted to fight the Article 15s, and tell their side of the story.\\n\\nIn November, they were notified that Sonntag had decided to drop their Article 15s. They were then both sent a General Order Memorandum of Reprimand (GOMOR) — a letter of reprimand from a commander that requires zero evidence. GOMORs either stay on one's record temporarily or permanently, and if permanent, can hurt a soldier's ability to be promoted and stay in the military.\\n\\nIt's a hate letter, and you can't fight that, said Guy Womack, a military trial lawyer and analyst, about GOMORs. You can ask your commander not to put it in your permanent file…but you have no real right to due process like you do with criminal proceedings.\\n\\nHe said Sonntag likely dropped the Article 15s because he knew he would lose in a court-martial. Robertson and Squires called their bluff, and the GOMOR was a face saving measure, he said.\\n\\nUnfortunately, that's a common way to shoot someone in the back and that's what it amounts to, Womack said. I've had cases — a few of them in recent years — where the evidence was not there to convict someone of a crime, but the command believed they had done something wrong. So they say, 'We'll give you this GOMOR.' It's a common tactic.\\n\\nIn December, both Robertson and Squires received word that their GOMORs would stay on their files permanently. And just last week, both were told they were being discharged from the military within 60 days.\\n\\nBased on what? I said take it to court martial so I could have my day in my court, so I could have my voice, and give my testimony, and show how jacked up this is, and I was not given my chance to tell my side, said Squires.\\n\\nRobertson has served over 13 years in the Army, and Squires have served over 12 years. Both joined after 9/11, in 2005 and 2006, when they were 20 and 19 respectively, and have both served multiple deployments overseas. Both have three children.\\n\\nThey could care less about what we're going to do about our families and our jobs, Squires said.\\n\\nThey're even getting to the point now where they're trying to make us work very long hours just to keep a handle on us because they're worried we're going to go crazy, and they basically want us to be in the office all day long, and at the end of this, we're just going to get dropped off, out of the military, he said.\\n\\nSo I can't even go search for a job, look for a job, they're holding us, and they're just going to kick us out, no money, no paycheck, on the streets, my kids with no food, no health care, nothing, Squires added. They don't care what happens to us.\\n\\nSonntag has also come under fire for trying to punish an Army chaplain and his assistant after the chaplain said he could not conduct a marriage retreat with same sex couples due to the requirements of his chaplain-endorsing agency. Both were later exonerated.\\n\\nIt is not clear whether any of the comments in the email that Sonntag said warrant further evaluation have been addressed.\\n\\nIn response to a request for comment, U.S. Army Special Operations Command's Director of Public Affairs Lt. Col. Loren Bymer said in a statement:\\n\\nArmy Special Operations Command is predicated on high standards and character attributes that define a Soldier's service. There was not an all-inclusive investigation launched, but all allegations of misconduct were handled by commanders at the appropriate levels and adjudicated accordingly. The Special Warfare Center and School has a responsibility to ensure each soldier attending training is prepared to meet the needs of the nation now, and in the future. This includes ensuring professional instruction, consistently strenuous mental and physical standards, inclusive training, and upholding the expectation that cadre and candidates demonstrate the Army Special Operations attributes at all times.\\n\\nThe issue of standards will likely continue to be a heated topic of debate, as the military continues to integrate more women into the combat arms.\\n\\nThe Obama administration began lifting restrictions on women serving in the combat arms, and services have been slowly implementing those policies.\\n\\nThe Marine Corps, which was the most resistant, has made recent headlines for integrating a female platoon into a previously all-male battalion at Parris Island, S.C., and for its first female Marine officer graduating from the Scout Sniper Unit Leaders Course.\\n\\nAt the same time, the military is facing recruiting shortages, and an ever-increasing demand for Special Forces.\\n\\nOnly 29 percent of young Americans between 17 and 24 are eligible to meet the requirements to join the military, according to the Heritage Foundation. Only one in eight wish to serve in the military, according to the Associated Press.\\n\\nWe have some recruiting challenges, and I think the trajectory is not good over the next few years, Mark Mitchell, principal deputy assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict, said February at the 2018 Special Operations/Low Intensity Conflict Symposium, according to Military.com.\\n\\nFormer Green Beret and Ultimate Fighting Champion superstar Tim Kennedy said Army recruitment challenges hit the Green Beret force especially hard.\\n\\n[For] Special Forces specifically, we are gonna have the biggest deficit of eligible… population, to select from, he said on The Joe Rogan Experience on May 17. You have to have a certain level of intelligence, a certain level of physicality, just to be eligible for Special Forces to pick you…that pool is the smallest that has ever been in history.\\n\\nSonntag himself acknowledged those challenges shortly after taking command. He said at a symposium in November 2017 that all three of the Army Special Operations regiments are facing serious challenges in force structure changes, pipeline production, and recruiting.\\n\\nWe are currently not meeting our production numbers. The restructuring of the 85th [Civil Affairs] Brigade has created an imbalanced CA force structure. And our recruitment is down. If something doesn't change soon, we will short the operational force drastically over the next five years, he said.\\n\\nRobertson said lowering standards in order to produce more Green Berets goes against a fundamental SOF truth that every Green Beret is taught.\\n\\nThey were basically telling us to not uphold standards, said Robertson. The reason they were doing that is because they were trying to make quota…In Special Forces you don't sacrifice quality for quantity."}
{"original": "During my time at the 2016 SMITE World Championship, I had the chance to sit down with co-founder and COO of Hi-Rez Studios, Todd Harris.\\n\\nThere are a lot of people making games out there, and many of them are turning toward the burgeoning eSports arena. Aside from your community focus, what makes Hi-Rez special?\\n\\nTodd: Definitely, our focus is really community first, honestly. From, I would say, a marketing standpoint or an eSports standpoint, we think about eSports as a heart of the overall community, and I think other companies do also. What sets us apart is really how early and consistently we bring the community in during the beginning design and development phases. I would say what's more traditional right now for some other studios, is they have a vision of a game and they take it very far to a point, and then maybe they have a beta or they do a grand reveal. They have very polished art, and maybe a trailer. Our philosophy is actually to put the game product in the hand of our end users much earlier in the process, and to really use their feedback to shape the game. And that's casual users and committed users. So there's a lot of things, but that's the number one thing I think that makes us a bit different.\\n\\nHow would you parallel that to things like Steam's Early Access program? There are a lot of creators trying to put out content very early, but not many who can make it worth the investment of a player's time and money. Where's the line for you guys there?\\n\\nYeah. I mean, its very important to treat players fairly right? In any business you want to treat your consumers fairly. At this point, because we have a track record as a multi-game studio, we have many of our community members who play our games tell us that they understand our philosophy. So our main purpose with a beta is not to actually try to get money early. We do tend to monetize during the beta because it helps support the process, but I think that's really the main difference. We're, if anything, I think we tend to be a little more generous during the beta process because it's not our main focus to monetize. Our main focus is to get people who have a little skin in the game as far as money but are there committed to helping us to make the game better. And from a business standpoint, it really is a player's purchases or play time over the long term. So basically, we don't put out half-assed stuff and try to charge a lot of money for it.\\n\\nWhere do you see Hi-Rez going in the future? Obviously, we have Paladins incoming, and Jetpack Fighter just released. But what's the trajectory that you guys are looking at?\\n\\nI mean, we definitely aspire to be a multi-game studio first of all, because there are companies out there that are incredibly successful off of one game, and that's great, but we do enjoy the game development process as well, and making new things. So, we want to be a multi-game studio and we want to honestly just continue to grow a global community who enjoys our type of games, and will potentially enjoy switching off their time between multiple games of ours. If you get a little bit tired of SMITE and you want something maybe with a little different feel and a shorter match time, Paladins might appeal to you. With Jetpack Fighter we've introduced mobile, right? So, at the end of the day our goal is to build a global community of people who enjoy competitive games, and that's what we're trying to do.\\n\\nSo, you're going to stick with a competitive multiplayer focus, then?\\n\\nI think that for the next few years, I would say we're going to stay in the action multiplayer arena. It's possible down the road, I could see us doing, down the road a PvE game that was co-op or multiplayer for instance. It would be much less likely for us to do a single-player narrative game. That's not really our thing. So, online multiplayer, community-based. That's all pretty core to us.\\n\\nYou picked up the Tribes/Starsiege/Earthsiege IP. After a while, now Tribes: Ascend is starting to come back as a fan-service sort of thing. Tribes was Halo before Halo —\\n\\nTotally. Good one.\\n\\n— and it's a behemoth IP, but it's from way back. Are you guys looking at the next generation of Tribes? Do you guys see that IP as something you want to pursue?\\n\\nWe want to preserve the IP because it has a very deserved legacy. Like you said, it was Halo before Halo. It was the first game with indoor and outdoor maps. It was the first game with driveable vehicles. King of capture the flag. King of large maps. Right? It's full of so many firsts. Honestly, in the short term, our goals were pretty simple, which was, you know, work with the current player base of Tribes: Ascend, even though it's not large, but to try to keep moving the game in the direction that they want. That's really what happened with the Out of the Blue update. And then also, as we mentioned in the media thing, releasing the other games just to again kind of keep all of those names relevant to folks. And then I would say, longer term, we'd love to revisit the IP in some form, but we don't have any specific team or designers working on it right now.\\n\\nSo we can expect to see more Tribes in the future?\\n\\nYeah, Definitely.\\n\\nAre you guys interested in acquiring any other IPs?\\n\\nThose sort of things for us are very opportunistic. I wouldn't say we have a strategy of acquiring older games. Really our strategy is to make fun, action multiplayer games, and in the case of Tribes, it was just good timing and a good match with what we wanted to do. So we're not actively looking to collect other IPs, but if the right one comes along, then we'll take a look.\\n\\n[laughing] You're about to get a lot of suggestions.\\n\\nBut let's dig a little deeper on Tribes: Ascend. It was kind of a roller coaster, from launch until it was temporarily dropped. There was a lot of community drama surrounding how that was handled. How did you get there?\\n\\nSo Global Agenda, of course, was our first game, and like all of our games, it was a labor of love. It took us five years to put it out and we were – and are – incredibly proud of it. It's still probably my favorite Hi-Rez game honestly. I spent a lot of time playing it. My son still plays the game every once in a while. And I've worked on it in a more hands-on fashion as we've grown. Great game. It really was just, from a business… it was super ambitious. The amount of different types of content we tried to bundle into one brand new action MMO was very large.\\n\\nThe closest thing now would be a Destiny, but we did it with a much smaller team, and we tackled even more types of content like Agency vs. Agency territory. At the end of the day though, we were a smaller team. It was very ambitious. So from a design and team standpoint, it was great that we were so ambitious. From a business standpoint, we were in a situation where the team size that we had was difficult for it to support all the different types of content that players expect.\\n\\nThat's a lot of plates to spin.\\n\\nPvP plate. Instance PvE plate. Open zone PvE plate. AvA play. There's the raids plate. There's the double agent plate. You know what I mean? There's just so much stuff in there so what we learned are the good things where we built a technical platform; we did tackle all these different types of content, which really became seeds for future games, honestly. And we learned from a business side that hey maybe what we need to do to be more commercially successful is be more narrow but deep, in the type of game that we deliver.\\n\\nSo that was our main learning there, so as much as we love it, its unfortunate that we can't put more content out for the game, but that's kind of the table that we set. It was really just an over-ambitious scope. But what we do know is that, in order to retain players, it generally does take frequent updates from the developer. And that's where, as that small of a team, it was very challenging to try to update all the different slices. Your favorite part might have been the PvP, someone else's was PvE, someone else's was open zones, right? So, even if you tried to touch up each… It's the blessing and the challenge of Global Agenda.\\n\\nSo how did that inform Tribes: Ascend?\\n\\nIt informed Tribes because we said okay we're going to make a more focused offering. And so with Tribes, actually, from a scopes standpoint, we were much more narrow. We said we're not going to do a campaign, we're not going to do PVE. I'm sure there would be people that would like it, but it's just going to be a multiplayer game only. And so that allowed us to make the scope smaller. We were going to do a jetpack PVP game, and that would be either third or first person. We had been kind of inspired somewhat by Tribes — it was one of the inspirations of Global Agenda. So We just narrowed the scope even further. And then said, hey rather than be inspired by Tribes, let's just look into getting the IP, which is what we did — I did.\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nAnd then once we had the IP, it was a super passionate team; not a big team, 12-15 people that put that game out. And you know, I think the team executed very well. Honestly, it was a very well-crafted game.\\n\\nAnd it got pretty big.\\n\\nYeah, people probably played Tribes more than all the other previous games combined. Partly because it was free, and that made it available. The challenge with Tribes was, I would say, a little bit of a lesson for us where wee could have done a better job a little bit on the monetization. It's going to sound weird but we almost, we deliver very large updates in the beginning, rather than kind of spacing it out a little bit over time.\\n\\nBut fundamentally, I'll take you back and say kind of that after Global Agenda we divided the studio basically into thirds. Where we have one third working on Global Agenda, one third working on Tribes, and one third working on SMITE. So we had all of those going for a while we were releasing Tribes, Global Agenda, and SMITE. And it kind of just got to, again, be a financial decision where we said Tribes is… There's a very dedicated fan base but because the game is fairly niche and hard to learn, we think that unless we change the core of what it is, it's not going to grow all that much, and it's going to be tough to support a studio of our size.\\n\\nSo either we would have to downsize the studio because we couldn't pay everyone's salaries, try to change it fundamentally where it wouldn't feel like Tribes and try to grow it — but it would be more like Tribes was starting to become Call of Duty or another shooter and could have had more hit-scan and faster time-to-kill. And we didn't want to do that. So we thought alright we're going to let it kind of stay Tribes, but know that it's not going to support the business. And in order to support the business and keep paying people, we need to go all in on SMITE.\\n\\nSo why SMITE? What made you guys say, Okay, this is our next thing?\\n\\nWe will often have a small team of 3-7 people prototyping some kind. And that's what SMITE started as – a prototype of yet another mode of Global Agenda. I mentioned there was Global Agenda, Tribes, and then when we kicked off with the SMITE team there's was just a new team that was working on a new mode of Global Agenda. So we had all this stuff — we hadn't quite learned our lesson — we had all these different types of content. And then, I think it was [staff member] Ares, said let's try another mode that's kind of tower defense-like, so we literally played the Global Agenda classes, put towers in with like turrets, and you had the robot minions coming up, like all the other PvE bosses. You had a jetpack and you were defending it with a jetpack at the end.\\n\\nSo SMITE started as a Global Agenda tower defense mode?\\n\\nIt was kind of a laned map with jetpacks and robots. And we played that for about a month, and people thought it was really, really fun. And it would have been fun in Global Agenda, but that was the time we had to make a hard decision…\\n\\n…Does Global Agenda need another plate to spin?\\n\\nExactly. No. And we were seeing other games out there that were just one mode games that were doing really well. And we were like, Maybe we're working too hard or the wrong way. If a game like League of Legends or another game could have one mode and one map… So at first it started as a game mode in Global Agenda, but we thought maybe it should be its own game. It'll probably do better as its own game than underneath the umbrella of Global Agenda.\\n\\nSo that was a decision too. First decision was, Try this mode, then decision two was, Let's actually make this its own game, and decision three was, Well as long as we're making its own game, should it have a different theme? Should it be the GA IP or should we come up with something new? And that's where the idea of gods came up.\\n\\nIt was a hard decision. Because on one hand, we could put this out very quickly because we have so much Global Agenda art it could be out probably in six months or a year. Or we could do a whole new IP of gods, which we knew would take 2-3 years just to make all the art, but everyone was so excited about that theme so much that we went with gods. That was about one month in that we decided we were going to switch it to gods.\\n\\nSo you decided to go with a religious theme. It's a potentially controversial choice for a lot of reasons. Were you afraid of offending people?\\n\\nYeah, we knew that might come up honestly. I mean, really, the only place it really came up, which we also thought it might, was around the Hindu pantheon, because that's an active religion. There's one billion people that are worshiping that. But our kind of litmus test was, We think gods are compelling. We think, religion aside, if you just look at these things as works of world literature, there are inspiring stories there. And if we can find literature that shows gods battling one another, let's go for it. So that was basically it.\\n\\nSo here's the 2,000 year question: how long until players can main Jesus?\\n\\n[laughing] We have no plans to implement Jesus. We get asked that every time. People do talk about, yes, maining Jesus — but no plans. But if we ever need really crazy PR, you know…\\n\\nThe internet at large — but more specifically the controversy surrounding GamerGate and social justice — has become a perpetual rage machine of late. You haven't been immune. You've taken some heat for character designs, particularly Sol. How do you and your team react to that?\\n\\nI'd say a couple things. I'd say, one, eSports, like gaming, when done right, can bring a lot of positivity into the world. As the simplest answer, we try to highlight that positivity. First of all, eSports itself is kind of the ultimate meritocracy. Right? I mean, it doesn't care about race, religion, gender, language, right? I mean, you just compete on your merits… You don't have to be a six-foot 350-pounder to play, like in football. I mean, you just let your skills speak for themselves. So I think actually it has a lot of core athletes associated with it.\\n\\nI think you have to have a really thick skin when you're making video games. And ultimately, again we're in the business of working with our community to make something that they enjoy. So things from the outside, that aren't actually our player community don't actually bother us that much. Kind of like the new deities. I get hate e-mail for the inclusion of them. But they're not from people who would play our games, or any games. And I get more fan mail from Hindus that are like, I'm glad <whoever> is in there kicking butt!\\n\\nThe majority of the demographic we're serving is enjoying it, and so we'll continue honestly to look at comments from our actual player community, around whether the players get to enjoy it and what appeals to them. And in the same way, we need different play styles. I mean, we need enough Guardians and enough whatever else. As they start asking for more visual designs, we're going to do it. I think we've done that. I think woman characters in this event are strong warriors, not sexualized but still sexy. Amaterasu is another great new role model for the game. The new Japanese goddess will be a similar but diverse style. We do listen to the community. We don't care too much about what's outside the community.\\n\\nI noticed that SMITE doesn't represent atheism. Is there going to be a No-God? Or is that spectator mode? You're nothing, just hovering there.\\n\\n[laughs]\\n\\nThanks, I'm here all week. But let's shift gears. In your opinion, why should non-gamers be interested in the eSports scene? Why should they care about what's going on here?\\n\\nCouple things. For one, just to stay abreast of trends and culture. It clearly has arrived as a phenomenon when you have a hundred million people on Twitch every month watching other people play video games. So it validates that there's something there. Maybe a shorter way, they should… if it's not their thing, it probably is going to be their kid's thing, and from that standpoint, they should be paying attention to it.\\n\\nBut if you're not a core gamer, why should you get involved in watching something like the SMITE World Championship?\\n\\nI think the human interest stories help. We try to tell those stories. It's the same way when I watch the Olympics – I may not know or care that much about the sport, but really if there is a compelling story that shows me where the competitor came from and what adversity they overcame.\\n\\nYou know, our competitors are very similar. So I think the stories' adversity in many cases, and inspiring. Ultimately these guys aren't doing it for the money; they're doing it to be the best in the world at their passion. I think everyone can identify with that, that striving to be the best in whatever it is that you love. So I think that's the story of not only Hi-Rez and SMITE, but that eSports will begin to tell more and more to help other people relate.\\n\\nThank you for your time.\\n\\nEditor's note: Hi-Rez Studios paid for travel and lodging accommodations in attending the SMITE World Championship 2016.\\n\\nFollow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both."}

We had two quarterbacks who were capable, in my mind, of playing at a level that could get us to the Super Bowl. In case you had an injury or just your depth at that position. And I felt that we had from about the sixth game on last year, a superior position at quarterback because if Dak got nicked up, we knew we had a hot hand.\\n\\nWhile convincing Romo to stay in Dallas as a backup and pass up other lucrative opportunities to start would be quite the coup, it's also quite a change from the tune Jones used to sing. Jones used to talk about getting Romo a Super Bowl ring, and how that would solidify his legacy. Now, the mark of greatness means getting him a contract negotiation that's comfortable for all parties?\\n\\nSounds more like cabinet material rather than presidential, to be honest.\\n\\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn"}

{"original": "Wednesday on Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson Tonight, host Tucker Carlson opened the program by reacting to Sen-elect Mitt Romney's (R-UT) public critique of President Donald Trump.\\n\\nCarlson reminded viewers of Romney's path to prosperity at Bain Capital and how his exploitation of the finance-based economy had implications on real Americans. Carlson said it was indicative of the broader problem of how the ruling class is harming the country overall, which led to the election of Trump.\\n\\nTranscript as follows:\\n\\nGood evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight. Happy New Year. Newly-elected Utah senator Mitt Romney kicked off 2019 with an op-ed in the Washington Post savaging Donald Trump's character and leadership. Romney's attack and Trump's response this morning on Twitter are the latest salvos in a longstanding personal feud between the two men. It's even possible that Romney is planning to challenge Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020. We'll see. But for now, Romney's piece is fascinating on its own terms. It's a window into how the people in charge, in both parties, see our country.\\n\\nRomney's main complaint is that Donald Trump is a mercurial and divisive leader. That's true of course. Beneath the personal slights, though, Romney has a policy critique. He seems genuinely angry that Trump might pull American troops out of the Syrian civil war. Romney doesn't explain how staying in Syria would benefit America. He doesn't appear to consider that a relevant question. More policing in the Middle East is always better. We know that. Virtually everyone in Washington agrees.\\n\\nCorporate tax cuts are also popular in Washington, and Romney is strongly on board with those too. His piece throws throws a rare compliment to Trump for cutting the corporate rate a year ago. This isn't surprising. Romney spent the bulk of his business career at a firm called Bain Capital. Bain Capital all but invented what is now a familiar business strategy: take over an existing company for a short period of time, cut costs by firing employees, run up the debt, extract the wealth, and move on, sometimes leaving retirees without their earned pensions. Romney became fantastically rich doing this. Meanwhile, a remarkable number of those companies are now bankrupt or extinct. This is the private equity model. Our ruling class sees nothing wrong with it. It's how they run the country.\\n\\nMitt Romney refers to unwavering support for a finance-based economy and an internationalist foreign policy as the mainstream Republican view. He's right. For generations, Republicans have considered it their duty to make the world safe for banking, while simultaneously prosecuting ever more foreign wars. Modern Democrats generally support these goals. There are signs, however, that most people do not support this, and not just in America. In countries around the world — France, Brazil, Sweden, the Philippines, Germany, and many others — voters are suddenly backing candidates and ideas that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. These are not isolated events. What you're watching is populations revolting against leaders who refuse to improve their lives.\\n\\nSomething like this has been in happening in our country for three years. Donald Trump rode a surge of popular discontent all the way to the White House. Does he understand the political revolution he harnessed? Can he reverse the economic and cultural trends that are destroying America? Those are open questions. But they're less relevant than we think. At some point, Donald Trump will be gone. The rest of us will be too. The country will remain. What kind of country will be it be then? How do we want our grandchildren to live?\\n\\nThese are the only questions that matter. The answer used to be obvious: the overriding goal for America is more prosperity, meaning cheaper consumer goods. But is that still true? Does anyone still believe that cheaper iPhones, or more Amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from China are going to make us happy? They haven't so far. A lot of Americans are drowning in stuff. Yet drug addiction and suicide are depopulating large parts of the country. Anyone who thinks the health of a nation can be summed up in GDP is an idiot.\\n\\nThe goal for America is both simpler and more elusive than mere prosperity. It's happiness. There are a lot of ingredients in being happy: Dignity. Purpose. Self-control. Independence. Above all, deep relationships with other people. Those are the things that you want for your children. They're what our leaders should want for us, and would if they cared. But our leaders don't care. We are ruled by mercenaries who feel no long-term obligation to the people they rule. They're day traders. Substitute teachers. They're just passing through. They have no skin in this game, and it shows. They can't solve our problems. They don't even bother to understand our problems.\\n\\nOne of the biggest lies our leaders tell is that you can separate economics from everything else that matters. Economics is a topic for public debate. Family and faith and culture, those are personal matters. Both parties believe this. Members of our educated upper-middle-classes, now the backbone of the Democratic Party, usually describe themselves as fiscally responsible and socially moderate. In other words, functionally libertarian. They don't care how you live, as long as the bills are paid and the markets function. Somehow they don't see a connection between people's personal lives and the health of our economy, or for that matter, the country's ability to pay its bills. As far as they're concerned, these are two totally separate categories.\\n\\nSocial conservatives, meanwhile, come to the debate from the opposite perspective, but reach a strikingly similar conclusion. The real problem, you'll hear them say, is that the American family is collapsing. Nothing can be fixed before we fix that. Yet, like the libertarians they claim to oppose, many social conservatives also consider markets sacrosanct. The idea that families are being crushed by market forces seems never to occur to them. They refuse to consider it. Questioning markets feels like apostasy.\\n\\nBoth sides miss the obvious point: culture and economics are inseparably intertwined. Certain economic systems allow families to thrive. Thriving families make market economies possible. You can't separate the two. It used to be possible to deny this. Not anymore. The evidence is now overwhelming. Consider the inner cities. Thirty years ago, conservatives looked at Detroit or Newark and were horrified by what they saw. Conventional families had all but disappeared in poor neighborhoods. The majority of children were born out of wedlock. Single mothers were the rule. Crime and drugs and disorder became universal. What caused this nightmare? Liberals didn't want to acknowledge the question. They were benefiting from the disaster, in the form of reliable votes. Conservatives, though, had a ready explanation for inner city dysfunction: big government. Decades of badly-designed social programs had driven fathers from the home and created what they called a culture of poverty that trapped people in generational decline.\\n\\nThere was truth in what the conservatives said. But it wasn't the whole story. How do we know? Because virtually the same thing has happened decades later to an entirely different population. In many ways, rural America now looks a lot like Detroit. This is striking because rural Americans don't seem to have much in common with people from the inner city. These groups have different cultures, different traditions and political beliefs. Usually they have different skin colors. Rural people are white conservatives, mostly. Yet the pathologies of modern rural America are familiar to anyone who visited downtown Baltimore in the 1980s: Stunning out of wedlock birthrates. High male unemployment. A terrifying drug epidemic.\\n\\nTwo different worlds. Similar outcomes. How did this happen? You'd think our ruling class would be interested in knowing the answer. Mostly they're not. They don't have to be. It's easier to import foreign labor to take the place of native-born Americans who are slipping behind. But Republicans now represent rural voters. They ought to be interested. Here's a big part of the answer: male wages declined. Manufacturing, a male-dominated industry, all but disappeared over the course of a generation. All that remained in many areas were the schools and the hospitals, both traditional employers of women. In many places, women suddenly made more than men. Before you applaud this as a victory for feminism, consider the effects. Study after study has shown that when men make less than women, women generally don't want to marry them. Maybe they should want to, but they don't. Over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out of wedlock births, and all the familiar disasters that follow: more drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed in the next generation. This isn't speculation, or propaganda from the evangelicals. It's social science. We know it's true. Rich people know it best of all. That's why they get married before they have kids. That model works. Increasingly, marriage is a luxury only the affluent in America can afford.\\n\\nAnd yet, and here's the bewildering and infuriating part, those very same affluent married people, the ones making virtually all the decisions in our society, are doing pretty much nothing to help the people below them get and stay married. Rich people are happy to fight malaria in Congo. But working to raise men's wages in Dayton or Detroit? That's crazy.\\n\\nThis is negligence on a massive scale. Both parties ignore the crisis in marriage. Our mindless cultural leaders act like it's still 1961, and the biggest problem American families face is that sexism is preventing millions of housewives from becoming investment bankers or Facebook executives.\\n\\nFor our ruling class, more investment banking is always the answer. They teach us it's more virtuous to devote your life to some soulless corporation than it is to raise your own kids. Sheryl Sandburg of Facebook wrote an entire book about this. Sandburg explained that our first duty is to shareholders, above our own children. No surprise there. Sandburg herself is one of America's biggest shareholders. Propaganda like this has made her rich. What's remarkable is how the rest of us responded. We didn't question why Sandburg was saying this. We didn't laugh in her face at the pure absurdity of it. Our corporate media celebrated Sandburg as the leader of a liberation movement. Her book became a bestseller: Lean In. As if putting a corporation first is empowerment. It's not. It's bondage. Republicans should say so.\\n\\nThey should also speak out against the ugliest parts of our financial system. Not all commerce is good. Why is it defensible to loan people money they can't possibly repay? Or charge them interest that impoverishes them? Payday loan outlets in poor neighborhoods collect 400 percent annual interest. We're ok with that? We shouldn't be. Libertarians tell us that's how markets work: consenting adults making voluntary decisions about how to live their lives. OK. But it's also disgusting. If you care about America, you ought to oppose the exploitation of Americans, whether it's happening in the inner city or on Wall Street.\\n\\nAnd by the way, if you really loved your fellow Americans, if it would break your heart to see them high all the time. Which they are. A huge number of our kids, especially our boys, are smoking weed constantly. You may not realize that, because new technology has made it odorless. But it's everywhere. That's not an accident. Once our leaders understood they could get rich from marijuana, marijuana became ubiquitous. In many places, tax-hungry politicians have legalized or decriminalized it. Former Speaker of the House John Boehner now lobbies for the marijuana industry. His fellow Republicans seem fine with that. Oh, but it's better for you than alcohol, they tell us. Maybe. Who cares? Talk about missing the point. Try having dinner with a 19-year-old who's been smoking weed. The life is gone. Passive, flat, trapped in their own heads. Do you want that for your kids? Of course not. Then why are our leaders pushing it on us? You know the reason. Because they don't care about you.\\n\\nWhen you care about people, you do your best to treat them fairly. Our leaders don't even try. They hand out jobs and contracts and scholarships and slots at prestigious universities based purely on how we look. There's nothing less fair than that, though our tax code comes close. Under our current system, an American who works for a salary pays about twice the tax rate of someone who's living off inherited money and doesn't work at all. We tax capital at half of what we tax labor. It's a sweet deal if you work in finance, as many of the richest people do. In 2010, for example, Mitt Romney made about $22 million dollars in investment income. He paid a federal tax rate of 14 percent. For normal upper-middle-class wage earners, the federal tax rate is nearly 40 percent. No wonder Romney supports the status quo. But for everyone else, it's infuriating. Our leaders rarely mention any of this. They tell us our multi-tiered tax code is based on the principles of the free market. Please. It's based on laws that Congress passed, laws that companies lobbied for in order to increase their economic advantage. It worked well for those people, but at a big cost to everyone else. Unfairness is profoundly divisive. When you favor one child over another, your kids don't hate you. They hate each other. That happens in countries too. It's happening in ours, probably by design. Divided countries are easier to rule. Nothing divides us like the perception that some people are getting special treatment. In our country, some people definitely are. Republicans should oppose that with everything they have.\\n\\nWhat kind of country do you want to live in? A fair country. A decent country. A cohesive country. A country whose leaders don't accelerate the forces of change purely for their own profit and amusement. A country you might recognize when you're old. A country that listens to young people who don't live in Brooklyn. A country where you can make a solid living outside of the big cities. A country where Lewiston, Maine seems almost as important as the west side of Los Angeles. A country where environmentalism means getting outside and picking up the trash. A clean, orderly, stable country that respects itself. And above all, a country where normal people with an average education who grew up no place special can get married, and have happy kids, and repeat unto the generations. A country that actually cares about families, the building block of everything.\\n\\nWhat will it take a get a country like that? Leaders who want it. For now, those leaders will have to be Republicans. There's no option at this point. But first, Republican leaders will have to acknowledge that market capitalism is not a religion. Market capitalism is a tool, like a staple gun or a toaster. You'd have to be a fool to worship it. Our system was created by human beings for the benefit of human beings. We do not exist to serve markets. Just the opposite. Any economic system that weakens and destroys families isn't worth having. A system like that is the enemy of a healthy society.\\n\\nInternalizing this won't be easy for Republican leaders. They'll have to unlearn decades of bumper sticker-talking points and corporate propaganda. They'll likely lose donors in the process. Libertarians are sure to call any deviation from market fundamentalism a form of socialism. That's a lie. Socialism is a disaster. It doesn't work. It's what we should be working desperately to avoid. But socialism is exactly what we're going to get, and soon, unless a group of responsible people in our political system reforms the American economy in a way that protects normal people.\\n\\nIf you want to put America first, you've got to put its families first."}

He is far from the only one shocked by the decision. De Blasio's own people have called him out.\\n\\nHe went to the f–king gym? Jesus! said a former staff member. Another told the Post, every New Yorker's regular routine has been put on hold. His should be, too. Get to work. Set an example. This is embarrassing. Yet another questioned his unwillingness to adhere to CDC guidelines, telling the paper:\\n\\nDidn't the CDC recommend no gatherings of 50 people or more? … Will he be counting the amount of people there and leaving if it's over 49? If we're supposed to be social distancing, then what does that even mean if he gets to play by his own rules? Leaders are supposed to set by example. What kind of example does this set? Also, why is he at the gym and not hunkered down 24/7 working on this? It's a pandemic, and people are dying. Stunning. How many people have to die before he stops getting chauffeured to the gym is my question. What's the appropriate number of deaths before he finds it uncouth?\\n\\nDe Blasio's press secretary, Freddi Goldstein, defended the mayor's risky decision. The YMCA has been a huge part of his and his family's life, like it has been for a lot of New Yorkers. It's clear that's about to change and before that, the mayor wanted to visit a place that keeps him grounded one last time, Goldstein said. That doesn't change the fact that he is working around the clock to ensure the safety of New Yorkers. After today, gyms will close and he will no longer be visiting the YMCA for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nAfter his 12-mile trip to his favorite gym, de Blasio finally decided it was time to make sure the children of New York had adequate protection. It is time to take more drastic measures, de Blasio said during an update at City Hall Sunday evening, announcing that schools would be closed until at least April 20. This is a decision I have taken with no joy whatsoever.\\n\\nBut NYC Council Member Keith Powers implored de Blasio to live by his own words. As elected officials, we're expected to lead and set an example for the public, he wrote. We're in a public health crisis, where gyms and restaurants are closing. Our message to everyone is to stay home. Mr. Mayor, we need you to lead by example."}

And there is some upside to having somebody who's a little unpredictable.\\n\\nBrooks said, The question what's next strikes me as a secondary question. The primary question is, what are we going to do about chemical warfare? A hundred years ago, right now, World War I was going on, and there were people were being gassed in the trenches. And the fact that the world community has basically tried to eliminate chemical weapons since that time strikes me as a great achievement.

So, I think it was incumbent upon the US to do something when chemical weapons were used.\\n\\nHe continued, Does this signal some grand change of strategy in the Middle East? I sort of doubt it. But at least we set this precedent on this particular issue. Now, the question –, I think it was probably totally impulsive of President Trump to do this. He's an impulsive person, and we're stuck the downsides of his impulsivity. But there are upsides to having an impulsive president because nobody in the world, and especially in places like North Korea, quite knows what's going to happen.

{"original": "BIRKENAU, Poland — President Reuvin Rivlin of Israel and President Andrzej Duda of Poland led 15,000 participants in the 30th annual March of the Living along the road from Auschwitz to Birkenau in a striking gesture of solidarity between the two nations.\\n\\nThe leaders marched together along the three-kilometer stretch, alongside Israel's former Chief Rabbi Israel Meir Lau — himself a Holocaust survivor, liberated by the Americans at Buchenwald.\\n\\nIn the weeks leading up to the march, debates raged over a new Polish law that makes it illegal to accuse Poland of complicity in the Holocaust. Jewish leaders and the Israeli government criticized the measure.\\n\\nAs Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, told Breitbart News during the march, You can't change history. Some Poles saved Jews, some did nothing, and some collaborated.\\n\\nBut Danon, like his government, was also quick to stress the ties that bind the two nations together. He emphasized the strong relations between the two countries at the United Nations, where Poland often votes in support of Israel.\\n\\nAlong the route, the two heads of state spoke frequently, together with Rabbi Lau.\\n\\nSmall crowds gathered along the route, waving Polish and Israeli flags.\\n\\nOne survivor, Edward Mosberg, carried a Polish flag — a deliberate choice, his family said, to emphasize that Poles had also suffered in the concentration camps.\\n\\nThe marchers came from dozens of countries, including some with no sizable Jewish population, like Japan.\\n\\nIt's something I wanted to do all my life, said Karine Carmona, 41, of Montevideo, Uruguay.\\n\\nThe marchers finally reached the entrance to Birkenau, the portal through which so many went to their deaths.\\n\\nHolocaust survivor Shmuel Bogler, 88, told Breitbart News that he was participating in his third March of the Living.\\n\\nDuring the Second World War, he was taken to Auschwitz from Hungary, then later transferred to a work camp and survived a death march across two months and five days until reaching Buchenwald, where he was later liberated.\\n\\nAt the end of the march, participants held a formal memorial ceremony in the plaza that lies between two of Buchenwald's demolished crematoria.\\n\\nMosberg told the assembled marchers that each of them was now a witness to what had happened there, nearly a lifetime ago.\\n\\nDr. Shmuel Rosenman, chairman of the March of the Living, challenged those present to turn tears into action, declaring: We must stand up and oppose evil, racism, and discrimination.\\n\\nIt fell to President Rivlin to tackle the controversy with Poland. Addressing President Duda, he said (in Hebrew): It was not the Poles who created the death camps, but our people were not just killed in camps, alluding to anti-Jewish pogroms in some Polish towns that occurred even after the war. He noted that Nazism would not have succeeded in Europe had antisemitism not created the fertile ground for the war's atrocities.\\n\\nPresident Duda responded by stressing Poland's historical warmth toward Jews. He noted that the nearby town for which the concentration camp was named, Osweicim, was once a place where Jews and Poles lived together. Jews had also sought refuge in Poland from persecution elsewhere. It was Nazi Germany, he said, that imposed the system of ghettos and camps. And many Poles helped rescue Jews, and tried to warn the world about the Holocaust.\\n\\nToday, Duda said, it was Poland's mission to spread the truth about the Holocaust throughout the world.\\n\\nRabbi Lau had the last word. He thanked the Polish government for helping organize the March for the past 30 years, but also said that the Polish people would have to find out the truth about the collaboration of some Poles in the Holocaust, sooner rather than later.\\n\\nPoles had been the greatest nation in helping Jews during the Holocaust, he said. We will never deny it! But we want you not to deny other things.\\n\\nThe day concluded with the singing of traditional Jewish prayers for the dead, and the singing of Hatikvah, Israel's national anthem.\\n\\nJoel B.

{"original": "The number of drug deaths dropped sharply in 2018 after 28 years of rising casualties, and Americans' life expectancy also reversed its decline, rising by one month to 78.7 years, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\nThe drop in drug deaths saved roughly 2,900 lives, and it follows a massive death spike under President Barack Obama, whose progressive deputies did little to discover or curb the massive spike in deaths from opioids and fentanyl shipped from Mexico and China. The age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths increased … by 2% per year from 2006 through 2013, and by 14% per year from 2013 through 2016, the CDC reported.\\n\\nA March 2019 report by the Washington Post said:\\n\\nIn May 2016, a group of national health experts issued an urgent plea in a private letter to high-level officials in the Obama administration. Thousands of people were dying from overdoses of fentanyl — the deadliest drug to ever hit U.S. streets — and the administration needed to take immediate action. The epidemic had been escalating for three years. The fentanyl crisis represents an extraordinary public health challenge — and requires an extraordinary public health response, the experts wrote to six administration officials, including the nation's drug czar and the chief of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The administration considered the request but did not act on it.\\n\\nUnder President Donald Trump, the death toll has dropped by 4.5 percent — or roughly 2,900 lives per year — amid a growing economy that is pulling sidelined Americans back into jobs. That gain is aided by Trump's rejection of business demands for more migrants, and his increased actions against drug smuggling from Mexico and China. The partial recovery is showcased by a January 30 report in the New York Times:\\n\\nIt's literally like coming out of a fog, said Andrew Wright, 34, who has been drug-free since August 2018, when he entered treatment at the Counseling Center in Portsmouth, Ohio. Medicaid, the government insurance program, covered his care. It's like I'm 22 and I've finally made it out of my parents' house, embracing life for the first time. I'm learning how to live. … … he has now stayed off drugs for the longest period in his adult life, he said, a fact he attributes to his treatment program together with a change in the attitudes of the people in his town. A small grooming products company, Doc Spartan, hired him to make beard oil and grenade-shaped soap. Someone sold him a cheap car. Others helped him start sorting out his life — getting driver's license, dealing with his unpaid bills and getting treatment for hepatitis C. I literally feel like I'm a soldier in this war, and I really like it, said Mr. Wright, who now works as a trainer at PSKC, a CrossFit gym, and at a halfway house.\\n\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported January 29:\\n\\nIn 2018, the age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths in the United States was 4.6% lower than the rate in 2017. In 2018, there were 67,367 drug overdose deaths in the United States (Figure 1), 4.1% fewer deaths than in 2017 (70,237).\\n\\nThe death toll fell in several midwest states which had been hit hard by outsourcing and free trade:\\n\\nThe drug overdose death rate was lower in 2018 than in 2017 for 15 jurisdictions: Alaska, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Wisconsin (Figure 2). The drug overdose death rate was higher in 2018 than in 2017 for 5 states: California, Delaware, Missouri, New Jersey, and South Carolina.\\n\\nBut the good news is mixed with bad news:\\n\\nIn 2018, the states with the highest age-adjusted drug overdose death rates were West Virginia (51.5 per 100,000 standard population), Delaware (43.8), Maryland (37.2), Pennsylvania (36.1), Ohio (35.9), and New Hampshire (35.8).\\n\\nThe death rate from synthetic opioids — such as fentanyl — grew slower than in prior years, while the deaths from heroin and opioids fell:\\n\\nBetter cancer treatments also saved many lives and to extend lifespans to 78.7 years, according to the CDC. The New York Times reported:\\n\\nImprovements in cancer mortality rates represented the single largest share of the life expectancy gain in 2018, about 30 percent. Next came the decline in so-called unintentional injuries, which include deaths from car accidents and drug overdoses. That category accounted for about 25 percent of the gain, a change that was driven almost entirely by a decline in drug deaths …\\n\\nBut life expenctancy remains below the 2014 peak, according to a January 30 report in the Washington Post:\\n\\nA decline in the death rate from cancer is the single largest driver of the small increase in life expectancy, the CDC reported. Five of the other nine leading causes of death also showed declines in death rates, including the top cause, heart disease, as well as unintentional injuries (which include overdoses), chronic lower respiratory diseases, stroke and Alzheimer's disease. Two more, diabetes and kidney disease, were essentially unchanged. Deaths from suicide and influenza and pneumonia increased.\\n\\nDespite the encouraging elements of the CDC mortality report, the broader pattern for American health remains sobering. Life expectancy improved by the tiniest of increments, from 78.6 to 78.7 years. That figure remains lower than the peak in U.S. life expectancy, at 78.9 years, in 2014. … It's good news that there was an increase in life expectancy. That's what we want to see, but it doesn't really alter the long-term picture. We still have a very bleak situation at this point, said Steven H. Woolf, director emeritus of the Center on Society and Health at Virginia Commonwealth University. In October 2019, federal data also showed that Trump's policies have also reduced the murder rate in the United States. Nationwide, homicides spiked to 15,195 in 2016, up from 12,278 murders in 2014 when Obama and his progressive and media allies began blaming police forces for multiple episodes in which young black men were killed. Since then, Trump has ended the White House support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and the number of murders was forced down to 14,123 in 2018, according to new FBI data. The murder rate dropped by 6.8 percent from 2017 to 2018, saving more than 1,000 lives.\\n\\nThanks to our pro-worker, pro-American economic policies, unemployment is at the lowest level in more than 50 years.

{"original": "Not so long ago, prominent Democrats were insisting that voter fraud did not exist in the United States. Others conceded that it existed, but that it was so rare as to be irrelevant to the outcome of elections. Liberal media sources like U.S. News scoffed that looking for voter fraud was like going on a unicorn hunt.\\n\\nNotably, in early 2017 then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi mocked President Trump's claim that voter fraud occurred in the 2016 presidential election. She called his focus on voter fraud really strange, adding, I frankly feel very sad for the president making this claim. She asked Republicans to join her in declaring that we have confidence in our system and that we always respect the results of the election.\\n\\nShe's singing a different tune now. As Speaker of the House, she is closely watching the election dispute in North Carolina's 9th Congressional District. More than two months after the election, the outcome is still in doubt. Incumbent Republican Mark Harris leads Democrat Dan McCready in the unofficial vote count by 905 votes, but there are credible allegations that a contractor working for the Harris campaign harvested absentee ballots and failed to deliver ballots that were likely cast for McCready. The State Board of Elections declined to certify the election result in the wake of the November election, and a new Board will resume investigating the election later in January.\\n\\nBut the final decision rests with the United States House of Representatives, which can decline to seat any Member. Speaker Pelosi has suddenly developed a very keen interest in the problem of voter fraud. She recently described just how fundamental the problem of voter fraud is: This is bigger than that one seat. This is about undermining the integrity of our elections. … What was done there was so remarkable, in that that person, those entities, got away with that. Get ready for her coming conclusion that the alleged voter fraud is undeniable.\\n\\nPelosi is not the only prominent Democrat to suddenly change her attitude about voter fraud. In a poetic turn of events, Democrat Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland is the new chairman of the House Oversight Committee, which will likely conduct hearings on the matter. Cummings had this to say: When it comes to a state's electoral process I think we have to be very careful and try to allow that state to provide due process. But at the same time we cannot just turn our heads to alleged voter fraud.\\n\\nNot so long ago, Cummings was highly critical of those who focused on the problem of voter fraud. In March 2017 he met with President Trump. After the meeting, Cummings said, I told him that I thought voting fraud is all but nonexistent. Don't expect Cummings to repeat that statement again.\\n\\nThe fact is that voter fraud does exist, and it is a significant problem. Election crimes must be prosecuted wherever the evidence supports a conviction. The Heritage Foundation has been compiling a list of voter fraud convictions, not mere allegations, since approximately the 2000 election. The total is up to 1,019 and growing. Of course, convictions are just the tip of the iceberg, representing a tiny fraction of the total instances of voter fraud. Indeed, as President Trump's Commission on Election Integrity found, before it was shut down by a dozen lawsuits, a 2017 study looking at just 21 states revealed that approximately 8,400 people had double-voted in the 2016 election. It is unlikely that even one percent of those double voters will ever be convicted, because most counties don't bother to prosecute election fraud in a meaningful way.\\n\\nThe North Carolina election dispute has finally compelled Democrats to admit that voter fraud is a very real problem. Whether they are now willing to support efforts to solve the problem remains to be seen.\\n\\nKris W. Kobach served as the Secretary of State of Kansas during 2011-2019. He drafted and implemented Kansas's Photo-ID and Proof-of-Citizenship election law. His office also prosecuted multiple cases of election fraud in Kansas. An expert in immigration law and policy, he coauthored the Arizona SB-1070 immigration law and represented in federal court the 10 ICE agents who sued to stop Obama's 2012 DACA executive amnesty. During 2001-03, he served as U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft's chief adviser on immigration and border security at the U.S. Department of Justice. His website is kriskobach.com."}
{"original": "The leftist media is outraged. When I was asked on Breitbart News Daily about hijab-wearing Olympic fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad, I spoke of the larger context: They've designed special outfits… it's more of imposing Islam on the secular marketplace. Whether it's in the workplace, whether it's in the school, it's Islamic supremacism.\\n\\nIndependent Journal Review was appalled that I wasn't joining the Ibtihaj Muhammad lovefest. Mediaite claimed that I ranted and raved. Right Wing Watch piled on as well.\\n\\nWhy the fuss? Why does the media go into fifth gear on a story like that of Ibtihaj Muhammad wearing a hijab in the Olympics? Is it because a Muslim isn't slaughtering people? Isn't that Islamophobic?\\n\\nWhere are the news stories every time a Christian, Jew, Hindu, Buddhist, Mormon, Wiccan, pagan, et al picks up a tennis racket or a polo stick? Why is Ibtihaj Muhammad's hijab national and international news? And why is it news if I don't share the general enthusiasm? It seems to me that the media suffers from the soft bigotry of low expectations when it comes to Muslims: if Muslims aren't killing, it's a news story.\\n\\nIbtihaj Muhammad is being in-your-face about her hijab: she is the only Olympic fencer whose religion we will all know. And that is part of a larger agenda. None of those who excoriated me for objecting acknowledged that I was saying was true: there is a long-standing effort to impose Islam on the secular marketplace.\\n\\nAn American company, Ariens Manufacturing Company of Brillion, Wisconsin, is under attack by Islamic supremacists who are demanding that the company submit to Islamic law. Ariens got into hot water when it asked Muslim employees to pray during scheduled breaks in designated prayer rooms. Our manufacturing environment does not allow for unscheduled breaks in production. Muslims walked off their jobs, demanding that Ariens allow Muslims to leave their work station whenever they want.\\n\\nMind you, these Muslim workers don't have to pray at those times. They can make up the missed prayers later. They don't stop production lines in Iran and other Muslim countries for prayer. But here in the West, it is a way to impose Islam on the workplace, on the secular marketplace — and on their co-workers.\\n\\nA similar thing recently happened at Cargill Meat Solutions in Fort Morgan, Colorado. Despite the fact that Cargill was accommodating the vast majority of Muslim daily prayer requests by providing specially created reflection rooms, i.e., prayer rooms, 190 Muslim workers walked off the job.\\n\\nA Muslim flight attendant, Charee Stanley, claimed that she was suspended from her job with ExpressJet Airlines because she refused to serve alcohol. She filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) – and the Hamas-tied Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) jumped onto the case. Why would a devout Muslim want to be a flight attendant in the first place, when half your job is serving alcohol?\\n\\nThat was reminiscent of Samantha Elauf, the devout Muslim who sued retailer Abercrombie & Fitch because she wanted to wear the hijab on the job. She won that case and got herself a healthy cash settlement – and Abercrombie & Fitch had to change the way they do business in order to accommodate her demands. That is no doubt part of the objective here as well.\\n\\nThere are many such cases. The EEOC is suing Star Transport for rightfully terminating two Muslims who refused to do their job. If these Muslim truck drivers don't want to deliver alcohol, then they shouldn't have taken a job in which part of their duties would be to deliver alcohol. It's that simple.\\n\\nBut no, Islamic supremacists chip away at the establishment clause, and in doing so, impose Islam on the secular marketplace. They want to establish a public Muslim presence everywhere and bend rules to gain special privileges. Why Ibtihaj Muhammad? When is the media going to pay any attention to the girls who didn't want to cover up and were honor killed for it? Where is the coverage of the Muslim girls who were killed by their fathers and/or brothers for refusing to wear the hijab?\\n\\nFor the millions of women and girls forced to wear the cover-up, the adulation given to Ibtihaj Muhammad is ghastly. Instead of lauding her, why not honor the memory of\\n\\nAqsa Parvez, who was honor murdered — strangled to death by her father and brother because she didn't want to wear the hijab. Where is anyone honoring all the many, many other women and girls who have been victimized or killed for not wearing the hijab?\\n\\nLook at the energy the media expends, the lengths they go to try to discredit me. They are very afraid of me – clearly, I must frighten them immensely. They're not used to people telling the truth.\\n\\nPamela Geller is the President of the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI), publisher of PamelaGeller.com and author of The Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration's War on America and Stop the Islamization of America: A Practical Guide to the Resistance.

{"original": "Blaine amendments, borne out of 19th-century anti-Catholic bigotry, have been the constant bane of the modern education-choice movement. The amendments, currently found in the constitutions of 37 states, prohibit public funds from supporting sectarian schools.\\n\\nBlaine amendments have been at the center of legal disputes in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and elsewhere, in which leftist groups and teachers-union hacks have challenged school choice programs that allow parents to educate their children at religious schools using public funds. Thus far, supporters of school choice have experienced several setbacks, but all that could soon change.\\n\\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is considering a case that could erase Blaine amendments from the school choice debate once and for all. Teachers unions, who have used Blaine amendments as their bread-and-butter argument in dozens of cases, have a legitimate fear this ruling will spell doom for their failed system.\\n\\nAfter lawmakers enacted [education savings accounts], teachers unions and other special interests challenged their legality in court, The Heritage Foundation's Lindsey Burke wrote in October 2016. Arizona unions based their suit on the state's Blaine amendment, which prohibits public funds from flowing to religious institutions. In 2014, Arizona courts ruled in Niehaus v. Huppenthal ESAs do not violate the state constitution.\\n\\nIn Nevada, too, the state's Supreme Court ruled against the local chapter of the ACLU, which was challenging the Nevada's new ESA program on the grounds it violated the state constitution's Blaine amendment. And though, as Burke writes, both research and legal precedent … make [ESAs] well-positioned to withstand legal challenges based on Blaine amendments, the amendments continue to serve as an impediment to families accessing school choice programs in an efficient way. In Nevada, for instance, thousands of families are stuck on a waiting list as the legislature figures out a way to fund the ESA program after the state's Supreme Court declared the program (but not its funding mechanism) constitutional.\\n\\nThe very existence of Blaine amendments also seems to serve as a deterrent to attempts to establish more education choice programs, and there appears to be a positive correlation between claims of Blaine amendment violations being shot down and more states moving to propose their own forms of popular school choice programs.\\n\\nState legislators across the country are pondering education savings account measures in the wake of a split decision by the Nevada Supreme Court that upheld the constitutionality of that state's program, while killing the funding source, Watchdog.org reported in October 2016. Lawmakers in Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin are considering their own ESA programs.\\n\\n'Nevada's nearly universal ESA has set the new standard for educational choice,' Leslie Hiner, vice president of programs at EdChoice, told Watchdog.org.\\n\\nThe fact that teachers unions may soon be unable to blame Blaine spells further endangerment for their beloved (and often failing or mediocre) public schools.\\n\\nIf SCOTUS removes Blaine amendments from the arsenal of anti-school choice advocates, what will the unions and their cohorts have left? Claims that school choice drains public school funding have been disproven many times over, and parents who want to send their child to a better school—one that is not decided for them based on their ZIP code—can hardly be expected to care about financing the failed school they've chosen to abandon.\\n\\nA U.S. Supreme Court ruling finally to dismiss Blaine amendments would be a win for the whole country. We could at last do away with this bigoted measure, which has marred the constitutions of many states for decades while opening the door for the type of educational alternatives children and their families have been yearning for.\\n\\nSuch a ruling wouldn't be all bad for public schools, either. More school choice would mean greater competition and motivation for government schools to strive to their greatest potential. All public schools have to worry about is whether the private sector can do things better, and again, their fears are legitimate.\\n\\nTeresa Mull (tmull@heartland.org) is a research fellow in education policy at The Heartland Institute."}
{"original": "Former U.N. ambassador John Bolton took stock of President Trump's foreign policy on Thursday's Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow.\\n\\nThe president, during the campaign, always talked about an America First foreign policy. What he said expressly he meant by that was that American national interests have to dominate what a president does – not abstract ideas about the way the world order should look, but concentrating on threats to America and dealing with them, Bolton recalled.\\n\\nIn the case of Syria, as we've discussed before, I think a lot of people were worried that the retaliation for the chemical weapons attack was just the first step toward a much greater involvement in the Syrian conflict. Those who wanted that said there was a change of policy, and they liked it. Those who opposed it said there was a change in policy and they didn't like it, he said.\\n\\nBut, in fact, I don't really think there was a change in policy, Bolton continued. I think this was a response to the use of chemical weapons, just as we would respond if it were nuclear weapons or biological weapons. It's a threat to American national security when anybody uses weapons of mass destruction. So Trump's response – which so far, at least, has been confined to the one strike at the Syrian airbase, although obviously, it took place in Syria – was not a shift in policy on the civil war.\\n\\nThen when you look at Korea – look, this is one of the consequences of eight years of Obama's failed foreign policy. He pursued what he called 'strategic patience' vis-a-vis the North Korean nuclear program, which was nothing more than a synonym for doing nothing at all. The consequences are right before us: the North Koreans are now very close to being able to drop a ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead on a U.S. target, he said.\\n\\nI think Trump's response was entirely appropriate, he argued. I think where he has not stepped up to the plate yet, at least his administration hasn't, is the Iranian nuclear weapons program. Despite his very strong view during the campaign that the Obama nuclear deal was a debacle, just yesterday Secretary of State Tillerson signed a letter to Speaker Ryan, in compliance with the congressional reporting requirement, saying Iran was in compliance with the deal.\\n\\nBolton said this assessment of Iranian compliance was just patently false.\\n\\nNow, they say the NSC is reviewing it. They're looking at further sanctions because of Iran's terrorist activity, but there's plenty of evidence out there already publicly that Iran is violating the deal, he contended. It's not just a problem, as Tillerson said later in the day, that ultimately, the deal just delays Iran's nuclear weapon; it doesn't prevent it. It doesn't delay it, either, if they're violating it, which I think they're doing.\\n\\nMarlow highlighted Bolton's recent New York Post editorial calling for the Trump administration to name and sanction Iranian terrorists and terror-supporting institutions.\\n\\nThe Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, as its name implies, is the military wing of the Iranian theocracy, to guard the 1979 Islamic revolution there, Bolton explained. It reports directly to the supreme leader. Forget President Rouhani or the election coming up later this spring; the real ruler in Iran has always been the supreme leader, since the '79 revolution.\\n\\nThe IRGC, as it's called, is really the principal means by which the ayatollahs are trying to get a hegemony in the Middle East, through a variety of mechanisms. The Quds Force, which is really the tip of the spear, they were responsible in an earlier incarnation for the bombing of the Marine barracks in Lebanon going back to 1983. They've been killing Americans for a long time, he said.\\n\\nThe nuclear weapons program in Iran and the ballistic missile programs are under the control of the IRGC, he said. If we name them as a foreign terrorist organization, all kinds of statutory sanctions kick in. I think it will have a dramatic impact on the Iranian regime. Opponents of naming the IRGC as a terrorist organization include many in the administration who don't want to admit Iran is violating the nuclear weapons deal and who are afraid that if we name the IRGC, that Iran will pull out of the deal.\\n\\nWhat a shame if that were to happen! Bolton added sarcastically.\\n\\nThe point is, Iran's behavior has not changed at all, despite what the Obama administration said all through the negotiations: if we can just solve this nuclear program, they'll start behaving like a civilized nation. The ayatollahs have made a joke of that contention for the past now going on two years, since the deal was signed in 2015, he said.\\n\\nI think there's still hope for the Trump administration on this. Their utterly inexplicable finding that Iran is in compliance with the nuclear deal – I mean, that's kind of an embarrassment. Fred Fleitz, a former colleague of mine, has an excellent article up on the Fox News opinion website on what's wrong with that finding. I urge people to take a look at that. This has got to be stopped. Otherwise, I think it will risk embarrassing the Trump administration, given the president's very strong stand against this deal in the campaign, Bolton advised.\\n\\nHe said it was not surprising that the first mandated 90-day status report on the Iran nuclear deal from the Trump State Department would falsely declare compliance because the State Department is almost genetically incapable of saying foreign governments actually violate their treaties.\\n\\nI had this experience in arms control deals when I was in the Bush 43 State Department, Bolton recalled. I understand what Tillerson's putting up with, but you've got to stand against this because just the inertia of the people who negotiated the deal, the people who supported it, are very reluctant to admit they were wrong and that Iran, in fact, is violating it because it's a way of undercutting all of their efforts.\\n\\nThat's what political appointees and presidential appointees are designed to do, to pierce through that bureaucratic inertia and get to the truth that the Iranians are violating it on the ballistic missile side, they've violated it on the heavy water side, they've violated it on the enriched uranium limits – and that's just what's been reported publicly, he noted.\\n\\nWhat do we know, in fact, about Iranian cooperation with North Korea? Bolton asked. How much of the Iranian program is really being conducted in North Korea, where our intelligence is, unfortunately, even worse than it is inside Iran? There are a lot of questions here.\\n\\nI think it was a mistake to certify compliance, but as I say, it's exactly what the State Department did in the early Bush administration with the agreed framework with North Korea. Despite mounting evidence of North Korean violations, they kept wanting to certify that North Korea was in compliance. Eventually, we broke that. This game isn't over yet, but that first certification was a disappointment, he said.\\n\\nTurning to North Korea, Bolton said the communist nation's latest threats to unleash a super-mighty preemptive strike on the United States were standard rhetoric.\\n\\nWithin the next few days, you can expect them to say they'll unleash a 'sea of fire' across the Korean Peninsula, he predicted. They've got a whole handbook of these phrases that they use. This is how they talk before – at least we think before – they have the capability to launch ICBMs that can hit the United States.\\n\\nOur troops in South Korea are vulnerable. They've got thousands of tons of chemical weapons. South Korean civilians are vulnerable. That's why my view has long been that really the only solution to the nuclear problem in North Korea, and, in fact, the North Korean problem generally, is to reunify the peninsula. As long as this regime is in power, its irrational threats can someday actually come to fruition, with horrible consequences, he warned.\\n\\nThis regime is not going to change its behavior, he stressed. It has three times in the past 25 years made unequivocal statements it would give up its nuclear weapons program. It has violated them every time, usually before the ink was dry. That's the pattern Iran is watching. They see this: there are no consequences really for North Korea. Even in the Bush administration, the administration lifted sanctions against North Korea that now we're looking at reimposing. If this is the way North Korea behaves before they can hit the United States with a nuclear weapon, imagine how they're going to behave once they're able to.\\n\\nBolton looked at the presidential race in France, judging it very close, with several non-conventional candidates, to say the least, possibly making the two-person runoff.\\n\\nI would guess, in a year or period when political opinion polling has not been exactly accurate, it's going to be very hard to say with any certainty who comes out in the top two spots this coming Sunday. But it's possible Marine Le Pen would be one, as you correctly say, and the other would be a candidate of the extreme left actually backed by the French Communist Party. Melenchon is his name, he told Marlow.\\n\\nSo you could have a runoff between these two candidates, neither of whom obviously represents one of the major standing French political parties of the center-right or the center-left. I think that is the kind of scenario – a proto-Communist, basically, versus Marine Le Pen – where she could win. In any event, no matter who the last two are, I think that things are so volatile in France and across the European Union that while I still think it's unlikely Le Pen would win in the final round, I don't think you can discount that yet, said Bolton.\\n\\nJohn Bolton is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and head of his own political action committee, BoltonPAC.\\n\\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\\n\\nLISTEN:"}
{"original": "A Chinese official named Guan Zhaojin, formerly head of customs in the busy port city of Dalian, is under investigation for helping professional personal shoppers evade huge import tariffs and intrusive inspections for overseas purchases.\\n\\nExtra spice was added to the scandal by Guan's alleged habit of conducting sexual affairs with some of the female clients for his smuggling operation.\\n\\nAccording to the South China Morning Post, Guan was undone by his wife videotaping him confessing to his many affairs – a confession he elected to deliver clad in only his underpants. China Daily reported Guan's wife reported him to the authorities and handed over the underpants video as evidence.\\n\\nGuan claims he was already investigated and exonerated on corruption charges in September and has no fear of another investigation, but the SCMP was more downbeat about his chances, relaying a social media announcement from the port authority that new leads and online reaction concerning Guan Zhaojin's cover-up and assisting with smuggling, corruption, and bribery have come in.\\n\\nThe online reaction is presumably public grumbling over the immensely valuable advantage Guan allegedly conveyed to his clients, personal shoppers for the burgeoning Chinese upper class known as daigou:\\n\\nDaigou have thrived in recent years, as more consumers have turned to buying luxury goods and products like baby milk formula from overseas, where they are often much cheaper, due to China's heavy import tariffs of 30 per cent to 80 per cent.Daigou, who are often Chinese citizens living abroad selling to friends and trusted clients through WeChat, also act as key influencers for foreign brands among consumers, often stopping sales of a particular brand after it has encountered controversy in China. But daigou have sometimes earned a bad reputation in countries such as Australia, where their activities have led to chronic shortages of baby milk formula for local consumers.\\n\\nThe value of daigou smuggling has been estimated at over $100 million worth of luxury goods per year – possibly far over that, given high-end estimates of $100 billion in luxury goods imported to China every year – which is more than enough for the Chinese government to consider making a mournful example out of someone.\\n\\nA marquee prosecution would also be a good way for Beijing to roll out tighter controls on daigou shopping, as detailed by Caixin:\\n\\nOn Jan. 1, China's new e-commerce law — the first to directly affect daigou — came into effect. Under the new law, daigou will be required to register as e-commerce operators and acquire licenses in both China and the country where they shop, making their business subject to taxation, finance lawyer Cheng Jiuyu from Zhongwen Law Firm said. Any e-commerce platform and seller could be fined 2 million yuan and 500,000 yuan respectively — and possibly face criminal charges. It's likely to be good news for China's tax collectors, who missed out on an estimated 100 billion yuan this year, thanks to e-commerce between private individuals, according to a report from the Beijing-based Central University of Finance and Economics. This law is making an effort to regulate all e-commerce business, Cheng says. [Those daigou who didn't pay taxes] will lose their edge, and those who didn't have many clients will find it hard to survive. But it's unclear how the law will be enforced. Cheng says it's likely that customs will get stricter on undeclared parcels, and platforms like WeChat and Taobao — where many of the products are sold — may work with the authorities to avoid being held liable themselves. Daigou will have to register and truthfully declare their items, and the increased cost will be passed on to their customers. Customers' purchasing behavior will also change accordingly: They will go for sellers who have bigger platforms and better services, Cheng says. There will be a wave of bankrupt, small-time daigou. Nevertheless, he believes that some daigou may try to stick it out and ignore the law. If profits are high, some may take risks to continue their business, he says.\\n\\nThe new regulations have apparently been enough to frighten casual daigou shoppers out of the business and dramatically reduce their customer base. The Chinese government imposed those rules somewhat gingerly, with a nod and wink to let the personal shoppers and their clients know they should stock up because the good times were coming to an end.\\n\\nIf the next stage involves letting them know they will be treated as criminals and face severe punishment if they defy customs laws, the high-profile prosecution of a high-ranking customs official – served up with a dash of sex scandal – would be an effective means of sending the message."}

{"original": "Purdue University professors have presented research on rapidly charging batteries that could change the face of the electric automotive industry.\\n\\nProfessor of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Science, and Mathematics John Cushman presented new research at the International Society for Porous Media 9th International Conference in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Entitled Redox reactions in immiscible-fluids in porous media – membraneless battery applications, the report outlines a new type of battery, and the method by which it could be recharged with unprecedented speed.\\n\\nCushman called the growing worldwide sales of electric and hybrid vehicles incredible, but said that there remained strong challenges for the industry and consumer alike. Chief among those concerns is the life of a hybrid or electric vehicle's battery, and the massive infrastructure development needed to keep them charged. For drivers, it boils down to practicality. The time and effort required to keep their cars running is still an ongoing hurdle.\\n\\nPurdue Professor Eric Nauman is the co-founder, along with Cushman, of Ifbattery — a company exploring the commercial applications of their research. He highlighted the tremendous cost of developing infrastructure to handle the needed distribution and storage of the energy used by traditional electric vehicles. With Cushman and Nauman's new developments, they may have a solution: Ifbattery is developing an energy storage system that would enable drivers to fill up their electric or hybrid vehicles with fluid electrolytes to re-energize spent battery fluids much like refueling their gas tanks.\\n\\nUsing fluid electrolytes to power batteries gives them a much more accessible fuel supply. Furthermore, the spent electrolytic fuel could be collected and recharged at a wind, solar, or hydroelectric power plant. Cushman said:\\n\\nInstead of refining petroleum, the refiners would reprocess spent electrolytes and instead of dispensing gas, the fueling stations would dispense a water and ethanol or methanol solution as fluid electrolytes to power vehicles. Users would be able to drop off the spent electrolytes at gas stations, which would then be sent in bulk to solar farms, wind turbine installations or hydroelectric plants for reconstitution or re-charging into the viable electrolyte and reused many times. It is believed that our technology could be nearly 'drop-in' ready for most of the underground piping system, rail and truck delivery system, gas stations and refineries.\\n\\nWith the potential for clean, efficient, and reusable fuel, both hybrid and electric vehicles could be poised for a leap into mass consumer relevance. Backed up by higher capacity and recharging that is as easy as a stop at the gas station, we may be looking at the first truly pragmatic alternative to fossil-fueled vehicles. All that remains to be seen is whether the cost of implementation is prohibitive. If not, Purdue and Ifbattery may very well force car companies and consumers alike to take notice.\\n\\nFollow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both."}

{"original": "President Donald Trump may want to send Fed Chair Jerome Powell a belated Christmas card thanking him for backing off his hawkish stance on monetary policy.\\n\\nSpeaking on a panel in Atlanta, flanked by predecessors Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke, Powell said the Fed's monetary policy is flexible. He acknowledged the December stock market sell-off, saying central bank officials are listening carefully to financial markets.\\n\\nIt was a change of tune for Powell. Less than a month ago, Powell appeared to brush off the downturn in stocks as a little volatility.\\n\\nFriday's panel appeared to be designed to reassure markets. Powell had remarks written down on a piece of paper despite the informality of the panel setting. That seemed to indicate that he had chosen his words carefully.\\n\\nAs always, there is no preset path for policy, Powell said. And particularly with muted inflation readings that we've seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves.\\n\\nPowell also said that the Fed could be flexible on its balance sheet reduction, the unwind of the enormous pile of bonds that it accumulated through its quantitative easing program. Last month, he had desribed the balance sheet reduction as being on auto pilot.\\n\\nPowell Now vs Then: we wouldn't hesitate to make a change if we came to the view that that balance sheet normalization…was part of the problem, we wouldn't hesitate to make a change Dec 19: we would effectively have the balance sheet runoff on automatic pilot — Sara Eisen (@SaraEisen) January 4, 2019\\n\\nIt worked. Stocks rose sharply after the panel. The Nasdaq Composite, which had been down sharply on Thursday, rose by more than 4 percent.\\n\\nFriday was Powell's second attempt to reassure markets and businesses that the Fed would not go overboard in its rate hikes. In mid-December, following the Fed's decision to hike rates for the fourth time in 2019, Powell sounded somewhat less certain about future rate hikes than he had in an interview in October. That interview with Judy Woodruff is widely seen as sparking the recent stock market volatility.\\n\\nTrump has been saying for several months that he does not think the Fed should be raising rates. Trump and Fed officials have often appeared to disagree on how fast the economy should be growing. Trump wants it to grow at 3 percent or more for several years. Many Fed officials think the economy has been growing faster than its long-term potential and see their role as creating conditions for a soft-landing in which growth falls back toward 2 percent.\\n\\nBut with inflation very low despite extremely low levels of unemployment and stronger-than-expected growth, many now think the Fed should rethink its model. The economy appears to be able to grow at a faster rate and unemployment to fall further than Fed economists thought was possible without inflation getting out of control. This suggests potential growth may be greater than the Fed believed.\\n\\nPowell's comments hinted that he may be moving toward that idea–or at least to being patient and letting more evidence come in.\\n\\nWe will be prepared to adjust policy quickly and flexibly and use all of our tools to support the economy should that be appropriate, he said.\\n\\nOddly enough, Powell was asked if he would resign if Trump demanded it. He said he would not. But after Friday's comments and the market's reaction, that scenario now seems even less likely than it ever did."}

I think we did speak on this issue, it's just that we understand there's a legal framework that has to be developed first.\\n\\nRice referred to the case of Notre Dame women's basketball player Arike Ogunbowale as a perfect example of the confusing NCAA rules on athletes benefitting from their college careers. Ogunbowale was granted a waiver from the league so that she could accept payment for being on TV's Dancing With The Stars. The league quixotically claimed that her basketball career was not the reason she was asked to be on the show. Rice claimed the basis for the waiver was absurd.\\n\\nI couldn't for the life of me understand the explanation, Rice said adding, because obviously, she's there because she hit two winning shots in two basketball games (in the women's Final Four), so that's the connection.\\n\\nClearly, the rules need to be changed. However, careful thought needs to be put into the mechanics of that change, Rice said.\\n\\nPlayers have been trying to get the league to change the rules on benefitting from their likeness for some time. There were two recent federal lawsuits on the matter.\\n\\nOne was a case brought by former UCLA basketball player Ed O'Bannon who filed suit claiming that college players ought to be compensated when schools use their names and likenesses for advertising. In 2016, O'Bannon tried to get the U.S. Supreme Court to take the case, but the court refused his entreaty. The high court's move left in place a lower court ruling from 2015 that favored O'Bannon, though it was a decision that did not satisfy advocates for college athletes to make money from advertising.\\n\\nAnother suit was filed by former Arizona State quarterback Sam Keller who wanted to be compensated by a video game company for its use of his likeness and name in a video football game.

{"original": "The mispronunciation of a first name, a recycled Power Point presentation, and a toddler's taste in footwear all factored in Nike losing the NBA's biggest star to rival Under Armour.\\n\\nIn a long exploration of Nike's major mistake, ESPN's Ethan Sherwood Strauss noted the sportswear leader muffed its chance to secure Curry in its stable of big name basketball athletes through a long series of missteps that showed the company's blasé indifference to his rising star.\\n\\nSince his NBA debut as a first round, seventh overall pick in 2009, Curry has become one of the most exciting players on the hardwoods. In fact, the young North Carolinian is already being considered one of the greatest shooters of all time. He has amassed many accolades and helped lead the Warriors to the NBA Championship in 2015. Along with being the NBA's most valuable player that year he is also a three times NBA All-Star from 2014 to 2016. And that is just to start as he has a long list of achievements going back to college.\\n\\nAs to his sportswear contract, it is reported that Curry's worth to Under Armour (UA) is an amazing $14 billion.\\n\\nOn March 3, 2016, Business Insider noted that Curry has been a boon to UA. UA's U.S. basketball shoe sales have increased over 350 percent YTD. Its Stephen Curry signature shoe business is already bigger than those of LeBron, Kobe and every other player except Michael Jordan. If Curry is the next Jordan, our call will likely be wrong.\\n\\nBut as ESPN's Strauss reports, Nike had its chance to keep Curry in its stable of NBA stars and muffed the whole deal from word go.\\n\\nAs Strauss continued his report, he revealed that Nike didn't bother to offer Curry the chance to lead a training camp — something he really wanted to do — didn't give him much personal attention, delivered a Power Point presentation with Kevin Durant's name in it, and even mispronounced his name during a pitch session!\\n\\nEven after Curry announced he wanted to go with UA in 2013 Nike still had an opportunity to keep him on its team by matching the mere $4 million offer UA had given him to kick off their association. And as Strauss notes, $4 million is chump change to a company worth $16 billion.\\n\\nBy some accounts, losing Curry was one of Nike's biggest goofs. As Strauss notes, Sonny Vaccaro said, This is Nike's biggest fear. They can't overcome this in the shoe business. This is going to be detrimental to them. Psychologically.\\n\\nBut maybe Nike was never in the running in the first place. All because Curry's one-year-old toddler made the final decision.\\n\\nMy favorite story is Riley, Curry has said of his early decision process. Strauss goes on to explain, it's a few weeks before a final decision on the shoe contract must be made. At his agent Jeff Austin's house in Hermosa Beach, California, Curry surveys the array of shoes before him. He asks his baby daughter, 'Riley, which one do you like?'\\n\\nAt this point, Riley is little over 1 year old. She is presented with a Nike sneaker, an Adidas sneaker and an Under Armour sneaker. She picks up shoe one, a Nike. Threw it over her shoulder, Curry says. She picked up shoe two, threw it over her shoulder. She picked up the third shoe, walked over and handed it to me. It was the Under Armour Anatomix Spawn. So I knew right then, Curry says, smiling.\\n\\nHowever it went down, the fact remains that Steph Curry has become one of the most amazing young players in the NBA and Under Armour is laughing all the way to the bank.\\n\\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com"}

{"original": "LAS VEGAS (AP) — Bernie Sanders scored a resounding victory in Nevada's presidential caucuses on Saturday, cementing his status as the Democrats' national front-runner amid escalating tensions over whether he's too liberal to defeat President Donald Trump.\\n\\nThe 78-year-old Vermont senator successfully rallied his fiercely loyal base and tapped into support from Nevada's large Latino community as the Democratic contest moved for the first time into a state with a significant minority population.\\n\\nThe win built on Sanders' win earlier this month in the New Hampshire primary. He essentially tied for first place in the Iowa caucuses with Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who has sought to position himself as an ideological counter to Sanders' unabashed progressive politics, but was fighting for a distant second place in Nevada.\\n\\nThe victory, while encouraging for Sanders supporters, only deepens concern among establishment-minded Democratic leaders who fear that the self-described democratic socialist is too extreme to defeat Trump. Sanders for decades has been calling for transformative policies to address inequities in politics and the economy, none bigger than his signature Medicare for All health care plan that would replace the private insurance system with a government-run universal system.\\n\\nDespite establishment anxiety, moderates are struggling to unify behind a single candidate, and the vote on Saturday was again split between several centrists, including Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden.\\n\\nAlso in the mix: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who desperately needed a spark to revive her stalled bid; billionaire Tom Steyer, who spent more than $12 million on Nevada television, and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who hoped to prove her strong New Hampshire finish was no fluke.\\n\\nAfter the chaos of Iowa's caucuses, there were concerns about Nevada's similar setup. But no major problems were in sight.\\n\\nAt noon, under sunny skies, dozens of uniformed housekeepers and casino workers cast ballots in the Bellagio, one of seven casino-resorts on the Las Vegas Strip among 200 locations statewide that hosted caucuses. Nevada is the third contest on a 2020 election calendar marked by chaos and uncertainty after the opening votes in Iowa and New Hampshire, overwhelmingly white, rural states.\\n\\nThe first presidential contest in the West is testing the candidates' strength with black and Latino voters for the first time in 2020. Nevada's population aligns more with the U.S. as a whole, compared with Iowa and New Hampshire: 29% Latino, 10% black and 9% Asian American and Pacific Islander.\\n\\nSelf-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders has emerged as the front-runner in the race so far as a half-dozen more-moderate candidates criticize one another. Each wants to be the preferred alternative to the Vermont senator in the race to take on President Donald Trump in November.\\n\\nIn a show of confidence, Sanders left Nevada early to rally supporters in Texas, which offers one of the biggest delegate troves in just 10 days on Super Tuesday. The progressive senator told cheering supporters in El Paso that Trump is a pathological liar running a corrupt administration.\\n\\nWhen we come together there is nothing we can't accomplish, Sanders declared.\\n\\nThe Nevada verdict represents the third in a primary season that will span all 50 states and several U.S. territories, ending only at the party's national convention in July. But with two more rounds of voting scheduled over the next 10 days — including Super Tuesday's massive delegate haul — the party may identify a consensus candidate long before the convention.\\n\\nSanders and his allies were increasingly confident about his strength in the race. In Nevada, he has strong support from Latinos and rank-and-file union workers who have warmed to his calls to transform the nation's economy and political system to help the working class.\\n\\nThere was skepticism about Pete Buttigieg's ability to win over a more diverse set of voters after strong finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire. Joe Biden, who struggled in those early states, looked to Nevada's voters of color to prove he still has a viable path to the nomination.\\n\\nElizabeth Warren and Klobuchar were fighting for momentum, hoping to benefit from a sudden surge of outside money from newly created super PACs.\\n\\nKlobuchar, campaigning in her home state of Minnesota Saturday night, claimed Nevada success no matter what. As usual I think we have exceeded expectations.\\n\\nNew York billionaire Mike Bloomberg, who dominated the political conversation this week after a poor debate-stage debut, wasn't on the ballot. He's betting everything on a series of delegate-rich states that begin voting next month.\\n\\nBillionaire Tom Steyer spent more than $12 million of his own money on television advertising in Nevada, according to data obtained by The Associated Press.\\n\\nTrump weighed in on social media, continuing his weeks-long push to sow discord between Sanders and his Democratic rivals.\\n\\nLooks like Crazy Bernie is doing well in the Great State of Nevada. Biden & the rest look weak, Trump tweeted. Congratulations Bernie, & don't let them take it away from you!\\n\\nThe stakes were high for Nevada Democrats to avoid a repeat of the chaos in Iowa, and it appeared Saturday's caucuses were largely successful.\\n\\nThe developer the Nevada Democrats had planned to use had its mobile app fail spectacularly in Iowa. Nearly three weeks later, Iowa Democratic officials have yet to post final results. But resources poured into Nevada, as Democrats realized they could ill afford another poorly executed election.\\n\\nUnlike state primaries and the November election, which are run by government officials, caucuses are overseen by state parties.\\n\\nNevada Democrats sought to minimize problems by creating multiple redundancies in their reporting system, relying on results called in by phone, a paper worksheet filled out by caucus organizers, a photo of that worksheet sent in by text message and electronic results captured with a Google form. They relied on trusted commercial tech that appeared to smooth the process.\\n\\nIn addition, it appeared Nevada Democrats were able to successfully navigate a complicated process for adding early voting to the caucus process. Nearly 75,000 people cast early ballots over a four-day period, and the party was able to process those in time for Saturday so they could be integrated into the in-person vot.\\n\\nAt the Bellagio caucus site, 41-year-old Christian Nielsen, a scuba diver for the Cirque du Soleil show O, saidhe backed Sanders because he believes the country needs a major change in the White House.\\n\\nWe need somebody in the White House who has been on the right side of history for their entire career, somebody who stands with the working class, and will make things more fair for everybody, Nielsen said.\\n\\nThe Democrats' 2020 nomination fight shifted beyond Nevada even before the final results were known.\\n\\nOnly Biden, Buttigieg and Steyer were still in the state when news of Sanders' victory was announced.\\n\\nSanders and Klobuchar spent the night in Super Tuesday states. And Warren, who began Saturday in Las Vegas, was to finish the day in Washington state, which hosts its election on March 10 but has already begun offering early voting.\\n\\n___\\n\\nPeoples and Jaffe reported from Washington.

{"original": "House Speaker Rep. Paul Ryan wants Congress to pass a law that would cause Puerto Rico bondholders who own $73 billion in notes from the territory's government to be treated the same way the federal government treated Chrysler bondholders back in 2008 and 2009.\\n\\nFriday morning, Ryan addressed a special meeting of the GOP caucus to attempt to persuade recalcitrant conservatives the cram down is a good idea.\\n\\nIf the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) Rep. Sean Duffy has sponsored and Ryan supports becomes law, Puerto Rico would use the special dispensation provided the territory in the bill to force bondholders to accept pennies on the dollar prior to or during a bankruptcy filing.\\n\\nAs George Mason University professor Todd Zywicki and the Heritage Foundation's James Sherk wrote of the Chrysler bondholder cram down:\\n\\nIn bankruptcy, the secured status of these bonds should have meant that the secured creditors would be paid in full before any money was allocated to subordinate creditors, such as the UAW's VEBA plans. Instead, the plan imposed by the government forced Chrysler's secured creditors to accept only 29 cents on the dollar, while the UAW recovered most of the value of its claims.\\n\\nAs Breitbart News reported previously, if PROMESA passes, Puerto Rico's bondholders would receive the same kind of treatment as Chrysler's bondholders.\\n\\n[The] plan that would let Puerto Rico wipe out $33 billion of its $73 billion debt in bankruptcy.\\n\\nLeadership of both political parties are backing the creation of a federal control board and legal authorization for Puerto Rico to file bankruptcy. The effort would pave the way for a cramdown of about 45 percent of the island's debt, without any spending cuts.\\n\\nConservatives in the House say that's a bad idea.\\n\\nRyan is technically right that the PROMESA bill is not the same kind of immediate bailout of billions in direct loans to Puerto Rico as the 2008 auto bailout of Chrysler and General Motors, a good portion of which was subsequently written off.\\n\\nBut in many respects, his argument today echoes the words of former President George W. Bush, who defended the TARP bailout of banks that he later used to bail out the auto companies when he infamously said: I've abandoned free market principles to save the free market.\\n\\nRyan's need to intervene in order to save the increasingly unpopular Puerto Rico bailout is urgent.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the House Natural Resources Committee rejected PROMESA in a surprise move, preventing it from coming to the floor of the House for a vote.\\n\\nThe bill's passage through the committee was expected to be a slam dunk.\\n\\nAs recently as Tuesday, a confident Natural Resources Committee Chairman, Rep. Rob Bishop, said It is the Island's best shot to mitigate its financial collapse and future calls for a bailout, which would be untenable. Congress must act now to avoid a humanitarian crisis that will severely impact 3.5 million Americans living in Puerto Rico and millions of Americans on the mainland.\\n\\nThe bill's sponsor, Rep. Sean Duffy, was equally confident:\\n\\nThe three and a half million Americans living in the U.S. territory deserve the attention and support of Congress. After decades of mismanagement, Puerto Rico's investors also deserve better. A protracted and chaotic legal battle would not serve the interest of creditors or the island. Worse would be a mutli-billion dollar taxpayer bailout thrust on the shoulders of America's taxpayers and retirees. The PROMESA Act will ensure that the island meets its debt obligations in a controlled, responsible manner, without saddling the U.S. taxpayers with the bill. If we get this right, we have an opportunity to put the people of Puerto Rico on a path to economic opportunity. However, if we do nothing, the American people will be on the hook.\\n\\nBut that confidence evaporated in 48 fast moving hours.\\n\\nAs The Hill reported:\\n\\nSpeaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) will try to sell fellow Republicans on a bill to help Puerto Rico deal with its debt crisis at a special meeting Friday. Ryan said the morning conference meeting would be solely devoted to Puerto Rico, in an effort to educate members and bring them on board with the bill, which has faced persistent conservative opposition. A lot of members are just coming up to speed on this, he said Thursday. It is why tomorrow morning, we're doing a policy conference on just the issue of Puerto Rico. The members who have been spending a lot of time on this are going to give a presentation to the broader conference to bring people up to speed. The fate of that legislation took a turn for the worse late Wednesday, when the House Natural Resources Committee abruptly canceled a markup of the bill. Republicans said the delay was spurred by Democrats in Congress and the Obama administration. Committee Chairman Rob Bishop (R-Utah) said the administration was still trying to alter the bill, making a markup impossible. And Ryan contended that the bill did not receive consideration because Democrats were not willing to back it. But a Wednesday morning hearing on the bill also made clear there was ample conservative discontent as well. Several committee members lambasted the proposal, arguing it was a bailout for an island territory with a record of fiscal mismanagement. . . The current bill does not commit any federal funds to Puerto Rico. Instead, it establishes an outside control board to monitor the island's finances, and allows the island to go to court to try and restructure some of its debt if voluntary negotiations with creditors fail.\\n\\nOn Thursday, Ryan gave an advance preview of his pitch:\\n\\nThere is chaos occurring. Puerto Rico passed a law negating, arguably, their debt. We want to bring order to the chaos. And the need for Puerto Rican legislation is to bring order to the chaos. And my number one priority as speaker of the House with respect to this issue is to keep the American taxpayer away from this. There will no taxpayer bailout. We want an oversight board, just like we did with the District of Columbia a number of years ago, to be involved, to provide the kind of leadership and structure that is necessary for Puerto Rico to gets its own fiscal house in order and to guide the kind of debt restructuring that is necessary so that Puerto Rico can continue to access the capital markets and keep the taxpayer out of this. That is our primary responsibility is to protect the American taxpayer and to help bring order to the chaos that will befall Puerto Rico if the status quo continues going in the direction it's going.\\n\\nRyan took exception to television ads calling PROMESA a bailout of Puerto Rico:\\n\\nI'm not going to characterize who is behind what ads because I don't know who is behind what ads. A bailout is getting the taxpayer involved. We are — our whole entire purpose of this is to prevent the taxpayer from getting involved and not having a taxpayer bailout. That is why we are going the path we are going to prevent to taxpayer from being involved in this.\\n\\nWhat Ryan fails to note is that Puerto Rico has been a regular recipient of funds from federal taxpayers for years, and PROMESA will do nothing to change that pattern of support.\\n\\nIn fact, Congress is currently considering a separate proposal to increase federal subsidies directly to Puerto Rico residents through the extension of Earned Income Tax Credits. That's a neat trick, especially since residents of Puerto Rico currently do not have to file or pay any federal taxes.\\n\\nIn 2013, the federal government spent $2 billion on food stamps to residents of Puerto Rico, and that amount appears to be increasing with each additional year.\\n\\nAn estimated one-third of the island's residents receive food stamps.\\n\\nForbes contributor Martin Sullivan argues that Puerto Rico is already receiving $8 billion in subsidies from an obsure IRS ruling:\\n\\nThere's no one in the administration or in D.C. that's contemplating a federal bailout of Puerto Rico, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on June 29. That statement is simply false. It may be true that the Treasury is not contemplating cash subsidies or loan guarantees for Puerto Rico, but it already is providing something just as good: tax credits for U.S. companies operating in Puerto Rico on a Puerto Rican tax designed to give those companies U.S. tax credits. Sound complicated? Yep. That's why nobody is paying attention. Think about it this way: Puerto Rico imposes a tax that the federal government pays. U.S. companies operating there are just the middlemen. Here are the details. Since 2011, approximately 20 percent of Puerto Rico's total revenue collections have come from a temporary excise tax on certain products manufactured in Puerto Rico. . . Now here's the financial magic. On March 30, 2011, the IRS released Notice 2011-2 ruling that this new excise tax was a foreign tax creditable against U.S. taxes. The notice stated that the new tax was novel and that determination of the creditability of the Excise Tax requires the resolution of a number of legal and factual issues. Until these issues were resolved, the IRS would not challenge taxpayers' claims that the tax was creditable. Further, if the IRS decided the credit was not creditable in the future, the new position would apply only prospectively. Thus, most of the new tax burden imposed on multinationals doing business in Puerto Rico was eliminated by Treasury.\\n\\nIn 2008, President George W. Bush acknowledged that he abandoned free market principles when he tried to sell the TARP bailout to the American people.\\n\\nAt least President Bush was honest about what he had done.\\n\\nSpeaker Ryan, it seems, wants to obscure the real consequences of PROMESA as he tries to sell it to his House colleagues."}

{"original": "The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) noted on Thursday that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) is pushing a return to the tolerant, moderate Islam that is open to the world, to all the religions and traditions of its people as part of Saudi Arabia's major economic reform plan.\\n\\nAt the heart of Saudi Arabia's recent cultural and political upheaval is an understanding that the country must become more compatible with the Western world and more hospitable to foreign investment, in order to manage the transition away from an oil-based economy with limitless deep pockets. Possibly the trickiest aspect of this transformation will be an Islamic reformation in the notoriously strict kingdom.\\n\\nAs the Journal goes on to note, MBS is looking quite a way back into history for that memory of moderate Saudi Islam, since its harsh blend of strict Wahhabi Islam was brewed up in the 18th Century by the eponymous cleric Mohammed Ibn Abd al-Wahhab. Tribal influences, and of course the presence of Islam's holy cities of Mecca and Medina, have pushed the kingdom in an Islamist direction ever since.\\n\\nThe key event in recent Saudi Islamic history is often underappreciated by outside observers: the siege of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, in which militants occupied the holiest shrine of Islam for 15 days in 1979. The WSJ mentions it only briefly, but the siege dovetailed with the revolution in Iran to change both the Sunni and Shiite wings of the Islamic world.\\n\\nIt is best understood as a theocratic coup, and not an unsuccessful one because it permanently altered the relationship between Saudi Arabia's royal family, secular bureaucracy, and hardline Islamist clergy. The government did much to curry favor with the Wahhabi extremists to prevent anything like the Grand Mosque attack from happening again. The most pessimistic interpretation of the aftermath is that fundamentalists effectively blackmailed the wealthy Saudi government into bankrolling extremism and terrorism. The siege made the government look weak, dishonest, and decadent to many Saudis.\\n\\nThe Grand Mosque terrorist incident was also a landmark moment in deteriorating relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and by extension Sunni and Shiite Islam, since Iran was widely believed to be involved in the attack. A dismal contest between Saudi Arabia and Iran began to demonstrate which was more pious and faithful to Islamic law. Fundamentalism spread rapidly across formerly liberal and cosmopolitan cities across the Middle East, which until the Islamist upheaval of the late Seventies resembled American and European cities of the same era. It didn't help matters that Islamic fundamentalism mixed easily with Marxist quackery.\\n\\nSome find the speed of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's reforms astonishing, or worry that he is moving too quickly, but Margherita Stancati at the Wall Street Journal recalls that fundamentalism descended upon Saudi Arabia very quickly forty years ago:\\n\\nThe mixing of unrelated men and women, let alone singing and dancing, was no longer acceptable. Cinemas closed and music stopped. In public, women were forced to wear face-covering veils, which in parts of the country such as Asir had been virtually nonexistent. The religious police, formally known as the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, was given the job of enforcing the new order. Radical Islamists infused the school curriculum with the teachings of Wahhabi scholars. Textbooks instructed students to hate Christians and Jews and denigrated Shiite Muslims. Some of the more extreme views often came from teachers, who sometimes recruited students to extremist causes. Saudi charities linked to the government helped spread that interpretation of Islam beyond the kingdom's borders, inspiring generations of jihadists.\\n\\nAs Stancati notes, even young women eager for reform in Saudi Arabia today grew up being taught that drawing pictures of animals was an insult to Allah's sacred and unique ability to create life, or that listening to music for pleasure would get them tortured for all eternity in the afterlife by having hot metal poured in their ears. Top Saudi clerics criticized the government for giving women the right to drive by saying it would give them easy access to worldly temptation, and as we know, women are weak and easily tempted.\\n\\nHowever, the Saudi public overwhelmingly supports ending the ban on women drivers. Younger Saudis in particular grasp that they need to become more socially compatible with the rest of the world if they are to compete on the global stage, in an era when oil is no longer the bottomless spring of easy money it once was.\\n\\nCrucially, there does not seem to be any massive fundamentalist pushback lurking, comparable to how Saudi modernization at the beginning of the oil boom fed the resentments that erupted in 1979. The government is making a serious effort to nourish more moderate interpretations of Islam and improve education.\\n\\nGranted, some of the social liberalization described by Stancati is incremental, such as upscale Riyadh women getting to decide what color fabric they wish to be wrapped in from head to toe, instead of having to settle for all black. Also, liberalization in the big Saudi cities is much more noticeable than in small towns and distant areas.\\n\\nRetired Pacific Fleet commander Admiral James Lyons noted in the Washington Times in December that Saudi demographics are now remarkably skewed toward the younger generation, as 70 percent of the population is under 30 years old, and they have little patience for onerous Islamic restrictions. He also noted that the post-oil Saudi economy will have to welcome women into the workforce, which necessarily involves lifting restrictions upon them, such as allowing them to drive.\\n\\nLyons is willing to cut the crown prince a lot of slack for playing rough as he consolidates power, because it's necessary to implement rapid reforms against bureaucratic and social inertia in Saudi Arabia. There is also some comfort in knowing that MBS has practical dollars-and-cents reasons to make his reforms stick; if his sense of idealism flags, the sound of a doomsday clock ticking on a trillion-dollar economic collapse should strengthen his resolve."}

But the left half of the left wants to push broader boundaries, and it's no wonder they worry when the rest of the party starts to pull instead. The liberal vanguard Tlaib belongs to seeks massive change, from Medicare for all to a grand climate bargain. They see no hope for compromise now, so they look to a future of Democratic control, when ramming transformation through will require breaking things. The party establishment so far has shown small desire to do so. And that, Tlaib might say, is a motherf—ing shame.\\n\\nDespite brushing off criticisms of Tlaib's use of vulgar language from unspecified pro-civility crusaders, in a column published in November, Roberts called for amplified political censorship across Facebook and Twitter.

Venezuela depends on hydroelectric power and is currently suffering a drought that has left its main dam barely operational.

Schools are explicitly included in the measure, leaving the nation's children without class for most of the week.\\n\\nMaduro previously decreed three-day weekends to reduce demand for electricity nationwide, a move that elicited severe criticism of Maduro's laziness and the improvisational nature of his rule.

Fuenmayor noted that late dictator Hugo Chávez had tried to change time zones in an attempt to save electricity and failed.\\n\\nVenezuela has been suffering infrastructure problems for years under Maduro, though the problem has been exacerbated recently. In February, an attempt to prevent the current drought situation resulted in millions of Caracas residents being deprived of drinking water due to alleged maintenance.\\n\\nOutside the capital, the situation was even worse, as officials began rationing the water supply similarly to how necessary goods are rationed in supermarkets. Currently, Venezuelans must wait up to six or seven hours on supermarket lines to buy essential goods like flour, vegetable oil, and milk. Increasingly, these lines have become violent, with individuals physically beating each other for access to limited food resources. The electricity shortage will likely force supermarkets to be open for fewer hours, worsening wait times to pay for groceries.\\n\\nThe pro-democracy opposition in the National Assembly, meanwhile, is issuing stern statements condemning Maduro.

Fauci is one of the top infectious disease experts in the country, he noted.\\n\\nSiegel noted the coronavirus task force's inclusion of CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield, a virologist, and Dr. Nancy Messonnier, an expert in vaccines.\\n\\nThey've been doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing, said Siegel of the Trump administration's measures towards protecting Americans from the coronavirus. [They are] restricting travel, isolating patients who are sick and, trying to cut down on contact. It's a very hard thing to do when people are pouring in from all over the world.\\n\\nSiegel contrasted the coronavirus's mortality rate with those of SARS, swine flu, and the flu.\\n\\nSARS had about a ten percent mortality [rate], but it only affected about 8,000 people, recalled Siegel. Swine flu had a very, very low mortality for flu, but flu itself really only causes about a point-four percent death rate, and [coronavirus] is about one-point-four percent. So this is killing more than flu, but I want to make a couple of points that will reassure people.\\n\\nSiegel continued, One, at the beginning of an emerging contagion, it always appears more deadly than it actually is. The 1918 flu is an exception, but normally as time goes on, it's less deadly, and part of that is because you see more immunity appearing, and you also find a lot of milder cases — or even cases where people don't get sick at all. You find that as you start to test more people.\\n\\nUndiagnosed and asymptomatic persons infected with coronavirus are not captured in data for quantifying mortality rates, explained Siegel, Mild cases that are being undiagnosed make [coronavirus] seem more deadly.\\n\\nThe coronavirus outbreak illustrates the need for America's economy to decouple from China, assessed Siegel.\\n\\nWe're relying on China for 90 percent of our ingredients for pharmaceuticals, Siegel remarked. That hopefully will change as a result of this because we're going to end up with tremendous shortages of basic drugs, including antibiotics and blood pressure medication if this continues much longer in Wuhan.\\n\\nSiegel concluded, This is a wake-up call that we must make more of our pharmaceuticals here in the United States.\\n\\nAsked about news media conduct regarding coronavirus, Siegel said, They're certainly not helping because they're hyping, and the hyping leads to hysteria.\\n\\nBreitbart News Sunday broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Eastern.\\n\\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter."}

But it will be an absolute disaster for the country at large, as a number of recent reports and articles make clear.\\n\\nA recent analysis by a senior economist at Deutsche Bank, for example, says that the way the European Union is selling its 'Green Deal' is 'dishonest' and poses massive risks for prosperity, the economic system and democracy itself.\\n\\nIn the report, titled Climate Neutrality: Are We Ready for an Honest Discussion?, Eric Heymann warns that the EU's green ambitions of 'Net Zero' Carbon emissions cannot be achieved without a fall in standards of living, a reduction in international competitiveness, and a loss in personal freedom.\\n\\nAt the moment, he notes, we all get to take key consumption decisions — whether we travel at all, how much we travel and which means of transport we use, whether we live in a large house or a small apartment and how we heat our homes, how many electronic devices we have and how intensely we use them or how much meat and exotic fruit we eat — on the basis of 'income, not on climate considerations.'\\n\\nIf we are to achieve climate neutrality, we will need to change our behaviour in all these areas of life because it is impossible to do any of the above things in a carbon neutral way. The only way this is likely to happen, he warns, is through government compulsion.\\n\\nHeymann warns:\\n\\nI know that 'eco-dictatorship' is a nasty word. But we may have to ask ourselves the question whether and to what extent we may be willing to accept some kind of eco-dictatorship (in the form of regulatory law) in order to move towards climate neutrality.\\n\\nThis, Heymann goes on to say, will lead to massive political resistance because prosperity and employment are likely to suffer considerably.\\n\\nLet's repeat that phrase for the dimmer kids at the back of the class, Johnson.\\n\\nProsperity and employment are likely to suffer considerably.\\n\\nThis makes a nonsense of Johnson's airy claim that his green revolution will create hundreds and thousands of new jobs. Of course it won't. There is plenty of evidence to support Heymann's claim. None to support Johnson's.\\n\\nI pointed this out in June last year in a piece titled Britain Unleashes a Green New Deal to Kill What's Left of the Economy.\\n\\nFor example, a study by economics professor Dr Gabriel Calzada Alvarez of Madrid's University of Rey Juan Carlos found that for every 'green job' created by the Spanish government, another 2.2 jobs were destroyed in the real economy. Another study, this time in the UK, found that for every green job created by government 'investment' in the renewables industry, 3.7 jobs were destroyed in the real economy.\\n\\nMore recently, a report by the think tank Onward has warned that ten million jobs in 'Red Wall' seats (i.e. traditional Labour constituencies in the Midlands and North which lent their votes to the Conservatives in the 2019 election so that Johnson could deliver Brexit) face being wiped out in Johnson's attempt to reach his 'net-zero by 2050' emissions target.\\n\\nThis might suit Johnson and his green crony capitalist chums in the Westminster bubble, but as Paul Homewood notes, metropolitan greenies will largely insulated from the disastrous effects of their eco-fascist policies in the country at large.\\n\\nThe climate change agenda is being driven by the metropolitan liberal consensus in London, where few jobs will be at risk. Outside of London there is little support for Net Zero, but people there have little say in policy decisions. Polling may suggest otherwise, but the public have been deliberately kept in the dark about the real costs and implications involved.\\n\\nBoris Johnson's green revolution is a slow motion train crash in the making. Even those invested in 'climate change' as a genuine threat are starting to wake up to the problem.\\n\\nHere, for example, is market strategist and investor Bill 'I absolutely believe climate change is the biggest challenge humanity faces' Blain writing at CapX.\\n\\nThe brutal reality is offshore wind is far less efficient than promised and requires much more expensive maintenance. They break down, sink into their foundations and don't generate anything like the power expected. For all the due diligence, they simply won't ever make any money unless the price at which they sell energy is dramatically increased – at which point they make zero sense.\\n\\n[It goes, almost without saying, that 'offshore wind' will be playing a major part in Boris Johnson's green revolution – the one that will supposedly create those 'hundreds of thousands of jobs']\\n\\nBlain sees the makings of a 'financial crash' driven by the renewables sector, for wind turbines are not the panacea they may look to gullible investors.\\n\\nThis will feel very familiar to many investors who have seen all the blithe assumption about operating and maintenance costs on all kinds of technological green marvels fail to meet expectations. Biowaste generators, biomass, thermal pellets – you name it, and the rosy assumptions failed to materialise because the difficulties in making them work and keeping them working were glossed over by the promoters. Most of the smart money already knew that about renewables and is deeply sceptical. The not-so-smart money still laps the deals up. Sadly, renewables is likely to become another charming but flawed investment thesis. I am no stranger to investment madness – three times I've invested in airships and lost my dosh every time.\\n\\nBoris Johnson's obsession with green issues is steering the UK economy to disaster. He needs to go now."}

An individual can change his hormone levels and undergo surgery to better imitate the opposite sex, but a male on the day of his conception will remain a male on the day of his death. And as discussed below, the idea that there is a real personal trait called gender that challenges or invalidates the identity significance of biological sex is equally fallacious. But the absence of genuine evidence is simply ignored, and faux evidence is created to validate the mania.\\n\\nThe man who became the first person to obtain a legal sex designation of non-binary now says the transgender lifestyle is a fraud. https://t.co/mEM5NcstRW — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) January 8, 2020\\n\\nThe lucrative transgender industry is now enthusiastically treating gender dysphoria with expensive and life-altering medical interventions and surgeries.

{"original": "U.S. tech companies want to hire more skilled professionals, so the government should give green cards to foreigners who graduate from U.S. universities, says a report released Tuesday by FWD.us, an advocacy group for Mark Zuckerberg and other wealthy West Coast investors.\\n\\nThe report claims:\\n\\nthe tighter labor market means U.S. employers are struggling to fill critical jobs, limiting productivity and putting global leadership at risk. These labor shortages are especially pronounced in emerging industries like artificial intelligence (AI) that rely on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) skills.\\n\\nThe most straightforward solution is to allow graduates with a U.S. degree and a job offer to start working and begin the green card process immediately, says the report, adding This would relieve pressure on the H-1B program and keep it more focused on truly temporary workers, while facilitating permanent residency for well-educated and highly-skilled individuals who have already lived in the U.S. for some time and can fill permanent roles.\\n\\nThe FWD.us report is just one part of a broader campaign by companies and investors to convince legislators that they must quickly pass a labor-supply bill in 2021. That short timeline would minimize legislators'opportunity to debate the value of flooding the labor market for college graduates. It would also minimize Americans' ability to organize opposition to the FWD.us plan, which would likely cut middle-class wages and spike housing costs.\\n\\nThe lobbyist chatter about the need for more skilled workers is about the second term, said Daniel Horowitz, the editor of Conservative Review. Voters who back President Donald Trump's America First agenda need to organize this year to defeat next year's push for cheap labor, he said, adding:\\n\\nThe president needs to hear from his base — now is precisely the time to stand up and not stand down out of fear of pressuring the President. … He wants to be pressured [because] it is very hard for the President to go in one direction when 100 percent of the pressure inside the administration is headed in the other direction. The mistake that Trump supporters make is they wait until it is too late to stop the President from feeling compelled to go with the swamp … The time to get to the President is early and often.\\n\\nAmerican graduates have to organize now to push back anticipated demands for more work visas by Business Roundtable and Chamber of Commerce types, said Marie Larson, a technology graduate and a founder of the American Workers Coalition. American graduates need a seat at the bargaining table because there is no greater stakeholder than American graduates — they are the ones whose livelihood is at stake.\\n\\nFWD.us was founded by wealthy investors, including Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who also helped to expand the H-1B visa program.\\n\\nThe H-1B program lowers American wages by keeping roughly 700,000 Indian and Chinese graduate visa-workers in a wide variety of U.S. jobs.\\n\\nOverall, roughly one million Indian graduates hold American jobs because they are enrolled in the H-1B, OPT, J-1, L-1, H4EAD, and post-doc programs.\\n\\nThese one million-plus outsourcing workers have been used by CEOs, university managers, and investors to stabilize their U.S. workforces and raise their stock-values — but at the cost of reducing many Americans' opportunity to innovate and experiment.\\n\\nGovt data shows 1 million Indian contract-workers get white-collar jobs in tech, banking, health etc.\\n\\nThe Indian hiring ignores many EEOC laws & is expanding amid gov't & media silence.\\n\\nIt is a huge economic & career loss for US college grads.#S368 #H1B https://t.co/pqEW9yJ89c — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) February 17, 2020\\n\\nThis huge workforce also helps flatline salaries for American graduates.

At a February 26 CNN town hall, Bloomberg echoed the FWD.us plan by saying he would provide green-cards to every foreigner who graduates from a U.S. university:\\n\\nOne of the things in immigration is you've got to do some things quickly … You've got to staple a green card on every degree when they [foreign students] get out of college, particularly if they're studying STEM [Science, Technology, Enginering and Math]… We need more immigrants, not less immigrants. And a lot of them come from China.\\n\\nAnother founding member of the FWD.us group is former Google chief Eric Schmidt.\\n\\nThe FWD.us report cites his February 27 op-ed in the New York Times, which said the U.S. should counter competition from China by importing foreign scientists — such as Chinese scientists.\\n\\nThe headline of the op-ed is: Eric Schmidt: I Used to Run Google. Silicon Valley Could Lose to China, and it admits that Schmidt and his peers are being out-competed by China:\\n\\n… in recent years, Americans — Silicon Valley leaders included — have put too much faith in the private sector to ensure U.S. global leadership in new technology. Now we are in a technology competition with China that has profound ramifications for our economy and defense — a reality I have come to appreciate as chairman of two government panels on innovation and national security. The government needs to get back in the game in a serious way. Important trends are not in our favor. America's lead in artificial intelligence, for example, is precarious. A.I. will open new frontiers in everything from biotechnology to banking, and it is also a Defense Department priority. Leading the world in A.I. is essential to growing our economy and protecting our security. A recent study considering more than 100 metrics finds that the United States is well ahead of China today but will fall behind in five to 10 years. China also has almost twice as many supercomputers and about 15 times as many deployed 5G base stations as the United States. If current trends continue, China's overall investments in research and development are expected to surpass those of the United States within 10 years, around the same time its economy is projected to become larger than ours.\\n\\nSchmidt also admits that he and his peers have failed to attract, recruit, and train enough American innovators, saying, We should undertake major efforts to train up-and-coming scientists and engineers.\\n\\nThe failure to build up domestic skills has left Schmidt and his peers dependent on the willingness of foreigners to work in U.S. firms, Schmidt suggests:\\n\\nA majority of computer scientists with graduate degrees working in America were born abroad, as were most current graduate students studying computer science in U.S. universities.\\n\\nBut Schmidt argues that America's technological advantages can be preserved by continued reliance on these foreign experts:\\n\\nThey are a source of national strength. A vast majority want to stay and contribute to American innovation. We must make it easier for them to do so. There is no need to wait for comprehensive immigration reform: We can change the immigration process for highly skilled people now to reduce the red tape, backlogs and uncertainty that threaten to drive tech talent to other countries — including to our strategic competitors.\\n\\nSchmidt's reference to red tape, backlogs, and uncertainty is likely a reference to the S.386 bill being pushed Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee.\\n\\nLee's bill would fast-track roughly 300,000 Indian visa-workers into green cards and then citizenship, regardless of the impact on American graduates.\\n\\nThe 300,000 Indians are part of the much larger workforce of roughly 1 million Indian visa-workers. The Indians have been imported to replace many of the boisterous American professionals who provided the skills and innovation which powered Silicon Valley in the 1980s and 1990s.\\n\\nNew Infosys lawsuit helps explain how the huge H-1B/OPT outsourcing economy pressures & rewards Indian managers to discriminate against American graduates, including Indian legal immigrants.\\n\\nFollow the money, all the way to India.\\n\\nAnd to Utah's #S386https://t.co/anISMObiu6 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) February 5, 2020\\n\\nLee's S.386 bill also offers the promise of fast-track work permits to the next wave of Indian graduates who accept lower wages to work in Americans' jobs. There are no caps in the OPT and H-1B programs, and Lee's bill could roll back complicated country caps curbs on the award of green cards to foreign workers.\\n\\nSo far, Lee's S.368 bill has been blocked by several GOP and Democratic Senators, by a few business interests, and by new groups of U.S. professionals. The high-stakes economic fight gets minimal coverage from white-collar journalists in the establishment media.\\n\\nBut FWD.us, the Chamber of Commerce, Bloomberg's group, major universities, and other lobbies are expected to push for a quick passage of S.386 shortly after the election, say lobbyists from all sides of the fight.\\n\\nNeither Schmidt's op-ed nor the FWD.us report suggested that companies should expand the U.S. workforce by offering higher salaries and benefits to American graduates.\\n\\nThose benefits could include legal changes to end the large-scale Indian outsourcing that has pushed many American experts out of Silicon Valley companies and into the unemployment line."}

Not always.\\n\\nFor states that don't already have vote-by-mail or that greatly restrict it, such a change could require amending state law. It also would require major changes to state and county voting and tabulating systems. Buying the equipment and software to track ballots and read the signatures on them could cost millions. And that's not to mention deciding who pays for return postage — individual voters or taxpayers?\\n\\nSo far this year, there have been quick moves to extend mail voting in only two cases, both limited in scope: Maryland postponed its primary but decided to hold next month's special congressional election by mail. And the Democratic Party in Wyoming, which already was sending all its members ballots, has canceled the in-person portion of its presidential caucus.\\n\\nAs in Wyoming, the Democratic caucuses and primaries in Alaska, Hawaii and Kansas were already to be held largely by mail this spring. So far, none of the five states that have postponed their primaries — Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland or Ohio — have said they will mail ballots statewide.\\n\\nA bill in Louisiana seeking to expand vote-by-mail was introduced even before the state's primary was pushed back, but it hasn't received a legislative hearing and is opposed by the state's top elections official. Pennsylvania lawmakers eased absentee ballot rules last year, and now Democrats want to expand voting by mail. Republicans, who control the statehouse, have generally resisted voting changes, and it's unclear if the virus crisis is enough to overcome concerns about the costs of greatly expanding vote-by-mail.\\n\\nOpposition isn't unusual, typically because lawmakers or election officials believe it opens a pathway to voter fraud. The ability to receive a ballot in the mail is greatly restricted in 16 states.\\n\\nThose states allow absentee ballots only for voters who give a valid reason to get one — and require they be requested for each election. Of those, Delaware and New York are phasing in no-excuse mail voting.\\n\\nThe hurdles to implementing voting by mail for all voters is why states might be better off taking only small steps at first, said Charles Stewart, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That could mean simply making absentee ballots easier to get.\\n\\nHastily implemented changes to voting rules and laws can end up causing all types of problems that you didn't anticipate, he said.\\n\\nDoug Jones, an election security expert at the University of Iowa, said universal mail voting also raises concerns about voters illegally selling blank ballots or being coerced to vote a certain way.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, after Ohio postponed its primary and poll workers failed to show up at some Florida and Illinois precincts, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez called a shift to voting largely by mail the simplest tool to balance health concerns and the need to carry out a fundamental function of democracy.\\n\\nA half-dozen states already have or are implementing systems where all voters are mailed ballots. They can mail them back, drop them off at designated spots or choose to vote in person on Election Day.\\n\\nOregon has been conducting elections that way since the 1990s.

{"original": "In his weekly Angelus address Sunday, Pope Francis commented on the meeting of Jesus with an adulterous woman, observing that the woman is an image of all humanity, since we are all adulterers who have cheated on God's love.\\n\\nIn his reflection on the Sunday gospel reading, the Pope recalled the episode where a group of Pharisees drag a woman caught in adultery before Jesus to see how he will react, reminding him that Moses prescribed stoning for this sin and hoping to trap him in his response. Rather than take a stand on her punishment, Jesus suggests that the one with no sin on his own conscience be the first to throw a stone at her.\\n\\nThis woman represents all of us, since we are sinners, that is, adulterers before God, traitors of his faithfulness, Francis said.\\n\\nOn this, the third anniversary of his pontificate, Pope Francis told the crowd of thousands gathered in Saint Peter's Square that the story is one of his favorite passages in the Bible, that he likes to read and reread often. It highlights the theme of the mercy of God, he said, who never wills the death of the sinner but that he be converted and live.\\n\\nFrancis noted that the Pharisees weren't really looking for Jesus' opinion on the Mosaic teaching but rather were trying to ensnare him in a catch-22 situation. Either Jesus contradicts the Law of Moses by recommending leniency, thus alienating himself from his Jewish followers, or he takes a hardline stance and recommends the stoning of the woman, thus betraying his own call to gentleness and mercy.\\n\\nInstead, Francis notes, Jesus escapes from their trap by suggesting that the one who is without sin cast the first stone, and they all leave one by one, beginning with the eldest.\\n\\nAnd so once all the Pharisees have walked away, Jesus turns to the woman and says, Where are they? Has no one condemned you?\\n\\nNo one, sir, she replies.\\n\\nAnd Jesus answers: Neither do I condemn you. Go, and sin no more.\\n\\nThough we only know of this woman by the title the adulteress, Francis said, this label does not do justice to her, because Jesus sees the person beyond her sin and desires her salvation.\\n\\nThe Pope reminded his hearers that we should not identify ourselves or others by our inclinations toward sinful behavior, a tendency all too common in today's world.\\n\\nGod does not nail us to our sin, Francis said, and he does not identify us with the evil we have done. We have a name, and God does not identify this name with the sin we have committed.\\n\\nJesus makes the woman feel, perhaps for the first time, that she is not her sin, that she has a dignity of a person; that she can change her life and escape from her bondage and walk in a new way, he said. Because every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future.\\n\\nWe would all do well, Francis added, to have the courage to drop the stones we carry to throw at others, and think a bit on our own sins!\\n\\nFollow Thomas D.

{"original": "A significant 86 per cent of Austrians surveyed in a snap poll on Sunday night support their country continuing independent action to deal with the migrant crisis, without the guidance or agreement of the European Union (EU).\\n\\nAustria was on the main migratory corridor from the Near East and North Africa to Europe, sitting at the top of the so called 'Balkans route' until action by nations like Hungary and Macedonia closed access to the peninsula by illegal incursions.\\n\\nDespite having spent much of 2015 being highly critical of efforts to close the route, Austria's government under Chancellor Werner Faymann is now taking a much harder line, and this is proving extremely popular with voters, reports Kronen Zeitung.\\n\\nA snap poll taken after a Sunday night television appearance by the Chancellor, in which he again called on his German counterpart Angela Merkel to change course on her migrant strategy, found broad agreement with the new direction of travel for the country. With the statement Austria should continue to set their own migrant policy as long as there is no solution at EU level, 86 per cent agreed, with 62 per cent agreeing strongly.\\n\\nAlthough the question left the possibility of Austria falling into line with the EU at a later date should a continent-wide approach to the migrant crisis be agreed on, to the respondents this seemed a remote possibility. Some 83 per cent said they couldn't see any sort of agreement between the EU-28 in the next few weeks.\\n\\nA similar proportion also believed Austria should be unafraid to make decisions independently of the EU. Asked is it right to enforce the Balkan closure along with other states, 85 per cent agreed, with just six per cent disagreeing strongly.\\n\\nThe transformation of Austria's Chancellor Faymann from a Merkel-esque advocate of unlimited asylum for all comers into an advocate of border control and fences was as unexpected as it was sudden. Austrian media now characterises him as a Frenemy to the German chancellor, describing his conversion to plan B as an emancipation.\\n\\nExplaining this transformation, Chancellor Faymann has spoken of plan B as self defence for Austria, and insisted Austria could not become the waiting room of Germany.\\n\\nHis reticence to play ball with the Euro club of leaders in Brussels while working out ad hoc solutions with neighbours may prove unpopular in Brussels. As Breitbart London reported, Swedish leader Stephen Löfven slammed European countries not accepting migrant quotas as beneath contempt.\\n\\nCalling for a pan-European solution and discouraging exactly the action Austria, Hungary, and others have taken, Mr. Löfven said:\\n\\nThe important thing now in such a difficult situation is that we do things together in the EU. If all keep on with their own unplanned solutions we'll make it even worse."}

Jack Nicklaus has a powerful solution.\\n\\nI think with the length the guys hit today … the simplest solution is change the frigging golf ball, Nicklaus explained at Augusta National. The golf ball goes so far.\\n\\nCourses overflowing with money can elongate the fairways. But few posses such funds. So changing the ball, Nicklaus believes, remains the soundest solution.\\n\\nAugusta National is about the only place, the only golf course in the world that financially can afford to make the changes that they have to make to keep up with the golf ball, the 18-time major winner maintain. I don't think anybody else could ever do it."}
