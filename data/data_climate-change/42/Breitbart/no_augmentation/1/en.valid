announcing an 'lgbt-inclusive' update to all of its products, education giant pearson has launched a guide to pushing 'social justice' activism in every part of the school curriculum.
'creating an lgbt-inclusive curriculum' was produced by lgbt activist group stonewall and is sponsored by pearson, which owns the exam board edexcel and publishes thousands of school textbooks as one of the uk's biggest education companies.
claiming an inclusive curriculum is a crucial part of tackling homophobic bullying in schools, the handbook advises ways in which teachers can alter lessons across the syllabus so lgbt pupils see themselves represented in what they're learning.
writing about the need to stamp out anti-lgbt bullying in a foreword to the guide, the senior vice-president for schools at pearson uk, sharon hague, said: lgbt students will only feel comfortable to be themselves if they also get to see themselves in their classrooms.
organised by subject, the guide lists suggestions to ensure lgbt visibility across the curriculum, for example recommending teachers set questions which reference homosexual relationships in maths and science, and introduce terminology specific to the lifestyles of sexual minorities in foreign language lessons.
material promoting gay and trans lifestyles could be spread across all parts of the curriculum in 120 uk schools. https://t.co/92rpsf1zbu — breitbart london (@breitbartlondon) may 17, 2017
one example given is to begin a question with: two women would like to have a baby together, and the doctor recommends they use in vitro fertilisation (ivf).
the vast majority of suggestions go far beyond issues of visibility and representation, however, with most of the handbook's tips for creating an lgbt-inclusive curriculum promoting hard-left 'social justice' activism and identity politics in the classroom.
advice on teaching maths includes an example lesson in which children learn about codebreaker alan turing. teachers are instructed to provide pupils with some information about alan turing's life, including the arrest and trial for his relationship with another man, and to introduce a discussion on the historical treatment of gay people by the secret services.
in history lessons, pupils should study the links between different social justice movements, while art teachers are urged to explore the way that art has been, and is being, used to effect social and political change, including lgbt equality, race equality and tackling climate change.
the handbook calls for schools to push a left-wing agenda across every subject, recommending science teachers explore gender stereotypes and barriers to participation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (stem) subjects.

suggested activities include tasking pupils with devising a campaign to get more women involved in stem, and discussing questions such as why is it important that diverse groups of people, including lgbt people, enter stem professions?
pearson's president for core markets, rod bristow, said the company will use the handbook to help update our own products and resources to ensure they are lgbt inclusive.
ukip education spokesman david kurten stated that the despicable move is bad news for children and parents, who he pointed out will effectively have no choice but to be exposed to politicised education material due to pearson's position as the largest supplier of textbooks for schools, and the owner of britain's largest exam board, edexcel.
maths should be about maths, it should not be about sexualizing children, he told breitbart london, warning the new textbooks will make it significantly more difficult for parents to protect their children from the malign influence of left-wing identity politics.
israel's intelligence minister yisrael katz told an influential knesset committee on monday that iran was working to upgrade the military capabilities of the hamas terror group in the gaza strip.
speaking to the foreign affairs and defense committee on monday, katz said: in recent days, while we face the known threat from gaza, there is a direct iranian intervention. iran, hezbollah and hamas are involved in operative preparations to upgrade the threat to israel from the direction of gaza.
the islamic republic was increasing its involvement in the gaza strip after hamas was forced to leave qatar, following pressure from saudi arabia, katz told the committee, according to a report by the jerusalem post.
this meeting is under the shadow of a four-letter word: i-r-a-n, he minister told the committee.
it's amazing how everything has to do with iran, katz continued. whether it's their nuclear aspirations and the need to prevent them from developing nuclear weapons… the attempt to improve its military preparedness in syria, training shi'ite militias [or] actions improving hezbollah missiles.
in a short time we will see ourselves fighting a much more challenging threat on the operative and military levels if we don't change direction, the post quoted the minister as saying.
referring in brief to the ongoing protest in iran, katz said that israel would like to see the repressive regime removed and replaced with a democracy. we don't intervene, but we wish luck to the iranian people in pursuit of freedom and democracy.
after he made his comments, prime minister benjamin netanyahu instructed his government to avoid commenting on the protests in iran.
it's not that they love zion, katz said in irony, discussing the iranian investment in money and manpower in several conflicts around the world. it's a question of whether resources should be used to support terror and aggression in syria, lebanon and gaza. all these developments require israel to consider them and try to change the situation.
over the weekend, defense minister avigdor lieberman said that mortar shells fired at israel from gaza were made in iran.
purdue university professors have presented research on rapidly charging batteries that could change the face of the electric automotive industry.
professor of earth, atmospheric and planetary science, and mathematics john cushman presented new research at the international society for porous media 9th international conference in rotterdam, netherlands. entitled redox reactions in immiscible-fluids in porous media – membraneless battery applications, the report outlines a new type of battery, and the method by which it could be recharged with unprecedented speed.
cushman called the growing worldwide sales of electric and hybrid vehicles incredible, but said that there remained strong challenges for the industry and consumer alike. chief among those concerns is the life of a hybrid or electric vehicle's battery, and the massive infrastructure development needed to keep them charged. for drivers, it boils down to practicality. the time and effort required to keep their cars running is still an ongoing hurdle.
purdue professor eric nauman is the co-founder, along with cushman, of ifbattery — a company exploring the commercial applications of their research. he highlighted the tremendous cost of developing infrastructure to handle the needed distribution and storage of the energy used by traditional electric vehicles. with cushman and nauman's new developments, they may have a solution: ifbattery is developing an energy storage system that would enable drivers to fill up their electric or hybrid vehicles with fluid electrolytes to re-energize spent battery fluids much like refueling their gas tanks.
using fluid electrolytes to power batteries gives them a much more accessible fuel supply. furthermore, the spent electrolytic fuel could be collected and recharged at a wind, solar, or hydroelectric power plant. cushman said:
instead of refining petroleum, the refiners would reprocess spent electrolytes and instead of dispensing gas, the fueling stations would dispense a water and ethanol or methanol solution as fluid electrolytes to power vehicles. users would be able to drop off the spent electrolytes at gas stations, which would then be sent in bulk to solar farms, wind turbine installations or hydroelectric plants for reconstitution or re-charging into the viable electrolyte and reused many times. it is believed that our technology could be nearly 'drop-in' ready for most of the underground piping system, rail and truck delivery system, gas stations and refineries.
with the potential for clean, efficient, and reusable fuel, both hybrid and electric vehicles could be poised for a leap into mass consumer relevance. backed up by higher capacity and recharging that is as easy as a stop at the gas station, we may be looking at the first truly pragmatic alternative to fossil-fueled vehicles. all that remains to be seen is whether the cost of implementation is prohibitive. if not, purdue and ifbattery may very well force car companies and consumers alike to take notice.

as a member of the super bowl-bound philadelphia eagles, national anthem protester and social activist malcolm jenkins is allotted a group of tickets for the upcoming super bowl.
ever the activist, jenkins decided to give his tickets to a convicted murderer who is out on parole.
the eagles strong safety told the media that he read about convicted murderer kempis songster who was getting out of prison and decided to reward the killer with super bowl tickets, cbs sports reported.
a few weeks ago, i saw an article come across my text that he was getting out, and i wanted to do something special for him, jenkins told the new york daily news on jan. 25. i knew i wanted to do something to celebrate him coming home because i understood he really dedicated himself to a life of service and he's trying to repay what he's taken from society. i know he has some great ideas and we're trying to accomplish the same thing when we talk about reform and healing our communities.
jenkins added that instead of giving the tickets to someone who is sick or well deserving, he gave the tickets to the murderer to encourage people to think outside the box and to listen and hear from one another.
the player concluded saying he is going to lean on the released killer for insight.
because he's someone i'm going to lean on for insight of what's going on, who has been through the process, knows what's going on, how people are being affected, jenkins concluded. those are the voices i want to amplify when we talk about trying to change it. you have to be able to engage, and kempis is a great example of that.
kempis songster, who was convicted of murder as a teenager, was released from maximum-security prison early after a recent supreme court decision that mandatory life sentences for minors are unconstitutional. the felon was handed a life sentence in 1988 for murdering another teenager during an argument in a philadelphia crack house, but thanks to the scotus decision he served only 30 years of that sentence.
jenkins was one of the first members of the national football league to join former san francisco 49ers second-string quarterback colin kaepernick to protest against the country, our flag, history, and first responders by raising a military black power fist during the playing of the national anthem.
jenkins mounted his protests starting in 2016 and continued them throughout the 2017 season until november when he said he decided that the issue was well worn and recognized. he also decided to stop the protests because of the $89 million the league promised to spend on social justice issues and programs.

senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky) reportedly told gop senators that he won't judge anybody for their decision in regards to objecting to the electoral college vote, which congress will count on wednesday, after previously urging them to refrain from doing so.
according to sen. kevin cramer (r-nd), who recounted the conversation to politico, mcconnell recognized that it is a weighty decision and added that each lawmaker has to make it yourselves.
'i've voted twice on declarations of war.' and he said, 'this is right up there. but … there's a lot of noise out there and i won't judge anybody for their decision,' cramer said of mcconnell.
sen. josh hawley (r-mo) was the first gop senator to announce his intention to object to electoral college votes, formally making the announcement last week:
millions of voters concerned about election integrity deserve to be heard. i will object on january 6 on their behalf pic.twitter.com/ktaappjghe — josh hawley (@hawleymo) december 30, 2020
on monday, hawley revealed left-wing activists protested outside of his home, demanding he drop his electoral college challenge, while his wife and newborn were home alone.
tonight while i was in missouri, antifa scumbags came to our place in dc and threatened my wife and newborn daughter, who can't travel, he announced, adding that they screamed threats, vandalized, and tried to pound open our door.
let me be clear: my family & i will not be intimidated by leftwing violence, he added:

on saturday, several gop senators, led by sen. ted cruz (r-tx), released a joint-letter, outlining their intention to object to electors from disputed states unless and until an emergency 10-day audit is completed.
in addition to cruz, senators signing off included ron johnson (r-wi), james lankford (r-ok), steve daines (r-mt), john kennedy (r-la), marsha blackburn (r-tn), mike braun (r-in), cynthia lummis (r-wy), roger marshall (r-ks), bill hagerty (r-tn), and tommy tuberville (r-al).
sen. kelly loeffler (r-ga), who faces off against raphael warnock in tuesday's runoff election, joined her colleagues on monday, stating her intention to vote to give president [donald] trump and the american people the fair hearing they deserve and support the objection to the electoral college certification process on january 6.
one republican senator aligned with mcconnell added that the majority leader is letting everybody reach their own conclusion here.
that's very much his leadership style on issues like this, is to not say much, the lawmaker said, according to politico.
i think he hopes we don't have too many people vote to do this, the lawmaker added. trying to convince people right now wouldn't produce much of a result when you could just give them time to think about it.
mcconnell's hands-off approach follows reports of the majority leader urging members to refrain from challenging the votes, reportedly telling them that an objection isn't in the best interest of everybody, as reported in mid-december.
i think that there was encouragement on the phone for us to accept the result, as much as it's not what we, you know, would have envisioned for the next four years, and to try to do what's best for american people, which is to look forward, sen. shelley moore capito (r-wv) said at the time.
house minority leader kevin mccarthy (r-ca), on the other hand, has explicitly approved of the challenge to the electoral college votes, explicitly calling for a debate.
i mean, you see now that senators are going to object, the house is going to object — how else do we have a way to change the election problems? he asked.
trump, meanwhile, has slammed what he dubbed the surrender caucus within the republican party, warning that it will go down in infamy as weak and ineffective 'guardians' of our nation, who were willing to accept the certification of fraudulent presidential numbers!:
french president emanuel macron threatened to ban travel from the united kingdom if stricter measures were not enacted to contain the coronavirus pandemic.
in a phone call with boris johnson on friday, macron reportedly informed the british prime minister that should the uk continue with its lax policy on coronavirus, france would be forced to shut off travel from the uk.
we clearly had to threaten him so that he would finally move, a government official told the french newspaper libération.
confirming the veracity of the report, a senior french official told politico: we had prepared the closure of our border and told prime minister johnson we would implement it that day if there was no evolution [of british measures].
following the phone call between the two leaders, boris johnson ordered pubs, restaurants, nightclubs, cinemas, and other public venues to close. the british government has claimed that the phone call with macron did not influence the decision to enact stricter measures to fight the virus.
as the pm said on friday these new measures were taken based on scientific advice and following the government's action plan set out two weeks ago, a government official said.

last week, the prime minister of france, edouard philippe, said that the uk was not adopting strong enough measures to contain the spread of the virus and warned that a travel ban would be enacted if the situation in the uk did not change.
it goes without saying that if neighbouring states such as the united kingdom spend too long continuing to avoid these containment measures, then we would have difficulty accepting british nationals who would move freely in their own country and then come to our country, philippe said.
france has enacted some of the strictest lockdown measures in europe, barring people from leaving their homes for fifteen days. those who do venture outside are required to carry a government form to justify their reason for being outside or face getting fined up to €135 euros.
on sunday, 112 people died from coronavirus, bringing the death toll since in the country to 674. the number of confirmed cases in the country rose by over 1,500 over the previous day, with 16,018 people infected with the virus.
in announcing the figures, france's director-general of health, jérôme salomon said: the virus kills and it is continuing to kill.

president donald trump may want to send fed chair jerome powell a belated christmas card thanking him for backing off his hawkish stance on monetary policy.
speaking on a panel in atlanta, flanked by predecessors janet yellen and ben bernanke, powell said the fed's monetary policy is flexible. he acknowledged the december stock market sell-off, saying central bank officials are listening carefully to financial markets.
it was a change of tune for powell. less than a month ago, powell appeared to brush off the downturn in stocks as a little volatility.
friday's panel appeared to be designed to reassure markets. powell had remarks written down on a piece of paper despite the informality of the panel setting. that seemed to indicate that he had chosen his words carefully.
as always, there is no preset path for policy, powell said. and particularly with muted inflation readings that we've seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves.
powell also said that the fed could be flexible on its balance sheet reduction, the unwind of the enormous pile of bonds that it accumulated through its quantitative easing program. last month, he had desribed the balance sheet reduction as being on auto pilot.
powell now vs then: we wouldn't hesitate to make a change if we came to the view that that balance sheet normalization…was part of the problem, we wouldn't hesitate to make a change dec 19: we would effectively have the balance sheet runoff on automatic pilot — sara eisen (@saraeisen) january 4, 2019
it worked. stocks rose sharply after the panel. the nasdaq composite, which had been down sharply on thursday, rose by more than 4 percent.
friday was powell's second attempt to reassure markets and businesses that the fed would not go overboard in its rate hikes. in mid-december, following the fed's decision to hike rates for the fourth time in 2019, powell sounded somewhat less certain about future rate hikes than he had in an interview in october. that interview with judy woodruff is widely seen as sparking the recent stock market volatility.
trump has been saying for several months that he does not think the fed should be raising rates. trump and fed officials have often appeared to disagree on how fast the economy should be growing. trump wants it to grow at 3 percent or more for several years. many fed officials think the economy has been growing faster than its long-term potential and see their role as creating conditions for a soft-landing in which growth falls back toward 2 percent.
but with inflation very low despite extremely low levels of unemployment and stronger-than-expected growth, many now think the fed should rethink its model. the economy appears to be able to grow at a faster rate and unemployment to fall further than fed economists thought was possible without inflation getting out of control. this suggests potential growth may be greater than the fed believed.
powell's comments hinted that he may be moving toward that idea–or at least to being patient and letting more evidence come in.
we will be prepared to adjust policy quickly and flexibly and use all of our tools to support the economy should that be appropriate, he said.
oddly enough, powell was asked if he would resign if trump demanded it. he said he would not. but after friday's comments and the market's reaction, that scenario now seems even less likely than it ever did.
former u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice recently criticized college basketball rules that prevent student-athletes from making money off merchandise featuring their faces or names, a report says.
rice called the rules incomprehensible but warned that the legal ramifications of the idea needs to be studied before compensation can begin, sporting news reported.
we believe that students ought to be able to benefit from name, image and likeness but you can't decide a program until you know the legal parameters, rice told usa today in a may 9 interview.
apparently speaking on recommendations offered by the commission on college basketball, a group she chaired, rice went on to say that her group could not fully expound on the idea without further study.
i think some of the commentary suggested that we didn't really speak on this issue, rice said. i think we did speak on this issue, it's just that we understand there's a legal framework that has to be developed first.
rice referred to the case of notre dame women's basketball player arike ogunbowale as a perfect example of the confusing ncaa rules on athletes benefitting from their college careers. ogunbowale was granted a waiver from the league so that she could accept payment for being on tv's dancing with the stars. the league quixotically claimed that her basketball career was not the reason she was asked to be on the show. rice claimed the basis for the waiver was absurd.
i couldn't for the life of me understand the explanation, rice said adding, because obviously, she's there because she hit two winning shots in two basketball games (in the women's final four), so that's the connection.
clearly, the rules need to be changed. however, careful thought needs to be put into the mechanics of that change, rice said.
players have been trying to get the league to change the rules on benefitting from their likeness for some time. there were two recent federal lawsuits on the matter.
one was a case brought by former ucla basketball player ed o'bannon who filed suit claiming that college players ought to be compensated when schools use their names and likenesses for advertising. in 2016, o'bannon tried to get the u.s. supreme court to take the case, but the court refused his entreaty. the high court's move left in place a lower court ruling from 2015 that favored o'bannon, though it was a decision that did not satisfy advocates for college athletes to make money from advertising.
another suit was filed by former arizona state quarterback sam keller who wanted to be compensated by a video game company for its use of his likeness and name in a video football game. in 2014, the ncaa announced it had reached a $20 million settlement in the case.

southampton, england, feb. 18 (upi) — researchers in england have outfitted unmanned micro air vehicles with new wings inspired by bats.
the membrane wings are without mechanical components, making them lighter and more flexible. voltage inputs manipulate the wings mid-flight, allowing them to function like artificial muscles and change shape in response to shifting aerodynamic forces.
mavs using the new, more economical wings use less energy and are able to make longer flights.
a team of researchers from the university of southampton and imperial college london have been working to incorporate the physiology of bats into unmanned aerial vehicle and mav technology.
high-speed cameras and computer models have allowed scientists to observe and mimic the aerodynamic advantages of bat wings.
we've successfully demonstrated the fundamental feasibility of mavs incorporating wings that respond to their environment, just like those of the bats that have fueled our thinking, bharath ganapathisubramani, project leader and southampton professor, said in a news release.
we've also shown in laboratory trials that active wings can dramatically alter the performance, he said. the combined computational and experimental approach that characterized the project is unique in the field of bio-inspired mav design.
ganapathisubramani and his colleagues are now working on incorporating the wings into current commercial mav designs.
this is a paradigm shift in the approach to mav design, project researcher rafael palacios said. instead of a traditional approach of scaling down existing aircraft design methods, we constantly change the membrane shape under varying wind conditions to optimize its aerodynamic performance.
the mispronunciation of a first name, a recycled power point presentation, and a toddler's taste in footwear all factored in nike losing the nba's biggest star to rival under armour.
in a long exploration of nike's major mistake, espn's ethan sherwood strauss noted the sportswear leader muffed its chance to secure curry in its stable of big name basketball athletes through a long series of missteps that showed the company's blasé indifference to his rising star.
since his nba debut as a first round, seventh overall pick in 2009, curry has become one of the most exciting players on the hardwoods. in fact, the young north carolinian is already being considered one of the greatest shooters of all time. he has amassed many accolades and helped lead the warriors to the nba championship in 2015. along with being the nba's most valuable player that year he is also a three times nba all-star from 2014 to 2016. and that is just to start as he has a long list of achievements going back to college.
as to his sportswear contract, it is reported that curry's worth to under armour (ua) is an amazing $14 billion.
on march 3, 2016, business insider noted that curry has been a boon to ua. ua's u.s. basketball shoe sales have increased over 350 percent ytd. its stephen curry signature shoe business is already bigger than those of lebron, kobe and every other player except michael jordan. if curry is the next jordan, our call will likely be wrong.
but as espn's strauss reports, nike had its chance to keep curry in its stable of nba stars and muffed the whole deal from word go.
as strauss continued his report, he revealed that nike didn't bother to offer curry the chance to lead a training camp — something he really wanted to do — didn't give him much personal attention, delivered a power point presentation with kevin durant's name in it, and even mispronounced his name during a pitch session!
even after curry announced he wanted to go with ua in 2013 nike still had an opportunity to keep him on its team by matching the mere $4 million offer ua had given him to kick off their association. and as strauss notes, $4 million is chump change to a company worth $16 billion.
by some accounts, losing curry was one of nike's biggest goofs. as strauss notes, sonny vaccaro said, this is nike's biggest fear. they can't overcome this in the shoe business. this is going to be detrimental to them. psychologically.
but maybe nike was never in the running in the first place. all because curry's one-year-old toddler made the final decision.
my favorite story is riley, curry has said of his early decision process. strauss goes on to explain, it's a few weeks before a final decision on the shoe contract must be made. at his agent jeff austin's house in hermosa beach, california, curry surveys the array of shoes before him. he asks his baby daughter, 'riley, which one do you like?'
at this point, riley is little over 1 year old. she is presented with a nike sneaker, an adidas sneaker and an under armour sneaker. she picks up shoe one, a nike. threw it over her shoulder, curry says. she picked up shoe two, threw it over her shoulder. she picked up the third shoe, walked over and handed it to me. it was the under armour anatomix spawn. so i knew right then, curry says, smiling.
however it went down, the fact remains that steph curry has become one of the most amazing young players in the nba and under armour is laughing all the way to the bank.

madrid (ap) — if you're taking a bus in the spanish capital, be sure to keep your legs to yourself.
madrid authorities on monday started putting up signs banning the practice of 'manspreading' — opening one's legs so wide you invade other's seating space —on city buses as part of their new etiquette guidelines.
emt municipal transportation company says the sign is designed to discourage physical postures that bother people.
the sign features an illustration of a man with splayed legs with a red 'x' above. the text beneath urges passengers to respect the space of others.
there are no sanctions or fines for those indulging in the practice.
the bus company incorporated the ban following an internet signature campaign by a woman's group, mujeres en lucha (fighting women).
in their campaign petition, the women said it was a very common practice.
la @emtmadrid añade una nueva señal a bordo del bus para evitar el #manspreading: respeta el espacio de los demás. https://t.co/xg5lfwb4ta pic.twitter.com/ksyeu45gai — ayuntamiento madrid (@madrid) june 6, 2017
it's not difficult to see women with their legs closed and very uncomfortable because there's a man beside them who's invading their space with their legs, it added.
the group said women were taught to sit with their legs together whereas men are ingrained with the idea of territorial hierarchy, as if the space belongs to them.
emt said it felt its initiative, which also includes asking passengers not to eat or drink on buses, to keep their backpacks on or put their feet up on seats, was being well received. again, there are no sanctions for any of these other requests.
when a person opens their legs so wide it disturbs others, this is rude, said alvaro gomez jordana moya, 60, as he waited for a bus in madrid. it's also uncomfortable having to ask someone, 'please, can you close your legs'.
it's a problem because people don't respect seating, said another bus passenger maria carmen ventosa, 46. it should change things, if only out of respect for others.
madrid's underground train company said it had no plans to follow suit.
the last city has fallen and the traveller has been taken. now the guardians must regain their powers and rebuild their arsenals to save the earth in destiny 2.
players will travel to new worlds, gain new powers, and find and equip new weapons and armor in bungie's follow-up to their hit sci-fi first-person shooter destiny. destiny 2 has a great story, an iconic new villain, awesome characters you want to go on an epic adventure with, and of course, tons of the amazing gameplay that destiny is known for, said activision ceo eric hirshberg. we, along with our partners at bungie, have listened carefully to our community, and have added thoughtful innovations that make the game, and all of its content, more accessible to more types of players than ever before.
bungie appears to have finally listened to the many players of destiny that were discouraged by the game's lack of matchmaking for end-game content, admitting that only half of all players who reached the game's level cap had ever completed one of destiny's high-level raids and stressing that with destiny 2, gamers will always have someone to play with through the game's new guided games matchmaking feature.
with the sequel, the team are paying close attention to welcoming new and returning guardians to the universe with something for every type of gamer, including gameplay for solo, cooperative and competitive players with new places to explore and adventures to conquer, bungie ceo pete parsons said. changes to the series' open-world, quests structure, and the addition of an in-game clan system for players all look to bring significant change to destiny 2.
destiny 2 will launch on september 8 on playstation 4, xbox one, and through blizzard entertainment's battle.net platform on pc.
the public university of oregon spent $23,000 on research before deciding whether to change the name of several buildings on campus, which students claim have racist histories.
a black student group at the university of oregon demanded that campus buildings be renamed after uncovering that several of the buildings are named after men with controversial histories.
dunn hall, a prominent building on campus, is set to be renamed after the students uncovered that the building's namesake was once a member of the ku klux klan.
despite the concerns of the students, it's unclear why administrators poured such a significant amount of funds into research on the decision.
the report was one of several inputs the president considered in his deliberations, but he was very appreciative of the thoughtful approach taken by the historians, argued university spokesman tobin klinger.
they are used at the discretion of the president for a variety of purposes for the advancement of the organization, he added.
dunn hall will be renamed for a man or woman whose life exemplifies the characteristics of racial diversity and inclusion that dunn despised, according to university president michael schill, who oversaw the process.
in addition to the questionable funding decision made on researching the decision to rename buildings, the university has plans to build a $3 million black cultural center.
according to a press release, the center will be an engine for black students' academic success, providing the room and resources to grow stronger intellectually, ethically, physically and as a community, and will connect black students with resources for student success and leadership, as well as serve as a site for seminars and programs that serve the uo and all of oregon.

a michigan state representative wants residents to go to restaurants and order big the day after gov. gretchen whitmer's (d-mi) latest lockdown is scheduled to end.
state rep. john damoose (r) is introducing a resolution to declare january 16 restaurant dine-in day, he told the kyle olson show this week.
whitmer's mid-november three-week pause — which banned in-person dining and has been extended twice — is slated to end january 15.
i talked to so many restaurant owners who said, 'okay, i guess we can open on this date and it was less than 48 hours prior to the expiration that this was extended all the day [sic] to january 15,' and these businesses, you know what they did? they went out and stocked up, they got their workforce ready to go, and then they got the rug pulled out from them, damoose said.
all the stuff they bought spoiled, so it's just like adding insult to injury, he said.
he said of his resolution, which will be introduced on january 13 — the first day of the new session — it's entirely positive. we're living up to her extension to the 15th, fine, whatever. we don't agree with it, but we're going to live up to it. now, we're going to go out and celebrate these businesses.
damoose acknowledged a resolution does not do much, but the intent is to set the tone that we're serious about this.
he said many other representatives are rallying behind it, and some of these restaurants are just plain happy to see someone supporting them.
damoose told the kyle olson show that businesses and residents have been met with hostile message after hostile message from whitmer and her administration.
i think it's time we change our tone, he said, and thank residents for complying with the orders for so long.
damoose represents the northern lower peninsula and southern upper peninsula, including the tourist destination of mackinac island. he said those locations were able to get by in 2020, but many of them are wondering if they will be able to stay open if the restrictions continue much longer.
he said one way the legislature can restore some balance and decrease whitmer acting unilaterally is to use her administration's funding as a lever.
we do control the power of the purse, damoose said. reining in health and human services, we do control their budget, he said.
that is the department that began issuing restrictions after the state supreme court ruled whitmer's executive orders unconstitutional in october.
damoose noted the chairman of the house appropriations committee said future funding would be tied to repealing lockdown orders.
as for the restaurant dine-in day on january 16, he encouraged residents to order big and tip lots.

thousands of saudi women are now enjoying the right to attend football matches among other basic improvements in women's rights under the crown prince mohammed bin salman's modernization program.
in january, women were finally allowed to attend a match alongside men at the king abdullah sports city stadium in jeddah, although they had to enter through a separate turnstile.
it means that i am human, secondary school teacher nora told sky news at a riyadh derby game. no other can prevent me from doing what i want. no other [can] decide what i want. i am the one who decides.
this event proves that we are heading for a prosperous future, 32-year-old lamya khaled nasser told agence france press. i am very proud to be a witness to this massive change.
the decision allowing women to attend football matches followed the announcement last year that the ban on women drivers will also be lifted.
i will be ecstatic, i will be happy. i will be sad for all the years that passed in my life that i wasn't able to do such basic elementary step of mobility, said madeha al ajroush, a women's rights activist who has previously been jailed for driving a car in protest.
at 18, women usually automatically get behind the wheel and drive and do their errands, she continued. i had to wait until i was 63. that saddens me [that] they took away a lot from my life.
the loosening of restrictions falls in line with the crown prince's modernization movement known as the vision 2030 economic program, which saudi leadership officially approved last april. as well as promoting economic growth, the program also intends to liberalize many of the country's islamic conditions.
last year alone, authorities legalized yoga, held their first women's basketball tournament, and made roles available for women to work in the ministry of justice. the kingdom has also recently lifted a 35-year ban on commercial cinemas, with the company vue cinemas this week announcing plans to open 30 cinemas over the next three years.
however, the country's human rights record still remains well below that of many of its allies, with citizens regularly arrested and detained for crimes such as religious blasphemy, criticising the government, or dressing inappropriately.
mohammed bin salman's newfound authority has also been characterized by the sweeping arrests of dozens of saudi businessmen, officials, and even royalty on corruption charges, although many of them have since been released.

las vegas (ap) — bernie sanders scored a resounding victory in nevada's presidential caucuses on saturday, cementing his status as the democrats' national front-runner amid escalating tensions over whether he's too liberal to defeat president donald trump.
the 78-year-old vermont senator successfully rallied his fiercely loyal base and tapped into support from nevada's large latino community as the democratic contest moved for the first time into a state with a significant minority population.
the win built on sanders' win earlier this month in the new hampshire primary. he essentially tied for first place in the iowa caucuses with pete buttigieg, the former mayor of south bend, indiana, who has sought to position himself as an ideological counter to sanders' unabashed progressive politics, but was fighting for a distant second place in nevada.
the victory, while encouraging for sanders supporters, only deepens concern among establishment-minded democratic leaders who fear that the self-described democratic socialist is too extreme to defeat trump. sanders for decades has been calling for transformative policies to address inequities in politics and the economy, none bigger than his signature medicare for all health care plan that would replace the private insurance system with a government-run universal system.
despite establishment anxiety, moderates are struggling to unify behind a single candidate, and the vote on saturday was again split between several centrists, including buttigieg and former vice president joe biden.
also in the mix: massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, who desperately needed a spark to revive her stalled bid; billionaire tom steyer, who spent more than $12 million on nevada television, and minnesota sen. amy klobuchar, who hoped to prove her strong new hampshire finish was no fluke.
after the chaos of iowa's caucuses, there were concerns about nevada's similar setup. but no major problems were in sight.
at noon, under sunny skies, dozens of uniformed housekeepers and casino workers cast ballots in the bellagio, one of seven casino-resorts on the las vegas strip among 200 locations statewide that hosted caucuses. nevada is the third contest on a 2020 election calendar marked by chaos and uncertainty after the opening votes in iowa and new hampshire, overwhelmingly white, rural states.
the first presidential contest in the west is testing the candidates' strength with black and latino voters for the first time in 2020. nevada's population aligns more with the u.s. as a whole, compared with iowa and new hampshire: 29% latino, 10% black and 9% asian american and pacific islander.
self-described democratic socialist bernie sanders has emerged as the front-runner in the race so far as a half-dozen more-moderate candidates criticize one another. each wants to be the preferred alternative to the vermont senator in the race to take on president donald trump in november.
in a show of confidence, sanders left nevada early to rally supporters in texas, which offers one of the biggest delegate troves in just 10 days on super tuesday. the progressive senator told cheering supporters in el paso that trump is a pathological liar running a corrupt administration.
when we come together there is nothing we can't accomplish, sanders declared.
the nevada verdict represents the third in a primary season that will span all 50 states and several u.s. territories, ending only at the party's national convention in july. but with two more rounds of voting scheduled over the next 10 days — including super tuesday's massive delegate haul — the party may identify a consensus candidate long before the convention.
sanders and his allies were increasingly confident about his strength in the race. in nevada, he has strong support from latinos and rank-and-file union workers who have warmed to his calls to transform the nation's economy and political system to help the working class.
there was skepticism about pete buttigieg's ability to win over a more diverse set of voters after strong finishes in iowa and new hampshire. joe biden, who struggled in those early states, looked to nevada's voters of color to prove he still has a viable path to the nomination.
elizabeth warren and klobuchar were fighting for momentum, hoping to benefit from a sudden surge of outside money from newly created super pacs.
klobuchar, campaigning in her home state of minnesota saturday night, claimed nevada success no matter what. as usual i think we have exceeded expectations.
new york billionaire mike bloomberg, who dominated the political conversation this week after a poor debate-stage debut, wasn't on the ballot. he's betting everything on a series of delegate-rich states that begin voting next month.
billionaire tom steyer spent more than $12 million of his own money on television advertising in nevada, according to data obtained by the associated press.
trump weighed in on social media, continuing his weeks-long push to sow discord between sanders and his democratic rivals.
looks like crazy bernie is doing well in the great state of nevada. biden & the rest look weak, trump tweeted. congratulations bernie, & don't let them take it away from you!
the stakes were high for nevada democrats to avoid a repeat of the chaos in iowa, and it appeared saturday's caucuses were largely successful.
the developer the nevada democrats had planned to use had its mobile app fail spectacularly in iowa. nearly three weeks later, iowa democratic officials have yet to post final results. but resources poured into nevada, as democrats realized they could ill afford another poorly executed election.
unlike state primaries and the november election, which are run by government officials, caucuses are overseen by state parties.
nevada democrats sought to minimize problems by creating multiple redundancies in their reporting system, relying on results called in by phone, a paper worksheet filled out by caucus organizers, a photo of that worksheet sent in by text message and electronic results captured with a google form. they relied on trusted commercial tech that appeared to smooth the process.
in addition, it appeared nevada democrats were able to successfully navigate a complicated process for adding early voting to the caucus process. nearly 75,000 people cast early ballots over a four-day period, and the party was able to process those in time for saturday so they could be integrated into the in-person vot.
at the bellagio caucus site, 41-year-old christian nielsen, a scuba diver for the cirque du soleil show o, saidhe backed sanders because he believes the country needs a major change in the white house.
we need somebody in the white house who has been on the right side of history for their entire career, somebody who stands with the working class, and will make things more fair for everybody, nielsen said.
the democrats' 2020 nomination fight shifted beyond nevada even before the final results were known.
only biden, buttigieg and steyer were still in the state when news of sanders' victory was announced.
sanders and klobuchar spent the night in super tuesday states. and warren, who began saturday in las vegas, was to finish the day in washington state, which hosts its election on march 10 but has already begun offering early voting.

house speaker rep. paul ryan wants congress to pass a law that would cause puerto rico bondholders who own $73 billion in notes from the territory's government to be treated the same way the federal government treated chrysler bondholders back in 2008 and 2009.
friday morning, ryan addressed a special meeting of the gop caucus to attempt to persuade recalcitrant conservatives the cram down is a good idea.
if the puerto rico oversight, management, and economic stability act (promesa) rep. sean duffy has sponsored and ryan supports becomes law, puerto rico would use the special dispensation provided the territory in the bill to force bondholders to accept pennies on the dollar prior to or during a bankruptcy filing.
as george mason university professor todd zywicki and the heritage foundation's james sherk wrote of the chrysler bondholder cram down:
in bankruptcy, the secured status of these bonds should have meant that the secured creditors would be paid in full before any money was allocated to subordinate creditors, such as the uaw's veba plans. instead, the plan imposed by the government forced chrysler's secured creditors to accept only 29 cents on the dollar, while the uaw recovered most of the value of its claims.
as breitbart news reported previously, if promesa passes, puerto rico's bondholders would receive the same kind of treatment as chrysler's bondholders.
[the] plan that would let puerto rico wipe out $33 billion of its $73 billion debt in bankruptcy.
leadership of both political parties are backing the creation of a federal control board and legal authorization for puerto rico to file bankruptcy. the effort would pave the way for a cramdown of about 45 percent of the island's debt, without any spending cuts.
conservatives in the house say that's a bad idea.
ryan is technically right that the promesa bill is not the same kind of immediate bailout of billions in direct loans to puerto rico as the 2008 auto bailout of chrysler and general motors, a good portion of which was subsequently written off.
but in many respects, his argument today echoes the words of former president george w. bush, who defended the tarp bailout of banks that he later used to bail out the auto companies when he infamously said: i've abandoned free market principles to save the free market.
ryan's need to intervene in order to save the increasingly unpopular puerto rico bailout is urgent.
on wednesday, the house natural resources committee rejected promesa in a surprise move, preventing it from coming to the floor of the house for a vote.
the bill's passage through the committee was expected to be a slam dunk.
as recently as tuesday, a confident natural resources committee chairman, rep. rob bishop, said it is the island's best shot to mitigate its financial collapse and future calls for a bailout, which would be untenable. congress must act now to avoid a humanitarian crisis that will severely impact 3.5 million americans living in puerto rico and millions of americans on the mainland.
the bill's sponsor, rep. sean duffy, was equally confident:
the three and a half million americans living in the u.s. territory deserve the attention and support of congress. after decades of mismanagement, puerto rico's investors also deserve better. a protracted and chaotic legal battle would not serve the interest of creditors or the island. worse would be a mutli-billion dollar taxpayer bailout thrust on the shoulders of america's taxpayers and retirees. the promesa act will ensure that the island meets its debt obligations in a controlled, responsible manner, without saddling the u.s. taxpayers with the bill. if we get this right, we have an opportunity to put the people of puerto rico on a path to economic opportunity. however, if we do nothing, the american people will be on the hook.
but that confidence evaporated in 48 fast moving hours.
speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) will try to sell fellow republicans on a bill to help puerto rico deal with its debt crisis at a special meeting friday. ryan said the morning conference meeting would be solely devoted to puerto rico, in an effort to educate members and bring them on board with the bill, which has faced persistent conservative opposition. a lot of members are just coming up to speed on this, he said thursday. it is why tomorrow morning, we're doing a policy conference on just the issue of puerto rico. the members who have been spending a lot of time on this are going to give a presentation to the broader conference to bring people up to speed. the fate of that legislation took a turn for the worse late wednesday, when the house natural resources committee abruptly canceled a markup of the bill. republicans said the delay was spurred by democrats in congress and the obama administration. committee chairman rob bishop (r-utah) said the administration was still trying to alter the bill, making a markup impossible. and ryan contended that the bill did not receive consideration because democrats were not willing to back it. but a wednesday morning hearing on the bill also made clear there was ample conservative discontent as well. several committee members lambasted the proposal, arguing it was a bailout for an island territory with a record of fiscal mismanagement. . . the current bill does not commit any federal funds to puerto rico.
instead, it establishes an outside control board to monitor the island's finances, and allows the island to go to court to try and restructure some of its debt if voluntary negotiations with creditors fail.
on thursday, ryan gave an advance preview of his pitch:
there is chaos occurring. puerto rico passed a law negating, arguably, their debt. we want to bring order to the chaos. and the need for puerto rican legislation is to bring order to the chaos. and my number one priority as speaker of the house with respect to this issue is to keep the american taxpayer away from this. there will no taxpayer bailout. we want an oversight board, just like we did with the district of columbia a number of years ago, to be involved, to provide the kind of leadership and structure that is necessary for puerto rico to gets its own fiscal house in order and to guide the kind of debt restructuring that is necessary so that puerto rico can continue to access the capital markets and keep the taxpayer out of this. that is our primary responsibility is to protect the american taxpayer and to help bring order to the chaos that will befall puerto rico if the status quo continues going in the direction it's going.
ryan took exception to television ads calling promesa a bailout of puerto rico:
i'm not going to characterize who is behind what ads because i don't know who is behind what ads. a bailout is getting the taxpayer involved. we are — our whole entire purpose of this is to prevent the taxpayer from getting involved and not having a taxpayer bailout. that is why we are going the path we are going to prevent to taxpayer from being involved in this.
what ryan fails to note is that puerto rico has been a regular recipient of funds from federal taxpayers for years, and promesa will do nothing to change that pattern of support.
in fact, congress is currently considering a separate proposal to increase federal subsidies directly to puerto rico residents through the extension of earned income tax credits. that's a neat trick, especially since residents of puerto rico currently do not have to file or pay any federal taxes.
in 2013, the federal government spent $2 billion on food stamps to residents of puerto rico, and that amount appears to be increasing with each additional year.
an estimated one-third of the island's residents receive food stamps.
forbes contributor martin sullivan argues that puerto rico is already receiving $8 billion in subsidies from an obsure irs ruling:
there's no one in the administration or in d.c. that's contemplating a federal bailout of puerto rico, white house press secretary josh earnest told reporters on june 29. that statement is simply false. it may be true that the treasury is not contemplating cash subsidies or loan guarantees for puerto rico, but it already is providing something just as good: tax credits for u.s. companies operating in puerto rico on a puerto rican tax designed to give those companies u.s. tax credits. sound complicated? yep. that's why nobody is paying attention. think about it this way: puerto rico imposes a tax that the federal government pays. u.s. companies operating there are just the middlemen. here are the details. since 2011, approximately 20 percent of puerto rico's total revenue collections have come from a temporary excise tax on certain products manufactured in puerto rico. . . now here's the financial magic. on march 30, 2011, the irs released notice 2011-2 ruling that this new excise tax was a foreign tax creditable against u.s. taxes. the notice stated that the new tax was novel and that determination of the creditability of the excise tax requires the resolution of a number of legal and factual issues. until these issues were resolved, the irs would not challenge taxpayers' claims that the tax was creditable. further, if the irs decided the credit was not creditable in the future, the new position would apply only prospectively.
thus, most of the new tax burden imposed on multinationals doing business in puerto rico was eliminated by treasury.
in 2008, president george w. bush acknowledged that he abandoned free market principles when he tried to sell the tarp bailout to the american people.
at least president bush was honest about what he had done.
speaker ryan, it seems, wants to obscure the real consequences of promesa as he tries to sell it to his house colleagues.
matt damon is jumping to the defense of fellow actor sean penn amid mounting criticism of penn's clandestine exclusive interview for rolling stone with violent mexican drug kingpin joaquín el chapo guzmán loera.
backstage at sunday's golden globe awards, after he was named best actor in a motion picture musical or comedy for the martian, damon said he had yet to read penn's in-depth interview with the former fugitive.
i haven't read it yet; i definitely plan to, said damon, according to variety. i subscribe to rolling stone, so it's already been sent to me.
the actor then defended penn's actions, saying, but look, it's nothing new, actors going and seeking out meetings like this.
it's part of what we do in our job really well and sean somehow figured out that he had an audience with this person and i'm sure was pursuing something creatively and thought a meeting with him would be valuable, so he did it, said damon.
meanwhile, former talk show host and current fox news personality gerlado rivera took to his twitter page to defend penn and to place some of the blame for the atrocities carried out by el chapo's sinoloa drug cartel on the united states.
if it hasnt happened already it will soon #elchapo will be replaced by other drug kingpins as long as usa keep spending billions to get high — geraldo rivera (@geraldorivera) january 10, 2016
folks getting mad at penn cause he got chummy w el chapo why?penn wasnt acting as a journalist he was one risking alot to get huge exclusive — geraldo rivera (@geraldorivera) january 10, 2016
mystifying how outraged so many are at @seanpenn is it because he's a lefty? it certainly c/n be because he intv'd world's most wanted man. — geraldo rivera (@geraldorivera) january 11, 2016
el chapo escaped from a maximum security mexican prison in july of last year, but he was recaptured on friday. his drug cartel is believed to be responsible for thousands of violent murders.
in october, penn traveled to mexico, where he interviewed el chapo for rolling stone. that interview was published on saturday, a day after the drug lord was arrested following a firefight with authorities in the northwest mexican town of los mochis.
recounting a harrowing journey including remote locations, guns, and throw away cell phones, penn described the drug lord as a humble, rural mexican, whose perception of his place in the world offers a window into an extraordinary riddle of cultural disparity.
do you dream? …do you have hopes for your life? …if you could change the world, would you? were a few of the questions penn asked the fugitive, who was also allotted editorial control of the interview's first draft.
in the interview, el chapo also brags to penn that he supplies more heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana than anybody else in the world, and expresses no remorse for the violent actions carried out on his behalf.
rolling stone's decision to allow penn, who is not a journalist, the opportunity to interview el chapo is leading to criticism, as is the publication's decision to give the cartel leader editorial control over the interview.
despite efforts by both penn and el chapo's people to cover their digital tracks to protect the fugitive drug lord's location from law enforcement, penn's actions reportedly unwittingly helped authorities capture the cartel leader.
a source told breitbart texas el chapo likely would not have been captured had it not been for penn's meeting, as authorities were able to identify hundreds of radios and cell phones and get a complete map of targets for electronic intel collection.
rhode island bishop thomas tobin has registered his frustration with the democrats' abortion extremism, wondering aloud why pro-lifers are no longer welcome in the party.
as the presidential primary shifts to new england, it's sad to note that all of the major democratic candidates are pro-abortion, supporting even partial-birth abortion, wrote the redoubtable bishop tobin in a tweet wednesday.
where are pro-life democrats supposed to turn? or are pro-life voters not welcome in the democratic party? he continued.

in early 2017, dnc chairman tom perez established an abortion litmus test for the party, effectively ruling out the possibility of pro-life democrats.
every democrat, like every american, should support a woman's right to make her own choices about her body and her health, perez said at the time. that is not negotiable and should not change city by city or state by state.
at a time when women's rights are under assault from the white house, the republican congress, and in states across the country, he added, we must speak up for this principle as loudly as ever and with one voice.
at that time, perez became the first chairman of the party to require absolute ideological purity on abortion rights, promising to only back democratic candidates who embrace a woman's right to choose to eliminate her child.
the official 2016 platform of the democratic party has been dubbed the most pro-abortion platform in history, and the president of naral pro-choice america ilyse hogue called the 55-page document far and away the most progressive platform on reproductive health, freedom and justice in the history of the party.
democrat presidential hopeful pete buttigieg recently confirmed the party's intransigent pro-abortion position, effectively ruling out the possibility of pro-life democrats.
i am pro-choice, and i believe that a woman ought to be able to make that decision, buttigieg said in a fox news town hall in iowa when questioned about the party's lack of diversity regarding abortion.
in response, kristen day, executive director of democrats for life of america, threatened to withdraw support from candidates who would exclude pro-life democrats from the party.
we've had enough, ms. day told catholic news agency (cna) following her personal encounter with buttigieg, who said he would be willing to live without the support of pro-life voters in order to maintain his total support for abortion-on-demand.
in her interview, day expressed her chagrin over the democrats' slavery to the abortion industry, noting that pro-life democrats are simply fed up.
these presidential candidates are so afraid of the abortion lobby that they will make no room for pro-life democrats, she said, because they're afraid that they're going to lose all their money and support.
i just wanted to know if he [buttigieg] thought there was room for us in the party. and he doesn't, she said.
the party's abortion extremism, she said, is not going to be a good long-term strategy for them.
many catholics have also registered their exasperation with the democrats' alliance with abortion industry, echoing the position of bishop tobin.
i am convinced that the democratic party has moved so far away from moral decency that it's impossible for any catholic to make the case, in a reasonable way, for why it's okay for him/her to remain a democrat, and vote for democrat politicians, wrote catholic author shane schaetzel in 2019.
how could any catholic be supportive of a party, and politicians, who advocate and facilitate the wholesale slaughter of innocent human life? he asked.
after experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) upon retiring from the u.s. army, a veteran launched a martial arts fight club to aid other veterans to address their own issues.
veteran todd vance served in the army, beginning after the attacks on september 11 until his retirement in 2005. in service, he led over 250 missions as a squad leader. but, when he returned home, he began to flounder when back in society.
in an interview with cnn, vance noted that he was excited to leave the service and get back home. but it wasn't long before things began to overwhelm him. at first, it was all elation. i was just happy to be alive and happy to be out of the military, vance said. slowly but surely, reality was setting in about what i had seen and what i had done.
it wasn't long before vance was drinking too much. he became withdrawn but eventually decided something had to change.
after his diagnosis with ptsd, vance began training in martial arts, and said it changed his life. it gave me the structure, the discipline, the camaraderie, the routine that i needed to have in my life that i was missing so much from the military. before training, i had no reason not to drink until 3 in the morning. i was training six days a week, often two times a day, and eating clean,  he said.
soon, the veteran began to wonder if his experience could be replicated by others who suffer ptsd.
by 2012 vance had created pugilistic offensive warrior tactics (p.o.w.), a non-profit organization aimed at helping soldiers address their symptoms of ptsd and to adjust back to civilian life.
martial arts is focused on technique and fitness. … we have served more than 275 veterans, and all the success stories we have is a testament to the effectiveness of the program, vance said. we see people get right out of the military, they're young, they're a mess, they don't have any employment or social skills. two or three years later, they are working on their master's degree.
vance says his group works well for those who commit to the program. a study of 30 participants showed a 90 percent improvement in physical health and an 80 percent relief of symptoms of ptsd.

an alabama teacher says school officials told her monday to remove a shirt with the words just pray on it because the shirt violated the school dress code.
chris burrell, who works as a teacher in the mobile county school district, told wala she wore the shirt to support a local 11-year-old girl diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor last year.
an organization called aubreigh's army designed the shirt to raise money for the girl, aubreigh nicholas, who had been receiving treatment. the organization's crowdfunding page for aubreigh's treatment raised $45,645 as of saturday afternoon.
the school principal, allegedly unaware the shirt was to support a crowdfunding campaign, asked burrell to go home and change her shirt to reflect the school's dress code.
mobile county school district superintendent martha peek said burrell's shirt violated the dress code because it reflected certain beliefs.
we have to be cognizant of everyone's beliefs or everyone's thoughts in a public school, peek told wala.
burrell wrote a facebook post, which received approximately 800 shares before she deleted it, saying she did not intend to promote religion by wearing the shirt.
i didn't think twice about it. i wasn't trying to promote religion; it was just my monday feel-good shirt. burrell wrote.
the school district reportedly did not take further action against burrell after asking her to change her shirt.
we're totally supporting her, said peek. i think that this was just an unfortunate connection there, but still the principal would have had to exercise her judgment.
the wall street journal (wsj) noted on thursday that crown prince mohammed bin salman (mbs) is pushing a return to the tolerant, moderate islam that is open to the world, to all the religions and traditions of its people as part of saudi arabia's major economic reform plan.
at the heart of saudi arabia's recent cultural and political upheaval is an understanding that the country must become more compatible with the western world and more hospitable to foreign investment, in order to manage the transition away from an oil-based economy with limitless deep pockets. possibly the trickiest aspect of this transformation will be an islamic reformation in the notoriously strict kingdom.
as the journal goes on to note, mbs is looking quite a way back into history for that memory of moderate saudi islam, since its harsh blend of strict wahhabi islam was brewed up in the 18th century by the eponymous cleric mohammed ibn abd al-wahhab. tribal influences, and of course the presence of islam's holy cities of mecca and medina, have pushed the kingdom in an islamist direction ever since.
the key event in recent saudi islamic history is often underappreciated by outside observers: the siege of the grand mosque in mecca, in which militants occupied the holiest shrine of islam for 15 days in 1979. the wsj mentions it only briefly, but the siege dovetailed with the revolution in iran to change both the sunni and shiite wings of the islamic world.
it is best understood as a theocratic coup, and not an unsuccessful one because it permanently altered the relationship between saudi arabia's royal family, secular bureaucracy, and hardline islamist clergy. the government did much to curry favor with the wahhabi extremists to prevent anything like the grand mosque attack from happening again. the most pessimistic interpretation of the aftermath is that fundamentalists effectively blackmailed the wealthy saudi government into bankrolling extremism and terrorism. the siege made the government look weak, dishonest, and decadent to many saudis.
the grand mosque terrorist incident was also a landmark moment in deteriorating relations between saudi arabia and iran, and by extension sunni and shiite islam, since iran was widely believed to be involved in the attack. a dismal contest between saudi arabia and iran began to demonstrate which was more pious and faithful to islamic law. fundamentalism spread rapidly across formerly liberal and cosmopolitan cities across the middle east, which until the islamist upheaval of the late seventies resembled american and european cities of the same era. it didn't help matters that islamic fundamentalism mixed easily with marxist quackery.
some find the speed of crown prince mohammed bin salman's reforms astonishing, or worry that he is moving too quickly, but margherita stancati at the wall street journal recalls that fundamentalism descended upon saudi arabia very quickly forty years ago:
the mixing of unrelated men and women, let alone singing and dancing, was no longer acceptable. cinemas closed and music stopped. in public, women were forced to wear face-covering veils, which in parts of the country such as asir had been virtually nonexistent. the religious police, formally known as the committee for the promotion of virtue and the prevention of vice, was given the job of enforcing the new order. radical islamists infused the school curriculum with the teachings of wahhabi scholars. textbooks instructed students to hate christians and jews and denigrated shiite muslims. some of the more extreme views often came from teachers, who sometimes recruited students to extremist causes. saudi charities linked to the government helped spread that interpretation of islam beyond the kingdom's borders, inspiring generations of jihadists.
as stancati notes, even young women eager for reform in saudi arabia today grew up being taught that drawing pictures of animals was an insult to allah's sacred and unique ability to create life, or that listening to music for pleasure would get them tortured for all eternity in the afterlife by having hot metal poured in their ears. top saudi clerics criticized the government for giving women the right to drive by saying it would give them easy access to worldly temptation, and as we know, women are weak and easily tempted.
however, the saudi public overwhelmingly supports ending the ban on women drivers. younger saudis in particular grasp that they need to become more socially compatible with the rest of the world if they are to compete on the global stage, in an era when oil is no longer the bottomless spring of easy money it once was.
crucially, there does not seem to be any massive fundamentalist pushback lurking, comparable to how saudi modernization at the beginning of the oil boom fed the resentments that erupted in 1979. the government is making a serious effort to nourish more moderate interpretations of islam and improve education.
granted, some of the social liberalization described by stancati is incremental, such as upscale riyadh women getting to decide what color fabric they wish to be wrapped in from head to toe, instead of having to settle for all black. also, liberalization in the big saudi cities is much more noticeable than in small towns and distant areas.
retired pacific fleet commander admiral james lyons noted in the washington times in december that saudi demographics are now remarkably skewed toward the younger generation, as 70 percent of the population is under 30 years old, and they have little patience for onerous islamic restrictions. he also noted that the post-oil saudi economy will have to welcome women into the workforce, which necessarily involves lifting restrictions upon them, such as allowing them to drive.
lyons is willing to cut the crown prince a lot of slack for playing rough as he consolidates power, because it's necessary to implement rapid reforms against bureaucratic and social inertia in saudi arabia. there is also some comfort in knowing that mbs has practical dollars-and-cents reasons to make his reforms stick; if his sense of idealism flags, the sound of a doomsday clock ticking on a trillion-dollar economic collapse should strengthen his resolve.
san bernardino county supervisor robert lovingood wants to arm all eligible citizens — including county workers — in a bid to prevent or stall another terrorist attack in san bernardino.
fox la reports that lovingood wants citizens to get concealed carry permits, and he wants to see a change in policy at county offices that will allow county workers to volunteer to become authorized to carry concealed weapons as well. and it appears many san bernardino county residents are thinking the same way. for example, waiting times for concealed carry permits in san bernardino county have spiked from 3 months before the shooting, to more than a year, due to the flood of applicants.
according to the desert sun, the san bernardino sheriff's department received 75 applications [for concealed carry] during the weekend following the attack, when it normally averages 10. by the end of the month, deputies had received 750 applications, compared to a monthly average of 80. and captain david teets explained that the demand for concealed carry permits is surging in riverside county as well.
an interview is part of the process for acquiring a concealed carry license in riverside, and teets explained that the number of applicants has pushed appointments for interviews from an average of eight to 10 months to as far out as 18 months.
writing in the daily press, supervisor lovingood made clear his belief that empowering the people to protect themselves is a good place to start in the fight against terrorism.

a friday-published washington post opinion editorial — written by molly roberts and entitled what so wrong with motherf***er? — dismisses criticisms of rep. rashida tlaib's (d-mi) derision of president donald trump as a motherf****r, framing concerns of civility as manifestations of linguistic timidity.
at a thursday evening moveon.org-hosted event in washington, dc, hours after her swearing-in ceremony as a congresswoman, tlaib said, we're going to go in and impeach the motherf**ker.
democrat rashida tlaib during her first day as a u.s. congresswoman: we're going to go in and impeach the motherf**ker. pic.twitter.com/hg538zoqlb — kyle morris (@realkylemorris) january 4, 2019
roberts praises tlaib — a self-described democratic socialist aligned with sen. bernie sanders (i-vt) and rep. alexandria ocasio-crotez (d-ny) — for articulating a cogent case of the country in crisis via the trump administration.
'motherf—er' is filler, writes roberts. it means little more than someone more unpleasant than 'unpleasant' can convey. saying you grab women by the p—y, on the other hand, is truly damaging: it turns members of that gender into something to be played with. calling immigrants an infestation dehumanizes them.
roberts heralds the democrat party's most openly left-wing politicians, casting them as trailblazers pushing against an insufficiently left-wing party establishment. concerns over profanity, she argues, are secondary to championing those with the vision to break what must be broken in america towards ushering in transformational political change:
a better politics isn't necessarily a more profane politics. but the left half of the left wants to push broader boundaries, and it's no wonder they worry when the rest of the party starts to pull instead. the liberal vanguard tlaib belongs to seeks massive change, from medicare for all to a grand climate bargain. they see no hope for compromise now, so they look to a future of democratic control, when ramming transformation through will require breaking things. the party establishment so far has shown small desire to do so. and that, tlaib might say, is a motherf—ing shame.
despite brushing off criticisms of tlaib's use of vulgar language from unspecified pro-civility crusaders, in a column published in november, roberts called for amplified political censorship across facebook and twitter. she encouraged social media companies to further flex their power to shut down disinformation and false news, terms she neglected to define.
tony blair claimed friday that brexit is already damaging britain's economy by hitting productivity – hours before new data revealed productivity growth has, in fact, hit a six-year high.
the former prime minister's claim was included in a 32-page document arguing brexit was harming the nhs, jobs, and living standards, likely designed to make the case for blocking brexit by pushing for a second referendum in 2019, as he suggested thursday.
the document quotes the office for budget responsibility (obr), who in november 2017 reduced its forecast for productivity growth by 0.5 per cent per annum.
the renewed weakness of productivity growth over the first half of 2017 will almost certainly have been exacerbated by the brexit vote, the tony blair institute for change quotes the obr as saying.
however, following the brexit referendum, in november 2016, the obr was forced to admit they had been too gloomy about the uk economy after a brexit vote and their recent productivity forecast was criticised as the return of project fear.
uk labour productivity now 1% above the peak achieved before the 2008 economic downturn https://t.co/r4bxn8brk3 — ons (@ons) january 5, 2018
0.2% rise in uk total public service productivity between 2014 and 2015 delivers sixth successive year of improving productivity – the longest consecutive period of growth for which estimates are available https://t.co/9galshvqmk — ons (@ons) january 5, 2018
the critics were correct, as friday the office for national statistics (ons) revealed growth in labour productivity hit a six-year high in the third quarter of last year, rising 0.9 per cent, following modest falls over the first six months of 2016.
launching his push for a second referendum on thursday, mr. blair also claimed that the brexit vote had created significant staff shortages in the nhs.
however, investigations have found that while the number of european union (eu) nurses being registered by the nursing and midwifery council has fallen, the number of eu staffers in the nhs is still rising overall, and currently stands at an all-time high.
furthermore, as bbc presenter john humphrys pointed out, the fall in the numbers of new eu nurses being registered has not been attributed to brexit, but the introduction of new english-language tests for foreigners.
alabama and ohio state fans have waited all year to watch their teams play for the national championship. however, they could have to wait just a bit longer.
a coronavirus outbreak at ohio state could cause the championship to be moved from january 11 to january 18, al.com reports.
the schools and their respective conferences have already had discussions with college football playoff officials about possibly postponing the game. according to the report, the buckeyes could have an entire position group wiped out by the virus.
ohio state has had to grapple with coronavirus issues throughout the season. in fact, the big 10 had to change their rule for competing in the conference championship after ohio state fell short of the six-game minimum due to several covid-related cancellations.
venezuela's socialist president nicolás maduro has ordered all government employees to come into work only on mondays and tuesdays, enraging parents who want their children to go to school and opposition members who have deemed the decree immoral.
maduro announced tuesday that government workers would be expected to come into work two days a week until further notice, a measure intended to reduce the nation's use of electricity. venezuela depends on hydroelectric power and is currently suffering a drought that has left its main dam barely operational. abc news notes that the measure affects an estimated three million workers on the government dole. they will be paid full weeks despite the measure. schools are explicitly included in the measure, leaving the nation's children without class for most of the week.
maduro previously decreed three-day weekends to reduce demand for electricity nationwide, a move that elicited severe criticism of maduro's laziness and the improvisational nature of his rule. he has, nonetheless, opted for a more extreme version of this plan, which also included requesting that women not use electric hair dryers until further notice. maduro has also followed in the footsteps of north korean dictator kim jong-un and established his own time zone, moving venezuelan clocks 30 minutes forward.
experts say none of these efforts will likely reduce the nation's energy consumption, least of those the time change. they are thinking of water and electricity conservation, but there are few families who will abide by recommendations for saving [energy], so really this will not be very effective, venezuelan professor wílliam fuenmayor told el nacional. fuenmayor noted that late dictator hugo chávez had tried to change time zones in an attempt to save electricity and failed.
venezuela has been suffering infrastructure problems for years under maduro, though the problem has been exacerbated recently. in february, an attempt to prevent the current drought situation resulted in millions of caracas residents being deprived of drinking water due to alleged maintenance.
outside the capital, the situation was even worse, as officials began rationing the water supply similarly to how necessary goods are rationed in supermarkets. currently, venezuelans must wait up to six or seven hours on supermarket lines to buy essential goods like flour, vegetable oil, and milk. increasingly, these lines have become violent, with individuals physically beating each other for access to limited food resources. the electricity shortage will likely force supermarkets to be open for fewer hours, worsening wait times to pay for groceries.
the pro-democracy opposition in the national assembly, meanwhile, is issuing stern statements condemning maduro. here in the national assembly we work monday to friday. the decree [license] to vagrancy dictated by the regime will not paralyze us, the head of the assembly, henry ramos allup, tweeted tuesday.
that because of corruption and electricity mafias our children will not have class is the height of immorality, maria corina machado, a former legislator, ousted from her position violently by maduro's police, said in response to the decree. venezuela demands education and productive work. these people are like gangrene, she added. they want to destroy and paralyze everything.
sen. elizabeth warren (d-ma) expressed frustration on friday that the democratic national committee (dnc) removed the donor requirements for upcoming debates — a move that opens the door for michael bloomberg (d) to participate.
the dnc is adjusting the requirements to qualify for upcoming debates, raising the polling threshold but ditching the donor requirements altogether. the move effectively opens the door for bloomberg, who has been rising in the polls but has been unable to participate in democrat debates due to the donor requirements and his decision to self-fund his campaign.
warren, who has blasted the billionaire on the campaign trail, was incensed.
the dnc didn't change the rules to ensure good, diverse candidates could remain on the debate stage. they shouldn't change the rules to let a billionaire on, she said on friday.
billionaires shouldn't be allowed to play by different rules—on the debate stage, in our democracy, or in our government, she added:

sen. bernie sanders' (i-vt) campaign also voiced frustration with the new rules.
dnc changing the rules to benefit a billionaire, sanders campaign manager faiz shakir, who once criticized bloomberg for not participating in the debates, said. i much prefer democrats being a grassroots party. and under bernie sanders, that's the way it will be:

rep. tulsi gabbard (d-hi) also responded to the dnc's sudden rule change:
the dnc has defended its decision to modify the rules, contending that the criteria are no longer needed due to the capture of grassroots support in real voting.
dnc spokeswoman adrienne watson told politico, the donor threshold was appropriate for the opening stages of the race, when candidates were building their organizations, and there were no metrics available outside of polling to distinguish those making progress from those who weren't.
bloomberg has reportedly spent more than $200 million in the last quarter on his presidential bid:
michael bloomberg gave his campaign $200,114,049.18 this quarter, and accepted zero –$0.00– in donations. wow. https://t.co/rqhs9zs240 pic.twitter.com/c2vvrwhfmc — christopher bedford (@cbedforddc) january 31, 2020

harvard university has announced plans to remove the reference to puritans from the ivy league institution's alma mater song, claiming that the word is not inclusive.
according to a column in the crimson by the staff editorial board, the reference to puritans in the school's song was not a concern for members of the harvard community before the announcement that the change would be made.
students do not engage with the alma mater on a regular basis. by contrast, other renamed or changed traditions involved phrases like house master (a change we opposed) which were used regularly. indeed, the line in question has not been a source of consternation among students. in our view, the proposed change merely serves as a token that will ultimately achieve little in the greater scope of issues that plague harvard college.
despite this, a task force working to make harvard more inclusive announced their decision to get rid of the reference to puritans in the alma mater song.
written in 1836, the alma mater ends with the line, till the stock of the puritans die. the song was revised in 1998 to make the lyrics more gender-inclusive, but they left the final line as it was, the task force wrote in a statement. we think it's time for a change.
in an email to the college fix, harvard government professor harvey mansfield expressed disappointment over the change, arguing that it only serves to wash away the history of the university. he added that it serves as a gross instance of political correctness.
mansfield called harvard america's trendiest university, and said that the move is a surrender to groups who want to use the university to gain their own political ends and who do not understand or care for the search for truth regardless of party.

there have been more than 6,000 grooming crimes recorded in the uk in less than five years, with numbers dramatically rising in the past 12 months, home office statistics reveal.
the data reveals there were more than five times more reported grooming offences last year than in the previous 12 months, with children as young as two-years-old as targets.
offences were logged by police in england and wales from april 2013 to december 2017, and appear to be rapidly accelerating as new offences are added to the statute books.
between april and december 2017, in the space of just eight months, there were a total of 2,996 grooming crimes recorded.
the numbers are boosted by the new offences of sexual communication with a child, brought into force in april 2017, and offences for meeting a child after grooming.
campaigners demand 'urgent action' as child sex grooming cases rise 64 per cent in just one year
https://t.co/vg3tqfuory — breitbart london (@breitbartlondon) october 26, 2017
the statistics were highlighted by the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children (nspcc), which is campaigning for tougher measures by government and social media firms against grooming.
according to the charity, facebook and apps they own, including instagram and whatsapp, were used in 52 per cent of online grooming cases where police disclosed methods employed by suspects.
tony stower, nspcc head of child safety online, said: these thousands of crimes show the sheer scale of grooming, where predators have either messaged their victim or gone on to meet them in person.
at present, our government is only prepared to tackle grooming after the harm has been done, and its forthcoming internet safety strategy has no plans to prevent grooming from happening in the first place.
culture secretary matt hancock could change this and bring an end to the wild west web. i urge him to bring in regulation for social networks, backed by an independent regulator with teeth.
do you think social media companies are doing enough to keep children safe online? it's time to end the #wildwestweb and protect our kids with a social media law. https://t.co/cgft7lkhan pic.twitter.com/qqfno8ww9f — nspcc (@nspcc) april 25, 2018
responding to surging levels of recorded grooming crimes in january of this year, a government spokesman commented:
online child grooming is an appalling crime that this government is working to tackle. we have provided law enforcement with the capabilities and resources they need to identify grooming victims and bring offenders to justice.
last year we provided police forces in england and wales with more than £20 million to enable dedicated officers to operate online in forums and chat rooms, to pursue offenders.
but companies have to take all steps possible to prevent their platforms being used to abuse children.
during cnn's election coverage on tuesday, cnn political commentator and former obama adviser van jones reacted to the partial results in the 2020 iowa caucuses by saying that 2020 democratic presidential candidate former vice president joe biden fell down these stairs, and i don't know how he gets up.
jones said, when you see these numbers, and you see joe biden, 100% household name recognition probably on five continents, at 15, it does change your view of him. when it was just an idea, well, he might not do well in iowa, he'll make it up later on. now we're living in the reality of he fell down these stairs, and i don't know how he gets up.

penny nance, president of concerned women for america, warns on breitbart news daily that conservatives face the most important battle of their lives in opposing obama's liberal supreme court pick, merrick garland.
this is a very important moment in the republic. this is why the people gave the senate back to the republicans. this is a check and balance in a president who's out of control, nance told host stephen k. bannon.
the media, obama, and the democratic party will place enormous pressure on republican sens. chuck grassley and mitch mcconnell to confirm garland, according to nance.
it is going to be a cage match… this is the most important battle of our lives, she recalled saying to hundreds of volunteer leaders in her group.
this battle — what hangs in the balance is every issue every one of your listeners care about, she said, naming concerns from preserving the second amendment to traditional marriage. the new york times placed [merrick garland]… to the left of [justice elena] kagan. so this is a very liberal nominee. of course. this is such a liberal president who thinks the constitution is a living, breathing document.
the court hangs in the balance now, she continued. and this next pick will decide for generations to come, for the next forty or maybe fifty years of what is going to happen on all the issues we care about. and by the way, this is not just going to be one pick. the next administration will choose two or three more.
in over eighty years, there hasn't been a supreme court nominee confirmed in the last year of a president's administration. we're not going to change that now just because the democrats want their way. this is so much bigger. the senate's doing their job. we need to encourage and thank them for that, she added.

the trump administration is handling the coronavirus outbreak better than previous administrations addressed earlier emerging contagions, said dr. marc siegel, professor of medicine at new york university, fox news medical correspondent, and author of false alarm: the truth about the epidemic of fear.
siegel shared his analysis on siriusxm's breitbart news sunday with special guest host joel pollak.
i've been handling these emerging contagions for about 20 years now, and i have to tell you, i've never seen one handled better, said siegel of president donald trump's approach to the coronavirus outbreak.
the center for disease control (cdc) erred in its messaging with a doom and gloom comment framing the spread of coronavirus in the u.s. as inevitable without quantifying caveats, siegel stated.
it's not a question of if this will happen but when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illnesses, said dr. nancy messonnier, director of the cdc's immunization and respiratory disease division, on tuesday.
siegel praised the trump administration's personnel selection for its coronavirus task force, headed by vice president mike pence.
the task force are really top players, said siegel, noting the task force's inclusion dr. anthony fauci, director of the national institute of health's (nih) infectious disease. fauci is one of the top infectious disease experts in the country, he noted.
siegel noted the coronavirus task force's inclusion of cdc director dr. robert redfield, a virologist, and dr. nancy messonnier, an expert in vaccines.
they've been doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing, said siegel of the trump administration's measures towards protecting americans from the coronavirus. [they are] restricting travel, isolating patients who are sick and, trying to cut down on contact. it's a very hard thing to do when people are pouring in from all over the world.
siegel contrasted the coronavirus's mortality rate with those of sars, swine flu, and the flu.
sars had about a ten percent mortality [rate], but it only affected about 8,000 people, recalled siegel. swine flu had a very, very low mortality for flu, but flu itself really only causes about a point-four percent death rate, and [coronavirus] is about one-point-four percent. so this is killing more than flu, but i want to make a couple of points that will reassure people.
siegel continued, one, at the beginning of an emerging contagion, it always appears more deadly than it actually is. the 1918 flu is an exception, but normally as time goes on, it's less deadly, and part of that is because you see more immunity appearing, and you also find a lot of milder cases — or even cases where people don't get sick at all. you find that as you start to test more people.
undiagnosed and asymptomatic persons infected with coronavirus are not captured in data for quantifying mortality rates, explained siegel, mild cases that are being undiagnosed make [coronavirus] seem more deadly.
the coronavirus outbreak illustrates the need for america's economy to decouple from china, assessed siegel.
we're relying on china for 90 percent of our ingredients for pharmaceuticals, siegel remarked. that hopefully will change as a result of this because we're going to end up with tremendous shortages of basic drugs, including antibiotics and blood pressure medication if this continues much longer in wuhan.
siegel concluded, this is a wake-up call that we must make more of our pharmaceuticals here in the united states.
asked about news media conduct regarding coronavirus, siegel said, they're certainly not helping because they're hyping, and the hyping leads to hysteria.

senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky) is expected to reject an objection to the electoral college votes as both chambers gather to count the votes, fox news reported on wednesday.
according to the report, mcconnell is expected to rebuke the gop challenge to certify the electoral college results for president-elect joe biden on wednesday, per sources:
meanwhile, a source familiar with wednesday's vote told fox news mcconnell plans to be one of the first speakers to object to initial challenges by colleagues in his own party, driving home the importance of certifying the votes — which have been approved by all 50 states — and ensuring a peaceful transfer of power.
mcconnell has remained relatively mum on the forthcoming objections from his colleagues, although he urged gop senators to refrain from objecting to the certification in mid-december, contending that it would not be in the best interest of everybody:
🚨new on a senate r call just now, @senatemajldr, @royblunt & @senjohnthune all pleaded with senate rs to not object to the election results jan. 6. mcconnel: it's a terrible vote for the gop. they'd have to vote it down, which makes it seem like they are anti trump, he said — jake sherman (@jakesherman) december 15, 2020
however, the kentucky republican reportedly told colleagues that he ultimately won't judge anybody for their decision in objecting to electoral votes, describing it as a very difficult decision.
'i've voted twice on declarations of war.' and he said, 'this is right up there.' but … there's a lot of noise out there and i won't judge anybody for their decision,' sen. kevin cramer (r-nd) said, recounting the conversation.
over a dozen gop senators have expressed their intention to object to the certification alongside roughly 140 house members — an action that will trigger debates in both chambers.
all eyes are on vice president mike pence, who will preside over wednesday's joint session of congress.
if vice president @mike_pence comes through for us, we will win the presidency, president trump said in a tweet early wednesday morning ahead of his appearance at d.c.'s million maga march.
many states want to decertify the mistake they made in certifying incorrect & even fraudulent numbers in a process not approved by their state legislatures (which it must be). mike can send it back! he continued.
states want to correct their votes, which they now know were based on irregularities and fraud, plus corrupt process never received legislative approval, the president said in another tweet.
all the vice president has to do, he added, is send them back to the states, and we win.
do it mike, this is a time for extreme courage! trump added:

trump, via his campaign, also hit back at a tuesday new york times report claiming that pence told trump that he does not believe he has the power to block the certification of the election.
the new york times report regarding comments vice president pence supposedly made to me today is fake news, the statement read. he never said that. the vice president and i are in total agreement that the vice president has the power to act.
the statement added that the vice president has several options under the u.s. constitution.
he can decertify the results or send them back to the states for change and certification. he can also decertify the illegal and corrupt results and send them to the house of representatives for the one vote for one state tabulation, it added.
tel aviv – a column in the london-based saudi daily al-sharq al-awsat argued that the arab spring failed because opposition parties were just as undemocratic and dictatorial as the tyrannical regimes they were fighting to replace.
columnist uthman al-mirghani wrote that arab opposition parties across the political spectrum – liberal, rightist, and islamic – had distanced themselves so much from the people that arab populations are now yearning for a return to previous regimes.
maintaining that the arab spring failed to realize a single one of the goals professed by protesters, al-mirghani said the chaos, crises, and wars that have swept the middle east are due to the failure of opposition groups to provide viable alternative governments.
the writer slammed opposition groups as weak and internally divided, and for having an intense preoccupation with their own interests and dreams of power, thus distancing themselves from the people.
many of the opposition parties accusing the existing regimes of tyranny are in themselves undemocratic, wrote al-mirghani, adding that the parties' political ideologies don't change matters.
the leftist parties have, in the eyes of the people, become a model of the elitism that is sunk in developing theories, while the islamic parties have become a model of egocentrism and opportunism.
he gave egypt and sudan as examples of countries in which the ruling parties were replaced by islamists, such as the muslim brotherhood, which turned to tyranny and absolute rule.
even countries like morocco and tunisia, the latter of which sparked the wave of protests across the arab world, have yet to fully realize a peaceful and democratic transfer of power.
al-mirghani asserted that the disillusioned masses have abandoned hope in opposition parties, and are instead turning to the internet – what he calls the online party – to voice their distress.
the arab spring … was not a message just to the regimes, as some people think. its outcomes are an indictment of the arab oppositions, which seem, to this day, not to have gotten the message, he concludes.
washington — in a senate confirmation hearing on thursday, david friedman, president donald trump's nominee to be u.s. ambassador to israel, indicated that although a two-state solution calling for the creation of a palestinian state next to israel is the most ideal path toward peace, the option has failed to yield progress due largely to palestinian intransience.
under questioning by marco rubio (r-fl) during thursday's confirmation hearing held by the senate foreign relations committee, friedman emphasized his skepticism toward a two-state solution, suggesting that imposing the deal on israel would be bad for their security and bad for their future.
friedman agreed with rubio when the florida senator noted:
your position is not that you are opposed to this ideal outcome in which there would be two states, but that you recognize that at this moment given the circumstances that exist in the world today, and in that region, in particular, it is not likely to have that outcome. and hopefully, that will change. hopefully, the palestinians will have better leadership. hopefully, they'll be more prosperous. hopefully, they'll have an opportunity to grow their economy and their security. and maybe in 20 years, 15 years, five years, sooner rather than later, we all hope there will be the opportunity for this to occur, but right now those conditions are perhaps not in place. and the worst thing to try to do is go in there and impose on our most loyal and important ally in the region a deal that is bad for their security and bad for their future, is that an accurate characterization of your feelings with regards to the two-state solution?
i think it is senator, responded friedman.
he acknowledged that the two-state option is the most ideal road to peace between israel and the palestinian authority.
i think it's the most ideal, friedman told sen. chris coons (d-de). i think it's the path that's received the most thought and effort and consideration. obviously, it's been tried for a long, long time and we continue to wrestle with it. much smarter people than me have tried to make progress and have failed, but it still remains i believe the best possibility for peace in the region.
when questioned by sen. ben cardin (d-md), the senate panel's ranking-member, trump's nominee noted:
if the israelis and the palestinians were able, through direct negotiations, to achieve a two-state solution along parameters agreeable to them…i would be delighted to see peace come to this region where people have suffered on both sides for so long. i have expressed my skepticism about the two-state solution solely on the basis of what i have perceived as an unwillingness on the part of the palestinians to renounce terror and accept israel as a jewish state. i think that in my view is a foundational problem, but i think it can be remedied and i hope it is.
friedman told the lawmakers that he agreed with president trump's recent comments marking a departure from the hardline stance the u.s. has maintained until recently, in which the two-state solution was the only option on the table.
i'm looking at a two-state [solution], and one-state [solution] and i like the one that both parties like. … i can live with either one, declared the u.s. president while standing next to israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu at the white house.
sen. bernie sanders (i-vt), who spent $1.2 million on private air travel in the final quarter of 2019, is outraged that president trump did not mention climate change during tuesday's state of the union address.
in the year 2020, how can a president of the united states give a state of the union speech and not mention climate change? sanders asked following the conclusion of trump's address to the nation:

sanders is a huge proponent of the green new deal and has proposed a massive $16 trillion plan as a hallmark of his presidential platform, describing climate change as the single greatest challenge facing our country.
however, sanders has yet to address his excessive use of private air travel on the campaign trail. federal election commission (fec) filings reveal that the socialist senator spent more on private air travel than his rivals in the final quarter of 2019, spending $1,199,579, precisely, on apollo jets, llc, which the free beacon notes is a luxury private jet charter service.
former vice president joe biden (d) also spent over $1 million on private air travel, followed by sen. elizabeth warren (d-ma), who spent $720,518 in the fourth quarter of the year.
she was spotted hopping off a private jet in des moines, iowa, this week and, as the video shows, appears to strategically place herself behind a staffer out of the camera's view:
a california elementary school has changed the name of its father-daughter dance to the family dance to be more inclusive.
parent teacher association president patrick kuske, whose organization sponsors the father-daughter dance at sacramento's crocker/riverside elementary school, bowed to pressure to change the name of the dance after being told by a couple of parents that they don't like it.
we got a request from a couple parents to be more inclusive and change the name, kuske told fox 40.
school principal daniel mccord agreed with the change. however the child wants to define their family, whoever they want to bring with them they're able to do that, mccord said.
the principal also said that there were no complaints from parents after the name change was announced.
kuske noted that the pta uses the dances as a fundraiser, so excluding people by the theme of the dance was questioned by some.
still, the pta chief said it isn't all about money. it's not just about making money for the school, it's about having a good time and getting people together at the same time, kuske exclaimed.
the sacramento city unified school district has also announced it will take this incident as an excuse to review all gender-related activities and issues at the next school board meeting on april 17.
traditionally, father-daughter dances were created to be inclusive, not exclusive. prior to such events, fathers often felt excluded from their daughters' school activities because most activities were aimed at mothers and daughters. while fathers and sons were typically involved in sports and similar activities, there were few school events for a father to do with his daughter. the father-daughter dance was created to give fathers an event where they could participate in their little girls' school activities.

uk prime minister boris johnson says he is becoming 'more and more obsessed' with cop26 (the united nations climate conference which britain is hosting later this year).
'the green agenda is not just a load of green nonsense,' he claims. 'if you do it right, it's the opportunity to create hundreds of thousands of jobs.'
the green agenda is not just a load of green nonsense… if you do it right, it's the opportunity to create hundreds of thousands of jobs looking ahead to cop26, boris johnson says he is becoming more and more obsessed with what we can dohttps://t.co/egiunu4srs pic.twitter.com/83cbylzvma — bbc politics (@bbcpolitics) january 13, 2021
possibly this is good news for johnson, who, as a reward for this nonsense, may now get more nookie from his eco-activist girlfriend carrie symonds (aka princess nut nut). but it will be an absolute disaster for the country at large, as a number of recent reports and articles make clear.
a recent analysis by a senior economist at deutsche bank, for example, says that the way the european union is selling its 'green deal' is 'dishonest' and poses massive risks for prosperity, the economic system and democracy itself.
in the report, titled climate neutrality: are we ready for an honest discussion?, eric heymann warns that the eu's green ambitions of 'net zero' carbon emissions cannot be achieved without a fall in standards of living, a reduction in international competitiveness, and a loss in personal freedom.
at the moment, he notes, we all get to take key consumption decisions — whether we travel at all, how much we travel and which means of transport we use, whether we live in a large house or a small apartment and how we heat our homes, how many electronic devices we have and how intensely we use them or how much meat and exotic fruit we eat — on the basis of 'income, not on climate considerations.'
if we are to achieve climate neutrality, we will need to change our behaviour in all these areas of life because it is impossible to do any of the above things in a carbon neutral way. the only way this is likely to happen, he warns, is through government compulsion.
i know that 'eco-dictatorship' is a nasty word. but we may have to ask ourselves the question whether and to what extent we may be willing to accept some kind of eco-dictatorship (in the form of regulatory law) in order to move towards climate neutrality.
this, heymann goes on to say, will lead to massive political resistance because prosperity and employment are likely to suffer considerably.
let's repeat that phrase for the dimmer kids at the back of the class, johnson.
prosperity and employment are likely to suffer considerably.
this makes a nonsense of johnson's airy claim that his green revolution will create hundreds and thousands of new jobs. of course it won't. there is plenty of evidence to support heymann's claim. none to support johnson's.
i pointed this out in june last year in a piece titled britain unleashes a green new deal to kill what's left of the economy.
for example, a study by economics professor dr gabriel calzada alvarez of madrid's university of rey juan carlos found that for every 'green job' created by the spanish government, another 2.2 jobs were destroyed in the real economy. another study, this time in the uk, found that for every green job created by government 'investment' in the renewables industry, 3.7 jobs were destroyed in the real economy.
more recently, a report by the think tank onward has warned that ten million jobs in 'red wall' seats (i.e. traditional labour constituencies in the midlands and north which lent their votes to the conservatives in the 2019 election so that johnson could deliver brexit) face being wiped out in johnson's attempt to reach his 'net-zero by 2050' emissions target.
this might suit johnson and his green crony capitalist chums in the westminster bubble, but as paul homewood notes, metropolitan greenies will largely insulated from the disastrous effects of their eco-fascist policies in the country at large.
the climate change agenda is being driven by the metropolitan liberal consensus in london, where few jobs will be at risk. outside of london there is little support for net zero, but people there have little say in policy decisions. polling may suggest otherwise, but the public have been deliberately kept in the dark about the real costs and implications involved.
boris johnson's green revolution is a slow motion train crash in the making. even those invested in 'climate change' as a genuine threat are starting to wake up to the problem.
here, for example, is market strategist and investor bill 'i absolutely believe climate change is the biggest challenge humanity faces' blain writing at capx.
the brutal reality is offshore wind is far less efficient than promised and requires much more expensive maintenance. they break down, sink into their foundations and don't generate anything like the power expected. for all the due diligence, they simply won't ever make any money unless the price at which they sell energy is dramatically increased – at which point they make zero sense.
[it goes, almost without saying, that 'offshore wind' will be playing a major part in boris johnson's green revolution – the one that will supposedly create those 'hundreds of thousands of jobs']
blain sees the makings of a 'financial crash' driven by the renewables sector, for wind turbines are not the panacea they may look to gullible investors.
this will feel very familiar to many investors who have seen all the blithe assumption about operating and maintenance costs on all kinds of technological green marvels fail to meet expectations. biowaste generators, biomass, thermal pellets – you name it, and the rosy assumptions failed to materialise because the difficulties in making them work and keeping them working were glossed over by the promoters. most of the smart money already knew that about renewables and is deeply sceptical. the not-so-smart money still laps the deals up. sadly, renewables is likely to become another charming but flawed investment thesis. i am no stranger to investment madness – three times i've invested in airships and lost my dosh every time.
boris johnson's obsession with green issues is steering the uk economy to disaster. he needs to go now.
theresa may's health secretary has snubbed christian campaigners and backed the use of sex-change drugs for children under the age of 18.
the department of health and social care, led by jeremy hunt mp, said that young people have a right to determine what happens to their own bodies, including consenting to drug treatments that can sterilise them and stunt growth.
it comes as the government considers a 2016 parliamentary report demanding trans issues are mandatory on school curriculums, 16-year-olds can change their gender without parental consent, and calling for fast-tracked sex changes.
hunt's department was responding to a petition by the christian group voice for justice uk, signed by more than 8,000 people, which called for all surgical and hormonal sex-change treatment to be banned below the age of 18.
the group referenced recent reports revealing the number of people regretting and seeking to reverse sex-change procedures is sharply rising, and criticised the fact children as young as four are being encouraged to embrace transgender ideology in school – something first exposed by breitbart in 2015.
the inevitable result is that increasing numbers of children are seeing themselves as having been born in 'the wrong body' and are demanding treatment, the petition, addressed directly to jeremy hunt, says.
were going for the 10,000 mark today. please sign our latest stand. https://t.co/jpu2p4bdmi — voice for justice uk (@vfjuk) january 22, 2018
while some children may genuinely suffer from gender dysphoria, they add, it is medically well documented that expression of such feelings are frequently both normal and transient, and without intervention naturally dissipate over time.
indeed, studies have found that 70 to 80 per cent of children who feel transgender lose such feelings, and another concluded that such feelings are much more likely to persist when adults in authority, such as teachers, tell kids they could be in the wrong body.
this government response is uninformed: puberty blockers may be given at age 10. if a child progresses to cross-sex hormones at 16 (as over 90% do) they are sterilised. is this in a child's best interests? @dhscgovuk @jeremy_hunt https://t.co/zp7nmux8jp — transgendertrend (@transgendertrd) february 20, 2018
however, hunt's department wrote that if children have the capacity to give consent for themselves, then consent should be sought direct from them.
a person under 16 can consent to a sex change procedure if they have 'sufficient understanding and intelligence to enable him or her to understand fully what is proposed', they claim.
furthermore, controversial sex-change drugs can be prescribed generally once the patient is around 15 years old for hormone blockers and 16 years old for cross-sex hormones.
the petitioners had concluded their appeal by asking: if a young person cannot legally buy a glass of beer below the age of 18, how is it we encourage them to make life-changing decisions involving the surgical mutilation of an otherwise healthy body, lifelong infertility, and with a lifetime spent on sex change hormones carrying well documented health risks and shortening life expectancy?
the wuhan coronavirus epidemic in iran is so severe that even the tightly controlled iranian press is beginning to question the government's absurdly low official statistics for the number of infections and fatalities.
the bbc noticed a striking example on monday, a headline that literally questioned the statistics coming from the regime.
here's an example of the first seeds of doubt in the iranian press over official coronavirus stats.
headline from financial daily eqtesad-e saramad: statistics: that is the question! pic.twitter.com/adu3vaqcyk — bbc monitoring (@bbcmonitoring) march 11, 2020
an iranian state television host fell on his knees tuesday and begged his audience in the province of yazd to stay at home so they do not contract the virus. officials in yazd declared an emergency situation on sunday.
this is quite a change from the attitude taken by state media just a few weeks ago, when the coronavirus was dismissed as less dangerous than the flu, quarantines were derided as an unnecessary overreaction, and criticism of the central government's response was treated as seditious.
in late january, iran was actually marketing itself as a perfect getaway destination for chinese travelers who wanted to celebrate lunar new year away from their own troubled country. iranian doctors thought a five-day quarantine would be sufficient for any visitors who displayed symptoms of the virus.
while iranian media grows slowly more critical of the secular government, the iranian people seem to have lost a good deal of reverence for the theocracy during the coronavirus crisis.
iran's supreme leader, ayatollah ali khamenei, is still trying to downplay the threat of the virus. religious shrines and ceremonies played an indisputable role in helping the epidemic spread so quickly, made worse by religious leaders who touted the healing properties of the shrines.
another ayatollah named abbas tabrizian, hailed by his followers as the father of islamic medicine in iran, became a figure of both local and international mockery for claiming the coronavirus can be held at bay by rubbing a cotton ball dipped in violet oil across the anus. an iran-based religious scholar with over a million followers named hadi al-modarresi who raised a stir by claiming the virus was undoubtedly an act of allah that is divine punishment against the chinese for their treatment, mockery, and disrespect towards muslims and islam admitted on wednesday that he himself has contracted the disease.
iranian social media is buzzing with undercover videos of overflowing morgues, images that paint a picture of a crisis much worse than the officially reported 9,000 infections and 354 deaths.
the situation is very difficult; the authorities do not provide the exact figures of the dead. they have even arrested a staff member who shot film inside a hospital, where you could see it was filled with dead people inside a cellar. and the situation is much worse now. hospitals are at capacity. no one is reporting the real death toll, a young iranian professional told fox news on tuesday.
the taliban wants to change the venue of scheduled peace talks with the united states this month from saudi arabia to qatar over riyadh's push to include the afghan government in the negotiations, members of the taliban declared on sunday.
the upcoming negotiations, the fourth in a series aimed at ending the 17-year war in afghanistan, are scheduled between the leaders of the taliban and us special envoy zalmay khalilzad to discuss the withdrawal of foreign forces and a possible ceasefire in 2019. leaders of the hardline islamic militant group have rejected the kabul government's offer for direct talks, despite growing international pressure in favor of the western-backed afghan government having a seat at the table.
qatar, home to the taliban's political headquarters, has long hosted and legitimized political leaders from the terrorist organization.
we were supposed to meet us officials in riyadh next week and continue our peace process that remained incomplete in abu dhabi last month, a senior taliban jihadi based in afghanistan told reuters on condition of anonymity, adding, the problem is that leaders of saudi arabia and the united arab emirates (uae) wanted us to definitely meet the afghan government delegation, which we cannot afford to do now, and we have canceled the meeting in saudi arabia.
saudi arabia, pakistan, and the uae are the only countries that officially recognized the terrorist group's regime during its five years of oppressive rule in afghanistan and are believed to have significant influence over the group.
another unnamed senior taliban insurgent indicated that the narco-jihadis explained to saudi arabia that it was not possible for the group to meet kabul at this stage.
everyone is aware of the fact that the afghan government wanted the u.s. and its allies not to leave afghanistan and we have paid a heavy price to expel all foreign forces from our country, he told reuters. why should we talk to the afghan government?
zabihullah mujahid, a spokesman for the taliban, reportedly confirmed that the group had canceled the meeting in saudi arabia but did not reveal the location of the new venue.
the u.s. has not commented on the change of peace talks venue.
mujahid recently told voice of america (voa) its negotiations with the united states for ending the war and illegitimate occupation of afghanistan remain on track.
there has been no interruption in the dialogue process with america because ending the occupation of afghanistan is now a compulsion for them [u.s.], mujahid told voa.
in the wake of reports that the u.s. is considering withdrawing half of the estimated 14,000 troops deployed to afghanistan, american vice president mike pence recently told fox news that the commander-in-chief is in the process of evaluating pulling some service members from the war-ravaged country.
the white house had previously dismissed news reports of a u.s. troop withdrawal from afghanistan.
on social media, mujahid reportedly appeared optimistic about the series of u.s.-taliban negotiations in recent months.
we can say with certainty that they indeed proved effective. they have given birth to hope that should the negotiations continue with such speed, then it is possible that foreign aggression be brought to an end, following which peace will be established, the taliban spokesman declared.
he defended the narco-terrorist group's stance for not holding talks with the afghan government, dismissing kabul as the product of foreign occupation of afghanistan, with no authority or ability to end to the war.
the taliban is fighting to restore strict islamic law, or sharia, in afghanistan. trump administration officials have come out in support of a ceasefire and relegitimizing the taliban as an official political power. u.s. troops removed the taliban from power in afghanistan in late 2001.
the trump administration has made political reconciliation between kabul and the taliban the primary tenet of its strategy to end the war, which started in october 2001.
in its latest assessment of the war, the pentagon said:
the united states has a single vital national interest in afghanistan: to prevent it from becoming a safe-haven from which terrorist groups can plan and execute attacks against the u.s. homeland, u.s. citizens, and our interests and allies abroad. our ultimate goal in afghanistan is a negotiated political settlement between the afghan government and the taliban.
in recent months, the united states, via trump's afghan reconciliation envoy, zalmay khalilzad, has intensified efforts to bring the taliban to the negotiating table.
marking a major departure from previous administrations long sought by the taliban, the u.s. is negotiating directly with the group. khalilzad has met with the group on several occasions. the taliban generates most of its funding from trafficking heroin, some of which is partly fueling the unprecedented fatal drug overdose epidemic in the united states.
the u.s. has conceded that it will not see a military victory in afghanistan, home to the highest concentration of terrorist groups (20) in the world.
filmmaker luc besson blasted french presidential hopeful marine le pen in a scathing essay on saturday, calling the front national candidate a scammer and a perfect representative of the establishment she denounces.
in a lengthy post on his facebook page, the 58-year-old director of leon the professional and the upcoming valerian urged his fellow countrymen to reject the populist, nationalist message of le pen, who came in second place behind centrist emmanuel macron in france's first-round presidential election this month and will face macron in a run-off in june.
we are the scammed, besson wrote. sentimental folks, yearning for ideals, strung along by fine words, tired of believing, revolted by unkept promises. weakened, disillusioned, an easy prey—like a wounded animal alone in the jungle.
as for who is doing the scamming, besson lists two culprits: the le pen family and the front national.
what a joke! the director exclaimed of le pen's claim to be the anti-establishment candidate and a candidate for the people.
marine is an heiress, raised in wealth and luxury in saint-cloud, a well-heeled suburb of paris, he wrote. she has never really worked in her life: neither in a company, nor in a factory, and definitely not on a farm. she has never contributed to france's growth, and has never created any jobs (except fake ones apparently). she is, in reality, the perfect representative of the establishment she denounces, living off handouts from brussels, and exploiting the system in every possible way to her advantage.
how can you claim to be the 'candidate of the people' without ever working for or with the people? and how can you declare your opposition to the 'system' while milking it for all it's worth for decades? he added.
as for le pen's party, the front national, besson calls it a nice little business, whose upper echelons comprise the elite of french fascism.
when and where in history has turning in on oneself had positive results? never, the director wrote. withdrawal brings isolation. isolation leads to totalitarianism. totalitarianism spawns fascism. fascism results in war. five thousand years of history are there as proof, and the little saint-cloud heiress cannot change history.
besson closed his essay with a call for french citizens to reject le pen and embrace diversity, which he called an opportunity and a strength.
let's look after our country, let's open up, let's transcend ourselves, and let's show the snake oil sellers that they have no place among us, he urged. let's show the rest of the world what it really means to be french. we are an open, courageous and fraternal people that has no need of two-bit ideology to get by. a great people grows even greater by supporting and reaching out to others.

prime minister theresa may has said she is confident of the success of british strikes on syria overnight, as well as defending the attacks as the right and legal thing to do.
speaking to the press from downing street on saturday morning, she described the joint action with the u.s. and france as limited, targeted and effective and insisted the aim was not to bring about regime change.
rather, the syria strikes, committed to without a parliamentary vote, are intended to show that the international community will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons, she claimed.
the prime minister @theresa_may is holding a press conference on syria. https://t.co/mwchyprfb5 — uk prime minister (@10downingstreet) april 14, 2018
questioning on if it was right to back strikes without giving the legislature a say, as recent prime ministers have done, mrs. may said she would be addressing parliament on monday.
there is no graver decision for a prime minister than to commit our forces to combat and this is the first time i have had to do so, she said. as always, they have served our country with the greatest professionalism and bravery, and we owe them a huge debt of gratitude.
we would have preferred an alternative path but on this occasion there was none. we cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised, either in syria, on the streets of the uk or elsewhere.
we must reinstate the global consensus that chemical weapons cannot be used. this action is absolutely in britain's national interest.
the lesson of history is when the global rules and standards that keep us safe come under threat we must take a stand and defend them. that is what our country has always done and that is what we will continue to do.
the british government published their legal justification for the strikes on saturday, stating that in the course of fightign the syrian civil war the syrian regime has been killing its own people for seven years and that it had used chemical weapons in breach of the customary international law prohibition on the use of chemical weapons, and amounts to a war crime and a crime against humanity.
making the case for military action, the document further stated: the uk is permitted under international law, on an exceptional basis, to take measures in order to alleviate overwhelming humanitarian suffering… there is convincing evidence, generally accepted by the international community as a whole, of extreme humanitarian distress on a large scale, requiring immediate and urgent relief.
despite the document issued by the british government, jeremy corbyn, the leader of the opposition, called the strikes legally questionable and claimed mrs. may was taking instructions from washington.
he said: bombs won't save lives or bring about peace.
bombs won't save lives or bring about peace. my statement responding to air strikes on syria: https://t.co/r6yqkk4mv3 — jeremy corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) april 14, 2018
continuing: this legally questionable action risks escalating further, as us defence secretary james mattis has admitted, an already devastating conflict and therefore makes real accountability for war crimes and use of chemical weapons less, not more likely.
the strike comes after concern from senior political figures in nato allies france and germany, where the interior ministers of both nations expressed the view that western strikes against the syrian government could spark a new migrant crisis, and a wave of migrants arriving in europe.
german homeland minister horst seehofer, the leader of germany's anti-mass migration christian social union remarked on the link between western military action adn the arrival of migrants, saying thursday: we both would like the conflicts to be solved diplomatically and through dialogue. a continuation of this spiral (of violence) would amplify the problem of migration.
the california insurance commissioner says young girls who claim to be uncomfortable with their biological sex must be provided with coverage for elective double mastectomies to cope with their gender dysphoria.
insurance commissioner ricardo lara asked the california department of insurance to issue a notice stating young girls cannot be denied coverage for elective double mastectomies on the basis of their age, the post millennial reported sunday:
california to facilitate mastectomies for young girls in the name of progresshttps://t.co/rjiante6r5 — libby emmons (@libbyemmons) january 3, 2021
for far too long, individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria have had to battle a host of challenges to get access to gender-affirming care in order to be their true selves, lara stated in a press release, adding:
social stigma, misconceptions about gender dysphoria and its treatment, and outdated medical criteria create barriers to necessary medical care that can lead to tragic results for individuals with gender dysphoria, especially for our transgender youth.
according to the press release, lara's office has received complaints via san diego's transfamily support services that young people with gender dysphoria and their parents reported insurance companies were denying coverage for elective double mastectomies and other radical transgender surgeries for people under the age of 18.
lara's office apparently considers the suggestion that a young girl and her parents take more time to consider such drastic bodily alterations as needlessly delaying the surgery.
to be proactive, health insurance companies should evaluate their coverage criteria for gender dysphoria treatment and eliminate any noncompliant practices to avoid needlessly delaying and interfering with medical care recommended by a patient's doctor, the press statement said.
kathie moehlig, executive director of transfamily support services, said in the statement the group is proud to partner with the california department of insurance to remove the age barrier for gender-affirming care.
this barrier was discriminatory and detrimental to the lives of trans youth, to have to navigate the overwhelming barriers to health care should not be a part of their experience. transgender youth already face so many challenges from unsupportive families, bullying at school, social stigmas, and even violence.
additionally, dr. ward carpenter, co-director of health services at the los angeles lgbt center, said california is now putting insurance companies on notice that they cannot deny access to medically-necessary care based on outdated rules that are not supported by evidence or scientific consensus.
carpenter said by issuing the legal notice to insurance companies, the state is expanding access to health care and also taking an important step in saving the lives of transgender and non-binary (tgnb) adolescents struggling with gender dysphoria, depression and suicidal thoughts.

in september, california gov. gavin newsom (d) signed legislation that establishes a transgender wellness and equity fund that may be used for transgender medical interventions, many of which are known to cause sterility in children.
feminist group women's liberation front (wolf) opposed the legislation:
gov. @gavinnewsom also signed ab2218, and the state of california will pay to sterilize children on the basis of claims to gender identity. https://t.co/brvisganye — wolf (@womenslibfront) september 28, 2020
the statement from lara's office also cites recommendations from the world professional association for transgender health (wpath), referring to the group as an international professional association that provides evidence-based standards of care for transgender people.
the department of insurance continued that wpath states male chest reconstruction surgery to treat gender dysphoria could be carried out in individuals under 18 'depending on an adolescent's specific clinical situation and goals for gender identity expression.'
wpath, however, is an organization whose reputation has been called into question by an increasing number of medical experts and analysts because it receives funding from transgender industry and advocacy groups.
atlanta-based pediatric endocrinologist dr. quentin van meter explained to breitbart news during an interview in 2018 that wpath was launched by psychologist john money and sexologist alfred kinsey, who was a colleague of harry benjamin, to push a political agenda for gender ideology. wpath's original title was the harry benjamin international gender dysphoria association (hbigda).
this is not a scientifically based organization, van meter said. it's essentially a pseudo-professional group of people who are pushing an agenda and have been since the beginning.
to be a member in wpath, you only need to have an interest in transgender issues, he explained. there is no professional degree required, no training specifically, no certification. if you want to be a member, all you need to do is pay your dues.
wpath's website includes a page devoted to scholarship funds that names some of the organization's sponsors who work on both a national and global scope to magnify our efforts in a proactive way.
the association states its focus is on collaborations in three areas:
general rights – partners such as the southern poverty law center, united nations development programs and the world health organization
sexual orientation and gender identity- partners such as the human rights campaign and the international lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex association (ilga)
trans* specific – partner such as the national center for transgender equality, transgender europe (tgeu) and global action for trans* equality (gate)
in november 2019, breitbart news reported that crowdfunding site gofundme showed that more than 26,000 girls and women were seeking financial assistance to have elective double mastectomies, or top surgery, in order to appear more masculine.
president donald trump's deputies have restored the biology-based definition of sexual discrimination in federal healthcare rules, ending the novel transgender definition, which was inserted by obama. https://t.co/s8l9l8k37g — breitbart news (@breitbartnews) june 13, 2020
despite the focus on surgery to change one's appearance in order to look more like the opposite sex, there is no scientific evidence that transgender treatments such as puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgeries, actually benefit young people with gender dysphoria, mainly because gender identity is a psychological — and not a biological — phenomenon.
in july 2019, attorney and writer jane robbins observed at the witherspoon institute's public discourse:
the concept of changing one's biological sex is, of course, nonsense, as sex is determined by unalterable chromosomes. an individual can change his hormone levels and undergo surgery to better imitate the opposite sex, but a male on the day of his conception will remain a male on the day of his death. and as discussed below, the idea that there is a real personal trait called gender that challenges or invalidates the identity significance of biological sex is equally fallacious. but the absence of genuine evidence is simply ignored, and faux evidence is created to validate the mania.
the man who became the first person to obtain a legal sex designation of non-binary now says the transgender lifestyle is a fraud. https://t.co/mem5ncstrw — breitbart news (@breitbartnews) january 8, 2020
the lucrative transgender industry is now enthusiastically treating gender dysphoria with expensive and life-altering medical interventions and surgeries. the cost of double elective mastectomy, for example, is over $10,000.
a gay man and attorney who worked on high-profile lgbt cases, including a challenge the boy scouts ban on homosexual members, set himself on fire on saturday at a public park in new york city to protest fossil fuels and climate change, according to a suicide note.
the charred remains of david buckel were found by a jogger in brooklyn's prospect park.
david buckel, 60, was found in the park at 6.30 a.m. on saturday before hundreds descended on it to enjoy the warm spring weather. he left a note in a bag for police which read: 'my name is david buckel and i just killed myself by fire as a protest suicide. i apologize to you for the mess, the note said.
he was protesting over climate change, his note read, and the dramatic method was intended as a metaphor for how fossil fuels are destroying the planet, the mail reported.
my early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves, the new york daily news reported his suicide note said.
a lifetime of service may best be preserved by giving a life. … honorable purpose in life invites honorable purchase in death. 'this is not new, as many have chose [sic] to give a life based on the view that no other action can most meaningfully address the harm they see. here is a hope that giving a life might bring some attention to the need for expanded actions, and help others give a voice to our home, and earth is heard.
buckel worked on cases for lamda legal, one of the largest lgbt advocacy and legal groups in the nation.
the news of david buckel's death is heartbreaking. this is a tremendous loss for our lambda legal family, but also for the entire movement for social justice. https://t.co/sl9xz2cytr — lambda legal (@lambdalegal) april 14, 2018
friends said that after he left the organization, mr. buckel became involved in environmental causes, which he alluded to in his note as the reason he decided to end his life by self-immolation with fossil fuels, the new york times reported.
pollution ravages our planet, oozing inhabitability via air, soil, water, and weather, buckel wrote in the email sent to the times. most humans on the planet now breathe air made unhealthy by fossil fuels, and many die early deaths as a result — my early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves.
a uk independence party spokesman has called on west midlands police to clarify their position on prosecuting female genital mutilation cases, following a tweet by the force shedding doubt on a zero-tolerance approach.
jane collins mep, ukip's home affairs spokesman, said in a press release she was worried by a tweet put out by west midlands police (wmp) which seemed to suggest that prosecuting the perpetrators of female genital mutilation (fgm) was not a priority for the force as it was unlikely to benefit the child.
in case they delete it, a screengrab of that astonishing tweet by @wmpolice saying they don't want to prosecute for mutilation #fgmletstalk pic.twitter.com/t28zxlp00x — english gardener (@richard_1942) february 26, 2017
a follow-up tweet by detective gill squires, fgm expert for wmp, intending to clarify the force's stance merely further confused the issue by suggesting that the force will only prosecute if it is in the child's best interests to do so.
@wmpsentinel @wmpolice how could it ever not be in the child's interests? — orwellian disciple (@astlesleftfoot1) february 26, 2017
collins said: it is in the best interests of everyone that this child abuse is eradicated. i cannot envisage a situation where the mutilation of a young girl which causes physical and psychological trauma, would result in a decision not to prosecute.
it is only by prosecuting – and i agree with the commons home affairs select committee that it is a 'national scandal' there has yet to be a successful prosecution in the uk since 1985 when it was made illegal – that people will realise we will not live in a country with more than one set of laws.
wmp later deleted the original tweet, replacing it with a link to a 2015 article which they said would help explain the issue.
the article explains that fgm has been a specific offence since the mid-80s, while further legislation introduced in 2015 allowed for parents to be prosecuted if they fail to prevent their daughters being cut.
it goes on to quote dc squires as saying, we're still trying to fully understand the prevalence of fgm in the west midlands but as a force we're much better now at identifying potential victims – and with teachers, healthcare professionals and social workers more switched on to the signs we are seeing an increase in reporting. […] when a child is born to a woman who's undergone fgm, steps are in place to stress to the family the practice is illegal.
detailing how the force planned to use posters in hard-to-reach communities to tackle the practice, she added: the poster has been developed with community members and support groups and will be placed in schools and prominent locations…it's a 'softer' approach to try and work alongside communities to change attitudes about the illegal practice.
fgm is not endorsed by any religion but supposed religious reasons are often used to justify the practice #fgmletstalk pic.twitter.com/k54sqhrwf2 — west midlands police (@wmpolice) february 24, 2017
but collins called for a tough approach to the issue, saying: i don't care if people say it's cultural – it is sick, wrong and illegal and must be enforced with stronger sanctions.
that is why this kind of message put out in the tweet from wmp worries me.
during an interview aired on thursday's broadcast of the fox news channel's hannity, president trump stated that he will most likely declare a national emergency if a deal isn't reached with congress and that he'll see what happens over the next few days.
trump said, if we don't make a deal with congress, most likely i will do that. i would actually say, i would. i can't imagine any reason why not.
later, host sean hannity asked the president about the timeline for how long he would wait before declaring an emergency.
trump answered, well, i think we're going to see what happens over the next few days. they should do it immediately. look, we're not going anywhere. we're not changing our mind. because there's nothing to change your mind about.

the german interior minister has said migrants will be denied permanent residence if they refuse to fit in to german society.
key chancellor angela merkel ally thomas de maizière, minister for the interior since 2013 heralded a slight change of course for the government today, and accepted his announcement could even unsettle some in germany.
although germany has remained steadfastly pro-migrant through the crisis, despite being the focus of much social upheaval and enormous costs, germans are growing more wary of multiculturalism and there is some desire for newcomers to attempt to fit in. playing to that, mr. de maizière said yesterday there has to be a connection between the successful completion of integration and how long you are permitted to stay in germany.
to realise this aim, he announced the government would be introducing a new integration law next month, reports der tagesspiegel. any migrant who refuses to integrate into german society by refusing to take german language lessons or to look for a job will be deported under the new plan.
speaking on his motivation for changing the law, mr. de maizière said we do not want ghettoes.
if mr. de maizière wants no ghettoes in germany, he will have his work cut out for him dismantling the ones already established over decades of mass migration. breitbart london has reported at length on europe's so-called no-go zones where police dare not tread, including those in germany which are dominated by migrant drug gangs.
one such report published just two days before the cologne new year's eve rape attacks described the situation in the same german state — north rhine-westphalia — as beyond the control of the police. one member of parliament from chancellor merkel's own party criticised the local police for having failed to tackle migrant criminality.
he warned that criminal parallel societies are seeking the upper hand or are solidifying existing positions, and the report stated officers often left these migrant controlled areas bruised and battered.
in a sit-down interview with anderson cooper for cbs's 60 minutes, rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-ny) floated taxing the wealthy as much as 70 percent to fund her climate change plan called the green new deal.
[p]eople are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes, ocasio-cortez told cooper in a preview clip of sunday's show while comparing herself to former presidents abraham lincoln and franklin d. roosevelt.
ocasio-cortez: there's an element where, yeah, people are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes.
cooper: do you have a specific on the tax rate?
ocasio-cortez: you know, you look at our tax rates back in the '60s, and when you have a progressive tax rate system, your tax rate, you know, let's say from 0 to $75,000 may be 10 percent or 15 percent, et cetera. but once you get to like the tippy tops, on your 10 millionth dollar, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 percent or 70 percent, that doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more.
cooper: what you are talking about, just big picture, is radical agenda compared to the way politics is done right now.
ocasio-cortez: well, i think that it only has ever been radicals that have changed this country. abraham lincoln made the radical decision to sign the emancipation proclamation. franklin d. roosevelt made the radical decision to embark on establishing programs like social security. that's radical.
cooper: do you call yourself a radical?
ocasio-cortez: yeah, you know, if that's what radical means, call me a radical.
u.s. tech companies want to hire more skilled professionals, so the government should give green cards to foreigners who graduate from u.s. universities, says a report released tuesday by fwd.us, an advocacy group for mark zuckerberg and other wealthy west coast investors.
the tighter labor market means u.s. employers are struggling to fill critical jobs, limiting productivity and putting global leadership at risk. these labor shortages are especially pronounced in emerging industries like artificial intelligence (ai) that rely on science, technology, engineering, and math (stem) skills.
the most straightforward solution is to allow graduates with a u.s. degree and a job offer to start working and begin the green card process immediately, says the report, adding this would relieve pressure on the h-1b program and keep it more focused on truly temporary workers, while facilitating permanent residency for well-educated and highly-skilled individuals who have already lived in the u.s. for some time and can fill permanent roles.
the fwd.us report is just one part of a broader campaign by companies and investors to convince legislators that they must quickly pass a labor-supply bill in 2021. that short timeline would minimize legislators'opportunity to debate the value of flooding the labor market for college graduates. it would also minimize americans' ability to organize opposition to the fwd.us plan, which would likely cut middle-class wages and spike housing costs.
the lobbyist chatter about the need for more skilled workers is about the second term, said daniel horowitz, the editor of conservative review. voters who back president donald trump's america first agenda need to organize this year to defeat next year's push for cheap labor, he said, adding:
the president needs to hear from his base — now is precisely the time to stand up and not stand down out of fear of pressuring the president. … he wants to be pressured [because] it is very hard for the president to go in one direction when 100 percent of the pressure inside the administration is headed in the other direction. the mistake that trump supporters make is they wait until it is too late to stop the president from feeling compelled to go with the swamp … the time to get to the president is early and often.
american graduates have to organize now to push back anticipated demands for more work visas by business roundtable and chamber of commerce types, said marie larson, a technology graduate and a founder of the american workers coalition. american graduates need a seat at the bargaining table because there is no greater stakeholder than american graduates — they are the ones whose livelihood is at stake.
fwd.us was founded by wealthy investors, including facebook founder mark zuckerberg and microsoft founder bill gates, who also helped to expand the h-1b visa program.
the h-1b program lowers american wages by keeping roughly 700,000 indian and chinese graduate visa-workers in a wide variety of u.s. jobs.
overall, roughly one million indian graduates hold american jobs because they are enrolled in the h-1b, opt, j-1, l-1, h4ead, and post-doc programs.
these one million-plus outsourcing workers have been used by ceos, university managers, and investors to stabilize their u.s. workforces and raise their stock-values — but at the cost of reducing many americans' opportunity to innovate and experiment.
govt data shows 1 million indian contract-workers get white-collar jobs in tech, banking, health etc.
the indian hiring ignores many eeoc laws & is expanding amid gov't & media silence.
it is a huge economic & career loss for us college grads.#s368 #h1b https://t.co/pqew9yj89c — neil munro (@neilmunrodc) february 17, 2020
this huge workforce also helps flatline salaries for american graduates. in 2019, for example, lower-skilled americans gained high wage increases amid reduced migration, but high-skilled americans got low salary increases amid the import indian workforce.
that's another lawless, moronic statement. and, who made the laws that allow foreigners to work lawfully? it rather seems the laws are illegal. the people of #alabama need to boot @repmobrooks. he's not for people. he's with corporate america's profits. — michael (@thejackofall) march 5, 2020
the fwd.us report also claims that immigrants are needed to fill 300,000 unfilled tech-jobs:
stem fields have unemployment rates below the national average and more than 300,000 more jobs than there are workers to fill them, according to estimates from new american economy.
mike bloomberg created the new american economy advocacy group. at a february 26 cnn town hall, bloomberg echoed the fwd.us plan by saying he would provide green-cards to every foreigner who graduates from a u.s. university:
one of the things in immigration is you've got to do some things quickly … you've got to staple a green card on every degree when they [foreign students] get out of college, particularly if they're studying stem [science, technology, enginering and math]… we need more immigrants, not less immigrants. and a lot of them come from china.
another founding member of the fwd.us group is former google chief eric schmidt.
the fwd.us report cites his february 27 op-ed in the new york times, which said the u.s. should counter competition from china by importing foreign scientists — such as chinese scientists.
the headline of the op-ed is: eric schmidt: i used to run google. silicon valley could lose to china, and it admits that schmidt and his peers are being out-competed by china:
… in recent years, americans — silicon valley leaders included — have put too much faith in the private sector to ensure u.s. global leadership in new technology. now we are in a technology competition with china that has profound ramifications for our economy and defense — a reality i have come to appreciate as chairman of two government panels on innovation and national security. the government needs to get back in the game in a serious way. important trends are not in our favor. america's lead in artificial intelligence, for example, is precarious. a.i. will open new frontiers in everything from biotechnology to banking, and it is also a defense department priority. leading the world in a.i. is essential to growing our economy and protecting our security. a recent study considering more than 100 metrics finds that the united states is well ahead of china today but will fall behind in five to 10 years. china also has almost twice as many supercomputers and about 15 times as many deployed 5g base stations as the united states. if current trends continue, china's overall investments in research and development are expected to surpass those of the united states within 10 years, around the same time its economy is projected to become larger than ours.
schmidt also admits that he and his peers have failed to attract, recruit, and train enough american innovators, saying, we should undertake major efforts to train up-and-coming scientists and engineers.
the failure to build up domestic skills has left schmidt and his peers dependent on the willingness of foreigners to work in u.s. firms, schmidt suggests:
a majority of computer scientists with graduate degrees working in america were born abroad, as were most current graduate students studying computer science in u.s. universities.
but schmidt argues that america's technological advantages can be preserved by continued reliance on these foreign experts:
they are a source of national strength. a vast majority want to stay and contribute to american innovation. we must make it easier for them to do so. there is no need to wait for comprehensive immigration reform: we can change the immigration process for highly skilled people now to reduce the red tape, backlogs and uncertainty that threaten to drive tech talent to other countries — including to our strategic competitors.
schmidt's reference to red tape, backlogs, and uncertainty is likely a reference to the s.386 bill being pushed utah gop sen. mike lee.
lee's bill would fast-track roughly 300,000 indian visa-workers into green cards and then citizenship, regardless of the impact on american graduates.
the 300,000 indians are part of the much larger workforce of roughly 1 million indian visa-workers. the indians have been imported to replace many of the boisterous american professionals who provided the skills and innovation which powered silicon valley in the 1980s and 1990s.
new infosys lawsuit helps explain how the huge h-1b/opt outsourcing economy pressures & rewards indian managers to discriminate against american graduates, including indian legal immigrants.
follow the money, all the way to india.
and to utah's #s386https://t.co/anismobiu6 — neil munro (@neilmunrodc) february 5, 2020
lee's s.386 bill also offers the promise of fast-track work permits to the next wave of indian graduates who accept lower wages to work in americans' jobs. there are no caps in the opt and h-1b programs, and lee's bill could roll back complicated country caps curbs on the award of green cards to foreign workers.
so far, lee's s.368 bill has been blocked by several gop and democratic senators, by a few business interests, and by new groups of u.s. professionals. the high-stakes economic fight gets minimal coverage from white-collar journalists in the establishment media.
but fwd.us, the chamber of commerce, bloomberg's group, major universities, and other lobbies are expected to push for a quick passage of s.386 shortly after the election, say lobbyists from all sides of the fight.
neither schmidt's op-ed nor the fwd.us report suggested that companies should expand the u.s. workforce by offering higher salaries and benefits to american graduates.
those benefits could include legal changes to end the large-scale indian outsourcing that has pushed many american experts out of silicon valley companies and into the unemployment line.
actor matt damon says he's sorry for the anger-inducing string of comments he's made of late, for which he was accused by many of downplaying the culture of sexual misconduct currently upending much of the entertainment world.
i really wish i'd listened a lot more before i weighed in on this, damon said in an appearance tuesday on today i don't want to further anybody's pain with anything that i do or say. so for that i am really sorry.
in december, the downsizing star received backlash after seemingly excusing sen. al franken's (d-mn) alleged serial sexual assault as a terrible joke and said he'd be able to work with louis ck after the comedian admitted to masturbating in front of several women.
those rolling stone interview comments were preceded by damon's admission to abc news that there's apparently a spectrum of behavior and that there's a difference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right?
damon managed to enrage more people by insisting that the sh*tload of guys who aren't sexual predators aren't getting enough credit.
now, damon — whose acting career was launched into superstardom, with help from disgraced movie mogul harvey weinstein — says he's going to sit down and shut up and let the women leading the anti-harassment time's up movement do the work without him getting in the way.
a lot of those women are my dear friends and i love them and respect them and support what they're doing and want to be a part of that change and want to go along for the ride, but i should get in the back seat and close my mouth for a while, he said on today.
the wave of misconduct allegations against powerful men in hollywood hit home with damon, who, in october, was accused of pressuring the new york times in 2004 to kill a story alleging sexual abuse against weinstein.
last month, a petition was launched demanding damon's cameo in the upcoming female-led heist reboot ocean's 8 be removed from the film. the petition, which says damon's role in the film is a show of massive disrespect for the brave women speaking out, has more than 28,000 signatures.

apple ceo tim cook announced wednesday the tech giant will be combatting systemic racism and advancing racial equity nationwide with two new school projects launched under its racial equity and justice initiative (reji) project.
apple has committed $100 million to its reji project to help dismantle systemic barriers to opportunity and combat injustices faced by communities of color, the press release stated.
the company's efforts will include the propel center, a learning hub for historically black colleges and universities (hbcus) and an apple developer academy, which expects to support coding and tech education for students in detroit.
apple said its projects will help build the next generation of diverse leaders.
we are all accountable to the urgent work of building a more just, more equitable world — and these new projects send a clear signal of apple's enduring commitment. we're launching reji's latest initiatives with partners across a broad range of industries and backgrounds — from students to teachers, developers to entrepreneurs, and community organizers to justice advocates — working together to empower communities that have borne the brunt of racism and discrimination for far too long.
we are honored to help bring this vision to bear, and to match our words and actions to the values of equity and inclusion we have always prized at apple, cook said.
apple announced the reji project following the protests, looting, and rioting that occurred in the united states following the deaths of george floyd, breonna taylor, and others.
every individual deserves equal access to opportunity regardless of skin color or zip code, said lisa jackson, apple vice president of environment, policy, and social initiatives.
for too long, communities of color have faced gross injustices and institutional barriers to their pursuit of the american dream, and we are proud to lend our voices and resources to build new engines of opportunity that empower, inspire, and create meaningful change.
the propel center was designed by ed farm, an education social justice group that works primarily with birmingham city schools and adults in the greater birmingham area. its key partners are apple and alabama power.
ed farm says the propel center is a physical and virtual campus imagined and designed … to provide historically black colleges and universities (hbcus) with shared services to support their work of preparing leaders who improve our word [sic].
the propel center will help cultivate leadership and drive innovation in tech and beyond, acting as a springboard for change in communities across america, ed farm founder anthony oni said in a statement.
the mission of the propel center is to provide innovative curricula to hbcu's in order to train black students in leadership skills. included in the curricula will be artificial intelligence (ai), agricultural technologies, social justice, entertainment arts, career preparation, and entrepreneurship.
apple says its experts will help develop the curricula and provide mentorship and learning support.
the apple developer academy in detroit, a joint effort with michigan state university, aims to empower young black entrepreneurs, creators, and coders, helping them cultivate the skills necessary for jobs in the rapidly growing ios app economy, the press statement says.
during a monday appearance on fnc's fox & friends, house minority leader kevin mccarthy (r-ca) weighed in on the recording of a phone call obtained by the washington post of president donald trump pressuring georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger (r) to recalculate the state's votes from the 2020 presidential election.
mccarthy argued that the election was not conducted well. he suggested to prevent delayed results and to shore up the integrity of future elections, congress should debate how to conduct the elections because it will unite this nation.
the president has always been concerned about the integrity of the election, mccarthy said of the audio. and the president believes that there are things that happened in georgia, and he wants to see the accountability for it. but look, does anybody in america think the last election was done well?
what has happened here in this last election because of covid — people just sending ballots out to anyone who is on the rolls. well, these rolls have not been cleaned up. and this isn't the first time this has happened, he added. when are we going to straighten out our elections, and when can we have a debate about the integrity of the elections? and if we really want to unite this nation, that's what the house should be doing — and the senate. this should never happen again in the future. we've watched it before. we have to change it, and we have to make sure that our elections are accountable, have integrity, and are safe.

the head of the democratic national committee and several voting rights groups are calling on states to mail ballots to all voters to keep remaining primaries running as the coronavirus pandemic is keeping millions of americans at home
voting rights groups and the head of the democratic national committee want the states with remaining primary elections to offer voting by mail as a way to ensure that voters can safely cast their ballots amid the coronavirus outbreak.
a quick and easy fix? not always.
for states that don't already have vote-by-mail or that greatly restrict it, such a change could require amending state law. it also would require major changes to state and county voting and tabulating systems. buying the equipment and software to track ballots and read the signatures on them could cost millions. and that's not to mention deciding who pays for return postage — individual voters or taxpayers?
so far this year, there have been quick moves to extend mail voting in only two cases, both limited in scope: maryland postponed its primary but decided to hold next month's special congressional election by mail. and the democratic party in wyoming, which already was sending all its members ballots, has canceled the in-person portion of its presidential caucus.
as in wyoming, the democratic caucuses and primaries in alaska, hawaii and kansas were already to be held largely by mail this spring. so far, none of the five states that have postponed their primaries — georgia, kentucky, louisiana, maryland or ohio — have said they will mail ballots statewide.
a bill in louisiana seeking to expand vote-by-mail was introduced even before the state's primary was pushed back, but it hasn't received a legislative hearing and is opposed by the state's top elections official. pennsylvania lawmakers eased absentee ballot rules last year, and now democrats want to expand voting by mail. republicans, who control the statehouse, have generally resisted voting changes, and it's unclear if the virus crisis is enough to overcome concerns about the costs of greatly expanding vote-by-mail.
opposition isn't unusual, typically because lawmakers or election officials believe it opens a pathway to voter fraud. the ability to receive a ballot in the mail is greatly restricted in 16 states.
those states allow absentee ballots only for voters who give a valid reason to get one — and require they be requested for each election. of those, delaware and new york are phasing in no-excuse mail voting.
the hurdles to implementing voting by mail for all voters is why states might be better off taking only small steps at first, said charles stewart, a professor of political science at the massachusetts institute of technology. that could mean simply making absentee ballots easier to get.
hastily implemented changes to voting rules and laws can end up causing all types of problems that you didn't anticipate, he said.
doug jones, an election security expert at the university of iowa, said universal mail voting also raises concerns about voters illegally selling blank ballots or being coerced to vote a certain way.
on tuesday, after ohio postponed its primary and poll workers failed to show up at some florida and illinois precincts, democratic national committee chairman tom perez called a shift to voting largely by mail the simplest tool to balance health concerns and the need to carry out a fundamental function of democracy.
a half-dozen states already have or are implementing systems where all voters are mailed ballots. they can mail them back, drop them off at designated spots or choose to vote in person on election day.
oregon has been conducting elections that way since the 1990s. since then, california, colorado, hawaii, utah and washington have implemented or begun phasing in similar systems.
with the coronavirus pandemic, the idea has generated more interest. the national vote at home institute advocates for a switch to a mail-based voting system and consults with governments about it.
said chief executive amber mcreynolds: it's better than hoping people show up and aren't scared, and hoping that you don't have a giant poll worker shortage and hoping polling places aren't closed.

in his weekly angelus address sunday, pope francis commented on the meeting of jesus with an adulterous woman, observing that the woman is an image of all humanity, since we are all adulterers who have cheated on god's love.
in his reflection on the sunday gospel reading, the pope recalled the episode where a group of pharisees drag a woman caught in adultery before jesus to see how he will react, reminding him that moses prescribed stoning for this sin and hoping to trap him in his response. rather than take a stand on her punishment, jesus suggests that the one with no sin on his own conscience be the first to throw a stone at her.
this woman represents all of us, since we are sinners, that is, adulterers before god, traitors of his faithfulness, francis said.
on this, the third anniversary of his pontificate, pope francis told the crowd of thousands gathered in saint peter's square that the story is one of his favorite passages in the bible, that he likes to read and reread often. it highlights the theme of the mercy of god, he said, who never wills the death of the sinner but that he be converted and live.
francis noted that the pharisees weren't really looking for jesus' opinion on the mosaic teaching but rather were trying to ensnare him in a catch-22 situation. either jesus contradicts the law of moses by recommending leniency, thus alienating himself from his jewish followers, or he takes a hardline stance and recommends the stoning of the woman, thus betraying his own call to gentleness and mercy.
instead, francis notes, jesus escapes from their trap by suggesting that the one who is without sin cast the first stone, and they all leave one by one, beginning with the eldest.
and so once all the pharisees have walked away, jesus turns to the woman and says, where are they? has no one condemned you?
and jesus answers: neither do i condemn you. go, and sin no more.
though we only know of this woman by the title the adulteress, francis said, this label does not do justice to her, because jesus sees the person beyond her sin and desires her salvation.
the pope reminded his hearers that we should not identify ourselves or others by our inclinations toward sinful behavior, a tendency all too common in today's world.
god does not nail us to our sin, francis said, and he does not identify us with the evil we have done. we have a name, and god does not identify this name with the sin we have committed.
jesus makes the woman feel, perhaps for the first time, that she is not her sin, that she has a dignity of a person; that she can change her life and escape from her bondage and walk in a new way, he said. because every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future.
we would all do well, francis added, to have the courage to drop the stones we carry to throw at others, and think a bit on our own sins!

a significant 86 per cent of austrians surveyed in a snap poll on sunday night support their country continuing independent action to deal with the migrant crisis, without the guidance or agreement of the european union (eu).
austria was on the main migratory corridor from the near east and north africa to europe, sitting at the top of the so called 'balkans route' until action by nations like hungary and macedonia closed access to the peninsula by illegal incursions.
despite having spent much of 2015 being highly critical of efforts to close the route, austria's government under chancellor werner faymann is now taking a much harder line, and this is proving extremely popular with voters, reports kronen zeitung.
a snap poll taken after a sunday night television appearance by the chancellor, in which he again called on his german counterpart angela merkel to change course on her migrant strategy, found broad agreement with the new direction of travel for the country. with the statement austria should continue to set their own migrant policy as long as there is no solution at eu level, 86 per cent agreed, with 62 per cent agreeing strongly.
although the question left the possibility of austria falling into line with the eu at a later date should a continent-wide approach to the migrant crisis be agreed on, to the respondents this seemed a remote possibility. some 83 per cent said they couldn't see any sort of agreement between the eu-28 in the next few weeks.
a similar proportion also believed austria should be unafraid to make decisions independently of the eu. asked is it right to enforce the balkan closure along with other states, 85 per cent agreed, with just six per cent disagreeing strongly.
the transformation of austria's chancellor faymann from a merkel-esque advocate of unlimited asylum for all comers into an advocate of border control and fences was as unexpected as it was sudden. austrian media now characterises him as a frenemy to the german chancellor, describing his conversion to plan b as an emancipation.
explaining this transformation, chancellor faymann has spoken of plan b as self defence for austria, and insisted austria could not become the waiting room of germany.
his reticence to play ball with the euro club of leaders in brussels while working out ad hoc solutions with neighbours may prove unpopular in brussels. as breitbart london reported, swedish leader stephen löfven slammed european countries not accepting migrant quotas as beneath contempt.
calling for a pan-european solution and discouraging exactly the action austria, hungary, and others have taken, mr. löfven said:
the important thing now in such a difficult situation is that we do things together in the eu. if all keep on with their own unplanned solutions we'll make it even worse.
the algemeiner reports: ahead of president donald trump's visit to the jewish state next week, hundreds of family members of israeli terror victims have signed a letter to the american leader that urges him to pressure the palestinian authority (pa) to stop giving money to terrorists and their families, the hebrew news site nrg reported on tuesday.
before peace talks can be renewed, the letter said, the palestinians must demonstrate good faith and show that they are truly willing to change their ways by stopping incitement and halting all payments to terrorists who murdered israelis.
furthermore, the letter's signatories asked for a meeting with trump during his time in israel.
golf, like baseball a few years ago, has a power problem. jack nicklaus has a powerful solution.
i think with the length the guys hit today … the simplest solution is change the frigging golf ball, nicklaus explained at augusta national. the golf ball goes so far.
courses overflowing with money can elongate the fairways. but few posses such funds. so changing the ball, nicklaus believes, remains the soundest solution.
augusta national is about the only place, the only golf course in the world that financially can afford to make the changes that they have to make to keep up with the golf ball, the 18-time major winner maintain. i don't think anybody else could ever do it.
