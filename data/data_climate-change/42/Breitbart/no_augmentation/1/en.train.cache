so imagine a classifier that says, for any queries on a particular text file, let's pull videos using signals that we historically understand to be strong indicators of quality (i won't go into specifics here, but those signals do exist). we're not manually curating these results, we're just saying hey, be extra careful with results for this query because many times really bad stuff can appear and lead to a bad experience for most users. ideally the proactive lever did this for us, but in extreme cases where we need to act quickly on something that is so obviously not okay, the reactive/manual approach is sometimes necessary. and also keep in mind, that this is different for every product. the bar for changing classifiers or manual actions on span in organic search is extremely high. however, the bar for things we let our google assistant say out loud might be a lot lower. if i search for jews run the banks – i'll likely find anti-semitic stuff in organic search. as a jew, i might find some of these results offensive, but they are there for people to research and view, and i understand that this is not a reflection of google feels about this issue. but if i ask google assistant why do jews run the banks we wouldn't be similarly accepting if it repeated and promoted conspiracy theories that likely pop up in organic search in her smoothing voice.

my point is that statistical cooling outliers garner no media attention. the global average temperature numbers come out monthly. if they show a new hottest year on record, that's a big story. if they show a big increase over the previous month, or the same month in the previous year, that's a story. if they represent a sequence of warming months or years, that's a story. when they show cooling of any sort—and there have been more cooling months than warming months since anthropogenic warming began—there's no story.

manually reacting to things is not very scalable, and is not an ideal solution to most problems, so the proactive lever is really the one we all like to lean on. ideally, our classifiers/algorithm are good at providing useful and rich results to our users while ignoring things at are not useful or not relevant. but we all know, this isn't exactly the case all the time (especially on youtube). from a user perspective, there are subjects that are prone to hyperbolic content, misleading information, and offensive content. now, these words are highly subjective and no one denies that. but we can all agree generally, lines exist in many cultures about what is clearly okay vs. what is not okay. e.g. a video of a puppy playing with a toy is probably okay in almost every culture or context, even if it's not relevant to the query. but a video of someone committing suicide and begging others to follow in his/her footsteps is probably on the other side of the line for many folks. while my second example is technically relevant to the generic query of suicide, that doesn't mean that this is a very useful or good video to promote on the top of results for that query. so imagine a classifier that says, for any queries on a particular text file, let's pull videos using signals that we historically understand to be strong indicators of quality (i won't go into specifics here, but those signals do exist).

in addition to allowing speeches that spread and stirred violence, foreign social platforms facebook, twitter and telegram have been popular tools for hong kong rioters to call for illegal assemblies and to doxx police officers. posts promoting hong kong secession are rife on these platforms, the global times previously learned from the hong kong police. platforms such as telegram have fallen into rioters' hands. these companies have always refused to cooperate with police on law enforcement issues, and because there were no legal terms, they only operated under corporation status, ronny chan, chairman of the superintendents' association of the hong kong police force, told the global times previously.

if georgians want to keep the gains that were made during president donald trump's administration, such as the tax cuts and more, blackburn said they need to re-elect loeffler and perdue because otherwise the democrats will control the u.s. senate committees and be able to rip apart the president's achievements. what's more, if voters care about election integrity or holding president-elect joe biden and his family accountable for their various scandals, she said that the democrats controlling the committees would sweep these issues under the rug.

for a country that has been more or less on the rise for the whole of its history – in other words, for well over two centuries – this has come as a huge shock. americans have thought of their country as the land of opportunity, god's chosen people, the leading country in the world. given this backdrop, it is hardly surprising that americans were totally unprepared for what has happened in the last twenty years: two failed wars, the 2008 financial crisis, a weakening economy, accelerated national decline and the rise of china. the consequence has been unhappiness and angst, profound uncertainty and loss of confidence about the future, and growing divisions.

auto parts prices have not risen sharply. on a year over year basis, auto parts are up 2.2 percent and rose 0.4 percent in december. excluding tires, however, auto parts fell 0.4 percent in december, reversing the gains of the previous three months. ex-tires auto parts prices are now up 2.9 percent from a year ago–another slowdown in year over year prices from the steeper 3.6 percent recorded in november. it's possible that the steeper gains seen earlier were due to metals or china tariffs or both but that now seems less likely. the december decline suggests a larger role for the storms that flooded some areas of the south this fall, pushing up demand for parts as consumers repaired storm-damaged cars.

austin, texas (ap) — texas was tired of waiting for tom herman to deliver a big 12 title and turn the longhorns back into national championship contenders.
and, in both 1969 and 2005, a democratic senator joined with a democratic house member in forcing votes in both houses on whether to accept the presidential electors being challenged. the most direct precedent on this question arose in 1877, following serious allegations of fraud and illegal conduct in the hayes-tilden presidential race. specifically, the elections in three states—florida, louisiana, and south carolina—were alleged to have been conducted illegally. in 1877, congress did not ignore those allegations, nor did the media simply dismiss those raising them as radicals trying to undermine democracy. instead, congress appointed an electoral commission—consisting of five senators, five house members, and five supreme court justices—to consider and resolve the disputed returns. we should follow that precedent. to wit, congress should immediately appoint an electoral commission, with full investigatory and fact-finding authority, to conduct an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in the disputed states. once completed, individual states would evaluate the commission's findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a change in their vote, if needed.

leahy: no. in fact, i was there when the democrats were in charge of the senate in the last year of president reagan's term, a member of the judiciary committee, and i urged that we go forward with president reagan's nomination. and we did. so, i mean, i'm pretty clear where i am. now, justice scalia was a friend of mine. we disagreed on a lot of things. i had a lot of respect for him and his family. in fact, his youngest son and our youngest son used to play soccer in grade school on saturday mornings. justice scalia, nino — we would call him nino — and i would stand there in our old clothes watching the kids playing and joking back and forth. so, i mean, this has to be a terrible blow to his family. let's not add to that blow by politicizing this. let's do exactly what president obama, what democrats did for president reagan and have the vote.

for the first time in meaningful numbers, refugees and other migrants came to europe, and europe was totally unprepared for that. but not only was europe unprepared then, it's still unprepared today. and it was unable to get its act together, and the divisions in europe do not allow for a european response. to this situation. the first thing one needs to look at is what the reality is, not what the perceptions are. we reached one million people that have crossed the mediterranean. but we are talking of the european union of more than 500 million people. so we have less than two refugees per thousand people in the european union. now if you go to lebanon, we have one refugee for each 3 or 4 lebanese. so it is clear that this problem could have been managed, but to be managed it would be necessary to have all european countries assume a common responsibility. first of all, doing their best to address the root causes, doing their best to contribute to the peace in syria or of other crises. but at the same time recognizing that many will come, preparing that arrival with adequate reception conditions at entry points, making sure that people at entry points could be welcomed, could be given shelter. this would require an important investment if proper reception conditions would be in place. and a fair distribution of people by plane in normal circumstances to all european countries, this crisis would have been perfectly managed.
naturally, the left-wing fascists in the social justice movement were quick to put and rage over not getting their way:
on february 12, north korea launched a pukguksong-2 intermediate-range ballistic missile (irbm). a decade of sanctions has not deterred the hermit kingdom from pursuing its goal of developing long-range, intercontinental ballistic missiles (icbm) with nuclear warheads which could target the u.s. homeland. yet, the trump administration has an opportunity to escape from the tit-for-tat cycle of following each north korean missile test with yet more ineffectual sanctions.
rather than sue [deadspin's] bullying internet pirates into submission the way tech billionaire peter thiel did, espn chose to acquiesce and adopt progressive ideology and diversity as groundbreaking business innovations. espn is the exact network deadspin desired. it's diverse on its surface, progressive in its point of view, and more concerned with spinning media narratives than with the quality of its product.

one of the biggest lies our leaders tell is that you can separate economics from everything else that matters. economics is a topic for public debate. family and faith and culture, those are personal matters. both parties believe this. members of our educated upper-middle-classes, now the backbone of the democratic party, usually describe themselves as fiscally responsible and socially moderate. in other words, functionally libertarian. they don't care how you live, as long as the bills are paid and the markets function. somehow they don't see a connection between people's personal lives and the health of our economy, or for that matter, the country's ability to pay its bills. as far as they're concerned, these are two totally separate categories.

in my day, i must have had three or four courses where we read on liberty, by john stuart mill, which taught the basics of free speech and why we need it. it was very common to read john stuart mill and other defenses of free speech in the tradition of classical liberalism – such as what the founders practiced. this is not taught today. instead, people teach about so-called white privilege and other ideas that, in an indirect way, are ultimately derived from marxism or what you might call neo-marxism, where the basic idea is that individual rights are just an illusion, and you really have just a bunch of powerful classes. instead of an economic class nowadays they talk about it as an ethnic or a gender class. and those powerful classes dominate and they create ideas like free speech that pretend to be neutral and fair to every individual, but they really aren't. they're just disguising the power of the class. that ideology comes from marx, but it's been spread out and used in this new frame with ethnicity and gender. so, this is the ideology that dominates the ethos of the studies programs.

with numbers like this, the effort is by far the most serious in modern history to challenge, via the process of congress certifying the electoral college results, an election. there have been other attempts, like after trump's win in 2016 in early 2017 some house democrats tried to challenge the results but did not get a senator on board with their challenge. also, in early 2005, some house democrats joined with then-sen. barbara boxer (d-ca) to challenge then-president george w. bush's re-election. that effort failed, as vast majorities in both chambers of congress rejected it.

look at our profit structure. to put it plainly, china's listed companies don't really make money. then who has taken the few profits made by china's more than 3,000 listed companies? two-thirds have been taken by the banking sector and real estate. the profits earned by 1,444 listed companies on the sme board and growth enterprise board are not even equal to one and half times the profit of the industrial and commercial bank of china. how can this kind of stock market become a bull market? when we buy stocks, we are buying the profits of the company, not hype and rumors. i recently read a report comparing the profits of china's listed companies with those in the u.s. there are many u.s. public companies with tens of billions dollars in profits. how many chinese tech and manufacturing companies are there that have accomplished this? there is only one, but it's not listed, and you all know which one that is. [xiang is referring to huawei, the chinese tech company.] what does this tell us?
for someone to win the vote, they need to win a majority of those members who voted for a candidate. voting present technically is a thrown-away vote, as it does not count toward the number of votes cast for candidates, and thereby lowers the total threshold. assuming all 435 members of the house are present and vote for a candidate, that would mean the winner needs 218 votes. if anyone is absent or votes present and not for a candidate, that lowers the number of votes a winner needs one member for each two members voting present or absent from the vote.

the country exported only $1.867 billion non-oil goods during november 21-december 22, less than half of iran's monthly average during the current fiscal year, which started on march 21, 2018. the plunge in exports was partly due to a complete stoppage in ultra-light oil (gas condensate) sales, which iran includes in non-oil export basket. the monthly gas condensate export has averaged at about $330 million, or only a seventh of the drop in total non-oil exports during november 21-december 22. in the other world, u.s. oil-related sanctions also seriously impacted iran's non-oil exports as well. the u.s. also imposed financial sanctions on iran in august, but the details of customs statistics does not show any meaningful change in the non-oil exports level during the august-november period. during the first nine months of the fiscal year (fy), the country has exported about 5.6 million metric tons of gas condensate at $2.776 billion, which indicates a 50% decline year-on-year. however, the country's total non-oil exports during march 21-december 22 reached $33.36 billions, or 4.5% more than the same period in last fy. despite this growth, iran has fulfilled less than 70% of its non-oil export target for the period. its non-fuel imports also declined 13.3% year-on-year to $32.62 billion.

there are technically two votes for the speakership. the first is in conference, where members of a party select whom their candidate will be. democrats already selected pelosi as their conference's candidate with a late november vote of 203-32 with three blank ballots and one absent member. the second, and more consequential, vote is on the floor of the house of representatives. the first order of business of a new congress is for the house to elect a speaker. so, when the 115th congress disbands and the 116th congress is sworn in, before the house can do anything else, the chamber must elect a speaker.

and i think many people are used to the fact that organic search is a place where content should be accessible no matter how offensive it might be, however, the expectation is very different on a google home, a knowledge panel, or even youtube. these lines are very difficult and can be very blurry, we are all well aware of this. so we've got huge teams that stay cognizant of these facts when we're crafting policies considering classifier changes, or reacting with manual actions – these decisions are not made in a vacuum, but admittedly are also not made in a highly public forum like tgif or industryinfo (as you can imagine, decisions/agreement would be hard to get in such a wide list – image if all your cl's were reviewed by every engineer across google all the time). i hope that answers some questions and gives a better layer of transparency without going into details about our pepsi formula. best, daniel

the momentum is very much one-sided, declared carney. one side depends on the government and hollywood, and one side depends on real america, where the people actually live and where the abortions actually happen. the march for life — 46 years of legalized abortion — every year the march gets larger and it gets younger. i'm 36 years old. i have seven kids, but i'm one of the old guys at the march. there are a lot of college students, a lot of high school students, and it's very encouraging. the former president of naral resigned after she witnessed march for life in person. she cited her inability to motivate young people to support abortion.

the 117th congress must understand that we have a mandate to legislate in defense of black lives. the first step in that process is to root out white supremacy starting with impeaching the white supremacist in chief, she added, prompting boos from members in the room:

[n]umber two, i would send immediately to the desk of the united states congress when i'm elected president – if i'm elected president – a codification of roe v wade, amended by casey, because i think it is a woman's right to choose. i think it's a woman's opportunity to be able to make that decision. and in fact, i've gotten 100% rating from naral as well.

two different worlds. similar outcomes. how did this happen? you'd think our ruling class would be interested in knowing the answer. mostly they're not. they don't have to be. it's easier to import foreign labor to take the place of native-born americans who are slipping behind. but republicans now represent rural voters. they ought to be interested. here's a big part of the answer: male wages declined. manufacturing, a male-dominated industry, all but disappeared over the course of a generation. all that remained in many areas were the schools and the hospitals, both traditional employers of women. in many places, women suddenly made more than men. before you applaud this as a victory for feminism, consider the effects. study after study has shown that when men make less than women, women generally don't want to marry them. maybe they should want to, but they don't. over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out of wedlock births, and all the familiar disasters that follow: more drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed in the next generation. this isn't speculation, or propaganda from the evangelicals. it's social science. we know it's true. rich people know it best of all. that's why they get married before they have kids. that model works. increasingly, marriage is a luxury only the affluent in america can afford.

the frightening encounter, in which bevo broke free of the metal barricades he was caged within and ran in uga's direction, aired live just before the game. bevo's handlers were quick to say that the steer is as docile as a lamb and that [h]e was just going to say hi, and that may be true. steers, like all animals, are individuals with unique personalities. it's quite possible that bevo was simply scared by the noise, lights, and chaos in the stadium and tried to flee from the confines of his makeshift pen. but that doesn't change the fact that uga or any of the humans standing nearby could easily have been trampled and killed. this frightening near-tragedy is yet another example of the reason most colleges and professional sports teams retired their live-animal mascots decades ago—and the handful who haven't yet should quickly follow suit. live animals used as mascots, such as baylor university's bears and the university of north alabama's lions, are held in captivity and often denied the opportunity to fulfill many of their most basic instincts. they're frequently carted around to sporting events and public appearances, which are confusing and frightening for them. human mascots can engage with sports fans, pose for pictures, lead cheers, and pump up their teams and fans much better than a terrified animal can. they're also much less expensive for schools, and some universities offer scholarships for student mascots.

mermaids is a british charity which is actually quite notorious. it should be interrogated far more than it is. it claims to be supportive of young people who don't know what gender they are and to advocate for transgender youth […] i'm very sceptical about this whole thing. we're allowing something utterly mad to go with the adults giving up. this idea that because you're feeling a bit feminine one day and a bit masculine on another and it's all so confusing — no, i don't accept all of this. i offer a weeks' supply of actually edible croissant from any of starbucks' competitors to anyone who can actually define for me what 'non-binary' actually means. mermaids is an incredibly sinister organisation. i don't accept that there's such a thing as transgender youth. i think the adults have left the room on this and it is not for a major multinational like starbucks to jump on board something on which so little has been thought about ethically and practically.

another proposal is to build the sites reservoir in the foothills west of the small town of maxwell, just over an hour north of sacramento. as noted earlier, the sites reservoir would store 500,000 acre-feet of off-stream water, meaning that it would not dam an active river, but rather be a site for water from other sites to be stored as available and used as needed. proponents argue that it would contribute to environmental quality as well as the state's storage capacity.

it's important to be aware that we are just looking at just one of the symptoms of a deeper problem, and a central question is, the reason why [the refugees] are fleeing. it's this dramatic multiplication of conflicts in the world. it's the fact the international community has lost much of its capacity to avoid conflicts, to prevent conflicts, and then to timely solve them. and this what leads in my opinion to have a surge in diplomacy for peace. ten years ago, we had about 38 million people displaced by conflict in the world. now we have about 60 million people. according to the numbers of the first semester of this year, things are still getting worse in 2016. 5% more people displaced, 80% more individuals by requesting help. and worse than that, ten years ago, we were helping one million people go back home every year. now in the last year, we only helped 130,000 people go back home, which means we are having more and more people forced to flee, and less and less people being able to find a solution for their plight. we are like a nurse that provides an aspririn to a patient. we are able to alleviate the pain, but we don't solve the problem. that is the political dimension of the humanitarian crisis. humanitarians need to be impartial, neutral, to abide by humanitarian principles, not to be political. but we need to be humble enough to recognize that there is no humanitarian solution for this problems.

they have plenty of harsh words, however, for the conservatives who were targeted. many commission members are skeptical of these speakers' commitment to anything other than the pursuit of wealth and fame through the instigation of anger, fear, and vengefulness in their hard-right constituency. their invitations to speak represented the assertion of individual rights at the expense of social responsibility by a handful of students. as a result, the commission finds speech of this kind hard to defend, especially in light of the acute distress it caused (and was intended to cause) to staff and students. in the report, conservatives are active, provoking and triggering. the left-wing activists who set things on fire appear in passive voice, that great grammatical machine for sanitizing the indefensible. left-wing groups have reasonable fears for their safety from conservative speakers, and the police needed to defend them (from what? further deponent sayeth not.) conservative students allege that their beliefs make them targets for left-wing professors. and when it comes to the remedies, it's clear who the commission thinks ought to change their ways.

we [president obama and i] felt so strongly, from the day we took office, for the need for immigration reform, said vice president biden in 2014, who had also voted in favor of the secure fence act when he was a senator.
one person who seems particularly worried about the outcome, at least privately, is president-elect joe biden. according to a report tuesday morning from politico, the democrat presidential candidate who became the first since bill clinton in the early 1990s to flip georgia—biden finished barely ahead of trump on nov. 3, and trump contends he still won the state and that fraud led to biden's victory—believes that both warnock and jon ossoff will lose their races on tuesday.

the simple fact is this obstructionism is unsustainable and not surprisingly our republican colleagues are reflecting and reconsidering and eventually they must relent as the outcry and outrage of public opinion swells and surges. not surprisingly some of them are already feeling the heat and reflecting it in their feeling — as sen. grassley and sen. tillis and sen. johnson — have already indicated, the current position is unsustainable.

in recent years, china-us relations have run into unprecedented difficulties. fundamentally, it all comes down to the serious misconceptions of us policymakers about china. some see china as the so-called biggest threat and their china policy based on this misperception is simply wrong. what has happened proves that the us attempt to suppress china and start a new cold war has not just seriously harmed the interests of the two peoples, but also caused severe disruptions to the world. such a policy will find no support and is doomed to fail. china-us relations have come to a new crossroads, and a new window of hope is opening. we hope that the next us administration will return to a sensible approach, resume dialogue with china, restore normalcy to the bilateral relations and restart cooperation.

these organic search policies and the consequences to violating them are public manually reacting to things is not very scalable, and is not an ideal solution to most problems, so the proactive lever is really the one we all like to lean on. ideally, our classifiers/algorithm are good at providing useful and rich results to our users while ignoring things at are not useful or not relevant. but we all know, this isn't exactly the case all the time (especially on youtube). from a user perspective, there are subjects that are prone to hyperbolic content, misleading information, and offensive content. now, these words are highly subjective and no one denies that. but we can all agree generally, lines exist in many cultures about what is clearly okay vs. what is not okay. e.g. a video of a puppy playing with a toy is probably okay in almost every culture or context, even if it's not relevant to the query. but a video of someone committing suicide and begging others to follow in his/her footsteps is probably on the other side of the line for many folks. while my second example is technically relevant to the generic query of suicide, that doesn't mean that this is a very useful or good video to promote on the top of results for that query.

polygamy is not a random crime. it's a problem of ego and ignorance, men who have been stripped of their land needing women to treat as property, she said.
when you care about people, you do your best to treat them fairly. our leaders don't even try. they hand out jobs and contracts and scholarships and slots at prestigious universities based purely on how we look. there's nothing less fair than that, though our tax code comes close. under our current system, an american who works for a salary pays about twice the tax rate of someone who's living off inherited money and doesn't work at all. we tax capital at half of what we tax labor. it's a sweet deal if you work in finance, as many of the richest people do. in 2010, for example, mitt romney made about $22 million dollars in investment income. he paid a federal tax rate of 14 percent. for normal upper-middle-class wage earners, the federal tax rate is nearly 40 percent. no wonder romney supports the status quo. but for everyone else, it's infuriating. our leaders rarely mention any of this. they tell us our multi-tiered tax code is based on the principles of the free market. please. it's based on laws that congress passed, laws that companies lobbied for in order to increase their economic advantage. it worked well for those people, but at a big cost to everyone else. unfairness is profoundly divisive. when you favor one child over another, your kids don't hate you. they hate each other. that happens in countries too. it's happening in ours, probably by design. divided countries are easier to rule.

the madness of trump, as bad as it was, it really needed to happen. we really needed a reflection of our world's greatest problem, which is not climate change, but sociopathy and narcissism. especially in america, she said. it's going to kill the world. it's not capitalism, it's narcissism. i was surprised we didn't have a live-television psychopath crazy person as a president a long time ago because that's what we see on tv and that's what we see on instagram.

an american company, ariens manufacturing company of brillion, wisconsin, is under attack by islamic supremacists who are demanding that the company submit to islamic law. ariens got into hot water when it asked muslim employees to pray during scheduled breaks in designated prayer rooms. our manufacturing environment does not allow for unscheduled breaks in production. muslims walked off their jobs, demanding that ariens allow muslims to leave their work station whenever they want.
but these five waves have essentially all come to an end. car sales have dropped sharply and real estate spending is also substantially decreasing, so we are facing serious problems. this is the crux of the six stabilities called for by the politburo [stable employment, stable finance, stable foreign trade, stable foreign investment, stable investment and stable expectations], or as some internet users have joked, the six tender kisses [kiss, is a homophone for , stability].

until either the federal workers' unions — which have a lot of sway — put more pressure on them, until the american people start getting in touch with democratic politicians, i think the democrats will refuse to move, despite the fact that what they are doing is against the interests of the american people and of america.

it was a hard decision. because on one hand, we could put this out very quickly because we have so much global agenda art it could be out probably in six months or a year. or we could do a whole new ip of gods, which we knew would take 2-3 years just to make all the art, but everyone was so excited about that theme so much that we went with gods. that was about one month in that we decided we were going to switch it to gods.

to be sure, some critics see this possible change in america as venezuela-ification. and yet it's worth noting that key green new dealers see the change in a much different frame of reference. here, for example, is saikat chakrabarti, top adviser to ocasio-cortez, tweeting on january 13, linking the green new deal to u.s. economic mobilization during world war two:

amazon could easily require sellers to provide some basic transparency about these listings—disclosing where these manufacturers are located, how long they've been in business, and which other brands they own. this might make it easier for amazon to punish companies that try to mislead customers with fake reviews. major internet companies often insist that policing their platforms for misinformation is a logistically insurmountable task. this argument has at least superficial plausibility for companies like facebook and twitter that have to deal with billions of pieces of content every week. but maintaining minimum standards for amazon product listings shouldn't be so difficult. amazon isn't just listing information on its website, it's offering a product for sale and taking a cut of the sale price. in many cases it's warehousing and shipping the physical products. the resulting revenue should give amazon ample resources to do basic vetting of product listings. amazon probably can't verify every claim in a product listing, but it shouldn't be hard to detect when someone takes a listing for honey and converts it into a listing for a drone. if it can't be done algorithmically, amazon can and should hire enough human beings to review every significant change to product listings. it shouldn't be possible for someone to change a listing for honey into a listing for a drone without anyone in seattle noticing.

if you live someplace without such restrictions, it's best just to use good judgment. if restaurants are open, it's ok to go to eat. but go in a small group and try to get a table away from others.
needless to say, the thought of digging up amazonia in pursuit of minerals is horrifying—horrifying, that is, to western environmentalists. yet for their part, brazilians seem okay with it; after all, they just voted bolsonaro into office. as this author has argued in the past, if a resource is sitting there, it only makes sense that hungry people will wish to see it utilized. green elites may sentimentalize poverty as living in harmony with nature, but the poor would rather have refrigerators, automobiles, and good health care.
the socialist senator seemed open to the idea of sharing a private jet with other presidential hopefuls who find themselves in the same predicament, citing the cost but, notably, not the impact on the environment. are you going to give rides to the other candidates who are in the senate? colbert asked. actually, we have used jets previously, and that was an idea we thought of. those are expensive so we thought we'd all chip in and ride together, sanders said, ultimately conceding that he does not know if the idea will come to fruition. that's greener. that's greener, sir, colbert noted. maybe we can all chip in, get one plane, and come back, sanders said.

finally, looming over all pro-american countries—and, in fact, over just about every country in the world—is the threat of china. china, of course, is a human rights-violator second to none: even if we put its maoist mass-murderous past aside, today, we see that it is defiantly anti-democratic; it routinely suppresses christians, as well as tibetans and other minorities and dissidents, including the falun gong. indeed, it's reliably reported to have preemptively locked up as many as one million muslims, without even the pretense of a legal trial.

jordan: here's what i know. spending bills start in the house of representatives. the most responsible for the spending bill is the speaker of the house. he could have stood firm in the position we passed earlier in the week. i wish he would have done that. do i think the speaker has problems? yes i do, particularly now as we head into this big immigration debate. just a few years ago he was viewed as the fiscal — the leader of fiscal responsibility in our party and now he presides over a bill that increases spending $300 billion dollars, a trillion dollar deficit. when we were so poised to win this fight. of course he's got problems, but the key is let's see what happens next–
i've just come from the white house and we had a great meeting there. i tweeted out that i've never been prouder of the president and i don't say that lightly. i'm not the kind to just say something is really great if it's not. i really am proud of the president for making an argument that no president in recent history has made and that is that we have been at war too long in too many places and that he's really going to make a difference. this is the kind of stuff those of us who have seen the horror of war and see the horror of those who have lost limbs in war and war that has gone on and on and on. we live for the day that somebody will actually stand up and say 'i'm going to change history.' i think the president is that person—and i really am proud of him not only for saying that not only is he following through with his syria policy but i really do think there will be changes in afghanistan as well. if you look at the polling data for the american people, i think the american people are with the president and they're tired of both parties who are unwilling to stand up and say enough is enough. it's time to spend some of that money at home. he mentioned how much money we spent in afghanistan on gas stations, luxury hotels, and this and that—our country suffers.

yeah. i mean, its very important to treat players fairly right? in any business you want to treat your consumers fairly. at this point, because we have a track record as a multi-game studio, we have many of our community members who play our games tell us that they understand our philosophy. so our main purpose with a beta is not to actually try to get money early. we do tend to monetize during the beta because it helps support the process, but i think that's really the main difference. we're, if anything, i think we tend to be a little more generous during the beta process because it's not our main focus to monetize. our main focus is to get people who have a little skin in the game as far as money but are there committed to helping us to make the game better. and from a business standpoint, it really is a player's purchases or play time over the long term. so basically, we don't put out half-assed stuff and try to charge a lot of money for it.

i would love to do a big immigration bill where we really repair the situation. … right now we have a problem, we have to take care of this and it's quicker and easier to do this individually. but we would like to see real immigration reform in this country because we need it and it could be a beautiful thing. with all of the companies coming into our country … we have many car companies and other companies that are going in. best job numbers … we have the best job numbers, we need people, we need great, qualified people. we want them to come in. so i think it's a great time right now, because of this. … everybody wants to see immigration reform. it's just, it's overdue. it's always been very political. maybe this [shutdown crisis] will turn out to be a blessing in disguise … we need strong borders and we need immigration reform, beyond that, we need immigration reform.

canadian prime minister justin trudeau interrupted a woman in the middle of a question during a townhall event to correct her, saying: we like to say peoplekind, not necessarily mankind, because it's more inclusive.
the new thinking focused on preservation, of both the land and the native people. some of this new thinking was guilt about past ill-treatment of indigenous folk, leading to the present-day idea that they should remain in their environment, living as they always had. and some of it, too, was an emerging ecological consciousness; amazonia is, undeniably, a fascinating and abundant region, and as such, it has become a preoccupation of greens around the world.

although apu is a beloved and sympathetic character, america's fascist humor police are angry because they see him as a caricature of an indian immigrant (i think we are supposed to say south asian now — it is hard to keep up). because of his accent, his propensity to say thank you, come again, and the fact that he runs a kwik-e-mart, the joke gestapo is on the march. an additional sin is that apu is voiced by hank azaria, who is a white guy (and has won three emmys for his work).

that's right: the rev. raphael warnock, the democrat nominee for one of georgia's u.s. senate seats—both of which are up for grabs in tuesday's runoffs—is running advertisements trying to depress the turnout of his opponent's base. the voter suppression effort seems to be an indication of where everyone knows this race will be decided: by president trump's supporters. do they follow his guidance and show up to back loeffler and sen. david perdue (r-ga) on tuesday? or do they do as the democrats want them to and stay home? it's anybody's guess, but a lot rides on whether traditional gop base voters turn out on election day in georgia or if they sit this one out.
this reporter analysed this situation on wednesday:
crime and violence are the clearest possible signs that a society isn't functioning as it should. if they increase to a certain point, societies don't function at all, and we should be worried about that always. we ought to be doing all that we can to build a place, a country where people who follow the law are rewarded; those who flout it are punished, and above all, children can live in peace and safety.

the headline statistic in xiang's speech is his claim that china's gdp rate of growth is at most 1.67 percent, or may even be negative. china's official national bureau of statistics claims that china's rate of gdp growth is at 6.5 percent. this one statistic alone could explain why the ccp felt it necessary to censor xiang's speech.

it is, of course, important that some equitable plan for resource development be put in place. that is, a plan that rewards risk-taking and entrepreneurship but also assures workers and citizens a piece of the action. we might note that one of the signal successes of the previous left-wing regime was its program of family allowances, aimed at the poor and working poor. such conscious spreading of the wealth is, of course, good politics, and yet it's also good policy because every citizen deserves a fair shake and because it's important to preserve social peace.

this next two chart show how the keynesian shell game has worked since we adopted the fiat money system on august 15, 1971. debt has grown at more than twice the rate of gdp. this is nothing short of a debt-based ponzi scheme that has entered the terminal stages. everything has its limits, even debt. the recent adoption of negative interest rates by over 20 advanced countries as some solution to this failure is akin to financial chemotherapy that will likely damage or kill, rather than provide the needed cure.

right now, if you are silly enough to still pay for cable (i canceled five years ago), you are subsidizing pretty much every major media conglomerate out there, because at least some of their channels are forced onto your package. streaming, on the other hand, means you are only funding those companies that have won your business through merit, by actually having something to offer.

indeed, some heterodox observers, such as the late thomas gold, argue that the earth is, in fact, making more energy, even now. that is, oil, gas, and coal aren't fossil fuels at all, in the sense that such fuels are supposed to be the decayed remains of dinosaurs and other prehistoric organisms. instead, gold argued, the internal heat of the earth is, as it were, constantly cooking up more oil. by this reckoning, so long as the core of the earth is hot, we'll never run out of carbon-based fuel.

then came bolsonaro. his campaign platform included a pledge to withdraw from the 2015 paris climate framework, and he has named ernesto araújo, a leading critic of climate activism, his foreign minister. araújo has been unsparing in his critique of foreign influence on his country; as he wrote in october, the tactic of the left essentially consists of the following: to sequester legitimate causes and noble concepts and to pervert them to serve their political project of total domination:

nabors described the hand-held gps system that most soldiers currently employ. it depends on geo-registering, a technology which allows soldiers to approximate their position if they have aligned an image they can observe with a reference image. the tar system will handle this process automatically, allowing soldiers to more precisely know not only their own position but that of allied and enemy forces.
the scene in question involved an exhausted marge reading the princess in the garden [a book filled with stereotypes] — or at least a version of the book that she has edited to make [politically] acceptable for 2018 — to lisa. this new clara sounds like she starts out pretty perfect, lisa says to her mom. but since she's already evolved, she doesn't really have an emotional journey to complete… kinda means there's no point to the book. well, what am i supposed to do? asks marge. it's hard to say, answers lisa, turning to the camera. something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive is now politically incorrect. what can you do? as she says that last line, she looks at a nearby picture of apu featuring bart's catchphrase, don't have a cow! some things will be dealt with at a later date, says marge. if it all, adds lisa.

the population of the usa is approaching 330 million, so you can see there is not a gun-crime epidemic and the vast majority of these heinous crimes are committed by hardcore criminals, not civilian shooters. right now there are more than 300-million firearms currently on the streets of america so there will be a thriving black market for guns no matter what kind of registration laws are passed. as far as terrorist-related firearm killings in the usa, there have been 88 in the past 10 years. again, not an epidemic.

besides, there's a fourth estate in washington that decides everything, and none of them have ever been elected to any job. it's called the bureaucracy, he added. i don't think it's red-blue. i don't think it's conservative-liberal. if you want to restore freedom to america, whether you're on the left or the right, what you want to do is rebalance the relationship between the states and the federal government and rebalance the relationship between the federal government's branches.

but i'll be the first to admit that the tone of our politics hasn't gotten better, but worse. too many people feel like the system is rigged, and their voices don't matter. and when good people are pushed away from participating in our public life, more powerful and extreme voices will fill the void. they'll be the ones who gain control over decisions that could send a young soldier to war, or allow another economic crisis, or roll back the rights that generations of americans have fought to secure.

castro: i don't believe that we should have family detention for people that are seeking asylum or refugee status so that we should develop other ways to ensure that people are processed, that we're able to keep track of them in the country. and we have developed some ways to do that but that we don't detain them the way that we have been. so no, i don't agree with that. the other thing i'll say margaret, and this is very important is, i hope that folks remember that the president said that he wanted to do this family separation policy because it would deter more families coming from these countries. and actually, the exact opposite happened. and so he's failed. he's a failed leader on this issue, and now he's just trying to stoke his political base by bringing up the wall all the time. and it's just a failure of leadership all around. i would end this kind of family detention. i would make sure that we invest in sensible, smart and effective border security that includes personnel, that includes the smart use of technology, and that does not scapegoat these immigrants but tries to look for a way that we can get to comprehensive immigration reform to fix our broken immigration system.

both sides miss the obvious point: culture and economics are inseparably intertwined. certain economic systems allow families to thrive. thriving families make market economies possible. you can't separate the two. it used to be possible to deny this. not anymore. the evidence is now overwhelming. consider the inner cities. thirty years ago, conservatives looked at detroit or newark and were horrified by what they saw. conventional families had all but disappeared in poor neighborhoods. the majority of children were born out of wedlock. single mothers were the rule. crime and drugs and disorder became universal. what caused this nightmare? liberals didn't want to acknowledge the question. they were benefiting from the disaster, in the form of reliable votes. conservatives, though, had a ready explanation for inner city dysfunction: big government. decades of badly-designed social programs had driven fathers from the home and created what they called a culture of poverty that trapped people in generational decline.

johnson said, isn't it nice that president obama is engaging in the same kind of tokenism that he's railed against at different parts of his administration? so you put two women on the court, so i guess now that's enough? i have had a huge problem with the entire way that president obama has handled this. number one, i think, again, he has abdicated to the republican party. he's always trying to make friends with people who don't like him. number two, he's not playing to win. look, this is your opportunity to change the supreme court for the next 25 years ,and you go for the easiest, most milquetoast selection that you can find. and lastly, honestly, i think it's a smack in the face to african-american women, to asian-americans, to the entire coalition of people who have allowed him to win them both, and he's basically telling them, i don't care about you, because i'd rather try and make peace with the republican party, when he could have just appointed somebody to the bench.

social conservatives, meanwhile, come to the debate from the opposite perspective, but reach a strikingly similar conclusion. the real problem, you'll hear them say, is that the american family is collapsing. nothing can be fixed before we fix that. yet, like the libertarians they claim to oppose, many social conservatives also consider markets sacrosanct. the idea that families are being crushed by market forces seems never to occur to them. they refuse to consider it. questioning markets feels like apostasy.

the consequences of poor planning, and political infighting, have become clear — from a distance, at least for now. across the ocean, the south african city of cape town, africa's most advanced and cosmopolitan city, provides a new warning. its population has doubled over the past two decades, but it has not built much new water storage capacity — thanks, in part, to the fact that the national government has authority over water and the local government is controlled by the opposition. as a result, the city nearly ran out of water in 2018, forcing severe restrictions on residents.

in addition to the economic devastation an open borders policy that ossoff champions — which he laid out at a latinx for ossoff event last week — would create, perdue said the public safety concerns with the leftist vision of defunding police combined with sanctuary cities is a recipe for disaster for georgians who should want checks and balances in the u.s. senate rather than a blank check to the open borders lobbyists.

this growing use of this green card workforce is ignored and misunderstood by the largely powerless white-collar reporters in the corporate media. many media companies — such as the washington post — are owned by firms or investors who want to grow the green card workforce. other white-collar reporters choose to view the visa workers via the lens of progressive immigration politics, even though the h-1b workers are foreign contract workers who replace white-collar americans and who do not become immigrants until they receive a green card.

whether the department suspends two or 200 more officers, there is zero chance we will have rooted out all the trump sympathizers within the capitol police by the time of the inauguration, mystal writes. nor will we have found all the violent white supremacists currently embedded in the national guard. or working for the secret service.

the letter contended that hawley had followed the established practice of past governors, attorneys general, and other statewide officials regarding his use of state vehicles for travel.
you know, matthew:25 is a pretty important teaching. and matthew:25 says, you know, when you are hungry, i fed you. when you were naked, i provided you with clothing. when you were an immigrant, i welcomed you. i think one of the reasons why so many people are moving away from donald trump is that he's abandoned all of those values.
one thing to keep in mind is that margin shifts in rural counties (versus november) may not be representative of statewide. for example, democrats could outperform in most rural counties by 2-3 points but still lose if there is slippage in the atlanta suburbs.#gasen — ryan matsumoto (@ryanmatsumoto1) january 6, 2021

in an article analyzing the possible motives for sorondo's affinity for communism, zmirak writes that sorondo's fondness for totalitarianism is the reaction of an angry, self-conscious mediocrity lashing out at his moral and natural betters. no wonder such men find kindred spirits in the gray, vicious ranks of the chinese communist party.

why — given this was a non-violent, non-threatening incident of an order of magnitude smaller than the kind of snarling physical aggression displayed by left-wing demonstrators — were so many conservative mps prepared to pretend otherwise and elevate it to the status of worst thing that has been done to an mp evah?

the covid-19 [chinese coronavirus] pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to the values of democracy, freedom and human rights that the west has taken delight in talking about. people seem to find out that the reality has revealed contradictions and double standards. if, in the face of such a straightforward, transparent, and thorough reality drama, some people's myths and obsessions about democracy, freedom, and human rights in the west cannot be shattered, then the only hope for the time being should be pinned on more rational analysis. is democracy a means or an end or a combination of both? should democracy solve the problem of fairness or efficiency? should democracy safeguard procedural justice or substantive justice or give consideration to both? mankind's exploration and thinking over democracy has never stopped.

democrats are blocking the budget plan — even though they now would likely approve spending roughly $1 billion on the fence — because they do not want trump to get roughly $1.5 billion above that total. the extra $1.5 billion might help trump claim a victory, and likely would cause democratic activists to claim a defeat.

sure, eastwood's bronco billy mccoy is plenty ready to throw a punch, but he's also a few degrees shy of a weirdo. this self-proclaimed fastest gun in the west is a walking-talking anachronism who keeps his mediocre (but charming) wild west show alive through hook or crook. billy's scattering of misfit performers is made up of a pregnant fake indian, a real indian (who's constantly getting snakebit), a black ringleader (the wonderful scatman crothers), an army deserter, an alcoholic, a cripple, a spoiled heiress, and billy himself — a former shoe salesman from new jersey and ex-convict who shot and wounded his unfaithful wife.

so you could have a runoff between these two candidates, neither of whom obviously represents one of the major standing french political parties of the center-right or the center-left. i think that is the kind of scenario – a proto-communist, basically, versus marine le pen – where she could win. in any event, no matter who the last two are, i think that things are so volatile in france and across the european union that while i still think it's unlikely le pen would win in the final round, i don't think you can discount that yet, said bolton.

the uscis regulatory change that has yet to be implemented would narrow the definition of specialty occupations, keeping big business and outsourcing firms from importing cheaper foreign workers for high-paying, white-collar jobs that american citizens could do. additionally, the change would increase the annual wage requirement for the foreign imports, driving up wages for americans in the process.

no matter how angry you may be at donald trump tonight and many of his voters are angry at him, watching this happen may confuse you. the chaos of an impeachment trial is hardly the peaceful and orderly transition of power both parties assure you they want. so why are they doing this? there has to be a reason and indeed there is one.

the violence that our nation witnessed on wednesday was abhorrent and resulted in an assault on law enforcement, lives lost and many more put in danger. these rioters must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. the president also misled many americans to believe that the outcome of the election could change on january 6th, when that simply was not true, and must held accountable for his role. i believe censuring the president after his actions helps hold him accountable and could garner wide bipartisan support, allowing the house to remain united during some of our nation's darkest days. i'm proud to join rep. fitzpatrick and others in introducing this resolution today.

what's at stake here is absolutely critical. we are holding the line here for the country to maintain a balance of power, perdue said. if you look at what we have to do, it's simply to get our vote out. five million people voted in november. there were nefarious activities that went on allegedly, and we have done a lot to add to the integrity of that by putting poll watchers in and we've got cameras on these drop boxes, so on and so forth. we're doing everything we can to make sure every vote is counted legally and accurately on jan. 5. but what we've really got to do, we've only gotten 3 million out to vote so far. that's off from where we were in november — i think some 3.6 million had voted already by this point in november. so we've got a ways to go but we've got to get our vote out. we also know that republicans win on election day. if there's any republicans out there, any conservatives out there, any independents or libertarians out there who haven't voted it, they owe it to their children and grandchildren to help us hold the line against this radical socialist agenda. that's what's at stake here, pure and simple. i know that sounds like trite words, but this is not the typical election where you can just correct it in two or four years. if these things get done, we will not be able to help self-correct this.

this seems to me almost a change of the world power scheme after post-world war ii. this seems to be the rise of russia. and now really we have to ask these questions given what they are saying. is it simply that obama abandoned the middle east, abandoned syria and now russia is on the rise? or is this the manchurian president, who went through with the iran nuclear deal, according to the aides themselves, because it fit with a certain agenda that obama has been spinning for almost a decade? is obama also deliberately handing the region, or parts of the region, over to adversaries, including russia?

so we think — what the secretary described, is that pull-factor. we think that — by allowing children to apply for asylum in those countries [via the cam program] and by making it clear that those that are not eligible for asylum will be returned to the countries, we think that we will take part of the incentive that human traffickers use to take thousands of dollars cash to take children on a long and dangerous journey, oftentimes facing physical and sexual abuse along the way north, to attempt to come into our country to take advantage of loopholes in our laws.

simply finishing the shasta dam to its design height [of 800 feet] could add nine million acre-feet to the system, mcclintock says. indeed, the trump administration, is proposing to raise the dam by 18.5 feet, increasing the capacity of the dam by 7 percent (630,000 acre-feet) — if tiny salamander species that environmentalists wish to have declared endangered do not stop plans for expansion.

the good news is there's also a lot we can do about this, from reducing the influence of money in our politics, to changing the way we draw congressional districts, to simply changing the way we treat each other. that's what i came back here to talk about this week. and i hope you check out my full speech at whitehouse.gov.

internalizing this won't be easy for republican leaders. they'll have to unlearn decades of bumper sticker-talking points and corporate propaganda. they'll likely lose donors in the process. libertarians are sure to call any deviation from market fundamentalism a form of socialism. that's a lie. socialism is a disaster. it doesn't work. it's what we should be working desperately to avoid. but socialism is exactly what we're going to get, and soon, unless a group of responsible people in our political system reforms the american economy in a way that protects normal people.
carney spoke optimistically of the pro-life movement's future.
park's spokesmen insist her words had the latter meaning: she was promising to bring pressures to bear that would change pyongyang's behavior, not overthrow kim jong-un. the north koreans, of course, promptly accused park of plotting to subvert their government, a charge that is certain to come up as justification, if they do engage in terror attacks against south korea.

couple things. for one, just to stay abreast of trends and culture. it clearly has arrived as a phenomenon when you have a hundred million people on twitch every month watching other people play video games. so it validates that there's something there. maybe a shorter way, they should… if it's not their thing, it probably is going to be their kid's thing, and from that standpoint, they should be paying attention to it.
nonetheless, the success of those cheering this challenge on in getting as many members of congress as they have gotten on board this fight—even if it is doomed to fail no matter what—is remarkable. it also resembles the anger and fury of the gop base in the wake of the nov. 3 contest, and signals that trump base voters are seeking fighters in the future for the party. but it is also a tough balancing act for gop leaders, as they seek to show the base they are willing to fight but also attempt to move forward with the reality of an incoming biden administration that is fast-approaching in just a couple weeks.
we would no longer be able to keep up our commitments to iraqi citizens, he warned.
the way to smash this republic is by using article v to re-establish and return the constitution to the relationship that it was intended to be, coburn said. what that means is a limited federal government with decisions made at state houses and local communities, and the federal government doing what it was supposed to do, the limited role that it's supposed to have.

the comparison of this view to the united states' long history of anti-catholic bigotry has been disputed. actually, it is exactly the same as this history in every important respect. a 19th-century bigot would have regarded catholicism as fundamentally illiberal — a backward faith characterized by clerical despotism — and thus inconsistent with america's democratic rules. the same attitude seems currently present in the u.s. senate.
there is one main issue that is central to the rest, and that is the issue of war and peace, she continued. i look forward to being able to get into this and to talk about it in depth when we make our announcement.

the imported labor force exists because congress allows companies to provide green cards to roughly 70,000 foreign workers each year. as a result, at least 1 million foreign graduates are competing in u.s. workplaces for those green cards or are waiting for promised green cards.

on monday, newsom took the oath of office and then delivered a fiery speech promising to offer an alternative to the corruption and incompetence in the white house. it was a gratuitous swipe at trump that made headlines and seemed to backtrack on the progress the two made during trump's visit to wildfire-stricken regions in november.

what article 50 says is: 'the eu treaties shall cease to apply to the state in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or' — and here's the key — 'failing that, two years after the notification' so the notification was the letter that was delivered that theresa may spoke about.

the majority of the demographic we're serving is enjoying it, and so we'll continue honestly to look at comments from our actual player community, around whether the players get to enjoy it and what appeals to them. and in the same way, we need different play styles. i mean, we need enough guardians and enough whatever else. as they start asking for more visual designs, we're going to do it. i think we've done that. i think woman characters in this event are strong warriors, not sexualized but still sexy. amaterasu is another great new role model for the game. the new japanese goddess will be a similar but diverse style. we do listen to the community. we don't care too much about what's outside the community.

merkel is increasingly isolated on the european stage as she has refused to impose a cap on arrivals, a decision that is irritating her neighbours who say it encourages migrants to keep coming.
remember that the big hospitals that are vertically and horizontally integrated are nothing but monopolies. if you go to a hospital parking lot at two o'clock in the morning – i'm talking employee parking lot – and you go to that same parking lot at two o'clock in the afternoon, you'll see five times as many cars. what that tells you is, they're 20 to 30 percent inefficient because almost everything else is operating in the hospital – maybe not at the same level, but not five times less in the middle of the night, coburn said to illustrate his point.

that has the same problem as the ap u.s. history curriculum. it focuses on group conflict – exactly the sort of thing that you find in the studies departments. and there's even a neo-marxist element to the ap u.s. history standards – they're very materialist. the ap european history standards imply that the original liberals, like john locke and hobbs, and the parliaments that brought modern democracy to england, were somehow motivated by class interest, and the implication is there's something inauthentic and not very believable about classical liberalism. so, there's no doubt that the curriculum the college board has put in place has been adding to and exacerbating the underlying problem that we're experiencing on free speech.

blumenthal said, as important as the change, ari, is the way it was made, lack of explanation, an indication of continuing churn and chaos and deep division in this white house, and the lack of any clear direction from the president on policy. you're absolutely right, john bolton is known as a hardliner, clearly different than others in the administration now on the iran agreement, for example, and it points to danger signals.

the coronavirus would likely need to accumulate multiple mutations in the spike protein to evade immunity induced by vaccines or by natural infection, the cdc noted.
there was truth in what the conservatives said. but it wasn't the whole story. how do we know? because virtually the same thing has happened decades later to an entirely different population. in many ways, rural america now looks a lot like detroit. this is striking because rural americans don't seem to have much in common with people from the inner city. these groups have different cultures, different traditions and political beliefs. usually they have different skin colors. rural people are white conservatives, mostly. yet the pathologies of modern rural america are familiar to anyone who visited downtown baltimore in the 1980s: stunning out of wedlock birthrates. high male unemployment. a terrifying drug epidemic.

this brings projected global warming from being potentially dangerous to being easily manageable. which is why, of course, it is unlikely to get much attention from a scientific establishment and a complicit media that much prefers to ramp up the global warming scare – even when the evidence doesn't support it.

friedrichs added, teachers' unions in l.a. have been offered a six percent raise. they've been offered more nurses, counselors, librarians — who would all pay dues, by the way — and they've even been offered the smaller class sizes they want. they're continuing to strike because they've been convinced by state and national teachers' unions that they need to push for a moratorium on charter schools and push for full unionization of charter schools. so those teachers are denying school choice to the very little kids who need it.

listen to us! screams the population. shut up and do what you're told, reply their leaders. in the face of dissent, the first instinct of illegitimate leadership is to crack down on the population. but crackdowns never make it better. instead, they always make the country more volatile and more dangerous. the people in charge rarely understand that. they don't care to learn or listen because all of this conversation is a referendum on them and their leadership, so they clamp down harder. obey, i tell you. obey! this is the romanov program. it ends badly every single time. but that doesn't mean they won't try it again. of course, they will because it's their nature. it's how we got here in the first place.

we're not manually curating these results, we're just saying hey, be extra careful with results for this query because many times really bad stuff can appear and lead to a bad experience for most users. ideally the proactive lever did this for us, but in extreme cases where we need to act quickly on something that is so obviously not okay, the reactive/manual approach is sometimes necessary. and also keep in mind, that this is different for every product. the bar for changing classifiers or manual actions on span in organic search is extremely high. however, the bar for things we let our google assistant say out loud might be a lot lower. if i search for jews run the banks – i'll likely find anti-semitic stuff in organic search. as a jew, i might find some of these results offensive, but they are there for people to research and view, and i understand that this is not a reflection of google feels about this issue. but if i ask google assistant why do jews run the banks we wouldn't be similarly accepting if it repeated and promoted conspiracy theories that likely pop up in organic search in her smoothing voice. whether we agree or not, user perception of our responses, results, and answers of different products and mediums can change.

it was this adherence to ideas and the rule of law that separated washington from a napoleon buonaparte—another great man who helped topple the french monarchy to established a republic, but eventually drove his nation to an empire of arbitrary rule. and it was the commitment to the constitution and ultimately the virtue of the american people that allowed america's founding generation to create an empire of liberty. washington understood this when he become the first president of the united states. he said in his inaugural address, the sacred fire of liberty and destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered, perhaps, as deeply, as finally, staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the american people.

for our ruling class, more investment banking is always the answer. they teach us it's more virtuous to devote your life to some soulless corporation than it is to raise your own kids. sheryl sandburg of facebook wrote an entire book about this. sandburg explained that our first duty is to shareholders, above our own children. no surprise there. sandburg herself is one of america's biggest shareholders. propaganda like this has made her rich. what's remarkable is how the rest of us responded. we didn't question why sandburg was saying this. we didn't laugh in her face at the pure absurdity of it. our corporate media celebrated sandburg as the leader of a liberation movement. her book became a bestseller: lean in. as if putting a corporation first is empowerment. it's not. it's bondage. republicans should say so.

you have to understand their long term agenda. michael pillsbury wrote a book called the 100 year marathon, perdue said. he's a renowned china expert. i concur with all of that. they want to be the hegemony of this century. they've got a long term plan. what they really want in simple terms is influence. they want to compromise people in positions of authority and bend them toward their propaganda and their way of thinking. as a matter of fact, jon ossoff actually tweeted out in support of xinhua, which is one of their propaganda arms supporting some of the things they were saying about the uyghurs and the freedom fighters in hong kong. this is something that is very serious. you think about people like eric swalwell on the intel committee getting these classified briefings and having all this inside information about what's going on inside the united states. that's one thing. the other is just a very subtle long-term drip, drip, drip of desensitizing americans to a socialist agenda. you see that right now in the democratic offering. this didn't just happen. they've been working on this for some time, and there are a lot of people who think socialism might not be all that bad. i can tell you, people are not trying to break into venezuela or cuba right now. socialism has failed every time it has been tried, and yet the chinese communist party has a long-term strategy to be a global hegemony.

corporate tax cuts are also popular in washington, and romney is strongly on board with those too. his piece throws throws a rare compliment to trump for cutting the corporate rate a year ago. this isn't surprising. romney spent the bulk of his business career at a firm called bain capital. bain capital all but invented what is now a familiar business strategy: take over an existing company for a short period of time, cut costs by firing employees, run up the debt, extract the wealth, and move on, sometimes leaving retirees without their earned pensions. romney became fantastically rich doing this. meanwhile, a remarkable number of those companies are now bankrupt or extinct. this is the private equity model. our ruling class sees nothing wrong with it. it's how they run the country.

but many, including major league baseball stars ryan howard and ryan zimmerman, contest that claim. the pair filed separate but similar defamation suits in washington, dc, courts contesting allegations in the dark side that tied them to performance-enhancing drugs. defendants publicly smeared mr. zimmerman with false and unsubstantiated allegations of performance-enhancing drug use, based on uncorroborated accusations by a third party that had been unequivocally recanted prior to defendants' publication, the washington nationals infielder's suit claimed. defendants knew full well that their 'source' had recanted his scandalous and untrue allegations against mr. zimmerman but, abdicating all journalistic responsibilities, defendants nonetheless chose to publish their defamatory story in an attempt to stir scandal and increase al jazeera's low ratings, no matter the cost to mr. zimmerman.

david azerrad of the heritage foundation justly called the holiday insipid, and lamented the fact that a celebration of washington was lumped in with a menagerie of other second-rate presidents. washington, the 'indispensable man' of the revolution who was rightly extolled for being 'first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen,' has now been lumped together with the likes of james buchanan, jimmy carter, franklin pierce and john tyler, he said.

these are the only questions that matter. the answer used to be obvious: the overriding goal for america is more prosperity, meaning cheaper consumer goods. but is that still true? does anyone still believe that cheaper iphones, or more amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from china are going to make us happy? they haven't so far. a lot of americans are drowning in stuff. yet drug addiction and suicide are depopulating large parts of the country. anyone who thinks the health of a nation can be summed up in gdp is an idiot.
the cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.

there's a cardinal, cardinal zen, i believe, who spent a lot of time in a communist prison, and he feels completely betrayed by the fact that they're making a deal with his persecutors, said zmirak. vatican officials are saying, 'oh, [joseph zen is] out of touch. he doesn't know what he's talking about.' they're dismissing the guy who lives in the country and has been in its prisons while they sit in their little italian hideaways eating gnocchi, drinking wine, and imagining that they're great realpolitik practitioners.

then when you look at korea – look, this is one of the consequences of eight years of obama's failed foreign policy. he pursued what he called 'strategic patience' vis-a-vis the north korean nuclear program, which was nothing more than a synonym for doing nothing at all. the consequences are right before us: the north koreans are now very close to being able to drop a ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead on a u.s. target, he said.

perdue faces off against ossoff on tuesday, while sen. kelly loeffler (r-ga) faces democrat rev. raphael warnock, in the georgia senate runoffs. these seats will determine control of the u.s. senate, as republicans currently have at least 50 seats and democrats currently have at least 48 seats. if the democrats take both of these seats, then vice president-elect kamala harris would be the deciding vote in the u.s. senate — and democrats would control the senate floor and all the committees. the importance of these races is highlighted by the fact that both president donald trump and president-elect joe biden are heading to georgia on monday, the day before the election, to give last-minute boosts to their parties' candidates.

sen. patrick leahy (d), vermont: well, i think he's making a terrible mistake. and he's certainly ignoring the constitution and ignoring responsibilities. president obama is doing the same thing that president reagan did. at the end of his term, he nominated a supreme court justice. the confirmation was in the last year of president reagan's term. the democrats controlled the senate. none of us intended to play politics with something as important as a supreme court nomination. and the democratic-controlled senate voted 97-0 in favor of president reagan's nominee in the last year of his presidency. the fact is, when you elect a president, you have to assume, if there's supreme court nomin — vacancies, he is going to make the nomination.

as a result, much of brazil's land became off-limits to development. today, indigenous tribes account for .4 percent of brazil's population, and yet they inhabit 13 percent of the land. to put that another way, natives are about 32 times more land rich than the average brazilian. admittedly, there are often violations of these pro-native restrictions, as illegal poachers and loggers seek quick profits in no-go zones. and yet because these violations are illegal, they are episodic, not offering the potential economic benefits of permanent settlements and systematic development—that is, of the kind that could offer good jobs at good wages to all brazilians.

as bloomberg news has reported, bolsonaro carried chunks of metal with him on the campaign trail, all to make a point about the value of mining. one of those chunks was of niobium, which is one of the rare-earth elements that undergird the modern economy. because it is needed to strengthen steel and semiconductors, niobium is precious; it sells for about $42,000 a ton. brazil has 40 million tons of niobium, and if we do the math, that's $1.68 trillion—which is a lot for a country whose annual gdp totals barely more than $2 trillion. the metal is already being mined in brazil, but bolsonaro's point is that there's a lot more niobium in the country–and many other rare earths, too; brazilians just have to find them and get them out of the ground.

president trump should order the secretary of defense to position american assets and shoot down kim jong un's next missile launch. intercepting a north korean missile would signal to pyongyang that america has the capability and the willingness to defend our allies and the homeland. in the parlance of military strategy, the missile defense option enhances deterrence-by-denial. north korea is more likely to be deterred from developing missiles if robust, layered missile defenses deny them any strategic benefit from striking first. the only two alternatives are preemptive offensive action and, of course, more strongly worded un security council resolutions and toothless sanctions.

but, in fact, i don't really think there was a change in policy, bolton continued. i think this was a response to the use of chemical weapons, just as we would respond if it were nuclear weapons or biological weapons. it's a threat to american national security when anybody uses weapons of mass destruction. so trump's response – which so far, at least, has been confined to the one strike at the syrian airbase, although obviously, it took place in syria – was not a shift in policy on the civil war.

companies also use visa workers to crimp and slow domestic competition by minimizing the hiring of american graduates who may use their work experience to join or create rival companies. in the early 2000s, the federal government broke up an illegal no-poaching cartel by tech companies who were trying to prevent their american workers from changing jobs and so sharing their expertise with rival companies. this strategy is legal if the workforce consists of h-1b workers who cannot change jobs without their managers' permission.

privately, biden's team does not expect to win the races, according to democratic officials, but they are more optimistic about their chances than they were weeks ago, pager and cassella wrote. though the president-elect narrowly won the state in november, they attribute that to a powerful anti-trump sentiment that did not translate down the ballot. perdue received about 88,000 more votes than ossoff, and the top two republicans combined got more than 636,000 votes than warnock in the special election. one former democratic official said few democrats, if any, are preparing for victory. it's not 'their organizing principle,' the official said of the incoming transition team, adding that their planning has focused on democrats not having control of the senate.
brooklyn nine-nine's chelsea peretti also put in a last-minute plug for ossoff and warnock.

next year is about one thing in particular: our cohesion. it is important we don't allow ourselves to be divided – not into generations, not into social groups, and not into those that are already here and those that are new citizens. […] it is crucial not to follow those who, with coldness or even hatred in their hearts, lay a sole claim to what it means to be german and seek to exclude others. our values, our traditions, our sense of justice, our language, our laws, our rules, [apply] to all who wish to live here. [the efforts put in to cope with the challenges would be worth it in the end because] countries have always benefitted from successful immigration, both economically and socially. […] i am convinced that, handled properly, today's great task presented by the influx and the integration of so many people is an opportunity for tomorrow.
this week, sen. ed markey (d-ma) introduced a plan to increase the inflow of refugee resettlement by more than 500 percent — hiking annual refugee admissions to at least 110,000. currently, president trump has reduced annual refugee resettlement to 18,000, which is merely a numerical limit and not a goal to be reached.

bloomberg, whom polls show is gaining traction in his quest for the 2020 democrat nomination, released his proposal for overhauling america's immigration and refugee laws on monday. the plan, based on policies the mayor implemented during his tenure at the helm of new york city, is being touted as beneficial to not only the country's diversity, but also its profit margins.

it was harris's office that collaborated with planned parenthood to produce legislation that would criminalize the cmp undercover journalists for publishing and distributing recordings of private communications with abortion providers in california.
sen. hawley said that's shocking, unethical, and perhaps illegal.
as a senator, harris voted against bills to protect the lives of babies who survive abortions and took to twitter to tout her vote against a ban on abortions past the fifth month of pregnancy.
understandably, americans are questioning the results of an election in which the laws designed to ensure fair and secure voting were rewritten at the last minute by unaccountable bureaucrats who had no authority to do so. the electoral college is an essential element of our republic, and each american deserves to have complete confidence in our country's election results.
lula da silva, former pt president, was arrested in 2017 on charges of taking over $1 million in bribes and, after multiple appeals, was sentenced to 12 years in prison last year. supporters insisted that his prison sentence should not keep him off the ballot to reclaim the presidency despite the law banning politicians convicted of corruption from running.
single-family zoning was one of the many ways white homeowners and politicians kept african-americans out of suburbs. … i don't feel so bad. our attached townhouse, on a piece of land a small fraction of the size of a single-family home, is less of a burden on the environment, and it is just the right size for the four of us. it's also just as loving and pleasant a place for my kids to grow up in as my own suburban manse was for me.
so don't think about that. stop talking about the georgia election. donald trump's phone call is the real story. you'll have plenty of time to think about what happened on tuesday come wednesday morning, when democrats are in charge and there's nothing you can do about it now or ever.

you how long before they cut off your water and electricity? before ups won't deliver your packages, and not to wreck your day, but guess what? amazon is now one of america's biggest grocery providers. good thing you don't need to eat.
however, my primary and continued complaint is that the disciplinary actions of the administration has extended far beyond accountability for the broken pledge regarding premarital sex. that accountability was served justly and humbly in maddi's confession, her suspension, and her removal from leadership positions. what was initially a punitive and learning moment has transformed into a public lesson (before this even was announced to the media). by banning maddi from walking at graduation, the administration and board collectively decided on a disciplinary measure of an obviously public nature. from what we've learned thus far, no other student in the school's history has been banned from walking at graduation for failing to abstain from sexual immorality and from the use of alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs. maddi is the only student, past or present, banned from walking at graduation. in a class of only 15 students, her absence will be obvious and can only be explained in that her immorality is visible (unlike the errs of past and present students).

one of the things that is so beautiful to watch is 3.2 percent wage growth. that hasn't happened in so long for our country. that's an incredible thing. that means people are actually getting more money, taking home more money, and that's something that is really nice to see. a lot of you have been following me when we were on a thing called the campaign — that was an exciting campaign, a great campaign — and i used to talk about wages going down, not going up, but going down for years. nineteen years. and now they went up 3.2 percent and yet there's no inflation because other things are going down, like the price of your gasoline at the tank. it is low and that doesn't happen by luck. i worked hard on that. that's like a tax cut for people. so a lot of good things are happening. labor participation rate increased to 63.1 [percent]. that's an incredible number also.
our history tells our story, especially if we don't acknowledge it or talk about a change in viewpoint and be honest about where we are today. it really tells you about what you're dealing with in the future, and i think that's the concern with warnock, noem said. he's had all these public declarations for embracing socialism and embracing marxism, and he will not say he's had a change of heart. he will not say that he believes he was wrong. he will not say in all of these personal issues he's had in the past that he's changed his ways or even acknowledge that he is on a different path. so that's some very clear testimony to people across the state, that he is doing what politicians do best, and that is putting a good spin on the kind of person he really is. he's never held public office before so when he gets to washington, dc, he's not going to even necessarily know how to be a u.s. senator and will clearly follow the direction of his leader. his leader is going to be schumer. that's concerning to us that we would be putting somebody there who is going to be following what pelosi's agenda is, and what schumer's agenda is and be falling right in line with what kamala harris would want to see in the white house. that is not true with david or with kelly.
lead soon contaminated the water and several residents died. an outbreak of legionnaires' disease began in 2014. snyder announced it in 2016.
in addition to this, there are three major external challenges. the first is the trade war, which is in fact no longer a trade war but rather a clash between two opposed value systems. it can be said with certainty that the sino-u.s. relationship has come to a crossroads right now and faces significant historic challenges. what are we to do? to be honest, i don't think we have really found much of a solution. you are aware that huawei's cfo meng wanzhou was recently detained in vancouver. in the past two days, mainstream media such as bbc and cnn have been reporting on how the u.s. is going at huawei on all fronts. what this tells us is that this issue is not simply about trade or economics.
now, if that happened, it would be hugely significant and have tremendous implications for all of us. yet, for a variety of reasons, the people in charge of this country didn't want to talk about it. they preferred to change the subject.

the anonymous donor of the multimillion-dollar gift approached leonard leo, executive vice president of the influential federalist society, and also a close personal friend of scalia and his family. leo said:
it should be particularly apparent in the minds of americans today—after the passing of the great originalist supreme court justice antonin scalia—how fragile american liberty is. this country as it was founded will not survive if leaders do not commit to circumscribed governmental power. it will be even worse if the people no longer care to hold them accountable and in check.

asked for comment, governor palin told breitbart news, rebecca has been a sharp, loyal, and amazing member of my team for over six years now. though i'm sorry to see her go full-time to another conservative outlet, i'm delighted she'll be helping change the world for the better by lending her talents to breitbart. they are so stinking fortunate to get her! rare is an outfit like breitbart – they're most valuable in our culture and the media, fighting the good fight for the sake of this country we love. and i'll still be bugging rebecca at all hours – i won't let her get away that far; every time we encounter an issue that we know the public must be aware of, we've been on it, and will continue to do so. she's the best.

he said he's not ready to fully retire (i don't do shuffleboard well, he said), but his decision lets espn escape from an uncomfortable decision. having a broadcaster of college games publicly identified with a sports handicapping business wouldn't fly. that accounts for the odd timing of his departure in the middle of the college basketball season; his family wants the site fully operational by the ncaa men's basketball tournament.
if this motion passes, i believe that the most sensible way to proceed would be for the house managers and the president's attorneys to attempt to agree on a limited and equal number of witnesses for each side. if they can't agree, then the senate could choose the number of witnesses, added the senator.
such work is not easy. the students must accurately depict a once-living person, using only their skull. to do this, they follow basic rules of anatomy. for example, a small change of direction on the mastoid process, a bony projection behind the ear, indicates whether a person has detached or attached earlobes. a hairline notch in the nose can signify a deviated septum or injury; the span from the brow of the nose to its end is always the same as that from the top to the bottom of the ears.
this rule comes from an admin we all hate, he tweeted, but the substance takes a lottery that randomly allocates h-1b visas & instead prioritizes them for the highest-paid workers, which incentivizes better pay for migrants. someone will have to explain to me why that's bad. notably, costa did not discuss the possible benefits for american graduates.

russia agreed with china that outside parties, by which they mean the united states, should not interfere with the resolution of territorial claims in the region.
leahy: well, there is no such thing as a thurmond rule. i used to tease the republicans about it. but i will give you an example. for the last two years of president george w. bush's term, democrats were in control of the senate. by this time, we had confirmed two or three times as many judges of george bush's than the republicans have of president obama's. they're playing politics, the same way they did when they killed about 70 of president clinton's judges by their pocket veto. the fact of the matter is, a supreme court justice, let's have a vote. let's have a debate. the senate has more recesses scheduled, more holidays scheduled this year than i have ever seen in my time there.
meanwhile, beyond china's borders, the belt and road initiative of the people's republic, while officially peaceful and cooperative, is, in fact, a key part of that country's bid for global dominion. it was bloomberg news—not exactly a mouthpiece for hawks—that summed up china's goals in a stark headline late last year: xi jinping's plan to dominate the world. and oh yes: the chinese are also busy hacking into america; there's a new report on china's cyber-espionage against the u.s. virtually every day.

rep. tom mcclintock (r-ca), an ally of the president, criticized his tweet and urged him to reconsider. in his own statement, mcclintock said that the principal blame for california's wildfires lies with federal agencies and laws which govern most of our state's forests and brushlands, not with state laws. he added that cutting fema's funding to calfire would damage the one governmental agency that actually works in the state of california.

the snowflake idea is true, but incomplete. the snowflake idea addresses that these students have helicopter parents who didn't want to see them get hurt in any way, who coddled them, and didn't get them used to the hard knocks of life. i think there's some real truth in that. so – when they hear someone who disagrees with them – they sort of want to shrivel up and die, which makes them want to silence people. but, i think that this psychological explanation underplays the importance of ideology in all this. if you look at what's happened to the university over the last few decades, they've really been taken over by the studies programs – african-american studies, latino studies, women's studies, environmental studies, gender studies – and sometimes they literally have studies that teach activism. these studies programs are generally built around political assumptions, and their classes are teaching leftist politics.

and yet even with the soviets gone, today, another empire, china, threatens us. indeed, the chinese, at the rate they're going, could prove to be more of a threat to us as than the soviets at their worst.
one thing i focused on, for example, was how we can make voting easier, not harder, and modernize it for the way we live now. here in illinois, a new law allows citizens to register and vote at the polls on election day. it also expands early voting, which makes it much easier for working folks and busy parents. we're also considering automatic voter registration for every citizen when they apply for a driver's license. and i'm calling on more states to adopt steps like these. because when more of us vote, the less captive our politics will be to narrow interests – and the better our democracy will be for our children.

so today, pompeo and the trump administration, operating as kirkpatrick-type realists, believe that the u.s. has an affirmative duty to look out for itself. and that means, as a matter of strategic necessity, allying with other countries that also fear china's rise. we can worry about the nature of those governments later; the first priority is to make sure that we don't lose the greater geopolitical struggle.

the obamacare accommodation biden referred to, however, was never viewed as such by many catholic schools and organizations. instead, they recognized it as an accounting trick whereby completion of a certified form would merely transfer their mandate to directly provide abortion-inducing drugs to an insurance provider, who would take care of the administration of these services for the faith-based groups. in short, the accommodation simply ensured the abortion-inducing drugs were paid for, as the obama-biden administration desired, while the conscience issues of the faith-based groups remained ignored.

on jan. 1, china's new e-commerce law — the first to directly affect daigou — came into effect. under the new law, daigou will be required to register as e-commerce operators and acquire licenses in both china and the country where they shop, making their business subject to taxation, finance lawyer cheng jiuyu from zhongwen law firm said. any e-commerce platform and seller could be fined 2 million yuan and 500,000 yuan respectively — and possibly face criminal charges. it's likely to be good news for china's tax collectors, who missed out on an estimated 100 billion yuan this year, thanks to e-commerce between private individuals, according to a report from the beijing-based central university of finance and economics. this law is making an effort to regulate all e-commerce business, cheng says. [those daigou who didn't pay taxes] will lose their edge, and those who didn't have many clients will find it hard to survive. but it's unclear how the law will be enforced. cheng says it's likely that customs will get stricter on undeclared parcels, and platforms like wechat and taobao — where many of the products are sold — may work with the authorities to avoid being held liable themselves. daigou will have to register and truthfully declare their items, and the increased cost will be passed on to their customers. customers' purchasing behavior will also change accordingly: they will go for sellers who have bigger platforms and better services, cheng says. there will be a wave of bankrupt, small-time daigou.

he replied, [sports] can change attitudes sometimes in ways that a politician never can change, a speech can't change. you know, all those kids who started growing up watching the brooklyn dodgers, and suddenly they're rooting for a black man on the field. and how that affects their attitudes laying the groundwork for the civil rights movement. that's the legacy all of us have benefited from, black and white and latino and asian. because what it did was it taught america the skills, the talent, the character and not the color that matters. we still have a long way to go. that's true in our everyday life. it's true in our sports. if you look at the number of african-american managers and the number of latino managers in baseball or owners, obviously there's still a carryover from the past.

given that no formal opposition was raised by environmentalists during the approval process for sites, he said, he did not anticipate significant opposition from them — though they were skeptical the reservoir would provide the water promised. watson said the project was consulting with environmental interests to allay those concerns, and to explore their thoughts about how the water should be managed once it had been stored, in the reservoir. he said the management process the project had developed would include local communities and native american groups. and he added that the sites reservoir will have statewide reach by helping recharge depleted aquifers throughout california — an urgent necessity once the state's new groundwater management requirements go into effect in 2020.

in her 1979 essay, kirkpatrick never claimed that human rights and democracy were unimportant; she simply argued that the american national interest was more important. indeed, it's worth noting that in recent decades, some authoritarian allies of the u.s.—including south korea, taiwan, argentina, brazil, and chile—have evolved into functioning democracies, and those countries are stronger as a result. so yes, it's possible for our friends to improve and for the free world to expand; it's just that the process must be handled with the utmost care.

we know that our democracy works the best when every voice is heard — that's why the @dnc made historic reforms to our primary process to return the power to where it belongs: the grassroots. that's why the dnc voted to shift power in the presidential primary process away from superdelegates and further towards our grassroots supporters — on the first ballot, our nominee will be selected by pledged delegates. we also established new rules for the state caucuses and primaries for 2020. for the first time, the dnc rules specify a preference for the use of primaries so that more people can participate in the presidential nomination process. caucus states are required to provide absentee voting or some other method for those who cannot vote in person, have votes recorded on paper in case of a recount, and set the national convention delegates based on the first level of voting. the grassroots donor threshold meant that anyone who wanted to see a particular candidate on stage had the ability to help make it happen. millions of grassroots donors were energized earlier than ever before in the process, and we saw increased engagement from supporters. now, with voting underway, candidates who have secured just one pledged delegate or are polling above 10% can make the debate stage. i'm exceptionally proud of the reforms the @dnc has made to fulfill our promise to our voters and rebuild their trust in our party. these changes are all about the future.

for instance, fire believes students should have access to the active assistance of counsel in most disciplinary cases, as opposed to only those with a potential penalty of greater than 30 days' suspension or those involving expressive conduct. the bill draft also addresses a few items about which fire does not take a position, and which fire would therefore not address through its own efforts. but there is little doubt that passage of this model legislation would represent a real improvement in free speech protections in states that do not already include such protections in state law.

combined with other environmental restrictions on land use, amazonia has become something of a giant national park, and that fencing off of resources has helped to impoverish the nation. and, of course, nobody is poorer than the indigenous tribes; one wonders if people living in huts are really happy living that way—and many do, in fact, flee.

it doesn't make any sense to me, noem said. we all know that china is not our friend. we all know that they are out to destroy this country. anybody who has done business with them in the way that he has and then tried to cover it up and to keep the truth from the public should not be trusted with a seat in the u.s. senate. that's just factual and the vast majority of people understand that. he clearly does not have america's future in mind when he does business dealings like that and when he is trying to keep the truth from the people.

and yet, wistful though i may remain for my suburban-sprawl childhood, these days i find myself continually amazed and befuddled by my state's insane fetishization of an anachronistic model of urban development. why — when the case for some better way of living has become so painfully obvious — can't california quit propping up its endless rows of single-family houses? why can't so much of america?
georgia, what we know: – early voting: 3,093,375 votes have been cast per ap.
and yet, nobody's working on that, he lamented. why? because there's not the willpower of the career politicians to do what's in the best interests of the country. they do what's in the best interests of their political career. i saw it in and out for the 16 years i was there, six years as a congressman and then all four years and ten years as a senator. the conflict of interests means we don't have any statesmen, or very few.

yeah, we knew that might come up honestly. i mean, really, the only place it really came up, which we also thought it might, was around the hindu pantheon, because that's an active religion. there's one billion people that are worshiping that. but our kind of litmus test was, we think gods are compelling. we think, religion aside, if you just look at these things as works of world literature, there are inspiring stories there. and if we can find literature that shows gods battling one another, let's go for it. so that was basically it.

not surprisingly, ola is one of the regulatory powers created by dodd-frank that the big wall street firms actually would rather keep in place. because ola would likely cushion the impact of a big bank's failure on creditors and counterparties, it reduces the cost funding for the big banks. it may also give the biggest firms a competitive advantage over smaller competitors whose customers, counterparties, and creditors would still have to worry about the prospects of a formal bankruptcy.

it orders the government to create a pathway for those previously deported to apply to return to their homes and families in the united states as long as they would have been eligible to stay under the new law. it's retroactive in other words. d.h.s. must spend taxpayer dollars transporting convicted criminal illegal aliens back into the united states. i am not making this up.

to put it bluntly, people burying their kids due to knife crime, fearful about violent extremism, plagued by a collapse of civility and antisocial behaviour, marooned in postcodes where the only visible authority is a parking ticket aren't interested in the bruised feelings of some well-heeled permanent secretaries. they want things done. their preference will be to back a home secretary who is on their side and impatient for results. the political rhymes with the personal. and that constituency dwarfs the whitehall machine.

in an era constrained by sustainability and affordability, a big house with a backyard should be a rarity. much of california is straining under its own success: we have too many people and too few places for them to live, offered at too-high prices, in too many areas touched-by-climate-change-related menaces, like wildfires, all too far from where people work. and the solution is so painfully obvious it feels almost reductive to point it out: make it legal to build more housing that houses more people.

lead house impeachment manager rep. adam schiff (d-ca) laid out the case against president trump in opening arguments on wednesday in the senate impeachment trial. the core of his claim was that trump withheld a white house meeting from new ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky, as well as essential military aid, unless and until ukraine announced investigations into former vice president joe biden and 2016 interference in the u.s. election. every part of that claim is untrue, and directly contradicted by the evidence that emerged in the house's own inquiry. schiff is clearly relying on the testimony of u.s. ambassador to the e.u. gordon sondland, who made the surprise announcement in his prepared statement for the public impeachment inquiry in the house intelligence committee that there had been a quid pro quo — a white house meeting in exchange for an announcement of investigations. under questioning, however, sondland admitted that he had no direct knowledge of a quid pro quo. in fact, he testified that when he asked president trump what he wanted from ukraine, he said nothing and no quid pro quo. moroever, as the transcript of trump's first call with zelensky in april showed, the president had already invited zelensky to the white house with no conditions whatsoever — a fact that schiff neglected to mention in the senate. as for the second call, there was never any discussion of withholding aid, or of the 2020 presidential election.

russia nevertheless seems determined to protect north korea, as russian president vladimir putin insisted that intimidating pyongyang was unacceptable.
accepting a cap now and working toward denuclearization later, as mount advised, could be taken by the north koreans as a signal of weakness because the u.s. has insisted on swift and complete denuclearization. the trump administration fears that if sanctions are loosened now, the maximum pressure needed to compel denuclearization will never be restored.

i think that [trump was] moving back to the george w. bush approach. and what was the bush approach? basically it was, don't change the footprint [and] don't expand the settlements geographically. population growth, that's different. build up and in. in built-up areas, if you want to build a new house, a new apartment, that doesn't affect the palestinians or the chances of peace really. so the google earth map, if you put it that way, of the settlements doesn't change.

rouhani is trying to reassert control and tamp down public unrest with a new budget that spends more on domestic priorities, but he could easily have done that during the obama years when lucrative foreign deals and literal pallets of cash were falling into his lap. if tehran is truly changing and turning its focus inward, it is only because the crushing effect of sanctions forced a major re-evaluation of policy. there is little evidence that any sort of political liberalization flowed from the nuclear deal boom and a great deal of evidence to the contrary.

other publications have shared life hacks that do not necessarily feed any mouths. this week, the aggregation site la patilla shared an article from october with a hack that allegedly uses toothpaste to reveal whether a woman is pregnant. if the toothpaste creates foam and changes color after being mixed in with a woman's urine, she is pregnant, according to the trick. la patilla is quick to note, despite the growing popularity of this method, science denies its efficacy. the toothpaste tends not to change color, even if you are pregnant, while the foam appears in most cases due to contact between the acidity of the urine and alkalinity of the toothpaste.

todd: definitely, our focus is really community first, honestly. from, i would say, a marketing standpoint or an esports standpoint, we think about esports as a heart of the overall community, and i think other companies do also. what sets us apart is really how early and consistently we bring the community in during the beginning design and development phases. i would say what's more traditional right now for some other studios, is they have a vision of a game and they take it very far to a point, and then maybe they have a beta or they do a grand reveal. they have very polished art, and maybe a trailer. our philosophy is actually to put the game product in the hand of our end users much earlier in the process, and to really use their feedback to shape the game. and that's casual users and committed users. so there's a lot of things, but that's the number one thing i think that makes us a bit different.

we've put out what i think is the most comprehensive and toughest bill on campus free speech. what this bill does is ban so-called free speech codes, and free speech zones, as it also discourages administrators from disinviting controversial speakers who have already been invited by students and faculty members. that's what most of the other model bills do. but, what the goldwater model adds to all that is insistence on punishment for students who shout down visiting speakers, or rip down posters for the talk that a speaker is going to give, or in any way interfere with the free speech rights of others. right now, that's really the heart and soul of the free speech crisis. even though i think it's absolutely essential that we ban these free speech zones and these restrictive speech codes, if you were to do all of that today, and still let these shout-downs take place, i think we'd still have a campus free speech crisis.

we have come through a period of eight years of tension at various levels, but particularly the top level. it's clear that [former president barack] obama and netanyahu didn't get along, didn't like each other. and that attitude was then communicated to the white house staff. you had a lot of backbiting, criticism of netanyahu — all of that is over. we've returned now to the idea that there should be no daylight in public between the two governments. there will be plenty of disagreements, but those will be discussed in closed rooms and the relations at the top are obviously genuinely good. there is no artifice here about getting along.

unilaterally decarbonising it — as seems to be johnson's and gove's wizard plan; entirely uncosted as these 'a unicorn for every household' schemes always are — must surely count among the most suicidally pointless plan ever devised by any government in history, especially by one wearing the 'conservative' tag.
here's an excerpt of that transcript (emphasis ours):
chinese economic expert xiang songzuo warns that economy shows signs of crashing

many people believe that since china is a communist dictatorship, they cannot have a recession because the chinese communist party (ccp) will control the economy enough to prevent it. it does not work that way. like every socialist economy, china's economy was headed for disaster until it was opened to free markets in the 1970-80s. in fact, every socialist economy has either opened up to free markets to some extent or ended in disaster and massive bloodshed. today, only venezuela and north korea have refused to open up to free markets, and both of those are disasters, with bloodshed in the future.

since the end of the little ice age in the 1880s, the planet has warmed by about 0.8 degrees c. you might think that was not a particularly drastic rate of warming to worry about. you might also note that such a rate of warming is well precedented in periods throughout history, such as during the minoan, roman and medieval warming periods. nonetheless this 0.8 degrees c rise – 0.9 degrees c, at a push – is the terrible climatic event the alarmist establishment has been assuring these last few decades is the worst thing ever and something that should worry us awfully.

the north-eastern u.s. is experiencing record-breaking cold. even the very sharks are dying as they swim.
the economy would be in an official financial depression if not for the world's central banks conspiring to push rates down—effectively stealing from savers. this policy is no different than cutting off your leg to feed yourself when on the brink of starvation—you may no longer be hungry, but you'll still bleed out. when the fed drops rates to benefit people purchasing and refinancing homes, for example, savers have to resort to eating into their principal. this one action is likely going to be the cause of the next mounting financial crisis: pension and insurance failures.

it's not about being a political junkie, and it's not about being hooked into this 24/7 news cycle. it's about how do you get to live your life, coburn said. most americans say, 'just leave me alone. let me do my thing.' that's getting harder and harder to do. if you have a way to make sure you can do your thing in the future, then you'll become involved in this.

gore's warning was not directly testable: he failed to provide a quantitative forecast. the 2001 u.n. intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) third assessment report's business as usual projection of 3°c per-century was used to stand for gore's forecast. adopting the ipcc projection favored gore, as it was less extreme than his tipping point alarm.

the thing that makes a generational crisis era unlike other eras is that, with rising nationalism and xenophobia, something that might be considered trivial at other times could be a cause for war now. in 1914, a serb, gavrilo princip, shot and killed archduke franz ferdinand, the heir to the austro-hungarian empire, and his pregnant wife sophie. assassinations were not uncommon in the world, then or now, but to most of the world's complete astonishment, this assassination triggered world war i.

most of the mothers in this country are juggling a lot of different responsibilities, noem told breitbart news when asked to put in context what is at stake for mothers in georgia and nationally in this race. they have a lot on their plate. many of them are working, many of them are taking care of elderly parents, many of them are paying the bills, and many of them are making healthcare decisions—all of those are impacted by who we elect and who we put into the u.s. senate. david and kelly have fought to make sure we keep more money in our pockets. if people vote for warnock and ossoff to go to washington, dc, they will raise taxes. they have endorsed the green new deal which means four to five years from now we will have $4 to $5 a gallon gasoline. that will make budgets even tighter, and people will have less money. our food will be more expensive in the grocery stores. healthcare decisions would be made by the government. these are very clear facts that warnock and ossoff have embraced and said they will do openly and publicly. they also have a fundamentally different viewpoint of this country, and warnock especially has had the opportunity to denounce marxism and socialism and he did not do that.

ocasio-cortez is a looker and i hazard a guess has had the privilege of turning men into gibbering idiots for most of her adult life. i have little doubt she has been trotting out utter nonsense and yet can make it look convincing and credible because she has hardly ever been challenged on it. this is what happens when beautiful women grow up in leftist circles and are rarely called out for mixing up a billion with a trillion. this builds confidence and sense of entitlement and soon you end up with alexandria ocasio-cortez. then suddenly when she enters congress and her policies are examined by people on the right, she thinks this is down to sexism. no. it's not your sex we have a problem with; it's the socialism.

these rulings affirm the truth that citizens play an important role in preserving election integrity by asking questions and challenging inaccuracies, said catherine engelbrecht, founder and president of true the vote. georgians owe a debt of gratitude to the registrars in muscogee and ben hill counties who bravely told the court they'd discovered voters who had in fact moved out of state and were attempting to vote in this election – and would have if citizens had not submitted these challenges. and the georgia citizens sued by fair fight were spending time with their families on christmas eve when they were served with court papers. they stood strong against these intimidation tactics and harassment. … true the vote's counsel james bopp represented the defendants in the fair fight case. these courageous citizens were targeted because they dared to stand up for their rights, bopp said. like true patriots, they stood strongly by the constitution and the laws of their state and they effected positive change. this is what citizen engagement looks like: there are forces that will try to stop us, but we'll never stop fighting to defend our democracy. … let the voters be heard. let every legal, eligible voter have their vote counted, engelbrecht said. for this to happen, it is critical that those not eligible to vote are prevented from doing so.

this amendment ensures that labor unions are not using illegal foreign labor to expand their reach into american workplaces & collect more union dues. under current law, an employee can sign a union authorization card to count toward the showing of interest in a union election regardless of whether that worker is authorized to work in the united states. illegal immigrants should not be working at american companies, let alone used by labor unions to organize workplaces. this motion to recommit ensures that unions cannot communicate with employees for organizing purposes if the employee is not legally authorized to work in the united states. … the change we're proposing here is simple. we're asking that unions be barred from contacting individuals who are not eligible to work in our country. if an employer cannot hire someone in our country illegally, a union should not be allowed to organize those individuals. believe it or not, this is not currently outlawed. if my colleagues insist on moving forward with legislation that empowers union bosses and strips independence from our workers, they should not do it in a way that encourages illegal immigration. … this motion to recommit would make the pro act pro-american worker, rather than just pro-union bosses.
