She went on to add, This action is to protect the movement and its activities. It is also needed to enable my pro bono legal help to take necessary action against people or corporations etc who are trying to use me and the movement in purposes not in line with what the movement stands for.
In other words, this all means it's the Democrats who are trying to suppress the vote in Georgia—at least part of the vote, the part from the pro-Trump areas—as part of their last-ditch effort to win control of the U.S. Senate in races their president-elect does not even think they have a shot at, which the Politico article sums up nicely.

In September, the CCP began to rebrand the forced labour in Xinjiang as facilitation of employment and has accused the United States of seeking to impose forced poverty on the region, by opposing the enslavement of the native Uyghur population.
Alongside the ruined structure, new channels appeared in the earthen emergency overflow spillway, strewn with rip rack rock that had been dropped by helicopter to keep the hillside from collapsing, to save the cities downstream.
Later, Sanders defended his unorthodox style and ideology as the key to bringing new voters into the political process.
State Sen. Marlon Kimpson, a member of the Legislative Black Caucus who has endorsed Biden, said he was a little disappointed in Biden's Iowa finish but was confident in a strong result in the state Biden needs the most.
Mr Sunak said that his budget will also tackle the scourge of plastic waste by introducing a new plastic packaging tax where manufacturers and importers will be charged £200 per tonne on packaging made from less than 30 per cent recycled plastic, the costs likely to be passed on to the consumer.
Donohue, however, praised Trump for his religious liberty policy.

Thunberg is taking part in the Davos summit for the second time and will be one of the main attractions at the annual meeting, alongside US President Donald Trump.
Sanders noted that his campaign had closed a large gap with Biden in the polls, pulling within single digits, with a chance to win in the South Carolina primary on Saturday.
McClintock dismissesdconcerns about Oroville. No dam, no work of man is perfect, he said. We make mistakes, we learn, we go forward.
Likewise, Erin Curtis of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation told Breitbart News, There is a lot of momentum for the project right now.
He blamed the state and federal environmental laws and regulations that make dams more difficult, and more expensive, to build. Until we change the environmental laws, construction is cost prohibitive, he told me.
As European Union member states, the countries have already abandoned many of their sovereign rights by ditching their national currencies for the euro, agreeing to open borders within the bloc, and submitting to European courts as their highest legal arbiter.

Another is the havoc the green ideology has wreaked on honest science and on once-trustworthy government institutions such as National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Francis also said it is necessary to create a social debate in which of those involved in any way can explain their problems and have access to adequate and reliable information in order to make decisions for the common good, something rarely seen in contemporary discussions of climate change that tend to exclude climate change skeptics.
The senators are facing an unprecedented challenge in the final days before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses. At a time when they would typically barnstorm the state, they're instead stuck in Washington as jurors in President Donald Trump's impeachment case. The little time they have for campaigning makes commercial travel tough.
Protesters promise to take part in civil disobedience at U.S. Capitol after the protest.
Vice is never boring. There are enough pinwheels, hula hoops, and party poppers to hold your interest. It's just that after a while it all becomes tiresome and reveals itself to be an endless series of hollow talking points.
While Biden was in overwhelmingly white New Hampshire on Saturday, billionaire Michael Bloomberg was courting black voters in Alabama, which is among the states that vote on Super Tuesday in early March. Bloomberg toured the late Martin Luther King Jr.'s church, spoke at a Democratic party luncheon and held a rally at Alabama State University, a historically black college and university.
Senator Bernie Sanders echoed Lessig's sentiments on Tuesday night, when he accused the president of creating an emergency and artificial crises, while ignoring that the biggest crisis of all which is — according to the senator — actually climate change.
And part of that problem is that Brazil is remarkably undeveloped. If we look at a map showing where the nation's 211 million people are located, we see that they are mostly huddled along the Atlantic Ocean. We might compare this situation to that of the U.S.; imagine what our prosperity would be like today if we had never pushed across North America, to Texas, California—and everywhere else west of the Atlantic seaboard.
The actor has taken a number of the political stands in recent weeks. He was arrested in Washington, D.C. in January while taking part in a climate change rally organized by Jane Fonda. At the Golden Globe Awards, he encouraged his fellow Hollywood stars to swear off flying private jets.
That opportunity might have presented itself last weekend since Sanders, Warren and others were campaigning in Iowa and then went to South Carolina for Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebrations and then on to Washington to be in the Senate. But they didn't share private flights.
Rather than President Donald Trump's conception of the good life, which he said revolved around cheating for money, Sanders said, his ethos was: We are stronger and more human when we care about other people.
The California primary will take place on Super Tuesday, March 3, instead of in early June, as in previous years.
Debs was the candidate of the Socialist Party of America in five successive elections from 1900 to 1920, and opposed the entry of the U.S. into World War I.
I asked him then, in a widely shared, public letter to cease and desist, he continued. However, he chose not to listen to my request, just as he chooses not to listen to the many American voices who ask him to stop his constant lies, to stop his petty, nasty name calling and bullying, to stop pushing his dangerous, vilifying and hateful rhetoric.
As bitter cold continues to grip much of North America and helps spawn the fierce storm along the East Coast, the question arises: What's the influence of climate change? Some scientists studying the connection between climate change and cold spells, which occur when cold Arctic air dips south, say that they may be related. But the importance of the relationship is not fully clear yet. The Arctic is not as cold as it used to be — the region is warming faster than any other — and studies suggest that this warming is weakening the jet stream, which ordinarily acts like a giant lasso, corralling cold air around the pole.
Some of the water that will be produced from the project will be dedicated for environmental projects, he said, nothing that some water would help fish, and some would supply existing refuges that support waterfowl species.
It's not just those candidates tethered to Washington by the impeachment trial who often opt to fly private. Former Vice President Joe Biden spent at least $1.2 million on charter jets through September, while Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, had spent at least $750,000.
8:20 PM: Democrats still holding leads:
One way that Bloomberg hopes to grow and enrich the economy is by increasing the number of refugees allowed into the country annually. If elected, Bloomberg hopes to accept 125,000 refugees if elected—nearly doubling the intake accepted under former President Barack Obama. A portion of the new refugees will be individuals fleeing the impact of climate change, an idea also favored by Bloomberg's more progressive rivals, like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and environmentalist billionaire Tom Steyer.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, the Los Angeles office of Vice News is protected by a fence to keep out the homeless from building tent cities.

Your country was entered into a green experiment far more radical and transformative (and insane) than anything anywhere within the European Union — including, even, Germany's economically ruinous Energiewende
Thunberg is due to address the summit in the Swiss Alpine resort town of Davos next week with a call on governments and financial institutions to stop investing in fossil fuels.
Next two extraordinary pieces of ad hoc legislation rushed through in the last few days, eagerly ushered in by the Remainer Speaker of the House John Bercow, and voted through by a Remainer-dominated Parliament, designed with the sole purpose of frustrating the No Deal Brexit that is now Britain's only way of getting the full Brexit it voted for in June 2016.
I'm not going to walk to California, Sanders replied when asked about flying private. We do the best we can as an example, but I'm not going to sit here and tell you that we're not going to use fossil fuels.
A representative for the campaign didn't comment Friday on the authenticity of the call.
Steyer is also seizing on Biden's fourth-place finish in last week's Iowa caucuses to undermine Biden's argument that he is best positioned to defeat President Donald Trump. That's important because many black voters in South Carolina have said they would back Biden because they view him as the most electable candidate in a crowded field.
BP just discovered a billion barrels of oil in the Gulf of Mexico. It was just another CNBC headline on January 8, and yet it highlighted a bigger trend: the surge in U.S. energy production.
Yet still, before Bolsonaro, leftist Brazilian governments had meekly accepted the Western Green agenda, even if it hurt economic development. Such is the power of ideas—and of foreign aid with strings attached to it.
In his statement, Pope Francis went beyond earlier declarations that seemed to exclude the Church taking a formal stand on questions of climate science.
3) Mexico has numerous states under the direct influence of drug cartels that have standing armies with access to RPGs, armored vehicles, artillery, and explosives. Most of Mexico has military forces patrolling streets to deal with cartel paramilitary forces.
However, fears still remain that the oil tanker could explode at any moment due to the high volatility of the condensate oil, likely killing all the crew members on board.
Whatever the source, the reality is that we're all standing atop virtually incomprehensible quantities of untapped energy abundance. In 2014, Breitbart News noted that the value of oil and gas under federal lands and waters amounted to $128 trillion. That $128 trillion, we might add, is six times the GDP of the U.S. Once again, that's just federal lands and waters—a fraction of this country's total territory.
Here's why, even though the House Democrats have shown no immediate interest in pursuing it, the Green New Deal remains a clear and present danger.
If you're a presidential candidate running to try to beat Donald Trump, who is a climate denier to his bones, and that requires you to move around the country … you should do that, said Leah Stokes, a professor and researcher into climate and energy politics at the University of California-Santa Barbara.
I really don't like their policy of taking away your car, of taking away your airplane rights, of 'Let's hop a train to California,' Trump said during a rally last February.

This, in turn, has massive implications for the post-Brexit Special Relationship between Britain and the US.
Since 2016, we've been dragged down into the mud of Trump's swamp, the two-time Academy Award-winner writes.
Biden has set a goal of administering 100 million shots in his first 100 days. The pace of vaccination is approaching one million shots a day, but 1.8 million a day would be needed to reach widespread or herd immunity by the summer, according to a recent estimate by the American Hospital Association. Wen says the pace should be even higher — closer to three million a day.
Mayor de Blasio has drawn comparisons between oil companies and the tobacco industry, which knowingly profited from behavior they knew to be harmful. The difference, of course, is that numerous deaths were convincingly attributed to cigarette smoking. Whereas people have died from severe weather events since the beginning of recorded history, no death has yet been ascribed to manmade global warming.
We don't have decades. What the scientists are telling us — if we don't get our act together within the next eight or nine years, we're talking about cities all over the world — major cities — going underwater, he said at the Democrat debate in November.
Biden said, according to Fox News:
Although the Biden campaign attempted to dismiss Bondi's argument, the broader point about a culture of corruption permeating the former vice president's family seems to have taken hold with the mainstream media. Just this past week, Politico published an in-depth exposé on the financial ties between James Biden, the former vice president's brother, and a high-powered Washington, DC, lobbyist.
As Breitbart News has reported, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti recently adopted a more pragmatic approach, and has approached the federal government to work together in dealing with the city's roughly 60,000 homeless people, including by possibly relocating some of them to unused federal property.
In the recording, an unnamed female pretends to be Greta, and Stolyarov plays her father, Svante. They offer to lend support to the campaign of a man who identifies himself as Sanders, and the man welcomes it.

The City of New York has reportedly filed a federal claim seeking damages from BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell to help pay for a $20 billion plan to protect the city from the effects of global warming.
Such moves play into the hands of rival global powers and can only lead to greater fragmentation rather than much needed increased cooperation, the letter said.
The proposal falls short of expectations for $2,000 direct stimulus payments. Instead, it provides for what Breitbart News estimates would be around $320 billion in direct payments of $1,400 for most Americans. Biden's aides say this amounts to the promised $2,000 when coupled with the $600 included in the aid bill President Donald Trump signed last year.
Unfortunately there are still people who are trying to impersonate me or falsely claim that they 'represent' me in order to communicate with high profile people, politicians, media, artists etc, she said and apologized to anyone who may have been misled by such people.
During the flight into Egypt, the child Jesus experienced with his parents the tragic fate of the displaced and refugees, Francis said in his message, citing a 1952 text by Pope Pius XII, which is marked by fear, uncertainty and unease.
Two weeks ago, the Vatican insisted that a focus on the coronavirus pandemic must not draw people's attention away from migrants.
The proposal also expands paid leave for workers and increases tax credits for families with children, goals shared by many pro-family conservatives seeking to make family formation more affordable.
Lana Del Rey has claimed in a recent interview that narcissism, not climate change, is the biggest problem facing the world today, a fact that the pop star claims came to light due to the Trump presidency.

Both states will deepen their cooperation in foreign affairs, defence, external and internal security and development and at the same time work on strengthening the ability of Europe to act independently, says the text of the treaty, as seen by Reuters.
As Breitbart News has noted, the Green New Deal is in fact an old idea, first championed by President Barack Obama's green jobs czar, Van Jones. It seeks to implement classic socialist policies of state-run enterprises, using the pretext of an environmental crisis.
21) The state of Tamaulipas, directly south of Texas, has two former governors currently indicted for their alleged roles in helping cartels. One remains in Mexico, while the other is in U.S. custody awaiting trial.
Economically and strategically, open borders isn't just a good plan — it's the only chance we've got. America is an aging nation with a stagnant population. We have ample land to house lots more people, but we are increasingly short of workers.
8) The majority of tunnels are found on the Arizona and California borders. The tunnels are generally discovered in areas where there are population centers on both sides of the border and a wall or fence is already in place. Few have been found in Texas, where there is a river.
I'm really not sure that this was quite the post-Brexit vision Trump had in mind when he promised Britain a 'fantastic' and 'very big' trade deal once it managed to extricate itself from the European Union.
A continent away, frantic negotiations were continuing on the eve of the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) decision on the Bay-Delta Plan, the controversial new policy that will mandate that rivers in the San Joaquin watershed must have an average of 40% unimpeded flow during the spring months — a decision that shifts precious water from farmers and cities to the environment in an effort to save threatened fish populations.
Critics, however, say that state authorities allocated just enough money to the project to make it appear as if they are spending money on water storage, while not quite enough to allow the reservoir to be built.
Why, given her claims to have felt threatened, did Soubry look so cheerfully unperturbed throughout?
That meant, Sanders said, No more premiums, no more co-payments, no more deductibles, no more out-of-pocket expenses, no more paying more than $200 per year for prescription drugs.
Still, Sanders' campaign says the senator's comment to Colbert wasn't realistic. Even if several senators were looking to decamp from Washington to Iowa quickly after the impeachment trial concludes each day, they would be headed to different parts of the state.
Biden's fading position in Iowa is contrasted by the central role he and his youngest son, Hunter, continue to play in the impeachment proceedings. This week, Trump's legal team laid out its case for why the president had good reason to suggest Ukraine look into Hunter Biden's role with the Ukrainian natural gas giant, Burisma Holdings. Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a member of the legal team, specifically noted that Hunter was paid $83,000 per month for a role he had little qualification to hold. She further argued the arrangement was rife with potential conflicts of interest, especially because Joe Biden led U.S. policy with Ukraine for most of the Obama administration.
For pity sake why are you hell-bent on making this country discernibly poorer? To achieve net zero means everyone living in poverty. It's bonkers. You've lost my vote. Didn't take long. NetZero is beyond insanity.

On top of that, the EU legislators complained that Trump and top administration officials lambast the EU as bureaucratic … and have praised populist and nationalist movements in the face of sitting EU governments. The legislators feel all of this crystallized in the diplomatic snub.

In conclusion, Ehrlich warned that sometime in the next 15 years, the end will come, meaning an utter breakdown of the capacity of the planet to support humanity.
Thunberg announced her intentions to trademark the terms Fridays for Future, Skolstrejk för klimatet, and her own name on social media platform Instagram, complaining that, my name and the #FridaysForFuture movement are constantly being used for commercial purposes without any consent whatsoever.
It's no wonder the ordinary folk who voted Brexit are growing increasingly restive and bitter. The Remainer Establishment — or Deep State, if you prefer — is snatching Brexit away from them; and it's so arrogant, so complacent, so contemptuous of the public that it's scarcely bothering even to hide its tracks.
Acknowledging her life both as a Christian and a climate change believer is like coming out of the closet, Hayhoe has said.
The 78-year-old Sanders suggests that Greta make a statement in his support and that they do an event together when she next comes to the U.S. I would be really appreciative, he says.
The conference addressed issues of biodiversity, great extinctions of history, population and demographics, and Ehrlich was invited to speak on Causes and Pathways of Biodiversity Losses: Consumption Preferences, Population Numbers, Technology, Ecosystem Productivity.
The divisions over water storage do not match partisan divisions on other issues. In the Central Valley, Democrats tend to be as vociferous in their advocacy for water storage as Republicans are. And in the past, Republicans were as skeptical of such projects as urban Democrats are today.
This is the problem of presenting your purity above your practicality, said Democratic strategist Chris Lippincott, who has not endorsed any of the 2020 primary candidates. When we think about certain candidates who talk a lot about the environment … you're going to hold them to a different standard.
Trump's America produces approximately 14 per cent of global CO2 emissions; Brazil about 1.5 per cent; India 7 per cent; and China nearly 30 per cent. Since none of these economies has any intention of driving change on the CO2 production front any time soon, it will put Boris Johnson's attempts to take Britain's economy Net Zero by 2050 into tragic, painful and embarrassing perspective.
But if there is, it must be bloody complicated…
At least the Fast & Furious movies are about something, are about the importance of family and working together. Other than justifying the scarf, Vice isn't about anything.
And in a way, it also highlighted a big counter-trend: the green left's desire to take it all away, in the name of fighting climate change.
Biden's aides claimed, without evidence, that the proposal would advance his target of administering 100 million vaccines by the 100th day of his administration and help move toward the objective of reopening most schools by the spring.
The Obamacare accommodation Biden referred to, however, was never viewed as such by many Catholic schools and organizations. Instead, they recognized it as an accounting trick whereby completion of a certified form would merely transfer their mandate to directly provide abortion-inducing drugs to an insurance provider, who would take care of the administration of these services for the faith-based groups. In short, the accommodation simply ensured the abortion-inducing drugs were paid for, as the Obama-Biden administration desired, while the conscience issues of the faith-based groups remained ignored.
There Is No Planet B, I Have a Green Dream and We Want A Cooler Planet, read some of the other signs.
Here's what Guterres demanded the nations of the world do:
Yet by the time that new technologies to foster development in Amazonia had come along—including air conditioning, mosquito abatement, and the helicopter—a new and hostile political attitude had taken hold.
In each of these people, forced to flee to safety, Jesus is present as he was at the time of Herod, he continued. In the faces of the hungry, the thirsty, the naked, the sick, strangers and prisoners, we are called to see the face of Christ who pleads with us to help.

Here is the evidence: a 2019 poll showing that for the 13th year running, 'dealing with global climate change' comes right near the bottom of Americans' political priorities.
In an article analyzing the possible motives for Sorondo's affinity for Communism, Zmirak writes that Sorondo's fondness for totalitarianism is the reaction of an angry, self-conscious mediocrity lashing out at his moral and natural betters. No wonder such men find kindred spirits in the gray, vicious ranks of the Chinese Communist Party.
Climate change advocates have recently insisted, however, that record cold temperatures in North America cannot be used as an argument against anthropogenic climate change, since no direct causality can be established between singular weather phenomena and climate change.
The emergency is the fact we don't have an executive who's exercising his power in a responsible way, continued Lessig on MSNBC, adding that the president cannot build the border wall without the support of Congress.
To allow women to have as many children as they want, Ehrlich said, is like letting people throw as much of their garbage into their neighbor's backyard as they want.
It's clear that the Green New Deal has more impetus than just climate change. That is, Ocasio-Cortez and her allies see a Green New Deal as being about more than climate change—it's about changing America.
You haven't, even though the figures are pretty spectacular. As Aaron Brown reports here at Real Clear Markets:
The socialist senator seemed open to the idea of sharing a private jet with other presidential hopefuls who find themselves in the same predicament, citing the cost but, notably, not the impact on the environment. Are you going to give rides to the other candidates who are in the Senate? Colbert asked. Actually, we have used jets previously, and that was an idea we thought of. Those are expensive so we thought we'd all chip in and ride together, Sanders said, ultimately conceding that he does not know if the idea will come to fruition. That's greener. That's greener, sir, Colbert noted. Maybe we can all chip in, get one plane, and come back, Sanders said.

As the highest-ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, Smith has called out Democrats' removal of a budgetary restraint on government spending, known as the pay-as-you-go provision, or PAYGO. This would enable Democrats to spend further on climate change proposals such as the Green New Deal.
The call itself took place in early December, but the duo decided to release it more than two months later because of Sanders' success in Iowa and New Hampshire, Kuznetsov told The Associated Press in a Skype interview.
Yet in the past two decades, all this expertise has gone to the trash heap, because, thanks to strong science and stronger entrepreneurship, we've enjoyed an energy miracle. This is in large part due to the new process of fracking; in 2018, the U.S., for the first time since World War Two, became a net energy exporter.
I'm still very much in a place where I'm trying to decide what is the most effective thing I can do to help our Congress, our [political] process, and our country actually address the issues of climate change, health care, wage inequality, etc., she told the outlet.
Professor Lessig is also a progressive activist, who has served on the boards of several groups financed by George Soros, and who offered in 2016 free and confidential legal services to members of the Electoral College who would violate state law to vote against then President-Elect Donald Trump.
So let's take a moment to drill down, pun intended, on that new discovery. At current prices, that new oil, in the waters south of New Orleans, is worth about $59 billion. For purposes of comparison, the GDP of the entire state of Louisiana in 2017 was $246 billion. Which is to say, $59 billion is an appreciable bump.
President Macron's office confirmed the extension of the Élysée Treaty would enable the two countries to take a lead on handling the challenges they will be confronted with in the 21st century, adding, [We] envisage deepening our engagement in favour of security and prosperity of our peoples in the framework of a more sovereign, united and democratic Europe.
During an environmental summit in December, President Xi Jinping described climate change as an enemy of picturesque scenery and called for efforts to ensure coexistence between man and nature, cherish the environment as we cherish our own lives, respect and protect nature, and safeguard the irreplaceable planet Earth.
I feel very honored and privileged to be here tonight. BAFTA has always been very supportive of my career and I'm deeply appreciative. But I have to say I also feel conflicted because so many of my fellow actors that are deserving don't have that same privilege, Phoenix said in his acceptance speech.
So now we can see the makings of the next epic political fight: that is, the zeal of the greens vs. the determination of carbon-energy producers. In the U.S. today, about a dozen states are heavily dependent on carbon-energy production for their wellbeing; these states account for most of the 1.1 million employees in the energy sector.
It's alarming to Catholics to see Joe Biden tout his Catholic faith and then turn around and say he would immediately go after the Little Sisters of the Poor and reinstate the rules that would force them to either violate their faith or pay crippling fines, Ashley McGuire, senior fellow with The Catholic Association, said in a statement to Breitbart News.
Because we still fail to make the connection between the climate crisis and increased extreme weather events and nature disasters like the #AustraliaFires
The president's policy differs from that of his predecessor. During former President Barack Obama's tenure in the White House, the number of displaced persons being resettled in the U.S. increased drastically. Between 2008 and 2017, more than 67,000 refugees on average were admitted into the country. The total would have been larger if Republicans had not stymied Obama's efforts to admit 110,000 displaced persons, most notably from Syria, during his final year in office.
11) Cartels spend a lot of money building a tunnel–only to be discovered shortly after.
The former vice president, in particular, claimed that questions about his political influence intersecting with his son's work in Ukraine were part of an organized smear campaign. The claim, which is disputed by ethics watchdogs in both the U.S. and Ukraine, was further undercut by Biden's inability to recollect in which country his son was working.

The study authors, from NOAA's Marine Mammal and Turtle division in La Jolla, California, analyzed sea turtle populations on beaches at the northern and southern ends of Australia's Great Barrier Reef.
Indeed, some heterodox observers, such as the late Thomas Gold, argue that the earth is, in fact, making more energy, even now. That is, oil, gas, and coal aren't fossil fuels at all, in the sense that such fuels are supposed to be the decayed remains of dinosaurs and other prehistoric organisms. Instead, Gold argued, the internal heat of the earth is, as it were, constantly cooking up more oil. By this reckoning, so long as the core of the earth is hot, we'll never run out of carbon-based fuel.
500 million (!!) animals are estimated dead because of the bushfires. Over 20 people have died and thousands of homes have burned to ground. The fires have spewed 2/3 of the nations national annual CO2 emissions, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

The papers questioned everything from the relative role of natural mechanisms in changes to the climate system vis-à-vis increased CO2 concentrations, the allegedly unprecedented nature of modern climate phenomena such as warming, sea levels, glacier and sea ice retreat, and the efficacy and reliability of computer climate models for projecting future climate states.
The madness of Trump, as bad as it was, it really needed to happen. We really needed a reflection of our world's greatest problem, which is not climate change, but sociopathy and narcissism. Especially in America, she said. It's going to kill the world. It's not capitalism, it's narcissism. I was surprised we didn't have a live-television psychopath crazy person as a president a long time ago because that's what we see on TV and that's what we see on Instagram.
Throughout the plan, there's a focus on ensuring that minority communities that have borne the brunt of the pandemic are not shortchanged on vaccines and treatments, aides said.

Addressing world leaders at the One Planet Summit on Monday, Guterres outlined how he saw a brave new world of the future, based on the theme of a great climate and economic reset he has espoused before. Guterres said:
Author Kenneth Richard found that during the course of the year 2017, at least 485 scientific papers were published that in some way questioned the supposed consensus regarding the perils of human CO2 emissions or the efficacy of climate models to predict the future.

Yet instead, it seems as though Western Greens are saddling up for a major confrontation with Bolsonaro.

Now, of course, in the future, since we know so much more than we did then, we can make growth clean—that's the point about carbon capture, and other new technologies. And yet at the same time, clean growth is still growth, and that means more. Yet are the environmental greens, as opposed to the Green New Dealers, really on board with that? We'll have to wait and see if that split is real, and if it can be bridged.
Smith noted in his letter to Kaufman that the OMB has fully complied with the laws in advising the Biden Transition Team (BTT), including:
Overall, as of 2005, nearly 860,000 refugees have been resettled across America—a large proportion going to areas that have lagged behind the rest of the country in economic growth since the Great Recession. The incoming refugees have stressed the already depleted resources of state and local governments. The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) estimates that it costs taxpayers more than $64,000 over five years to resettle one Syrian refugee. To resettle an entire family, the cost estimate rises to more than $257,000 over five years.

Nonetheless, with the passage of time, Pope Francis has seemed to take an ever more decided stance behind the notion of manmade global warming, while sending signals that there was not much room for debate on the issue.
29) The State Department keeps U.S. law enforcement from being more aggressive against cartels. The State Department has everything to do with how law enforcement and intelligence agencies operate in Mexico–and any effort to secure the border without addressing the Department's timidity in Mexico will likely fail or be less successful than it otherwise could be.
In the study, authors Nic Lewis and Judith Curry looked at actual temperature records and compared them with climate change computer models. What they found is that the planet has shown itself to be far less sensitive to increases in CO2 than the climate models say. As a result, they say, the planet will warm less than the models predict, even if we continue pumping CO2 into the atmosphere. As Lewis explains: Our results imply that, for any future emissions scenario, future warming is likely to be substantially lower than the central computer model-simulated level projected by the (United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), and highly unlikely to exceed that level.

From February 2016 to February 2018 (the latest month available) global average temperatures dropped 0.56°C. You have to go back to 1982-84 for the next biggest two-year drop, 0.47°C—also during the global warming era. All the data in this essay come from GISTEMP Team, 2018: GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP). NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (dataset accessed 2018-04-11 at https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/). This is the standard source used in most journalistic reporting of global average temperatures. The 2016-18 Big Chill was composed of two Little Chills, the biggest five month drop ever (February to June 2016) and the fourth biggest (February to June 2017). A similar event from February to June 2018 would bring global average temperatures below the 1980s average. February 2018 was colder than February 1998.
The EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment came following seven years of negotiations. Two factors are said to have played a critical role in the signing of the deal, namely China's desire to ink a deal before President-Elect Joe Biden assumes the White House and a push from German Chancellor Angela Merkel to secure a deal prior to the end of Germany's term as the head of the EU presidency in December.

It is incredibly important in President Trump's administration to make the clarion call for religious freedom all around the world. There are many countries in which religious freedom is not available and we believe that by gathering citizens from around the world … we will highlight the central nature of religious freedom and its importance to individuals in countries. We believe religious freedom is important for every citizen around the world and we want to bring everyone together to discuss how individuals of all faiths have the right to worship as they choose, or if they choose not to.

Newly-installed Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is calling for 70% taxation on the wealthy as a way to pay for her Green New Deal, which proposes to use government to create new jobs by investing in renewable energy.
I'm fairly sure he had in mind that Britain would become a freebooting, free-market player in the manner of Trump's America.
Still, the crisis provoked questions about whether state authorities had mismanaged Oroville Dam or ignored warnings about the structural integrity of the spillway — or even of the dam itself, which, some claimed, had already begin to leak.
Federal law enforcement officials were alerted in November that several Democrats had received calls from someone believed to be outside the U.S. who was claiming to represent the teenage Thunberg and was trying to set up calls or in-person meetings with members of Congress, a U.S. official told The Associated Press. Some of the congressional offices reported the incidents to the FBI and the Capitol Police, the official said. The person was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.
In March, Sanders' campaign became the first to announce it would provide carbon offsets, donations to environmental groups meant to mitigate the environmental effects of extra emissions. Since then, it had spent about $9,000 on them through September. And during his primary challenge to Hillary Clinton in 2016, Sanders paid around $14,000 for such offsets.
Unrelenting cold since late December has caused energy demand to spike, pushing up prices and straining supplies. New England power companies are struggling to keep up with demand. New England's current energy woes are the result of years of state and federal policies aimed at closing coal and oil-fired power plants, largely as part of the region's effort to fight global warming.
According to Richard's analysis, the 485 new papers underscore the significant limitations and uncertainties inherent in our understanding of climate and climate changes, which in turn suggests that climate science is not nearly as settled as media reports and some policymakers would have people believe.
We have been getting less and less water in the form of snowpack, which means less storage — we get more rain, so we can't store it. Sites, she said, provides another place to put that water.
Extreme weather conditions are hindering a rescue operation in the East China Sea after an Iranian oil tanker collided with another ship causing a fire that has yet to be extinguished.
During his first year in office, Mike will set the target for refugee admissions at 125,000, and—recognizing the changing conditions causing displacement—will also establish a precedent for people permanently displaced by climate change to qualify as refugees, Bloomberg's plan states.
It is naive to believe that China will respect the agreement it has signed. It is naive to ignore the geopolitical implications of doing a deal with China right now. And it is naive to think that the darkening political climate in Beijing will never affect life in Brussels or Berlin, Rachman wrote.
I would hope that is something that will continue in the new administration, Manchin added. I think the Biden administration will be very open to working with USCIRF and all of the groups involved with religious freedom.
Longer is better for assessing climate forecasts, and so Armstrong has agreed to extend the bet for another ten years, sticking with the original 2007 global mean temperature as the starting point. This time he has reason to be more confident. Validation tests published two years after the original bet compared no-change model forecasts with IPCC dangerous warming forecasts for horizons from one to 100 years, and found that no-change forecasts were considerably more accurate; especially over longer horizons. That study, followed all of the relevant scientific forecasting principles, with only a minor exception. To our knowledge, the study remains the only peer-reviewed paper published in a scientific journal that provides scientific forecasts of long-term global mean temperatures.
The top 10 GA counties w/ 10k+ voters where Dems underperformed Biden by the most in November's Loeffler special: 1. Hart -2.1%
With three weeks to go, there are warning signs.
But with his Iowa disappointment and the middling results expected in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, Biden probably will need a commanding victory by the time the Democratic contest reaches South Carolina. Any shifts in voter sentiment could narrow a hoped-for win or, in a nightmare scenario, relegate him to second place, threatening the viability of his campaign.
A private jet will reportedly fly Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to and from campaign events in Iowa to avoid commercial airline delays.
Top three concerns, according to the Pew Research Center were:
Although I have enormous respect for Biden, I have been disappointed in his lack of empathy on issues such as assistance for veterans or a criminal justice overhaul, Lincoln said. I've grown weary of politicians. The same old formula will not defeat Trump.
Morrison also rejected calls to downsize Australia's lucrative coal industry, noting Australia is the world's largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas and he intends to keep it that way.
Trump has his track record, and Bolsonaro is starting his. Mindful of the high stakes, other economic nationalists, in other countries, should be paying close attention.

Yes there are people of color on this records picture and that's all I'll say about that but thank you, she wrote.
That's right: the Rev. Raphael Warnock, the Democrat nominee for one of Georgia's U.S. Senate seats—both of which are up for grabs in Tuesday's runoffs—is running advertisements trying to depress the turnout of his opponent's base. The voter suppression effort seems to be an indication of where everyone knows this race will be decided: by President Trump's supporters. Do they follow his guidance and show up to back Loeffler and Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) on Tuesday? Or do they do as the Democrats want them to and stay home? It's anybody's guess, but a lot rides on whether traditional GOP base voters turn out on election day in Georgia or if they sit this one out.
Happily the New York Times is here to put it all in context. It's all further evidence of global warming, of course!
Moreover, the liberal cities that have incubated America's utopian environmental movement for decades could not exist without ongoing human intervention in the environment that brings water from mountaintop to tap.
By territory, Brazil is the fifth-largest country in the world, and on that land, and under that land, are vast natural resources. It's been estimated, in fact, that Brazil's natural wealth—much of it gold and uranium—is worth $21.8 trillion. That's a lot of money, about $103,000 for every Brazilian man, woman, and child.
Third, Australia's turtle populations are doing just fine.
Emails to Gore were unproductive: after several attempts at engagement, his staff informed Armstrong that Gore did not take bets. The important question of whether public policies should be based on the alarming projections remained, so Armstrong commissioned theclimatebet.com site to track how the bet would have turned out had Gore accepted.
A former cardinal from China, Joseph Zen, has criticized the Vatican for selling out Catholicism via its overtures to Beijing.
An Extra $59 Billion Could Solve a Lot of Problems
A notice of the protest says that Fonda will be joined by actors Maggie Gyllenhaal, Joaquin Phoenix, Martin Sheen, Saffron Burrows, and model Amber Valletta.
As Bloomberg News has reported, Bolsonaro carried chunks of metal with him on the campaign trail, all to make a point about the value of mining. One of those chunks was of niobium, which is one of the rare-earth elements that undergird the modern economy. Because it is needed to strengthen steel and semiconductors, niobium is precious; it sells for about $42,000 a ton. Brazil has 40 million tons of niobium, and if we do the math, that's $1.68 trillion—which is a lot for a country whose annual GDP totals barely more than $2 trillion. The metal is already being mined in Brazil, but Bolsonaro's point is that there's a lot more niobium in the country–and many other rare earths, too; Brazilians just have to find them and get them out of the ground.
Fire drill Fridays call for fast action on the Green New Deal and an end to all fossil fuel exploration, extraction and taxpayer subsidies to oil companies, the notice of the protest states.
While Iglesias would presumably be too busy fulfilling his role as deputy prime minister of Spain to carry on hosting the show, Hispantv never announced that the Fort Apache programme was discontinued, and has given no indication Iglesias will not continue to host the show in the future.

Sanders should have more than enough dough to afford the luxurious method of transportation — he raised $34.5 million in the final quarter of 2019 and brought in $96 million over the course of the entire year, the New York Post reported.
5:45 PM: Georgia exit poll: Coronavirus:
How Drugs Will Get Under, Over, and Around Trump's Wall
The Harvest Moon rocker recently called Trump, as well as other past presidents, losers for failing to take action to combat climate change.
We're here to show the governments and the people and the media and everyone that we're not happy with the situation as it is, said 17-year-old Deborah Hausser, one of the protesters.
To be sure, some critics see this possible change in America as Venezuela-ification. And yet it's worth noting that key Green New Dealers see the change in a much different frame of reference. Here, for example, is Saikat Chakrabarti, top adviser to Ocasio-Cortez, tweeting on January 13, linking the Green New Deal to U.S. economic mobilization during World War Two:
In November 2016, the Pope called climate change skeptics to an ecological conversion, while denouncing what he believed to be a weak reaction from governments to the climate crisis. He also criticized the ease with which well-founded scientific opinion about the state of our planet is disregarded.
We pay more per capita in health care and education for lower outcomes than many other nations, she added. And so for me, what's unrealistic is — is what we're living in right now.

The emergency legislation would be paid for with borrowed money, adding to trillions in debt the government has already incurred to confront the pandemic. Aides said Biden will make the case that the additional spending and borrowing is necessary to prevent the economy from sliding into an even deeper hole. Interest rates are low, making debt more manageable. Inflation is below the Federal Reserve's target, indicating that the economy has enough slack to withstand additional demand introduced by deficit spending.
1:59 AM: NBC Projects Warnock Win:
Republicans concede that the only way they lose these races is if the president's base does not show up. The Washington Post's Jacqueline Alemany quotes anonymous GOP officials on Tuesday in her Power Up newsletter to express that concern. The anonymous Republicans claim that Trump's nonstop voter fraud allegations in Georgia have hurt Loeffler's and Perdue's chances by causing Trump base voters to question the legitimacy of elections and consider not voting. Trump's been generally unhelpful throughout this whole process, the anonymous GOP senate aide said, warning that Republicans should be prepared for a bad night.
If global warming continues, the study concludes, then so many turtles may turn female that there will be no males with which to mate. Extinction will then be inevitable.
7:00 PM: Most polls now closed. A few precincts will be open for 40 more minutes.
Travis Lincoln, a 44-year-old from Charleston, attended Biden's first rally in Columbia last May and said he was all in for the former vice president. But as the primary approaches, Lincoln said he has shifted his backing to tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.
It is, of course, important that some equitable plan for resource development be put in place. That is, a plan that rewards risk-taking and entrepreneurship but also assures workers and citizens a piece of the action. We might note that one of the signal successes of the previous left-wing regime was its program of family allowances, aimed at the poor and working poor. Such conscious spreading of the wealth is, of course, good politics, and yet it's also good policy because every citizen deserves a fair shake and because it's important to preserve social peace.
Here is WWF's account of their findings:
The culminating pressure from the campaign trail, the impeachment hearings, and a newly awakened media seem to be having an impact. In recent days, the former vice president has made an increasing number of stumbles and gaffes. The gaffe follows several others Biden has made on the campaign trail in recent days. Most notably, the former vice president elicited attention on Tuesday for pushing a voter and suggesting because of a disagreement about climate change that the man go vote for someone else.
I'm perfectly prepared to accept that there may be a rational explanation for all the above that doesn't include the words deep state conspiracy.
In a video message embedded in the tweet, Pope Francis explains that he had chosen the theme Forced like Jesus Christ to flee for his message for the 2020 World Day of Migrants and Refugees to remind people of what Jesus experienced as a child displaced and a refugee.

We can't grasp the level of oil contamination at this moment, Park Sung-dong, an official from South Korea's Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, told Reuters. The cargo is still on fire, so it is hard to figure out if oil is being spilled.
As a Democrat candidate for president, Harris pledged not only to restrict states' rights to pass and enact their own abortion laws, but also to block a pro-life president's power and that of his or her administration.
State Rep. Ivory Thigpen, a member of the Legislative Black Caucus who has endorsed Sanders, said Sanders is the only candidate who has made genuine strides to foster substantive connections within South Carolina's black voters instead of relying on past support.
Trump's Border Wall Would Literally Split This Town in Two
In December, Bolsonaro himself made the case for more economic growth: Environmental politics can't muddle with Brazil's development. Today, the economy is almost back on track thanks to agribusiness, and they are suffocated by environmental questions.
A former lecturer at the Complutense University of Madrid, Iglesias became politically active in the 1990s, when he joined Spain's Communist Youth League, later hosting a television show on an Iranian state-owned network and founding the Hugo Chavez-backed Podemos party.
Van Jones was one of the early proponents of the Green New Deal concept, which he outlines in his 2008 book, The Green Collar Economy: How One Solution Can Fix Our Two Biggest Problems. An Amazon book review describes the book as a re-imagining of FDR's original New Deal that makes the government 'a partner' of the people, and sets about defining the principles of a 'smart, supportive, reliable' partnership. This also happens to be exactly what Ocasio-Cortez promises in her version of the Green New Deal. Wiki said, The book is a detailed proposal for a 'Green New Deal.' In 2009, Jones resigned from the White House under a cloud for supporting the view that President Bush was complicit in the September 11 terror attacks, and his treatise on the Green New Deal failed to get traction.
As Breitbart News and other outlets have reported, 30 Democrats traveled to Puerto Rico over the weekend on a chartered plane with over 100 lobbyists. Their itinerary included meetings with local officials — as well as parties, a local premiere of Hamilton, and free time on the beach.
Armstrong bet that the global mean temperature would not change; in other words, that temperature increases and decreases would tend to balance out over time. That forecast is consistent with a statement in the aforementioned IPCC technical report: In climate research and modeling, we should recognize that we are dealing with a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore that the long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.
McClintock is among the skeptics. He told Breitbart News that he has been hearing talk about the Sites Reservoir for decades, and that Californians are constantly told that construction is imminent. But somehow, that reservoir, and others, are never built.
Yet in addition, Brazil's potential wealth extends far beyond the resources that have already been identified.
Using his speech to call for concerted global action on the climate emergency at the summit, Gove noted the lack of efforts on the issue by President Trump and the Brazilian leader, Jair Bolsonaro. I shan't mention any world leaders by name in a critical fashion, he began. However, it's important in the United States and in Brazil that we recognise that there will be people, at the state and at the city level, who can play a vital role in driving change that we all need to see. Predicting that nonetheless COP 26 would be a success, Gove pointed to what he called politically, a realisation of the scale of the challenge and the emergency across the globe.
350.org is so invested in the Green New Deal that it is quietly transforming its college divestment campaign, the Fossil Fuel Divestment Student Network, into the Sunrise Movement, which serves as shock-troop protesters for the Green New Deal. For example, as college divestment campaigns close up shop, they encourage their followers to check out Sunrise Movement! In addition, two co-founders of the Sunrise Movement, Sara Blazevic and Varshini Prakash, left the Fossil Fuel Divestment Student Network to create the Sunrise Movement. Sunrise activists have protested on Capitol Hill and, encouraged by Ocasio-Cortez, have engaged in sit-ins in congressional offices, including three in the offices of Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), to push House Democrats to create a special committee next year focused entirely on climate change initiatives.
This is America. We shouldn't be doing this, the former mayor told The Dallas Morning News at the time. It's not good for Texas. It's not good for America.
To that end, proponents often exaggerate the threat of climate change and other environmental challenges. AOC herself has warned of cataclysmic climate disaster unless the United States moves to 100% renewable energy sources in the next ten years.
And while it's unclear who paid for it, signs like this appeared outside the Trump rally in Dalton on Monday night:
We might pause over that word: contain. That is, the people of Brazil just elected a new leader, knowing full well of his pro-growth agenda. And yet now, the Sierra Club, and other Western Greens, seek to contain him—and, by extension, to contain the Brazilian standard of living.
Macron addressed this week a letter to the French to encourage people to express their views on a series of economic and political matters during a three-month grand debate.
Alexander Gauland, leader of the populist, anti-mass migration Alternative for Germany (AfD), has condemned the union as a further erosion of our national sovereignty.
McKay has always had a smug problem. This is what undermined his comedies with Will Ferrell, what most undermines Vice, and why he wears a scarf in public. McKay despises anyone not enlightened enough to share his beliefs and is even more disgusted with those who enjoy life rather than obsess over politics, those more interested in the next Fast & Furious movie than they are in using Twitter to own the Republicans.
Not a ton of votes in those counties, but every little bit helps.

The average Brazilian doesn't consider climate change to be a very important issue, especially not in relation to truly terrible problems such as poverty—or the crime rate, which is even more terrible. Indeed, Brazil is rated as having the highest crime rate in the world, and street crime is terrifyingly rampant.

The developing relationship between Macron and Merkel blossomed at the end of last year, when the French president announced that the Franco-German couple would become the heart of Europe and work to stop the world descending into chaos — making not-so-thinly veiled criticisms of U.S. President Donald J. Trump's policy of putting the American electorate first, rather than globalist endeavours.

Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg is promising to nearly double the intake of refugees admitted to the U.S. under the Obama administration.
One, Trump, will be leading a fossil fuel economy — the world's largest by energy production — benefiting from the massive competitive advantage of using cheap, abundant energy, freed (thanks to Trump) from the shackles of the Paris Climate Accord.
Actress and leftist advocate Jane Fonda is headlining a climate change protest on Friday in Washington, DC, as part of the ongoing Fire Drill Fridays rallies inspired by Swedish teen Greta Thunberg's climate strike movement.
Life as we know it in California today would be unthinkable without the extensive system of dams, reservoirs, pumps and aqueducts that make urban life possible and that have transformed the drought-prone Central Valley into the most productive farming region on earth.
As a result, much of Brazil's land became off-limits to development. Today, indigenous tribes account for .4 percent of Brazil's population, and yet they inhabit 13 percent of the land. To put that another way, natives are about 32 times more land rich than the average Brazilian. Admittedly, there are often violations of these pro-native restrictions, as illegal poachers and loggers seek quick profits in no-go zones. And yet because these violations are illegal, they are episodic, not offering the potential economic benefits of permanent settlements and systematic development—that is, of the kind that could offer good jobs at good wages to all Brazilians.
We must look at climate change as if it were a devastating military attack against the United States and the entire planet. And we must respond accordingly, Mr. Sanders said in a Tweet.
And oh yes, it's good news, as well, for the United States, since energy security is a big part of national security. As any Baby Boomer remembers, all through the 60s, 70s, and 80s, we were told by the experts that the U.S. faced an energy crisis. Thus we needed to take dramatic steps to deal with this supposed shortfall—everything from cutting back on consumption to invading other countries to seize their oil.
We must not downplay the importance of our own responsibility in interaction with nature, Francis told the Diplomatic Corps accredited to the Holy See. Climate changes, with the global rise in temperatures and their devastating effects, are also a consequence of human activity.

One of the claimed concessions made before the signing of the agreement from China was to work towards implementing International Labour Organization conventions which prohibit the use of slave labour and set out rights for labour unions.

Another project, the Sites Reservoir, has been debated for decades. Rather than capturing water by blocking a river with a dam, the reservoir would be built in a valley with minimal water and would receive excess water during floods, relieving pressure on other dams and allowing them to store more.
This is why I call Ocasio-Cortez a Care Bear Communist. She comes across as ditzy, cute, approachable but the policies she wants to enact are pure hard-left poison.
He added that on Day One of his administration, he would legalize the sale of marijuana in every state in this country.
The poll finds a plurality of Democrats, Republicans and Independents likely to vote in the state's March 3, 2020 primary election in agreement that homelessness is the most important issue for Gov. Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers to work on in 2020. Twenty-one percent of Democrats and Independents called it the top issue, compared to 29 percent of Republicans. Housing affordability and the environment were the next highest priorities for likely Democratic primary voters, while Republicans were more concerned about immigration and taxes.
There's a cardinal, Cardinal Zen, I believe, who spent a lot of time in a communist prison, and he feels completely betrayed by the fact that they're making a deal with his persecutors, said Zmirak. Vatican officials are saying, 'Oh, [Joseph Zen is] out of touch. He doesn't know what he's talking about.' They're dismissing the guy who lives in the country and has been in its prisons while they sit in their little Italian hideaways eating gnocchi, drinking wine, and imagining that they're great realpolitik practitioners.

Indeed, it's quickly apparent: No matter what happens in the 2020 elections, the U.S. is not going to shut itself down for the sake of climate change. And neither, of course, is any other country in the world.
The pro-open borders German chancellor and globalist French president are set to formalise their already close co-operation with shared defence, foreign and economic policy, and business regulations in what is seen as a prototype for a more sovereign, united Europe, The Times reports.
One thing to keep in mind is that margin shifts in rural counties (versus November) may not be representative of statewide.

Obviously, this is a terrible business model. But the media are not about the business of journalism or even the business of business. This is all about a political agenda, and if that means creating a lucrative slush fund for Never Trump losers as a means to create more Never Trump losers, so be it.
Take John Bercow. As Speaker of the House, he is supposed to be non-partisan. Bercow's idea of non-partisanship where Brexit is concerned is to turn up to work in a car (with the personalised number plate B13RCO) with a rear window sticker that says BOLLOCKS TO BREXIT.

The host's acerbic wit was nothing new. He'd certainly offended in the past from the awards stage, and ads for Sunday's telecast played upon the idea that anything could happen, including Gervais being a jerk. His knack for ripping on Hollywood and offending the glitterati is well known among the thin-skinned in the industry. But at the Beverly Hilton, where the three-hour-plus ceremony took place, the mood was already sober thanks to an impeachment, the threat of war with Iran and devastating bush fires in Australia. The last thing anyone needed was for the smirking master of ceremonies to reprimand them for having hope, or taunt the room for trying to use their influence to change things for the better.

The leak, which came just hours after Biden himself campaigned for them in the Peach State ahead of Trump's rally for Loeffler and Perdue late Monday night, was brutal. Biden's team, Politico wrote, is privately skeptical about Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock's chances. Losses by the two Democrats, too, will drastically change what Biden is able to accomplish in his administration once he takes office on Jan. 20.

Part of this energy abundance is the simple working of the law of supply and demand.

Curtis described the value of the project in terms environmentalists might understand: given that the state's climate is changing, and becoming warmer, that means more of California's annual precipitation is falling as rain, rather than snow.
The political outlook for the legislation remained unclear. In a joint statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer praised Biden for including liberal priorities, saying they would move quickly to pass it. But Democrats have narrow margins in both chambers of Congress, and Republicans will push back on issues that range from increasing the minimum wage to providing more money for states, while demanding inclusion of their priorities, such as liability protection for businesses.
Of course, not everything has to be a fight. This author has argued for years that the overlooked middle ground in the climate change debate is carbon capture: that is, sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide, preferably as a solid, so that it can't contribute to the greenhouse effect. One would bet that if the Green New Deal were ever to really get going, carbon capture would loom large, offering a win-win for both sides. That is, we put less CO2 in the atmosphere—or even start removing it—but we still get the energy benefit of our natural resources.
In fact, as CNBC noted, the new discovery will inspire $1.3 billion in investment to actually get the oil out. And that's good news for all the workers who will get jobs and overtime out of this additional economic activity; according to Zip Recruiter, energy jobs in the Gulf pay an average of $80,201 a year. And so there's good news, too, for families, neighbors, storekeepers, and stakeholders.

The facts need not detain us here – because there aren't any. It's just speculation – could, may – gleaned from conversations with tame experts at institutions like the notoriously alarmist and fervently left-wing Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. And there's plenty more nonsense where this came from, as Thomas Williams reported here earlier.
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio is suing five major oil companies for causing bad weather in the hope of defraying part of the cost of much needed and overdue infrastructure work to protect against severe weather.
While Germany and France are uniting to create progressive-globalist union, nationalist and populist groups are working to reshape the EU into a Europe of independent nations ahead of European Parliament elections in May, with right-populist Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini meeting with Poland's conservative leadership in Warsaw on Wednesday.
There will be no lasting prosperity for our people if we do not protect our planet, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak announced at the latter end of his budget speech in the House of Commons on Wednesday, stating: The Treasury's net-zero review will set out the strategic choices ahead of COP26 [UN climate summit] later this year. Today's budget takes the first step.
The French leader, whose popularity ratings hit record lows at the end of last year, hopes the process will help quell anger over his economic policies.
Trump's refugee policy, which has shrunk the number of incoming individuals to levels unseen since 1980, is central to his agenda for raising wages and living standards for the American worker. The president and his allies have argued that a tight labor market benefits workers already in the country by pushing companies to invest in skill training and development. It also has the benefit of boosting wages, as there is a smaller pool of workers competing for open positions.
In an interview with Punchbowl News posted Monday morning, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez refused to rule out a 2022 run against current Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.
7) Most of the efforts by drug cartels to control migration happens South of the Texas border. Criminal organizations like the Reynosa faction of the Gulf Cartel profit more from human smuggling than drug trafficking.
The study revealed that during the course of the year 2017, at least 485 scientific papers were published that in some way questioned the supposed consensus regarding the perils of human CO2 emissions or the efficacy of climate models to predict the future.
Later in the comment, she elaborated: We are all a beautiful mix of everything. So before you make comments again about a WOC / POC [women of color / people of color] issue, I'm not the one storming the capital [sic], I'm literally changing the world by putting my life and thoughts and love out there on the table 24 seven. Respect it.
As Bill McGurn argues in the Wall Street Journal Monday, in his day, Dr. Ehrlich's assertion about the limited 'carrying capacity' of the Earth was settled science. Never mind that it is rooted in an absurdity: that when a calf is born a country's wealth rises, but when a baby is born it goes down.
Ultimately, this campaign is a throwback to the worst of the Obama era – and betrays the hallmarks of one of the Obama era's most notorious and discredited figures, Van Jones, who wrote the book The Green Collar Economy on which the Green New Deal is based.
That is, dam projects would go forward — if there were the political will to build them.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who found her political awakening fighting the constructionof the Dakota Access pipeline at Standing Rock, was a campaign organizer for Sanders' 2016 presidential run and campaigned with him in the summer of 2018.

But a Democrat Super PAC has been very publicly behind a billboard campaign in Georgia with essentially the same message, as Breitbart News reported earlier in the campaign.
Initially, local authorities evacuated nearly 200,000 people downstream of the dam. But a herculean effort by engineers managed to save and stabilize the emergency spillway, averting a massive disaster.

People are still fired up for Joe Biden, said Kimpson, who on Friday said he attended an NAACP meeting where energy for Biden was high. When I walked through through the office, folks were high-fiving me, for having given my endorsement. I've seen no one who is despondent.
John Zmirak, senior editor of The Stream, joined Tuesday's edition of SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight to discuss Sorondo's praise of China. Sorondo heads the Vatican's academies of science and social science.
The concern is that base voters may or may not turn up. But while Trump has expressed his disdain over the Nov. 3 election, he has been equally clear to Georgians in two different rallies and a number of other public statements that he needs and wants them to show up and vote for Loeffler and Perdue.
Extending the eviction and foreclosure moratoriums until the end of September
The Remainer Deep State is killing Brexit.
Biden has committed to embracing the Democrat Party's pro-abortion agenda that includes codifying Roe v. Wade, funding Planned Parenthood, and forcing American taxpayers to fund abortions through a repeal of the Hyde Amendment.
None of this had been costed, not remotely. But we're talking trillions of your money
In fact, Vice assures and reassures us that Cheney believes in nothing (literally nothing) other than the UET, but McKay cannot explain why. For example, after an hour or so of presenting Cheney as power hungry, when the opportunity finally arises to run for president, Mr. Power Hungry chickens out based on one bad poll. And his wife Lynne (Amy Adams), who is supposed to be the true power behind the snarl, agrees, and they happily retire from politics.
These statutes were certainly not written with the intent to give a man like Donald Trump the power that he's now claiming, said Lessig, but it's not an efficient process to check him and that's the uncertainty I think Congress now has to face.
Santiago Abascal, the leader of the Spanish populist party Vox, took the opportunity of Tuesday's confidence vote to denounce the coalition government, saying that the formation was an illegitimate union with the communist Podemos. He went on to criticise the government for failing to tackle the violence and rape associated with mass migration to Spain.

On Venice Boulevard in front of Vice Media's offices, a chain-link fence was erected to prohibit tents from going up. Residents around Penmar Golf Course have started a GoFundMe page and have hit their goal of raising $80,000 to fill a pedestrian pathway with native plants and landscaping — a project being called the Frederick Avenue Pass-Through but whose real objective is to deter the large encampment that has ballooned there.
It is also a system replete with ironies. The state that gave Ronald Reagan to America, and with him a new brand of unapologetic conservatism, is one in which the survival of the population depends on massive investments in infrastructure — albeit paid for, ultimately, by water users themselves.
Look, folks, it is what it is, Limbaugh said. The media wants it to be what it not yet is. Now, it could be. It could evolve and who knows what it could be. Right now, the media is reporting on the coronavirus as they hope it evolves. They hope for hurricanes on the first day of hurricane season. They hope for Hurricane Katrina, so they can say, Climate change!
Trump had criticized California for poor forest management, echoing critics who say that environmentalists have been so successful in pushing the government to restrict logging that they have inadvertently created conditions in which wildfires are likely to spread rapidly through dead trees and dense underbrush, and in which the lack of logging roads makes fighting fires harder. (Democrats prefer to blame climate change, though without evidence.)
Biden has long held that economic recovery is inextricably linked with controlling the coronavirus. Our work begins with getting COVID under control, he declared in his victory speech. We cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life's most precious moments until we get it under control.
A challenge for Biden is that he and his campaign has spent months raising expectations for South Carolina, in part to offset losses they anticipated in states that vote earlier and are less diverse. Biden has argued that his campaign would essentially begin in South Carolina, where a win would propel him into the clutch of states that vote in March where black and Latino voters will be key.
Out of the 350-seat parliament, Sánchez's Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) currently has 120 MPs and the Podemos have 35 seats, meaning that the government will govern from a minority position. Spain will now be governed by a coalition government for the first time since democracy was restored following the collapse of the Franco dictatorship in 1978.
The Sites Reservoir would be filled by significant water diversions from the Sacramento River, which could harm the river's dynamic flow-based ecosystems. More than 20,000 acres of federal and state public lands along the river that were acquired to protect and restore the river's riparian and aquatic habitats, could be degraded by the diversions. In addition to reducing flows in the Sacramento River, the reservoir would drown up to 15,000 acres of existing oak woodlands, grasslands, wetlands, and agricultural land in the western Sacramento Valley. Impacts associated with the reservoir footprint would harm the federally protected bald eagle, a host of other sensitive wildlife species, several rare plants, and significant historical and cultural resources. The Sites Project Authority, a consortium of water districts and local governments, claim that the reservoir could store up to 1.8 million acre feet of water (making it the seventh largest reservoir in the state) and reliably yield about a half million acre feet of water annually for communities, farms, and the environment. But this yield estimate fails to adequately consider the effects of climate change, chronic drought, and reservoir evaporation on project storage and deliveries. …
13) The presence of physical barriers in cities like El Paso has led to fewer people coming over the border to commit petty crimes or bring loads of drugs on their backs. The criminal organizations in the area shifted toward corrupting U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials to smuggle harder drugs.

My point is that statistical cooling outliers garner no media attention. The global average temperature numbers come out monthly. If they show a new hottest year on record, that's a big story. If they show a big increase over the previous month, or the same month in the previous year, that's a story. If they represent a sequence of warming months or years, that's a story. When they show cooling of any sort—and there have been more cooling months than warming months since anthropogenic warming began—there's no story.

But tn times of drought, such as the unusually severe drought that gripped the state from 2011 to 2017, storage is the most salient priority. And McClintock believes there is too little of it.
And Parliament's support of this creepy character demonstrates the most shaming hypocrisy:
Biden's biggest challenge will be to win the hearts and minds of the American people to follow his lead, said Dr. Leana Wen, a public health expert and emergency physician.
While the UN and other supranational groups seek to facilitate migration, rank and file Europeans are desperately looking for ways to slow it down.
In the short run, the green goal is moot because Republicans control the White House and the Senate; there are, to be sure, differing opinions on climate in Republican ranks, but there's no appetite for anything like what the greens have in mind.

What I'm most certain he didn't have in mind is that he'd be at the receiving end of finger-wagging lectures from Boris's Chief Operating Officer Gove, as delivered at a conference of the mostly hard-left eco-loon gathering, the Green Alliance.
Of course, all that could change after 2020, if the Democrats do well in the next election. If so, then the Democrats' green agenda, which is coming to be known as the Green New Deal, has a chance of becoming law.

His campaign is making payments to NativeEnergy, based in Burlington, Vermont, which is the same company that Clinton used for them during her presidential bid in 2016. That's also the same firm Warren uses, with her campaign paying a little more than $10,000 to it in September.
The ad focused on trying to split Trump from Loeffler, by highlighting how Kemp—Georgia's governor who Trump says he intends to back a primary challenger against in two years—appointed her to the seat vacated by the now retired former Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA). But the most interesting part of the ad may be how it opens: I'm Raphael Warnock and I approved this message.
He also promised that Medicare for All would include dental care, hearing aids, eyeglasses, and all health care.
This determination to argue, against all evidence, that the planet is in a warming phase and that we must do more to try to cool it down would be quite funny if it didn't have such terrible real world consequences.
After that, Greta tells Sanders that he was recruited by the KGB in 1988 when he visited Russia and has since been a sleeper agent.
Biden believes the key to speeding that up lies not only in delivering more vaccine but also in working closely with states and local communities to get shots into the arms of more people. The Trump administration provided the vaccine to states and set guidelines for who should get priority for shots, but they largely left it up to state and local officials to organize their vaccination campaigns.

A month after the election, Sanders hosted the National Town Hall on Climate Change Solutions—featuring Bill McKibben, activist Van Jones, and Representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez—to introduce the Green New Deal to the world. While this event looked like a gathering of disparate groups throwing their support behind this new movement, it was actually a gathering of compatriots working together to promote their common agenda. Specifically:
DeKalb election day turnout approaching 46k, if these figures are accurate, putting it on track to surpass the general.

In the letter, obtained by The Associated Press, the delegation pleads that both sides not undermine each other.
In an era constrained by sustainability and affordability, a big house with a backyard should be a rarity. Much of California is straining under its own success: We have too many people and too few places for them to live, offered at too-high prices, in too many areas touched-by-climate-change-related menaces, like wildfires, all too far from where people work. And the solution is so painfully obvious it feels almost reductive to point it out: Make it legal to build more housing that houses more people.

Gerson continued that Harris and her Senate colleagues attempted to force the narrative that Americans can believe what they want in private, but can't act on that belief in the public square.
One person who seems particularly worried about the outcome, at least privately, is President-elect Joe Biden. According to a report Tuesday morning from Politico, the Democrat presidential candidate who became the first since Bill Clinton in the early 1990s to flip Georgia—Biden finished barely ahead of Trump on Nov. 3, and Trump contends he still won the state and that fraud led to Biden's victory—believes that both Warnock and Jon Ossoff will lose their races on Tuesday.
The massively disappointing reality (NB – this is not what remotely what Smith, Ricardo or Cobden had in mind…)
This need to use all our energy, including carbon fuels, becomes all the more apparent if it proves to be true that the earth is literally making more oil, coal, and gas—even as you read these words.
And at that point, that $59 billion in new oil money from the waters off Louisiana might come in handy. Yes, with new technology, it can be made as clean, but energy is energy, and so if the goal is to create more jobs and more wealth for people, then, for sure, we need to think hard about using all of it. That is, we must do the opposite of leave it in the ground. After all, we have a lot of children to educate, streets to protect, and elderly to take care of.
But Trump is unlikely to notice, let alone care. Most Americans just don't see climate change as a credible problem.
We might further observe that World War Two was many things—beyond, of course, the necessary and righteous defeat of fascism. World War Two was also about growing the economy; during the four years of fighting, America's GDP rose 48 percent. Of course, most of that growth went to war production, and yet even so, personal consumption rose 20 percent, as unemployment fell to one percent. Not bad.

Biden is asking Americans to override their sense of pandemic fatigue and recommit to wearing masks, practicing social distancing and avoiding indoor gatherings, particularly larger ones.

Well, maybe, but first, I would still maintain that he was the only hope of breaking that three-year post-referendum deadlock which nearly saw Brexit being cancelled; and second, I had rather hoped — especially under the guidance of an advisor like Dominic Cummings — that his pragmatism would come to the fore and he would have realised that the ONLY way of delivering on his promises for a revitalised post-Brexit Britain, for the working classes especially, was to ditch the green crap.

But that is a fight about allocation. McClintock focused on storage, noting that the cheapest and best way to solve the state's water problems — measured in cost per acre-foot — is to build more reservoirs rather than letting much of the state's rainfall run out to sea. McClintock reminded me that it has been 40 years since California's last dam, the New Melones Dam, was completed in 1978.

Complicating matters is the education levels of recently admitted refugees has plummeted, according to data analyzed by CIS. In 1996, only 35 percent of incoming refugees lacked a high school diploma. By 2015, the number had skyrocketed to 51 percent. The low educational attainment levels help explain why 56 percent of refugee households received food stamps or other government benefits in 2015.
Sanders has pledged a $16.3 trillion environmental plan that would declare climate change a national emergency and calls for the U.S. to move to renewable energy across the economy until 2050. Warren wants to spend $3 trillion over 10 years to move the U.S. to 100% clean energy. And both are aggressive supporters of the Green New Deal, a sweeping plan to combat climate change.
The new thinking focused on preservation, of both the land and the native people. Some of this new thinking was guilt about past ill-treatment of indigenous folk, leading to the present-day idea that they should remain in their environment, living as they always had. And some of it, too, was an emerging ecological consciousness; Amazonia is, undeniably, a fascinating and abundant region, and as such, it has become a preoccupation of Greens around the world.

This builds confidence and sense of entitlement and soon you end up with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Then suddenly when she enters Congress and her policies are examined by people on the Right, she thinks this is down to sexism. No. it's not your sex we have a problem with; it's the socialism.

Moreover, the majority of Europeans believe that the influx of immigrants into their respective countries will increase both the crime rate and the threat of terrorism. A majority of citizens (57 percent) said that the arrival of large numbers of immigrants will change the culture of their countries.
This brings projected global warming from being potentially dangerous to being easily manageable. Which is why, of course, it is unlikely to get much attention from a scientific establishment and a complicit media that much prefers to ramp up the global warming scare – even when the evidence doesn't support it.
Trump urging Republicans to get out the vote:
The successful government deal comes after Kurz was able to score a resounding victory in the Austrian national election in September of last year.
Biden, however, has shown no indication that he values religious freedom on the domestic front.
Can you imagine the scandalised response it would get from the BBC and most of the rest of the mainstream media?
There would be calls for Bercow's resignation; endless why oh why? editorials about the decline of parliamentary standards; indignant commentary that Parliament's sovereignty was being suborned by narrow cliques…
The argument over climate change has been raging for decades, and yet only in the past few years has it really gained momentum. The 2016 Democratic platform was ambitious; it called for getting 50 percent of our electricity from clean sources within a decade, and for reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 80 percent by 2050.

Further, Smith noted Biden's planned proposal will be the first true chance for the American people to see how the Biden Administration plans to pay for campaign promises and its plan to significantly raise taxes on working-class Americans to fund its agenda.
Green turtles are in fact remarkably widespread, and are found in tropical, subtropical and temperate waters around the world. They certainly are not dependent on a narrow set of weather conditions. In Australia alone, there are seven regional populations of green turtles that nest in different areas; the southern Great Barrier Reef, the northern Great Barrier Reef, the Coral Sea, the Gulf of Carpentaria, Western Australia's north-west shelf, the Ashmore and Cartier Reefs and Scott Reef. They have also been around for more then 100 million years, so the idea that they will all die out if it gets a bit warmer is palpable nonsense.

Still, the emerging skepticism is frustrating for a candidate who views his ties to the black community — built over decades in the Senate, and solidified by serving as the No. 2 to the first black president, Barack Obama — as a central pillar of his candidacy.
Enormous numbers of sub-Saharan Africans have said they would migrate immediately to Europe if they had the chance and are only held back by the seemingly insurmountable obstacles to doing so.

Although writer/director Adam McKay has managed to keep the fires of his hatred for Dick Cheney stoked a full decade after the former vice president left office, rather than serving as a constructive muse, this hatred is so blinding, so smug, so superior, McKay ends up revealing more about himself than his subject.
He and others argue that California can add to its storage capacity relatively easily — not just by building new dams, but expanding existing ones, such as the Shasta Dam, one of the major reservoirs in the federal Central Valley Project, which supplies water to farmers hundreds of miles south.
Meanwhile a study by Judith Curry and Nic Lewis – also largely unreported by the mainstream media – confirms what skeptics have been saying for years: that the computer models used by the alarmist establishment to predict global warming are running too hot.

At the same time, Hayhoe reportedly took no questions from climate change skeptics during her talk at the Edmonton conference.
The consequences of poor planning, and political infighting, have become clear — from a distance, at least for now. Across the ocean, the South African city of Cape Town, Africa's most advanced and cosmopolitan city, provides a new warning. Its population has doubled over the past two decades, but it has not built much new water storage capacity — thanks, in part, to the fact that the national government has authority over water and the local government is controlled by the opposition. As a result, the city nearly ran out of water in 2018, forcing severe restrictions on residents.
Macron heads Tuesday to Grand Bourgtheroulde, a small town in Normandy, where he is to meet about 600 mayors and local officials.
The 29-year-old deflected further, saying the government would pay for social programs the same way the government would fund the Space Force — all while refusing to break down how much taxpayer money would go towards each of her policy proposals.

In the course of his illustrious career, Ehrlich has defended mass sterilization, sex-selective abortion, and infanticide.

I have decided to run and will be making a formal announcement within the next week, Gabbard told CNN's Van Jones during an interview to air Saturday. There are a lot of reasons for me to make this decision. There are a lot of challenges that are facing the American people that I'm concerned about and that I want to help solve.
One, two, three degrees! It's a crime against humanity! they chanted, while a group at the head of the march held up a banner saying: Let's Change The System, Not the Climate.
As a senator, Harris voted against bills to protect the lives of babies who survive abortions and took to Twitter to tout her vote against a ban on abortions past the fifth month of pregnancy.
Given that no formal opposition was raised by environmentalists during the approval process for Sites, he said, he did not anticipate significant opposition from them — though they were skeptical the reservoir would provide the water promised. Watson said the project was consulting with environmental interests to allay those concerns, and to explore their thoughts about how the water should be managed once it had been stored, in the reservoir. He said the management process the project had developed would include local communities and Native American groups. And he added that the Sites Reservoir will have statewide reach by helping recharge depleted aquifers throughout California — an urgent necessity once the state's new groundwater management requirements go into effect in 2020.
In July 2018, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview with Family Research Council President Tony Perkins, also a member of the USCIRF, that the Trump administration was making the clarion call for religious freedom all around the world:
ROME — The Vatican has urged greater attention to migrants in the new year, inviting the faithful to see them as people who have been displaced like Jesus.
Gabbard's announcement comes after the progressive congresswoman was the headline speaker at a December meet-and-greet with Democrat activists in Exeter, New Hampshire, where she told local reporters that a White House bid was on the table. I'm seriously thinking of how I can best be of service to our country, she told Concord Monitor News reporter Paul Steinhauser before meeting with Rockingham County Democrats.
Germany has become increasingly tied with the communist regime, with China becoming the country's largest trading partner in 2018, with some €200 billion in trade. Merkel has argued that closer ties with China are the only way for the world to solve pressing issues, such as supposedly man-made climate change.
But Boris appears determined to outstrip that disappointingness on almost every conceivable level.
The other, Johnson, will be leading an economy which has chosen to prioritise virtue-signalling over efficiency, hobbled by any number of green targets, regulations, misallocations of capital and crony-capitalist boondoggles; crippled by needlessly high energy costs. And with his most able minister Michael Gove in charge — and rumoured to be the man chosen, inter alia, to head Britain's hosting of the COP26 climate summit — it's a racing certainty that Britain's green-managed decline will be handled with great efficiency.
While perhaps failing to observe the irony of its own reporting, the Times juxtaposed the thoroughly discredited population explosion theories of the 1970s with the (equally alarmist) global warming predictions of our day.
Smith said that Democrats want to strip the PAYGO provision to pass their progressive agenda.
If such dependency on a potential foe doesn't seem to be a good idea, that's because it isn't. The Trump administration has emphasized the need for domestic rare-earth production, but with distinctly limited success, at least so far. And so in the meantime, it would be enormously helpful if we could import rare earths from Brazil.
Most migrants are clever and hard-working. So their intense competition for jobs and housing lowers wages and inflates housing prices. The resulting housing crisis is most obvious in Manjoo's high-migration state of California:
6) Border cities south of Texas like Reynosa, Tamaulipas, have much lower murder rates than Tijuana. Despite the difference, average citizens are often touched by cartels including shootouts, kidnappings, and other violent activities.

The California Department of Water Resources notes: On average, California receives about 200 million acre-feet of water per year in the form of rain and snow. (It adds that the state rarely experiences an average year.) The state's reservoirs can capture about 42 million acre-feet of that — roughly one-fifth. The rest seeps into underground aquifers, or flows out to the sea.
Trump's Wall Won't Stop Climate Change Migrants from Streaming into the US
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) rushed to minimize the political damage — as well as the potential loss of funds — with a statement assuring the public that The President and his administration understand the severity of the devastation and have delivered for Californians.  He added: Republicans will offer an amendment to the Democrat's [sic] spending bills that will be voted on the floor this week to increase money for forest management that will help prevent and reduce the devastation from wildfires that we saw a couple months ago.
Trump's Mexican Border Wall Would Be an Ecological Disaster
The state's capital city of Sacramento, which sits at the confluence of the American and Sacramento Rivers, was inundated during the Great Flood of 1862, which turned enormous regions of the state into inland seas for months, Scientific American recalled. That event, and others like it, fueled enthusiasm for building dams.

This theory of the non-biological origins—abiogenesis–of oil goes back to the 19th century. And yet even today, among geologists, it's still a decidedly minority viewpoint. Still, every time we discover additional carbon-based fuel reserves, that's an indicator that we might be dealing with a lot more than just the remains of the Jurassic Period. (As an aside, we might observe that the debate over the origins of oil puts useful perspective on the question of whether or not there is truly such a thing as settled science.)
About 84,000 people turned out last weekend for the ninth straight round of anti-government demonstrations across France, according to the French Interior ministry.
Young has been a longtime critic of Trump, even lamenting his past use of his music.
If that is not baffling enough, after Cheney comes out of retirement to become vice president under George W. Bush (Sam Rockwell), he puts the UET to work, but only to protect the country from terrorists via the War on Terror — all of which McKay rages against in that same tired way Michael Moore did more than a decade ago.
Privately, Biden's team does not expect to win the races, according to Democratic officials, but they are more optimistic about their chances than they were weeks ago, Pager and Cassella wrote. Though the president-elect narrowly won the state in November, they attribute that to a powerful anti-Trump sentiment that did not translate down the ballot. Perdue received about 88,000 more votes than Ossoff, and the top two Republicans combined got more than 636,000 votes than Warnock in the special election. One former Democratic official said few Democrats, if any, are preparing for victory. It's not 'their organizing principle,' the official said of the incoming transition team, adding that their planning has focused on Democrats not having control of the Senate.
17) The decriminalization of marijuana and the production of higher quality plants in the U.S. versus Mexico had a series of unspoken consequences. After marijuana from Mexico was not able to compete with U.S.-grown plants, some cartels shifted their model more toward human smuggling–becoming a factor in the 2014 migrant crisis and the current one at the U.S. border.
He also pledged to invest £300 million to tackle nitrogen dioxide emissions in towns and cities, and we are investing £500 million to support the rollout of new rapid charging hubs so that [electric car] drivers are never more than 30 miles away from being able to charge up their car.
And it all ends with McKay blaming Cheney for everything wrong in the world, including the California wildfires, ISIS, and Trump — again in that tired Michael Moore style.
(Also, I'm sorry, but using insults like Nazi is just moronic. Apart from being inaccurate — there are plenty of more damning epithets you could reasonably use on Soubry — they're just a gift to the enemy. I'm reminded of those idiots you occasionally see being caught at Tommy-Robinson-type rallies giving Nazi salutes. Yes, we know guys that you're doing it sarcastically, in response to endless provocation from leftists doing Nazi salutes at you. But don't you realise: that's not how it's going to look after the footage has been edited?)
We don't have to take private jets from Palm Springs to the awards, please. I'll try to do better and I hope you will too, he said.
Despite the murky economic picture, Bloomberg is not only promising to accept more refugees, but he's also lashing out at those who disagree. Last month, during a campaign swing through Texas, the former mayor attacked Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX) for his decision to halt refugee resettlement.

The future president also chose as his running mate Sen.

Gabbard enters a 2020 Democrat primary field which will likely go into double-digits. On New Year's Eve, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) was the first serious Democrat presidential contender to launch a White House exploratory committee. Former Vice President Joe Biden and former Rep. Robert Francis Beto O'Rourke (D-TX) are also reportedly considering running for president.
The tragic fact is that as a credentialed scientist—a biologist lecturing at Stanford University—Ehrlich's proclamation of the end times as well as the means to confront them struck many as the plausible theory of an expert.
The water burst out through the spillway in a constant gush, a mad torrent of white, unstoppable and ferocious. It swept down the smooth concrete — then pounded into the new cracks in the failed spillway, sending a spray hundreds of feet into the air and carving a new chasm in the hillside.
It was Harris's office that collaborated with Planned Parenthood to produce legislation that would criminalize the CMP undercover journalists for publishing and distributing recordings of private communications with abortion providers in California.
The plan provides $50 billion to expand testing, which is seen as key to reopening most schools by the end of the new administration's first 100 days. About $130 billion would be allocated to help schools reopen without risking further contagion.

But I think that it's more than just having sets that are multicultural. I think that we have to really do the hard work to truly understand systemic racism.

Since then, the greens and the Democrats have upped the ante: In 2017, some Congressional Democrats introduced legislation eliminating carbon fuel emissions by 2035. More recently, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has rallied Democrats to the target of ending carbon emissions by 2030.
Green leader Kogler, meanwhile, stressed the importance for Austria to combat climate change and said that the pricing of Co2 will be implemented into what he called a greening of the tax system. He also proposed a nation-wide public transit ticket that would cost around three euros per day.
Like Donald Trump in North America, Jair Bolsonaro in South America is an experiment. Both are conservative economic nationalists, both promised during their campaigns to unleash prosperity. Both are challenging the entrenched forces of orthodoxy, including Green orthodoxy, at home and abroad:
In his 2015 teaching letter on the environment, Laudato Si, the Pope explicitly declared that the Church does not presume to settle scientific questions or to replace politics.
A few brave souls resisted the urge to jump on the population explosion bandwagon, urging calm and rationality. One was economist Julian L. Simon, who later noted that whatever the rate of population growth is, historically it has been that the food supply increases at least as fast, if not faster.
Although de Blasio's lawyers have not yet revealed their legal strategy for the lawsuit, they will have to show a connection between the actions of the oil firms and real material damages. Since a suit cannot be brought over hypothetical future damages based on climate prophecies, the legal team will be obliged to link the behavior of oil companies to real events — such as Hurricane Sandy.
During the 2016 Republican primary, and as that state's sitting governor, Kasich was only able to win with a plurality of Ohio votes. Other than Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) losing his home state to Trump, it does not get any more pathetic than that.
I don't think anybody wants a handout or a preferential treatment, he continued. Although that's what we give ourselves every year.

Within the coalition, Pablo Iglesias will serve as deputy prime minister, with a remit of combatting allegedly man-made climate change and reducing poverty under Spain's 2030 agenda, according to El Pais.
The deal — which was not done in consultation with the United States — is seen as a big diplomatic loss for the incoming Biden administration, which had promised to develop closer ties with the EU to counteract the rise of China as opposed to President Trump's tougher unilateral approach.
We can say that Brazil today is a bit like what the U.S. would be like if the land west of the Appalachian Mountains was mostly proscribed from economic development. (In fact, the U.S. federal government owns a prosperity-crimping 28 percent of the land in this country, although that's a tale for another time.)
In his inaugural address, Bolsonaro made it clear that his views haven't changed. For instance, pledging his strong support for the police and the military, he recalled the words Ordem e Progresso, emblazoned on his country's flag: The national motto is order and progress.

Given this reality—that people won't willingly stay poor while wealth sits under their feet—one might think that Western Greens would be well advised to work with Brazil, so that the nation's mineral wealth can be developed responsibly. That is, resources could be mined using best practices, such that environmental damage is minimized and then the land completely reclaimed. After all, mine reclamation has made huge advances; with proper techniques, the wealth can be extracted and the land made as good as ever.

Berman: You mentioned the hamilton premier in Puerto Rico over the weekend. Some Democratic officials were at that event — I think we have some pictures of it which we can show here. Do you think that the Democrats should have been down there watching a play, instead of working with the president to try to end the shutdown? Rosselló: Well, they were here also listening for over four hours. They had a hearing. This is the largest congressional delegation in the history of Puerto Rico, and I thank them for coming over here. I had an opportunity to explain to them the root cause of the problems in Puerto Rico. We had a discussion about the [Hurricane Maria] recovery, how some of the recovery's being stalled because of bureaucratic processes that are imposed in Puerto Rico that are not imposed elsewhere. How we need to start the rebuilding phase to be very effective, and how Puerto Rico can become a model, and how we're going to implement some of these core concepts that we value, such as tackling inequality, and battling climate change. But it is important underneath all of that, it's the reality that Puerto Rico, we are treated as second-class U.S. citizens. Because we're not a state, we — you know, we get a third of the federal funding for healthcare, for example.
In a 2012 episode of Fort Apache, Iglesias defended working for the theocratic regime in Tehran, saying: Who has been one of the fundamental allies of Hugo Chavez?

In calling for the rapid implementation of expensive policies, Gore was presumably highly confident about his alarming forecast.

Gore's warning of dangerous warming was based on the predictions of experts. Experts, however, have a poor record in forecasting. Politicians are not exceptions. As Winston Churchill observed, The most essential qualification for a politician is the ability to foretell what will happen tomorrow, next month, and next year, and then to explain afterwards why it did not happen.
While he has yet to officially announce steps towards launching a White House bid, O'Rourke and his inner circle are said to be courting political operatives in key battleground states and meeting with prominent Democrat figures as buzz continues to build around the progressive darling.

Transportation emissions overall make up the largest share of U.S. climate-damaging emissions, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Globally, air travel pumps out about 3% of overall emissions of climate-destroying carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. Surging growth of air travel in Asia and around the world means those emissions will triple by 2050, the United Nations says, and recent studies say even that figure underestimates the explosive growth of air travel and its emissions.

Another proposal is to build the Sites Reservoir in the foothills west of the small town of Maxwell, just over an hour north of Sacramento. As noted earlier, the Sites Reservoir would store 500,000 acre-feet of off-stream water, meaning that it would not dam an active river, but rather be a site for water from other sites to be stored as available and used as needed. Proponents argue that it would contribute to environmental quality as well as the state's storage capacity.
Stolyarov insisted the pranksters didn't want to influence the presidential race in the U.S. in any way. In previous years, the two have been accused of having ties to the Kremlin — a notion they have repeatedly denied.

Davos (Switzerland) (AFP) – US President Donald Trump on Tuesday lashed out at the perennial prophets of doom who warn that the world is in the throes of a major environmental crisis, as he addressed an audience in Davos including Swedish teenage campaigner Greta Thunberg.
The Trump administration could not have chosen a worse moment to attack the EU, Marieke Schaake, the vice-chair of the EU delegation, told the AP.

Unilaterally decarbonising it — as seems to be Johnson's and Gove's wizard plan; entirely uncosted as these 'a unicorn for every household' schemes always are — must surely count among the most suicidally pointless plan ever devised by any government in history, especially by one wearing the 'Conservative' tag.
While the comments have elicited some online mockery from her woke fanbase, the singer's greater sin appears to be the cover shoot for her recent album, Chemtrails Over the Country Club, which features a shot of the singer and her friends.

McClintock's office was well-apprised of the state of talks between the various parties, including outgoing Governor Jerry Brown and incoming governor Gavin Newsom. The two liberal Democrats asked the SWRCB to postpone its decision, originally scheduled for November, to Dec. 12 to leave time for voluntary agreements with local water authorities. (The day following my meeting with McClintock, the SWRCB voted to approve the Bay-Delta Plan, despite some agreements being reached.)
As the Intercept's Ryan Grim explained:
There was no collusion with Russia. There was not a shred of evidence. There was nothing he did wrong to be impeached — zip, zero, nada — and yet look at what they made of it. The news became what they wanted to be true, and because they wanted it to be true, they reported it as true. They're doing the same thing with the coronavirus. Just be patient. Just, you know, be in control. If it evolves and becomes something very bad, I am confident the United States will be prepared for it because we have competent people in these agencies now.
There is one main issue that is central to the rest, and that is the issue of war and peace, she continued. I look forward to being able to get into this and to talk about it in depth when we make our announcement.

There's a reason Barack Obama built an entire national campaign apparatus outside of the Democratic National Committee. There's a reason that, when he didn't activate or continue that, we lost House majorities. Because the party — in and of itself — does not have the core competencies, and no amount of money is going to fix that.
Under the Green New Deal, Congress must develop a plan for the transition of the United States economy to become carbon neutral by 2030. And to accomplish that, the U.S. will need to make big investments today to jump-start and develop new projects and sectors to power the new economy, which are estimated to be in the tens of trillions of dollars. Some of these activists are hoping to get that money by diverting the trillions of dollars needed to build and upgrade our current energy and transportation infrastructures to entirely rebuild the U.S. economy to suit their Utopian and unrealistic world view. With hundreds of state and local officials and likely 2020 presidential candidates signing on to support the Green New Deal, this campaign isn't going anywhere. And neither is its supporters' strong aversion to the oil and natural gas that has made the US a leader in affordable energy, environmental progress, and economic advancements.
It could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event, President Trump said of the killing. Maybe he did and maybe he didn't. In response, Gabbard wrote on Twitter that being Saudi Arabia's bitch is not 'America First.'

However, as we know, there are some who don't want any of this to happen. In the name of fighting climate change, some green environmentalists seek to, in the words of top-dog enviro Bill McKibben, leave it in the ground. Or, in the case of that new $59 billion worth of oil in the Gulf of Mexico, leave it under the water.
Russia and (President Vladimir) Putin has been very bad, as far as I know, on climate change. They have a lot of oil, oil is important for their economy, they make a lot of money on oil, Sanders explains.
Stolyarov added that Thunberg's name opens doors to everyone. Everyone, from presidents to street cleaners, are ready to talk to Greta Thunberg, he told the AP in a Skype interview.
What would win the general election, Sanders said, were not typical Democratic Party policies, but policies aimed at the working class, like a $15 per hour minimum wage and universal health care.
In early 2017, the Vatican invited Dr. Ehrlich to speak at an academic conference titled 'Biological Extinction, sponsored jointly by the Pontifical Academy of Science and the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences.
DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have spent the past year courting the Democratic Party's base with appeals to the working class and sweeping promises to curb climate change. But as they balance their responsibilities to participate in the Senate's impeachment trial and rally voters on the campaign trail, they're turning to private air travel, an option typically reserved for the elite and criticized as environmentally unfriendly.

Wood has presented himself a pro-Trump attorney, and while he has donated to Trump and Republicans this election cycle, his political donation history as previously revealed by Breitbart News paints a very different picture: He is a longtime Democrat donor having backed Democrats for office at the federal and state level in Georgia in particular for years and years. He also previously opposed Perdue, backing his Democrat opponent with financial contributions.

Armstrong's challenge was in response to Gore's warning of a looming dangerous tipping point in global mean temperatures.

The European Parliament passed a motion in December calling for access to the camps in Xinjiang, sanctions, and saying that no investment treaty should be struck which didn't include China ratifying human rights conventions, especially the convention on forced labour, and then the European Commission rams through this deal within days despite the European Parliament's wishes.

As reported by NBC last month, O'Rourke (D-TX) edged out former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in an early presidential straw poll conducted by progressive advocacy group MoveOn.org.

Sanders, who MoveOn endorsed in the 2016 Democrat presidential primary, scored 13.1 percent.
Sanders has generated enthusiasm from younger black voters in South Carolina. That could help him avoid a repeat of his dismal showing in the 2016 primary, when African Americans overwhelmingly backed Hillary Clinton.

We will increase taxes on pollution. Electricity is now a cleaner energy form than gas. Our climate change levy paid for by companies taxes electricity at a higher rate. So as another step towards equalising the rates and encouraging efficiency, from April 2022 I'm freezing the levy on electricity and raising it on gas, he announced.
To put this temperature drop in context, consider that this is enough to offset by more than half the entirety of the global warming the planet has experienced since the end of the 19th century.
A big chunk of Forsyth County (Atlanta exurbs) has come in and it's not awful for Republicans. But probably not quite what they needed to make up for deficits elsewhere. Forsyth County (87% reporting):
Right now, the Chinese communist government is blowing up the churches of evangelical Protestants, and now, what are we doing? asked Zmirak. We're siding with the government that's blowing up these people's churches and putting them in prison. I guarantee you, if this continues, in thirty or forty years, when Christianity is continuing to spread through China, Pope Francis is guaranteeing that it will be Protestant rather than Catholic. So, my Protestant friends, you should thank Pope Francis for guaranteeing that, eventually, China will be largest Protestant country on earth, not Catholic.

14) A partially secured border is more deadly than an open or well-secured one. Previous administrations put barriers south of most cities in Arizona and California to funnel illicit traffic into areas that were easier to manage or too desolate to cross. This led to a spike in deaths since the desire of people to reach the U.S. pushes them to more remote and dangerous areas.

Indeed, if we want a quick measure of which countries are rich and which aren't, we might view a nighttime map of the world.

In an odd decision when unemployment is extremely high among low-income Americans, the proposal shoehorns inthe long-term Democratic policy aim of hiking the minimum wage to $15 an hour. That is likely to make it harder for low-income Americans to find jobs, putting further strains on state budgets funding employment benefits.
Biden, who has long been known for his gaffes and lapses on the campaign trail, told an audience on Wednesday that ongoing impeachment trial was proof that President Donald Trump and Republicans were worried about him becoming the Democrat nominee.
Gervais kicked off the Golden Globes by telling the audience his fifth time hosting would be his last, then proceeded to deliver an expletive-laced skewering of Hollywood's elites.
The Secret Split in the Green New Deal
But since with the telegenic dancing congresswoman promoting it it's not going to go away, perhaps we'd do well to examine it in more detail.
Sanders said that Pruitt's replacement at the EPA, Andrew Wheeler, should be vigorously opposed.
The two-party leaders then met with leftist Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen, a former member of the Green Party, with Kogler telling the Austrian press that the entire programme for the new coalition was still being worked on.
In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in July in Little Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania, one that upheld a Trump administration rule exempting religious groups from Obamacare's contraceptive mandate, self-professed Catholic Biden vowed to reverse protections for religious groups such as the Little Sisters.

Mr. Sanders has embraced the title of socialist, putting himself to the left even of many democrats. On first winning election to the House of Representatives in 1990, he famously said, I am a socialist and everyone knows that.
True to his reputation, Gervais opened the show on Sunday with a mix of evisceration and exasperation, pretending to confuse Joe Pesci for Baby Yoda, calling the Hollywood Foreign Press Association racist, and declaring Netflix's takeover of Hollywood.

[Sorondo] is saying that they're defending the climate; they're avoiding reckless capitalism, said Zmirak. It's staggering. This is a country that still forces women to get abortions after their second child. This is the head of the Vatican's congregation for science and social sciences. He is saying that because the Chinese government is more responsible, supposedly, on climate change and because it doesn't allow capitalism, it's better than the United States.
Now, I completely understand why CNN (and the Washington Post and the New York Times and NBC News and the rest) would not hire Trump supporters. The media have an agenda. They want to drive Trump from office by any means necessary, including the use of violence, and will do anything to stop him from serving a second term or furthering his mandate.

On that occasion, the Pope also said that politicians had been distracted in implementing important measures to curb carbon emissions and blamed the sluggish adoption of COP21 protocols on an economy which seek profit above all else.
Democrats criticized the president, with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) — a likely presidential contender in 2020 — saying Trump should fight climate change, and Sen.

They voted Brexit to get rid of this venal, self-serving Establishment. And here's that venal, self-serving Establishment raising an elegant middle finger and saying to them: Swivel, plebs!
Those things will have to wait for a second bill that Biden says will be introduced in February, to also include measures, his advisers say, will combat climate change and advance racial equity.
More than 150,000 California residents are homeless, according to the latest counts.
According to Richard's analysis, the 485 new papers underscore the significant limitations and uncertainties inherent in our understanding of climate and climate changes, which in turn suggests that climate science is not nearly as settled as media reports and some policymakers would have people believe.

The reservoir system has a variety of purposes — and storage is just one of them. Many dams and reservoirs were built for flood control.
Because incubation temperature of turtle eggs determines the animal's sex, a warmer nest results in more females. Increasing temperatures in Queensland's north, linked to climate change, have led to virtually no male northern green sea turtles being born. For the study, scientists caught green turtles at the Howick Group of islands where both northern and southern green turtle populations forage in the Great Barrier Reef. Using a combination of endocrinology and genetic tests, researchers identified the turtles' sex and nesting origin. Of green turtles from warmer northern nesting beaches, 99.1% of juveniles, 99.8% of subadults, and 86.8% of adults were female. Turtles from the cooler southern reef nesting beaches showed a more moderate female sex bias (65%–69% female).

Climate change, Donna Laframboise reminds us, came in at 17, second from bottom of a long list including terrorism, a financially sound social security system, Medicare, and dealing with the poor and needy.

It includes a budgetary exemption for 'measures to prevent, prepare for, or respond to economic, environmental, or public health consequences resulting from climate change.'

7:20 PM: Breitbart's Matt Boyle on the ground in Georgia, citing a GOP campaign official with knowledge of the matter: In Hall County alone, there has been a massive increase in Election Day turnout–which significantly favors Republicans. In November, there were 15,000 approximately Election Day voters there. This time a huge surge to approximately 23,000. At an approximately 70-30 percent split favoring Republicans among Election Day voters, that represents thousands–maybe as many as 7,000 plus–extra votes for the GOP candidates this time in that one county alone as compared with November 2020. The GOP campaign source told Breitbart News that's just one county, and expect to see similar trends across the board in several others.
And yet, wistful though I may remain for my suburban-sprawl childhood, these days I find myself continually amazed and befuddled by my state's insane fetishization of an anachronistic model of urban development.

The Vatican just cut a deal with the collaborationist Chinese communist party-controlled Catholic church, said Zmirak. There's a real church, which has been underground and illegal since Mao Zedong, and then there's been kind of like a Vichy French collaborationist wing, where they work for the government. The government appoints the bishops. The government controls everything. The Catholic church always condemned that as a communist front group. The Vatican just made a deal with the communist front group that they are going to be regarded as the real church, and the underground church has to resign and just go join the communist church.
At the time of the challenge, Gore warned that the climate was warming at such a rate that, without immediate action, disasters would occur. His book Assault on Reason — published in April 2007 — stated that: Many scientists are now warning that we are moving closer to several 'tipping points' that could — within as little as ten years — make it impossible for us to avoid irretrievable damage of the planet's habitability for human civilization.
In an opinion piece for the globalist, establishment newspaper, the Financial Times, Gideon Rachman said that the European Union's claims that the deal will discipline the behaviour of the communist regime are in fact naive.
Merkel enthusiastically backed Macron a week later, calling for a real, true European army — the prospect of which was often dismissed as a dangerous fantasy by Remain campaigners in the run-up to the British vote to leave the bloc.
From Boyle in Atlanta: The crowd is ecstatic now as Loeffler takes her first lead of the night over Warnock.
What we have got to do now, Sanders said, is to see if we can get a handful of Republican senators to understand that climate change is real, that environmental protection is enormously important for this country, and get them on board to demand that Trump appoint an EPA administrator who represents the American people and not just the fossil fuel industry.
To be a socialist, said Sanders, in the sense of what the Pope is talking about, what I'm talking about, is to say that we have got to do our best and live our lives in a way that alleviates human suffering, that does not accelerate the disparities of income and wealth.

Sanders has made a $5.5 million ad buy in states that include South Carolina. Steyer has hired the chair of South Carolina's Legislative Black Caucus to serve as an adviser, a $10,000-per-month gig that drew criticism among those who found it curious that a campaign would be paying a state lawmaker while receiving his endorsement.
For decades, policymakers have debated whether to build new reservoirs. One project, the Auburn Dam, was authorized by Congress in 1965 for flood control, but later abandoned over structural and environmental concerns. Numerous other proposals have been studied for decades, with little progress at the state or federal level — though local authorities have built their own projects, such as the Los Vaqueros Reservoir in the East San Francisco Bay, one of the few projects environmentalists have not opposed (though many have since opposed its expansion.)

The European Union has defended its decision to plough through with the deal by likening the supposed concessions from China made in the EU agreement with the phase-one trade deal signed by the Trump administration. Brussels has argued that the deal represents the bloc's strategic autonomy.
Moral of the story: There has never been any evidence that climate change is a top concern for most Americans. This is not a crowd pleaser or a vote getter.
To critics of dams, especially among environmentalists, the events at Oroville Dam were further proof of the dangers of dams and reservoirs — which, they argued, stored water only at great cost to nature and great risk to human life.

Put simply, researchers such as Marlene Kretschmer – the expert from the Potsdam Institute heavily quoted in the New York Times piece – are trying to pin recent cold winters on movements of the jet stream. This enables them to promote their global warming is still happening narrative. But for it to work it requires them to write off the recent cold winters, such as the one in 2013/14, as being anomalous – ie abnormally cold.
6:15 PM: Warnock and Ossoff doing last-minute campaigning:
Steyer, meanwhile, is flooding the South Carolina airwaves with millions of dollars in ads, building a robust staff and making numerous visits, including on Sunday and Monday, while Biden and others are in New Hampshire. The approach appears to have paid off: His support grew significantly in a Fox News poll last month, consistent with a steady momentum of endorsements that began in the final weeks of 2019.
This is a temptation present in our world, understandable because it is part of our nature, he said.
Streisand accuses the Trump administration of botching its response to the deadly Chinese coronavirus and claims the president stole credit for his red hot economy from former President Barack Obama. In contrast to Streisand's assertions, Dr. Marc Siegel, professor of medicine at New York University, has said the administration has addressed earlier emerging contagion better than the previous administrations.
Still, Biden is being outspent and sometimes outmaneuvered by rivals with deeper pockets.
Nonetheless, the singer-songwriter also took issue with Trump continuing to use his music at his famous MAGA rallies.
Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron are set to deepen Franco-German ties by signing a twinning treaty which has been criticised as an erosion of national sovereignty.
So it's entirely likely that we'll be in a political standoff: if not after the 2020 elections, then sometime soon enough. On the one side will the greens, and on the other side will be the carbons. Who will win in the end? There's no way to know, of course, but the greens' losing fight with France's yellow jackets should give them pause.

Shantytown-caliber poverty is non-existent in China, said Sorondo, following a state-supervised visit to the authoritarian country.
That would be perfectly fine with many environmental groups, for whom opposition to dams has become something of an article of faith over the past several decades. Dams were once thought to provide an environmentally-friendly source of renewable energy, through hydroelectric power. But they destroy whatever habitat finds itself submerged by reservoirs; impede fish migration; and — if managed poorly — create new hazards, such as mechanical failure.
What we are going to do is take on the health care industry and their $100 billion in profits and move this country toward 'Medicare for All', he declared.
A self-professed Catholic, as vice president, Biden did nothing to interfere with former President Barack Obama's pro-abortion agenda. In fact, his plans to defend abortion rights will undermine the beliefs of the majority of Americans of faith.

On the Iranian backed-programme, Iglesias praised Chinese dictator Mao Zedong as astute, declining to mention the 60 million deaths that occurred under Mao's brutal reign. In another episode, he also lionized the Colombian terrorist group FARC, despite the guerillas being responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths.
So let me ask again, why add an unnecessary voice to an already overstaffed chorus, someone who will be lost in the cacophony?
Indeed, with a bit of whimsy, one might even ask: If Mother Nature is giving us a gift, should we not feel an obligation to accept it? Surely we wouldn't want to offend her by refusing such a gift. After all, as the classic TV commercial from the 70s, warned us, It's not nice to fool Mother Nature.
The lack of will has less to do with engineering challenges, he maintains, than it does with politics, bureaucracy, and lawsuits by radical environmentalist groups.

The whole idea that Kasich might challenge Trump in 2020 for the Republican nomination is the biggest pile of fake news ever shoveled.
In September 2018, Ocasio-Cortez deflected CNN host Jake Tapper's question about how she would pay for $40 trillion in government programs like Medicare for All.
We've never seen any administration, which could match its record, so Catholics will have to weigh all of these decisions along with many other issues, he explained, emphasizing that not all issues are weighed equally by the Church.
But one thing we can say for sure about World War Two: It wasn't green. That is, all those factories, all those oil pipelines, all that technology—it was the opposite of the Al Gore worldview. (Or should we say, the world that Al Gore wants for us.)
That foreshadows California's grim fate — if it cannot find solutions now.
According to McKay, Cheney's decades-long obsession to fulfill his destiny through the UET was all about being able to drop bombs and water board a handful of terrorists. To what end? It's like watching the kid in Christmas Story deliberately destroy his Red Ryder BB gun after scheming for months to get his hands on it.
Needless to say, the thought of digging up Amazonia in pursuit of minerals is horrifying—horrifying, that is, to Western environmentalists. Yet for their part, Brazilians seem okay with it; after all, they just voted Bolsonaro into office. As this author has argued in the past, if a resource is sitting there, it only makes sense that hungry people will wish to see it utilized. Green elites may sentimentalize poverty as living in harmony with nature, but the poor would rather have refrigerators, automobiles, and good health care.
Yet Brazilians will likely judge Bolsonaro on that most familiar of metrics: the economy. The country is, after all, poor—it ranks 110th in the world—and it shouldn't be.

If Kasich does challenge Trump for the nomination in 2020, it will be a total vanity project because his campaign is a non-starter.
Manjoo does not entirely break the media taboo against mentioning the harms caused by mass migration. But he gets close by blaming California's crisis on too many people:
Viewed from a small airplane above the Oroville Dam — at 770 feet, the highest in the U.S. — in March 2017, the future of water storage in California looked doubtful. That year, California's deep drought was broken by record rainfall, filling that dam and many others.
Never before has there been such a clear need for science to be at the service of a new global ecological equilibrium, Francis told his audience, while painting a picture of a world on the verge of ecological collapse and a consequent increase of poverty and social exclusion.
For perspective, we might interject that today, carbon fuels—oil, gas, and coal—account for 77.6 percent of U.S. energy consumption. And that's all supposed to go to zero in 11 years? Hmmm.

But soon after, the #NoDAPL protests at Standing Rock—which were supposed to galvanize public support behind the Keep It in the Ground movement and usher in the dawn of the post-fossil fuel era—turned violent. Recognizing that extreme activism was not generating the public support they needed to upend U.S. energy policy, the leaders of the KIITG movement made a deliberate decision to change their tactics. Almost overnight, orchestrated militant actions were replaced with promises of guaranteed green jobs for all. Since then, Sanders and Rep. Huffman have abandoned the Keep It in the Ground campaign entirely and instead now publicly and enthusiastically endorse the Green New Deal.
With warming global temperatures and most sea turtle populations naturally producing offspring above the pivotal temperature [14], it is clear that climate change poses a serious threat to the persistence of these populations.
Crucially, the Sites Reservoir appears to have some startup funding. As much as half of the money will come from a special water bond passed by voters in Proposition 1 of 2014, which set aside $2.7 billion (of $7.5 billion) for water storage projects. The rest of the project would theoretically be funded by long-term contracts for water not reserved for public use.

The baffling mystery is how Ehrlich—despite his utterly failed forecasts—can continue to be hailed today as a serious scientist with something important to say to the world.
We only ask how we pay for it on issues of housing, health care, and education, Ocasio-Cortez said. How do we pay for it? With the same exact mechanisms that we pay for military increases for this Space Force, for all of these ambitious policies.
Yet if fairly dividing the pie is important, strongly expanding the pie is even more important. There's wealth in Brazil, but not nearly enough of it—at least not now.
As Isabel Hardman observes at the Spectator, Bercow has become a law unto himself.
Every day, he takes another swipe at the pillars of our democracy, but we cannot allow him to irrevocably change this country, the Meet the Fockers star adds. The 'beacon of hope' that is America could be extinguished if he's given another four years.
McKay had $60 million to work with and plenty of time to study Cheney. Rather than use those resources to explain what made Cheney tick, McKay chooses instead to hurl rocks at all of the bullet points on Cheney's Wikipedia page.
I understand it, he said of trying to live progressive values at all times, but the reality is, there's a big risk of being perceived as being an ideologue and not a problem-solver.
He added there is a need to re-imagine the way nations cooperate, before warning We need a networked multilateralism, bringing together the U.N. system, regional organisations, international financial institutions and others. And we need an inclusive multilateralism, drawing on the indispensable contributions of civil society, business, cities, regions and, in particular, with greater weight given to the voices of youth.
Some climate advocates said they weren't bothered by the private travel, especially because they view a more carbon-conscious administration as a far better result for the climate than four more years of Trump in the White House.
In a letter to be sent to members of U.S. Congress on Wednesday, the delegation for U.S. relations criticized the increasingly harmful approach from the White House, and condemned the demotion of the EU ambassador to the U.S. in the largely ceremonial Diplomatic Order of Precedence to the bottom of the list. Germany's Deutsche Welle reported that the State Department had made the change at the end of last year without notifying Brussels.
There is only one Senator Bernie Sanders carrying on the tradition of FDR; carrying on the tradition of that freedom fighter, Eugene Debs; carrying on the tradition of Mother Jones; carrying on the tradition of Fannie Lou Hamer … carrying on the tradition of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. … carrying on the tradition of Cesar Chavez.

This all sounds very worrying, until you realize that the study was actually co-produced by the WWF itself, probably with a view to reaching this conclusion:
According to Politico, the de Blasio administration is suing for reparations from Sandy damages, and seeks to force the companies to pay for the city's resiliency efforts, which have taken years to complete since 2012, when the storm devastated the city, killing 53 people across the state costing more than $19 billion.
Brazil's new president, Jair Bolsonaro, was sworn in on January 1. He won a landslide election in October on a platform that's pro-business, pro-gun, pro-United States, and pro-Israel. At the same time, his platform was also anti-crime, anti-political correctness, anti-Cuba, and anti-Venezuela.
16) Mexican transnational criminal groups and their leaders have grown beyond the size and power of the American mafia from Prohibition Era and Al Capone. Cartels are integrated into the Mexican political culture and bureaucracy. Legalization would not stop them.
Rep. Jason Smith (R-MO), the House Budget Committee ranking member, offered a motion to commit on the Democrats' rules package for the 117th Congress. The motion to commit would strike the Democrats' provision that creates an exemption for climate-related legislation for the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) restriction on spending. PAYGO mandates that new spending is either offset by a payfor such as tax increases or spending cuts. Democrats blocked the motion.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard says she will run for president in 2020. I have decided to run and will be making a formal announcement within the next week, the Hawaii Democrat and Iraq War veteran told CNN's @VanJones68 https://t.co/5BzVi2JMFq pic.twitter.com/nNNmGCED5C — CNN (@CNN) January 11, 2019
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), an Iraq War veteran who made history in 2012 as the first Hindu elected to Congress, said Friday she will run for president in 2020.
But because Bercow's dirty tricks are in accord with where most of the Establishment is on Brexit — i.e. wanting it derailed by whatever means necessary — you're scarcely going to hear a peep of protest…
What's best for all of us is electrifying enough people … who will go to the polls, said Myers, who is black. I don't think honestly that Joe Biden can electrify the 400,000 African Americans in the state of South Carolina.
McKay blames Cheney for leaking Valerie Plame's name when an exhaustive investigation proved that was not true. He even blames Cheney for coming up with the term Climate Change because it sounds less alarming than Global Warming — an audacious lie when we all know the left made the change after Jesus made it snow every time Al Gore made a speech.
The governors' real priority, some skeptical observers claimed, was to secure enough water for the California Waterfix — the Twin Tunnels project that will divert water from the Sacramento River under the California Delta to be pumped south.
Lana Del Rey told BBC1 Radio that the Trump administration needed to happen in order to reveal the true problems with the world.
8:59 PM: According to CNN, 90% of the current vote is early vote. Early vote is expected to be 72% of the current vote.
Obama's green jobs program was a notable failure, with many investments failing to pay off — most notoriously the solar panel company Solyndra, which failed after Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and others held it up as a model.
On only day two of the 117th Congress, House Democrats are already attempting to strip Americans of the transparency they deserve in order to push through an expensive progressive wish-list, Smith said.
Sites Reservoir … reduces the flood potential of the Sacramento River … and it allows the entire Central Valley system, all the other major dams in the north — Trinity, Shasta, Oroville, and Folsom — to rebalance … [A]s much as 3 million more acre-feet of water can be stored in Trinity, Shasta, Oroville and Folsom because they don't have to prevent flooding of Sacramento and other downriver communities, rebalancing the system. A similar proposal to raise the height of the Shasta Dam has a similar purpose, as would Temperance Flat on the San Joquin River near Fresno.

Ocasio-Cortez has historically not been shy in criticizing her party's leadership. In November, she blamed Democrat incompetence for the election losses. She told the Times:
It's still unclear how the new administration will address the issue of vaccine hesitancy, the doubts and suspicions that keep many people from getting a shot. Polls show it's particularly a problem among Black Americans. It's important to acknowledge the reasons why it exists and work to earn trust and build vaccine confidence in communities, said Gracia.

Since the end of the Little Ice Age in the 1880s, the planet has warmed by about 0.8 degrees C. You might think that was not a particularly drastic rate of warming to worry about. You might also note that such a rate of warming is well precedented in periods throughout history, such as during the Minoan, Roman and Medieval warming periods. Nonetheless this 0.8 degrees C rise – 0.9 degrees C, at a push – is the terrible climatic event the alarmist establishment has been assuring these last few decades is the worst thing ever and something that should worry us awfully.

Anything to advance the leftist agenda. Now, the leftist agenda includes getting rid of Trump. They would love for the coronavirus to be this deadly strain that wipes everybody out so they could blame Trump for it. Don't doubt me on that. If you've been paying attention to the mainstream media for the past four years, you can't doubt me on that. They haven't reported one thing true about these supposed Trump scandals.
About $20 billion would be allocated for a more disciplined focus on vaccination, on top of some $8 billion already approved by Congress. Biden has called for setting up mass vaccination centers and sending mobile units to hard-to-reach areas.
I've been handling these emerging contagions for about 20 years now, and I have to tell you, I've never seen one handled better, said Dr. Siegel told SiriusXM's Breitbart News Sunday.
Virtually every Labour MP in the Commons, formerly proud advocates of women's and workers' rights to workplaces free from bullying, chose to suspend that particular principle last year when serious accusations against the Speaker, from more than one reliable source, emerged. Normally – and especially if such allegations had involved a Conservative minister – Labour would have demanded immediate action. But in Bercow's case – as lucidly explained by Dame Margaret Beckett MP – the cause of opposing Brexit trumps any less important issue such as the rights of Commons members of staff.
No one is arguing against increasing productive capacity to go alongside increasing public investment. This is literally what we did to mobilize for World War 2, and @AOC has referenced that multiple times when talking about the economics of a Green New Deal.
An ad released in the final hours of the campaign on Monday squarely focused on trying to split Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) from President Donald Trump. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, squaring off with President Trump, a narrator says at the opening of the ad. Expected to appoint Kelly Loeffler to the open U.S. Senate seat.
One of the pope's right-hand men, Archbishop Sorondo from South America, he is the head of the Vatican's office on science and social sciences. He actually said a couple of days ago that China does a better job living out Catholic social teachings than the United States, said Zmirak.
That bullet-pointed horror show I've just outlined above: it's like a fantasy wish-list come true for all the things that people who voted Remain would have liked to happen to Britain but would never have dared hope could happen.
Dolezal notes that California uses an average of about 80 million acre-feet of water per year, and over the past two decades, roughly half of that is preserved for environmental use — dropping to 40% in the most recent drought, with agriculture using just over 40%, in both wet and dry years.
This isn't the first time Del Rey has fought off a woke cancel mob.
Trans-Atlantic relations have steadily worsened since Trump became president two years ago.
Loeffler and Perdue, in a joint statement, say the election will very close.
That is a stark contrast to the priorities of voters elsewhere in the country. According to a Gallup poll released earlier this week, Democrats nationwide consider health care the most important issue, followed closely by gun control and climate change. Overall, healthcare, national security, gun policy, education and the economy were cited as extremely important by over 30% of adults in the poll.
The United Nations migration agency (IOM) has posted an upbeat Easter message celebrating international migration as not only inevitable, but also necessary and desirable.
While a majority of evangelicals continue to question the existence of human-caused climate change, Hayhoe is not completely alone. Groups like the Evangelical Environmental Network, the Evangelical Climate Initiative, and Young Evangelicals for Climate Action have adopted similar programs.
Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexey Stolyarov, who have fooled many high-profile victims around the world, posted a recording of the phone call on YouTube on Thursday.
Professor Lessig told MSNBC on Sunday that President Trump himself is a national emergency, and that he is using words that have no connection to reality.
Since the start of his presidency, Trump has upset the decades-old tight relationship between Washington and the EU, slapping steel tariffs on EU imports, threatening tariffs on cars, ditching a deal the two sides have negotiated with Iran to contain its nuclear threat, and walking away from a global climate agreement pushed by the EU.
Ideas have practical consequences, and Dr. Ehrlich did not leave his followers guessing as to what they ought to be.
Australia and the Australian Government will set our policies based on Australia's national interests, on what Australia needs to do, Morrison told reporters in the rural center of Mudgee.
Unfortunately, in our own times, millions of families can identify with this sad reality. Almost every day the television and papers carry news of refugees fleeing from hunger, war and other grave dangers, in search of security and a dignified life for themselves and for their families, Francis said.

But the private planes present unique issues for Warren and Sanders. As the leading progressive voices in a crowded Democratic primary, they often criticize rivals they deem insufficiently loyal to those values. The sudden use of private travel is an example of how ideological rigidity can sometimes collide with White House aspirations.
The announcement comes after Thunberg scolded globalist leaders at the World Economic Conference in Davos, Switzerland, earlier this month.
The corruption, the abuse of process, the partisanship, the betrayal of the democratic process, the lies, the cant, the play-acting, the skullduggery have been so shameless and blatant as to beggar belief.
Tuesday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh speculated the media were pushing the coronavirus doom-and-gloom narrative as a way to hurt President Donald Trump.

The gaffe comes as the Iowa caucuses head to a finish, while simultaneously the impeachment trial continues to move forward in the Senate. Biden, who once led his rivals by double digits in the first caucus state, has fallen behind Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), with some speculating he may not place high enough to receive a single delegate.
Environmentalists have made no secret of their opposition to the Sites Reservoir. The Sierra Club has cast the project as a fatal threat to the Sacramento River, declaring:
At a meeting of climate scientists at Oxford in 2012, one participant argued that, given the insufficient observational data and the coarse and mathematically imperfect climate models used to generate attribution claims, they are unjustifiably speculative, basically unverifiable and better not made at all.
Combined with other environmental restrictions on land use, Amazonia has become something of a giant national park, and that fencing off of resources has helped to impoverish the nation. And, of course, nobody is poorer than the indigenous tribes; one wonders if people living in huts are really happy living that way—and many do, in fact, flee.
I will make that decision at the appropriate time, Sanders said.
And who exactly was the mysterious figure seen leading the insults against Soubry and filming her but then caught on camera passing something to her chief of staff, rather suggesting that they knew one another?
It was also revealed earlier this month that much of Thunbergs social media posts on Facebook are not actually written by her personally, but rather by her father, Svante Thunberg, or Adarsh Prathap, an Indian climate change activist.
Michael Gove – the most powerful figure in the UK government after Boris Johnson – has made a speech berating President Donald Trump for not doing enough about 'climate change.'
He added that Trump does not represent the character and people in the USA that I have come to know and love.
The African American vote cannot be taken for granted, said Thigpen. Just the idea that we are a firewall, that our vote is already cemented. … I won't go so far as to say it's offensive, but I think it might be misconceived.
In January of this year, author Kenneth Richard conducted a broad survey of climate change literature for 2017 and found that the alleged consensus behind the dangers of anthropogenic global warming is not nearly as settled among climate scientists as people imagine.
Republic of Thirst is a three-part series made possible by a generous fellowship from the Robert Novak Foundation. Part I of examined the debate over how California's scarce water resources should be allocated. Part III will examine whether those resources can be expanded through technological innovations like desalination. Part II examines whether more can be done to store and manage the water that falls naturally on the Golden State.
We have been poisoning air, land and water – and filling oceans with plastics. Now, nature is striking back: temperatures are reaching record highs, biodiversity is collapsing, deserts are spreading, [and] fires, floods and hurricanes are more frequent and extreme… We are extremely fragile. […] Pandemic recovery is our chance to change course. With smart policies and the right investments, we can chart a path that brings health to all, revives economies and builds resilience and rescues biodiversity.
Rep. Jason Smith (R-MO), the House Budget Committee ranking member, sent a letter to Joe Biden transition chair Ted Kaufman, noting Biden's first budget will expose the 46th president's plans to raise taxes on working-class Americans.
With the new proposals comes a call to redouble efforts on the basics.
Many nations—including the United States—began attaching population control measures to aid packages to third-world countries, meaning that the amount of aid received became conditioned by the state's ability to coercively reduce its own population.
And at the end of the day, no one in this race can or should win the nomination without proving they have sweeping support from African American voters, she said. Vice President Biden is the only candidate who has already done so.
Van Jones , who served as President Obama's environmental adviser and who wrote The Green Collar Economy, was hand-picked by McKibben to be one of only 20 messengers for 350.org, who acted as global spokespeople espousing 350.org's Keep It in the Ground philosophy.
Eliminating the PAYGO provision serves as a significant victory for progressives, as leftists would have had to find significant savings or tax increases to pay for an expensive climate change program such as the Green New Deal. Some estimates have found that the Green New Deal could cost $93 trillion.
The treaty is set to be signed in the German city of Aachan, which lies on the multi-nation border with Belgium and the Netherlands, on January 22nd, and the agreement will be ratified at both the French and German parliaments.
Cooper asked Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described Democratic Socialist, how she would pay for the trillions of dollars in government programs she supports. But instead of laying out a plan for how she would pay for the programs, Ocasio-Cortez deflected Cooper's question.

Vice is nowhere near as awful as W., Oliver Stone's disastrous George W. Bush biopic, but at the very least, Stone tried to understand and explain his subject. All McKay wants to do is make his rich Hollywood friends laugh, and not just at Cheney, but the stupid American people who allowed him to become vice president.
Buttigieg's, Biden's and Bloomberg's campaigns all say they are also paying for carbon offsets.
Following the financial struggles of his own media company, Left Hand Media, Iglesias was picked by Iranian owned and funded Spanish language network HispanTV, on which he began hosting Fort Apache, a television programme that provided a platform for his leftist ideology.

After The Big Short, McKay's successful turn to serious movie-making, I had high hopes for Vice, that it would be something closer to Stone's underrated Nixon. Unfortunately, McKay uses the irreverent formula that made The Big Short so memorable to own Cheney, and the results are alternately ham-handed (fishing lures and heart removals as metaphors), hollow (it's a movie filled with impersonations, not characters), and laughably dishonest.
On Monday, Newsom took the oath of office and then delivered a fiery speech promising to offer an alternative to the corruption and incompetence in the White House. It was a gratuitous swipe at Trump that made headlines and seemed to backtrack on the progress the two made during Trump's visit to wildfire-stricken regions in November.
Pope Francis took a strong stand on anthropogenic climate change Monday, telling a gathering of diplomats in the Vatican that global warming is a result of human action.
The relationship between population growth and housing demand is clear. More people means more demand for housing, and fewer people means less demand. … As a result, a shrinking population will lead to falling prices and a deteriorating, vacancy-plagued housing stock that may take generations to clear. … The potential for skilled immigrants to boost local housing markets is clear. Notably, economist Albert Saiz (2007) found a 1% increase in population from immigration causes housing rents and house prices in U.S. cities to rise commensurately, by 1%.

The bet was monitored monthly using satellite data on lower troposphere temperatures from researchers at the University of Alabama at Huntsville. In contrast to surface data, these satellite data cover the whole Earth, are fully disclosed, and are not contaminated by poor maintenance and location of weather stations, changes from mercury to electronic measurement, and unexplained adjustments.

Biden's standing in South Carolina has long gone unquestioned, so much so that two prominent black candidates — Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey — dropped out of the race in part because Biden's strength in the state created insurmountable barriers.
His demand for suburbia's death comes after he helped to make suburbia expensive by urging more immigration.

The plan comes as a divided nation is in the grip of the pandemic's most dangerous wave yet. So far, more than 385,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the U.S. And government numbers out Thursday reported a jump in weekly unemployment claims, to 965,000, a sign that rising infections are forcing businesses to cut back and lay off workers.
Kurz has been critical of migration policies within the European Union since forming the previous government with the populist Freedom Party.

The idea that the Chinese Communist Party will live up to the goal of abolishing slave labour appears to stand in direct contradiction to actual CCP policy, however, as the country has been accused of building factories in at least 135 concentration camps in the Xinjiang region, alone.
So that leaves open the question, if Trump is telling his supporters to vote, who is telling his supporters not to vote? Well, in addition to the actual Democrat candidates—as evidenced by the new Warnock ad—it's Democrats, as Breitbart News has previously reported earlier in the campaign, and it's also Never Trumpers at the Lincoln Project who are basically Democrats at this stage.
The socialist Prime Minister of Spain narrowly won a vote of confidence in parliament, allowing him to form a coalition government with Pablo Iglesias, a hard-leftist and former Iranian state television host who praised communist dictator Mao Zedong.

Late last year, Germany called on France to give up its seat to the EU so the bloc could speak with one voice — a request France rejected. Germany began her two-year stint in the Security Council as one of ten non-permanent members in January, with Mrs Merkel telling her country in her New Year's address that she would keep pushing for global solutions to the world's problems, including mass migration and climate change.
But critics say these dams would achieve little for storage, while hurting fish populations and destroying Native American heritage sites. They call such projects vampire dams — because they so often rise from the dead after being rejected by state leaders, one wrote recently.
The state's largest water reservoir — by far — is the natural reservoir provided by its Cascades and Sierra Nevada Mountain Range snowpack.

The perception of the causes of migration has also changed, as a majority of Europeans are now convinced that most migrants are attracted to Europe by pull factors such as the EU's economy and social benefits, rather than propelled by push factors such as wars, poverty or climate change.
It's also like a checklist of pretty much all the things that Brexit voters — and working-class voters especially — loathe with a vengeance.
As scientists themselves are beginning to recognize, doomsday theories—including those surrounding global warming—must learn to factor in the astounding resilience of human intelligence and the ability of human beings to react to changing scenarios in remarkably ingenious ways.
Delingpole: Greta Thunberg's Dad Writes Her Facebook Posts https://t.co/6D9tTROq1g — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 14, 2020
As Breitbart News reported, last June he said the world needs an overarching level of multilateral governance that can sideline problematic national interests as he lamented existing U.N. instruments such as the Security Council have teeth but show little or no appetite to bite.
Europeans have also expressed concern over the rapid population growth of Muslims in Europe and 70 percent of those interviewed said they believe that a growing Muslim presence is a problem. A mere 8 percent believe that the increased Muslim presence is no threat at all.
Our system of government has one President and one Administration at a time, Vought noted in a December letter to Kaufman.
The actor concluded by invoking the systemic racism that he said lies at the heart of the entertainment industry.

1) No one is proposing a wall between all of Mexico and the U.S.—the U.S. southern border is approximately 2,000 miles. The discussion is about 1,000 miles of physical barriers in regions that are heavily controlled by drug cartels.
That has to change, she told several thousand protesters, adding in a message to world leaders: This is just the beginning. You haven't seen anything yet. We assure you of that!.
MOSCOW (AP) — Russian pranksters claim they called U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders pretending to be climate activist Greta Thunberg and offered Thunberg's support to his campaign.
The shock troops of the Green New Deal are known as the Sunrise Movement, which sounds like a new thing but it's not. It's simply a repurposed version of an old, failed campaign of 350.org's – the college divestment network.
The proposal includes an even larger amount of funds for state and local governments, schools, and colleges. Biden's plan provides for $350 billion in state and local government aid and another $170 billion for K-12 schools and colleges.
The Chinese government attaches great importance to the accident, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang.
Are these states, and their elected officials, ever going to submit meekly to some green dictate that says leave it in the ground? That doesn't seem likely. And will lawmakers from, say, Louisiana—seeking to defend the new $59 billion worth of newly discovered oil, on top of the previously discovered $2.61 trillion, still waiting to be tapped—find a way to make constructive political alliances with those from states that don't produce energy, but merely consume it? That does seem likely.
Ocasio-Cortez – Occasional Cortex, as she's known, because she's so thick she doesn't even know how stupid she is – is the lipstick, obviously.
As well as taxing pollution, we will cut tax and invest in clean transport, he said, stating the government will present reforms to make it cheaper to buy lower- or zero-emission vehicles.
You'd have to strip out your gas cooker and your gas boiler and replace them with new, much more expensive electric versions
Prior to the signing of the agreement, Mr Biden's national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, had said that the administration would welcome early consultations with our European partners on our common concerns about China's economic practices.
Homelessness is the number one issue for California voters heading into the 2020 presidential primary in March, according to a new poll by the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC), as reported by the Sacramento Bee.
20) A cartel's power in Mexico comes not from kingpins, but from politicians, financiers, lawyers, and money launderers. U.S. authorities and diplomats routinely focus on kingpins such as El Chapo and his lieutenants, but never go after the rest of the circle.
Yep. It's true that mostly liberals are affected by this – and created this mess. But still, liberals' children feel the cold as badly as conservatives' children. In fact, being less robust and more snowflakey, probably even more so. Must they really suffer for their parents' stupidity?
Though smaller than nature's own reservoir, California's system of man-made reservoirs is vast — and complex. The Public Policy Institute of California notes that state and federal agencies manage 240 large reservoirs that account for 60% of the state's storage capacity, with the rest of the state's reservoirs owned and operated by local water agencies, or by private entities for use on private lands.
We must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse, said Trump, hours after Thunberg told the World Economic Forum that governments had done basically nothing to reverse climate change.
In her caption, she offered support to bushfire victims and then took aim at what she called the Australian government's lack of action on climate change.
Ehrlich prophesied that hundreds of millions would starve to death in the 1970s (and that 65 million of them would be Americans), that already-overpopulated India was doomed, and that most probably England will not exist in the year 2000.
One held up a soft toy koala with a sign around his neck reading simply HELP — a reference to the bushfires that have ravaged Australia, while another brandished a cardboard sign reading Wake Up and Smell the Bushfires.

CNN's John Berman asked Rosselló, who is affiliated with the national Democratic Party, about the congressional Democrats' junket on New Day, marking one of the only times the network — or any mainstream outlet — has covered the trip in less than glowing terms.
Hong Kong Watch Founder Benedict Rogers told Breitbart London that the failures of the European Union to meaningfully take on the atrocities of the communist regime will leave a vacancy in leadership that the United Kingdom should take up post-Brexit.
Called the American Rescue Plan, it would amount to $1.9 trillion in spending. Despite the massive cost, the plan does not focus on creating jobs or set aside money for building American infrastructure.
President-elect Joe Biden unveiled a coronavirus plan Thursday that he claims will turn the tide on the pandemic, speeding up the vaccine rollout, and providing financial help to individuals, states, and local governments and businesses struggling with the prolonged economic fallout.
Guardrails will ensure DOJ enforces the law even under an administration that's hostile to women's rights — and patients and providers will have standing to sue if they don't, Harris's plan stated during her campaign.
The 2020 election, Sanders said, was a chance to say: Enough is enough!
Instead of fighting, the 28-nation EU and U.S. should stand together to face shared challenges from countries such as China, Russia and Iran, Schaake said.
Another worrying underperformance for Rs: Early County (SW GA). Was Trump+5 and Perdue+11 in November but both Perdue and Loeffler are barely scraping by there with over 90% reporting. #GASen — Niles Edward Francis (@NilesGApol) January 6, 2021
The UN message—which seems to echo the position of George Soros and his Open Society Foundations—follows hard on the heels of a Europe-wide survey on immigration, which found that a striking 78 percent of European citizens want tighter control of Europe's external borders.
Second, turtles have been around for some time, are widespread and resilient.
Simply finishing the Shasta Dam to its design height [of 800 feet] could add nine million acre-feet to the system, McClintock says. Indeed, the Trump administration, is proposing to raise the dam by 18.5 feet, increasing the capacity of the dam by 7 percent (630,000 acre-feet) — if tiny salamander species that environmentalists wish to have declared endangered do not stop plans for expansion.
Streisand then blasts President Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S. from the 2016 Paris climate change accord, writing: We can't go on like this… It's too dangerous.
80% of Georgia's Nov. vote happened before Election day. Based on run-off early voting, if that holds, it would mean 773,343 votes likely in-person today. That's right around the *minimum* day-of turnout the GOP is hoping for, assuming that votes cast today favor them. — Lisa Desjardins (@LisaDNews) January 5, 2021
Why was this non-story so quickly allowed to escalate across the media, to the point where – outrageously – comparisons were being invited to the murder of MP Jo Cox?
We can add that today, renewable fuels account for less than 13 percent of our energy consumption. And most of our renewable energy, by the way, is hydropower, and the greens are increasingly hostile to dams as well. And so if we look at the two forms of energy that the greens truly approve of, namely, solar and wind, well, those two sources account for only about three percent of U.S. energy.
Moreover, as we all know, in recent years there's been a sudden surge of attempted restrictions on economic activity in every country in the world—namely, international mandates to clamp down on carbon dioxide, all aimed at doing something about climate change.
Their study, titled Environmental Warming and Feminization of One of the Largest Sea Turtle Populations in the World, warns that global warming could turn the world's sea turtle populations female, possibly leading to their extinction.
Your countryside would be trashed by a massively expensive, economically unviable white elephant project — HS2 — whose only functions were a) to cover the government's embarrassment at having squandered so much already and b) to enrich crony capitalist engineering companies and project managers and c) pacify the leftist Civil Service
A recent study by the Pew Research Center found, in fact, that more than a million sub-Saharan Africans had already moved to Europe since the year 2010.
#GAsen Runoffs Exit Poll: _____ Positions on issues are about right: Warnock (D) 46%
Now that the UK has left the EU, it must play a leadership role among democracies in championing human rights and countering the dismantling of freedom in Hong Kong, the genocide of the Uyghurs and the intense repression of religious believers, civil society, lawyers, bloggers, citizen journalists, whistleblowers, and dissidents in China, Rogers said.
The Green New Tories have revealed that they will tax pollution which will result in an increase in the levy paid on gas, the introduction of a plastic packaging tax, and a multi-billion pound spending spree on projects to make the UK 'carbon-neutral' by 2050.
Gore's warning was not directly testable: he failed to provide a quantitative forecast. The 2001 U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report's business as usual projection of 3°C per-century was used to stand for Gore's forecast. Adopting the IPCC projection favored Gore, as it was less extreme than his tipping point alarm.
Amidst criticism that Trump's rebuke showed insensitivity to the victims of ongoing fires, as well as first responders battling the blazes, the president subsequently made an extra effort to show his support for the state during the fires. Newsom joined then-Gov. Jerry Brown in welcoming the president on a tour of Paradise, California and other areas.
The 60 Minutes interview is not the first time Ocasio-Cortez has struggled to explain how she would fund $40 trillion in entitlement programs she is proposing.

23) Certain factions of drug cartels have crossed the line into terrorism and should classified as such. The designation would change the way the U.S. alienates them from banks, financial resources, and politicians. Other cartels would be forced to tone down their actions or risk similar consequences.
Satellite footage of the ship indicates that the strength of the blaze has decreased since the collision on Saturday, although strong winds have already pushed it 50 kilometers further from the Chinese coastline.
Many laugh at Bernie Sanders (and say) that he is a KGB agent and wants to build communism in the U.S. Since he calls himself a democratic socialist, we decided to play up this topic — the topic of Sanders being a recruited Russian agent, Kuznetsov said.
Australia is on fire. And the summer there has only just begun. 2019 was a year of record heat and record drought. Today the temperature outside Sydney was 48.9°C, she wrote.
The comparison of this view to the United States' long history of anti-Catholic bigotry has been disputed. Actually, it is exactly the same as this history in every important respect. A 19th-century bigot would have regarded Catholicism as fundamentally illiberal — a backward faith characterized by clerical despotism — and thus inconsistent with America's democratic rules. The same attitude seems currently present in the U.S. Senate.
But instead of pursuing these allegations — which normally it would have done, especially in the post #MeToo witch hunt climate — our virtue-signalling parliamentarians have proved oddly reluctant to boot out this charmless bruiser. Why? Because Bercow has made it his business to sabotage Brexit and most MPs, whatever they may think of him personally, are Remainers.
It is time for the UK to work with others across the free world to build an alliance of democracies to defend liberty and counter the CCP's repression and aggression.
Abrams also says Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger is no hero because he is not on the side of voters even though he is defending the election he ran last November.
Sanders is expected to charter a flight to Iowa this weekend while the Senate trial is in recess. Warren hasn't finalized her plans but is also considering private travel, and Amy Klobuchar hasn't ruled it out. Only Michael Bennet says he'll be flying commercial.
Rep. Tom McClintock (R-CA), an ally of the president, criticized his tweet and urged him to reconsider. In his own statement, McClintock said that the principal blame for California's wildfires lies with federal agencies and laws which govern most of our state's forests and brushlands, not with state laws. He added that cutting FEMA's funding to CalFire would damage the one governmental agency that actually works in the state of California.
The issue also came up in August, when Sanders traveled to Paradise, California, which had been ravaged by wildfires, to unveil his plan to fight climate change. He was unapologetic.
The yellow vest movement, prompted in November by a tax hike on diesel fuel, has expanded to encompass demands for wider changes to France's economy to help struggling workers. Protesters have denounced Macron's pro-business policies as favouring the rich.
