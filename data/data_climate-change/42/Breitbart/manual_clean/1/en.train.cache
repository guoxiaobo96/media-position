in other words, this all means it's the democrats who are trying to suppress the vote in georgia—at least part of the vote, the part from the pro-trump areas—as part of their last-ditch effort to win control of the u.s. senate in races their president-elect does not even think they have a shot at, which the politico article sums up nicely.

sanders noted that his campaign had closed a large gap with biden in the polls, pulling within single digits, with a chance to win in the south carolina primary on saturday.
mcclintock dismissesdconcerns about oroville. no dam, no work of man is perfect, he said. we make mistakes, we learn, we go forward.
likewise, erin curtis of the u.s. bureau of reclamation told breitbart news, there is a lot of momentum for the project right now.
he blamed the state and federal environmental laws and regulations that make dams more difficult, and more expensive, to build. until we change the environmental laws, construction is cost prohibitive, he told me.

another is the havoc the green ideology has wreaked on honest science and on once-trustworthy government institutions such as national oceanic and atmospheric administration.
francis also said it is necessary to create a social debate in which of those involved in any way can explain their problems and have access to adequate and reliable information in order to make decisions for the common good, something rarely seen in contemporary discussions of climate change that tend to exclude climate change skeptics.
the senators are facing an unprecedented challenge in the final days before the feb. 3 iowa caucuses. at a time when they would typically barnstorm the state, they're instead stuck in washington as jurors in president donald trump's impeachment case. the little time they have for campaigning makes commercial travel tough.
protesters promise to take part in civil disobedience at u.s. capitol after the protest.

while biden was in overwhelmingly white new hampshire on saturday, billionaire michael bloomberg was courting black voters in alabama, which is among the states that vote on super tuesday in early march. bloomberg toured the late martin luther king jr.'s church, spoke at a democratic party luncheon and held a rally at alabama state university, a historically black college and university.
senator bernie sanders echoed lessig's sentiments on tuesday night, when he accused the president of creating an emergency and artificial crises, while ignoring that the biggest crisis of all which is — according to the senator — actually climate change.
and part of that problem is that brazil is remarkably undeveloped. if we look at a map showing where the nation's 211 million people are located, we see that they are mostly huddled along the atlantic ocean. we might compare this situation to that of the u.s.; imagine what our prosperity would be like today if we had never pushed across north america, to texas, california—and everywhere else west of the atlantic seaboard.
the actor has taken a number of the political stands in recent weeks. he was arrested in washington, d.c. in january while taking part in a climate change rally organized by jane fonda. at the golden globe awards, he encouraged his fellow hollywood stars to swear off flying private jets.
that opportunity might have presented itself last weekend since sanders, warren and others were campaigning in iowa and then went to south carolina for martin luther king jr. day celebrations and then on to washington to be in the senate. but they didn't share private flights.
rather than president donald trump's conception of the good life, which he said revolved around cheating for money, sanders said, his ethos was: we are stronger and more human when we care about other people.
the california primary will take place on super tuesday, march 3, instead of in early june, as in previous years.
debs was the candidate of the socialist party of america in five successive elections from 1900 to 1920, and opposed the entry of the u.s. into world war i.
i asked him then, in a widely shared, public letter to cease and desist, he continued. however, he chose not to listen to my request, just as he chooses not to listen to the many american voices who ask him to stop his constant lies, to stop his petty, nasty name calling and bullying, to stop pushing his dangerous, vilifying and hateful rhetoric.
as bitter cold continues to grip much of north america and helps spawn the fierce storm along the east coast, the question arises: what's the influence of climate change? some scientists studying the connection between climate change and cold spells, which occur when cold arctic air dips south, say that they may be related. but the importance of the relationship is not fully clear yet. the arctic is not as cold as it used to be — the region is warming faster than any other — and studies suggest that this warming is weakening the jet stream, which ordinarily acts like a giant lasso, corralling cold air around the pole.
some of the water that will be produced from the project will be dedicated for environmental projects, he said, nothing that some water would help fish, and some would supply existing refuges that support waterfowl species.
it's not just those candidates tethered to washington by the impeachment trial who often opt to fly private. former vice president joe biden spent at least $1.2 million on charter jets through september, while pete buttigieg, the former mayor of south bend, indiana, had spent at least $750,000.
8:20 pm: democrats still holding leads:
one way that bloomberg hopes to grow and enrich the economy is by increasing the number of refugees allowed into the country annually. if elected, bloomberg hopes to accept 125,000 refugees if elected—nearly doubling the intake accepted under former president barack obama. a portion of the new refugees will be individuals fleeing the impact of climate change, an idea also favored by bloomberg's more progressive rivals, like sen. bernie sanders (i-vt) and environmentalist billionaire tom steyer.

your country was entered into a green experiment far more radical and transformative (and insane) than anything anywhere within the european union — including, even, germany's economically ruinous energiewende
thunberg is due to address the summit in the swiss alpine resort town of davos next week with a call on governments and financial institutions to stop investing in fossil fuels.
next two extraordinary pieces of ad hoc legislation rushed through in the last few days, eagerly ushered in by the remainer speaker of the house john bercow, and voted through by a remainer-dominated parliament, designed with the sole purpose of frustrating the no deal brexit that is now britain's only way of getting the full brexit it voted for in june 2016.
i'm not going to walk to california, sanders replied when asked about flying private. we do the best we can as an example, but i'm not going to sit here and tell you that we're not going to use fossil fuels.
a representative for the campaign didn't comment friday on the authenticity of the call.
steyer is also seizing on biden's fourth-place finish in last week's iowa caucuses to undermine biden's argument that he is best positioned to defeat president donald trump. that's important because many black voters in south carolina have said they would back biden because they view him as the most electable candidate in a crowded field.
bp just discovered a billion barrels of oil in the gulf of mexico. it was just another cnbc headline on january 8, and yet it highlighted a bigger trend: the surge in u.s. energy production.
yet still, before bolsonaro, leftist brazilian governments had meekly accepted the western green agenda, even if it hurt economic development. such is the power of ideas—and of foreign aid with strings attached to it.
in his statement, pope francis went beyond earlier declarations that seemed to exclude the church taking a formal stand on questions of climate science.
3) mexico has numerous states under the direct influence of drug cartels that have standing armies with access to rpgs, armored vehicles, artillery, and explosives. most of mexico has military forces patrolling streets to deal with cartel paramilitary forces.
however, fears still remain that the oil tanker could explode at any moment due to the high volatility of the condensate oil, likely killing all the crew members on board.
whatever the source, the reality is that we're all standing atop virtually incomprehensible quantities of untapped energy abundance. in 2014, breitbart news noted that the value of oil and gas under federal lands and waters amounted to $128 trillion. that $128 trillion, we might add, is six times the gdp of the u.s. once again, that's just federal lands and waters—a fraction of this country's total territory.
here's why, even though the house democrats have shown no immediate interest in pursuing it, the green new deal remains a clear and present danger.
if you're a presidential candidate running to try to beat donald trump, who is a climate denier to his bones, and that requires you to move around the country … you should do that, said leah stokes, a professor and researcher into climate and energy politics at the university of california-santa barbara.

biden has set a goal of administering 100 million shots in his first 100 days. the pace of vaccination is approaching one million shots a day, but 1.8 million a day would be needed to reach widespread or herd immunity by the summer, according to a recent estimate by the american hospital association. wen says the pace should be even higher — closer to three million a day.
mayor de blasio has drawn comparisons between oil companies and the tobacco industry, which knowingly profited from behavior they knew to be harmful. the difference, of course, is that numerous deaths were convincingly attributed to cigarette smoking. whereas people have died from severe weather events since the beginning of recorded history, no death has yet been ascribed to manmade global warming.
we don't have decades. what the scientists are telling us — if we don't get our act together within the next eight or nine years, we're talking about cities all over the world — major cities — going underwater, he said at the democrat debate in november.
biden said, according to fox news:
although the biden campaign attempted to dismiss bondi's argument, the broader point about a culture of corruption permeating the former vice president's family seems to have taken hold with the mainstream media. just this past week, politico published an in-depth exposé on the financial ties between james biden, the former vice president's brother, and a high-powered washington, dc, lobbyist.
as breitbart news has reported, los angeles mayor eric garcetti recently adopted a more pragmatic approach, and has approached the federal government to work together in dealing with the city's roughly 60,000 homeless people, including by possibly relocating some of them to unused federal property.

the city of new york has reportedly filed a federal claim seeking damages from bp, chevron, conocophillips, exxonmobil and royal dutch shell to help pay for a $20 billion plan to protect the city from the effects of global warming.
such moves play into the hands of rival global powers and can only lead to greater fragmentation rather than much needed increased cooperation, the letter said.
the proposal falls short of expectations for $2,000 direct stimulus payments. instead, it provides for what breitbart news estimates would be around $320 billion in direct payments of $1,400 for most americans. biden's aides say this amounts to the promised $2,000 when coupled with the $600 included in the aid bill president donald trump signed last year.
unfortunately there are still people who are trying to impersonate me or falsely claim that they 'represent' me in order to communicate with high profile people, politicians, media, artists etc, she said and apologized to anyone who may have been misled by such people.
during the flight into egypt, the child jesus experienced with his parents the tragic fate of the displaced and refugees, francis said in his message, citing a 1952 text by pope pius xii, which is marked by fear, uncertainty and unease.
two weeks ago, the vatican insisted that a focus on the coronavirus pandemic must not draw people's attention away from migrants.
the proposal also expands paid leave for workers and increases tax credits for families with children, goals shared by many pro-family conservatives seeking to make family formation more affordable.
lana del rey has claimed in a recent interview that narcissism, not climate change, is the biggest problem facing the world today, a fact that the pop star claims came to light due to the trump presidency.

both states will deepen their cooperation in foreign affairs, defence, external and internal security and development and at the same time work on strengthening the ability of europe to act independently, says the text of the treaty, as seen by reuters.
as breitbart news has noted, the green new deal is in fact an old idea, first championed by president barack obama's green jobs czar, van jones. it seeks to implement classic socialist policies of state-run enterprises, using the pretext of an environmental crisis.
21) the state of tamaulipas, directly south of texas, has two former governors currently indicted for their alleged roles in helping cartels. one remains in mexico, while the other is in u.s. custody awaiting trial.
economically and strategically, open borders isn't just a good plan — it's the only chance we've got. america is an aging nation with a stagnant population. we have ample land to house lots more people, but we are increasingly short of workers.
8) the majority of tunnels are found on the arizona and california borders. the tunnels are generally discovered in areas where there are population centers on both sides of the border and a wall or fence is already in place. few have been found in texas, where there is a river.
i'm really not sure that this was quite the post-brexit vision trump had in mind when he promised britain a 'fantastic' and 'very big' trade deal once it managed to extricate itself from the european union.
a continent away, frantic negotiations were continuing on the eve of the state water resources control board (swrcb) decision on the bay-delta plan, the controversial new policy that will mandate that rivers in the san joaquin watershed must have an average of 40% unimpeded flow during the spring months — a decision that shifts precious water from farmers and cities to the environment in an effort to save threatened fish populations.
critics, however, say that state authorities allocated just enough money to the project to make it appear as if they are spending money on water storage, while not quite enough to allow the reservoir to be built.
why, given her claims to have felt threatened, did soubry look so cheerfully unperturbed throughout?
that meant, sanders said, no more premiums, no more co-payments, no more deductibles, no more out-of-pocket expenses, no more paying more than $200 per year for prescription drugs.
still, sanders' campaign says the senator's comment to colbert wasn't realistic. even if several senators were looking to decamp from washington to iowa quickly after the impeachment trial concludes each day, they would be headed to different parts of the state.
biden's fading position in iowa is contrasted by the central role he and his youngest son, hunter, continue to play in the impeachment proceedings. this week, trump's legal team laid out its case for why the president had good reason to suggest ukraine look into hunter biden's role with the ukrainian natural gas giant, burisma holdings. former florida attorney general pam bondi, a member of the legal team, specifically noted that hunter was paid $83,000 per month for a role he had little qualification to hold. she further argued the arrangement was rife with potential conflicts of interest, especially because joe biden led u.s. policy with ukraine for most of the obama administration.

it's no wonder the ordinary folk who voted brexit are growing increasingly restive and bitter. the remainer establishment — or deep state, if you prefer — is snatching brexit away from them; and it's so arrogant, so complacent, so contemptuous of the public that it's scarcely bothering even to hide its tracks.
acknowledging her life both as a christian and a climate change believer is like coming out of the closet, hayhoe has said.
the 78-year-old sanders suggests that greta make a statement in his support and that they do an event together when she next comes to the u.s. i would be really appreciative, he says.
the conference addressed issues of biodiversity, great extinctions of history, population and demographics, and ehrlich was invited to speak on causes and pathways of biodiversity losses: consumption preferences, population numbers, technology, ecosystem productivity.
the divisions over water storage do not match partisan divisions on other issues. in the central valley, democrats tend to be as vociferous in their advocacy for water storage as republicans are. and in the past, republicans were as skeptical of such projects as urban democrats are today.
this is the problem of presenting your purity above your practicality, said democratic strategist chris lippincott, who has not endorsed any of the 2020 primary candidates. when we think about certain candidates who talk a lot about the environment … you're going to hold them to a different standard.
trump's america produces approximately 14 per cent of global co2 emissions; brazil about 1.5 per cent; india 7 per cent; and china nearly 30 per cent. since none of these economies has any intention of driving change on the co2 production front any time soon, it will put boris johnson's attempts to take britain's economy net zero by 2050 into tragic, painful and embarrassing perspective.

and in a way, it also highlighted a big counter-trend: the green left's desire to take it all away, in the name of fighting climate change.
biden's aides claimed, without evidence, that the proposal would advance his target of administering 100 million vaccines by the 100th day of his administration and help move toward the objective of reopening most schools by the spring.
the obamacare accommodation biden referred to, however, was never viewed as such by many catholic schools and organizations. instead, they recognized it as an accounting trick whereby completion of a certified form would merely transfer their mandate to directly provide abortion-inducing drugs to an insurance provider, who would take care of the administration of these services for the faith-based groups. in short, the accommodation simply ensured the abortion-inducing drugs were paid for, as the obama-biden administration desired, while the conscience issues of the faith-based groups remained ignored.

in an article analyzing the possible motives for sorondo's affinity for communism, zmirak writes that sorondo's fondness for totalitarianism is the reaction of an angry, self-conscious mediocrity lashing out at his moral and natural betters. no wonder such men find kindred spirits in the gray, vicious ranks of the chinese communist party.
climate change advocates have recently insisted, however, that record cold temperatures in north america cannot be used as an argument against anthropogenic climate change, since no direct causality can be established between singular weather phenomena and climate change.

the socialist senator seemed open to the idea of sharing a private jet with other presidential hopefuls who find themselves in the same predicament, citing the cost but, notably, not the impact on the environment. are you going to give rides to the other candidates who are in the senate? colbert asked. actually, we have used jets previously, and that was an idea we thought of. those are expensive so we thought we'd all chip in and ride together, sanders said, ultimately conceding that he does not know if the idea will come to fruition. that's greener. that's greener, sir, colbert noted. maybe we can all chip in, get one plane, and come back, sanders said.

as the highest-ranking republican on the budget committee, smith has called out democrats' removal of a budgetary restraint on government spending, known as the pay-as-you-go provision, or paygo. this would enable democrats to spend further on climate change proposals such as the green new deal.

yet in the past two decades, all this expertise has gone to the trash heap, because, thanks to strong science and stronger entrepreneurship, we've enjoyed an energy miracle. this is in large part due to the new process of fracking; in 2018, the u.s., for the first time since world war two, became a net energy exporter.

so let's take a moment to drill down, pun intended, on that new discovery. at current prices, that new oil, in the waters south of new orleans, is worth about $59 billion. for purposes of comparison, the gdp of the entire state of louisiana in 2017 was $246 billion. which is to say, $59 billion is an appreciable bump.

so now we can see the makings of the next epic political fight: that is, the zeal of the greens vs. the determination of carbon-energy producers. in the u.s. today, about a dozen states are heavily dependent on carbon-energy production for their wellbeing; these states account for most of the 1.1 million employees in the energy sector.
it's alarming to catholics to see joe biden tout his catholic faith and then turn around and say he would immediately go after the little sisters of the poor and reinstate the rules that would force them to either violate their faith or pay crippling fines, ashley mcguire, senior fellow with the catholic association, said in a statement to breitbart news.
because we still fail to make the connection between the climate crisis and increased extreme weather events and nature disasters like the #australiafires
the president's policy differs from that of his predecessor. during former president barack obama's tenure in the white house, the number of displaced persons being resettled in the u.s. increased drastically. between 2008 and 2017, more than 67,000 refugees on average were admitted into the country. the total would have been larger if republicans had not stymied obama's efforts to admit 110,000 displaced persons, most notably from syria, during his final year in office.

the former vice president, in particular, claimed that questions about his political influence intersecting with his son's work in ukraine were part of an organized smear campaign. the claim, which is disputed by ethics watchdogs in both the u.s. and ukraine, was further undercut by biden's inability to recollect in which country his son was working.

indeed, some heterodox observers, such as the late thomas gold, argue that the earth is, in fact, making more energy, even now. that is, oil, gas, and coal aren't fossil fuels at all, in the sense that such fuels are supposed to be the decayed remains of dinosaurs and other prehistoric organisms. instead, gold argued, the internal heat of the earth is, as it were, constantly cooking up more oil. by this reckoning, so long as the core of the earth is hot, we'll never run out of carbon-based fuel.

in the study, authors nic lewis and judith curry looked at actual temperature records and compared them with climate change computer models. what they found is that the planet has shown itself to be far less sensitive to increases in co2 than the climate models say. as a result, they say, the planet will warm less than the models predict, even if we continue pumping co2 into the atmosphere. as lewis explains: our results imply that, for any future emissions scenario, future warming is likely to be substantially lower than the central computer model-simulated level projected by the (united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change), and highly unlikely to exceed that level.

from february 2016 to february 2018 (the latest month available) global average temperatures dropped 0.56°c. you have to go back to 1982-84 for the next biggest two-year drop, 0.47°c—also during the global warming era. all the data in this essay come from gistemp team, 2018: giss surface temperature analysis (gistemp). nasa goddard institute for space studies (dataset accessed 2018-04-11 at https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/). this is the standard source used in most journalistic reporting of global average temperatures. the 2016-18 big chill was composed of two little chills, the biggest five month drop ever (february to june 2016) and the fourth biggest (february to june 2017). a similar event from february to june 2018 would bring global average temperatures below the 1980s average. february 2018 was colder than february 1998.

still, the crisis provoked questions about whether state authorities had mismanaged oroville dam or ignored warnings about the structural integrity of the spillway — or even of the dam itself, which, some claimed, had already begin to leak.
federal law enforcement officials were alerted in november that several democrats had received calls from someone believed to be outside the u.s. who was claiming to represent the teenage thunberg and was trying to set up calls or in-person meetings with members of congress, a u.s. official told the associated press. some of the congressional offices reported the incidents to the fbi and the capitol police, the official said. the person was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the ap on condition of anonymity.
in march, sanders' campaign became the first to announce it would provide carbon offsets, donations to environmental groups meant to mitigate the environmental effects of extra emissions. since then, it had spent about $9,000 on them through september. and during his primary challenge to hillary clinton in 2016, sanders paid around $14,000 for such offsets.
unrelenting cold since late december has caused energy demand to spike, pushing up prices and straining supplies. new england power companies are struggling to keep up with demand. new england's current energy woes are the result of years of state and federal policies aimed at closing coal and oil-fired power plants, largely as part of the region's effort to fight global warming.
according to richard's analysis, the 485 new papers underscore the significant limitations and uncertainties inherent in our understanding of climate and climate changes, which in turn suggests that climate science is not nearly as settled as media reports and some policymakers would have people believe.
we have been getting less and less water in the form of snowpack, which means less storage — we get more rain, so we can't store it. sites, she said, provides another place to put that water.

longer is better for assessing climate forecasts, and so armstrong has agreed to extend the bet for another ten years, sticking with the original 2007 global mean temperature as the starting point. this time he has reason to be more confident. validation tests published two years after the original bet compared no-change model forecasts with ipcc dangerous warming forecasts for horizons from one to 100 years, and found that no-change forecasts were considerably more accurate; especially over longer horizons. that study, followed all of the relevant scientific forecasting principles, with only a minor exception. to our knowledge, the study remains the only peer-reviewed paper published in a scientific journal that provides scientific forecasts of long-term global mean temperatures.
the top 10 ga counties w/ 10k+ voters where dems underperformed biden by the most in november's loeffler special: 1. hart -2.1%
with three weeks to go, there are warning signs.
but with his iowa disappointment and the middling results expected in tuesday's new hampshire primary, biden probably will need a commanding victory by the time the democratic contest reaches south carolina. any shifts in voter sentiment could narrow a hoped-for win or, in a nightmare scenario, relegate him to second place, threatening the viability of his campaign.
a private jet will reportedly fly sen. bernie sanders (i-vt) to and from campaign events in iowa to avoid commercial airline delays.
top three concerns, according to the pew research center were:
although i have enormous respect for biden, i have been disappointed in his lack of empathy on issues such as assistance for veterans or a criminal justice overhaul, lincoln said. i've grown weary of politicians. the same old formula will not defeat trump.
morrison also rejected calls to downsize australia's lucrative coal industry, noting australia is the world's largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas and he intends to keep it that way.

that's right: the rev. raphael warnock, the democrat nominee for one of georgia's u.s. senate seats—both of which are up for grabs in tuesday's runoffs—is running advertisements trying to depress the turnout of his opponent's base. the voter suppression effort seems to be an indication of where everyone knows this race will be decided: by president trump's supporters. do they follow his guidance and show up to back loeffler and sen. david perdue (r-ga) on tuesday? or do they do as the democrats want them to and stay home? it's anybody's guess, but a lot rides on whether traditional gop base voters turn out on election day in georgia or if they sit this one out.
happily the new york times is here to put it all in context. it's all further evidence of global warming, of course!
moreover, the liberal cities that have incubated america's utopian environmental movement for decades could not exist without ongoing human intervention in the environment that brings water from mountaintop to tap.
by territory, brazil is the fifth-largest country in the world, and on that land, and under that land, are vast natural resources. it's been estimated, in fact, that brazil's natural wealth—much of it gold and uranium—is worth $21.8 trillion. that's a lot of money, about $103,000 for every brazilian man, woman, and child.
third, australia's turtle populations are doing just fine.
emails to gore were unproductive: after several attempts at engagement, his staff informed armstrong that gore did not take bets. the important question of whether public policies should be based on the alarming projections remained, so armstrong commissioned theclimatebet.com site to track how the bet would have turned out had gore accepted.

a notice of the protest says that fonda will be joined by actors maggie gyllenhaal, joaquin phoenix, martin sheen, saffron burrows, and model amber valletta.
as bloomberg news has reported, bolsonaro carried chunks of metal with him on the campaign trail, all to make a point about the value of mining. one of those chunks was of niobium, which is one of the rare-earth elements that undergird the modern economy. because it is needed to strengthen steel and semiconductors, niobium is precious; it sells for about $42,000 a ton. brazil has 40 million tons of niobium, and if we do the math, that's $1.68 trillion—which is a lot for a country whose annual gdp totals barely more than $2 trillion. the metal is already being mined in brazil, but bolsonaro's point is that there's a lot more niobium in the country–and many other rare earths, too; brazilians just have to find them and get them out of the ground.

how drugs will get under, over, and around trump's wall
the harvest moon rocker recently called trump, as well as other past presidents, losers for failing to take action to combat climate change.
we're here to show the governments and the people and the media and everyone that we're not happy with the situation as it is, said 17-year-old deborah hausser, one of the protesters.
to be sure, some critics see this possible change in america as venezuela-ification. and yet it's worth noting that key green new dealers see the change in a much different frame of reference. here, for example, is saikat chakrabarti, top adviser to ocasio-cortez, tweeting on january 13, linking the green new deal to u.s. economic mobilization during world war two:
in november 2016, the pope called climate change skeptics to an ecological conversion, while denouncing what he believed to be a weak reaction from governments to the climate crisis. he also criticized the ease with which well-founded scientific opinion about the state of our planet is disregarded.
we pay more per capita in health care and education for lower outcomes than many other nations, she added. and so for me, what's unrealistic is — is what we're living in right now.

the emergency legislation would be paid for with borrowed money, adding to trillions in debt the government has already incurred to confront the pandemic. aides said biden will make the case that the additional spending and borrowing is necessary to prevent the economy from sliding into an even deeper hole. interest rates are low, making debt more manageable. inflation is below the federal reserve's target, indicating that the economy has enough slack to withstand additional demand introduced by deficit spending.
1:59 am: nbc projects warnock win:
republicans concede that the only way they lose these races is if the president's base does not show up. the washington post's jacqueline alemany quotes anonymous gop officials on tuesday in her power up newsletter to express that concern. the anonymous republicans claim that trump's nonstop voter fraud allegations in georgia have hurt loeffler's and perdue's chances by causing trump base voters to question the legitimacy of elections and consider not voting. trump's been generally unhelpful throughout this whole process, the anonymous gop senate aide said, warning that republicans should be prepared for a bad night.
if global warming continues, the study concludes, then so many turtles may turn female that there will be no males with which to mate. extinction will then be inevitable.

travis lincoln, a 44-year-old from charleston, attended biden's first rally in columbia last may and said he was all in for the former vice president. but as the primary approaches, lincoln said he has shifted his backing to tech entrepreneur andrew yang.
it is, of course, important that some equitable plan for resource development be put in place. that is, a plan that rewards risk-taking and entrepreneurship but also assures workers and citizens a piece of the action. we might note that one of the signal successes of the previous left-wing regime was its program of family allowances, aimed at the poor and working poor. such conscious spreading of the wealth is, of course, good politics, and yet it's also good policy because every citizen deserves a fair shake and because it's important to preserve social peace.
here is wwf's account of their findings:
the culminating pressure from the campaign trail, the impeachment hearings, and a newly awakened media seem to be having an impact. in recent days, the former vice president has made an increasing number of stumbles and gaffes. the gaffe follows several others biden has made on the campaign trail in recent days. most notably, the former vice president elicited attention on tuesday for pushing a voter and suggesting because of a disagreement about climate change that the man go vote for someone else.

in december, bolsonaro himself made the case for more economic growth: environmental politics can't muddle with brazil's development. today, the economy is almost back on track thanks to agribusiness, and they are suffocated by environmental questions.
a former lecturer at the complutense university of madrid, iglesias became politically active in the 1990s, when he joined spain's communist youth league, later hosting a television show on an iranian state-owned network and founding the hugo chavez-backed podemos party.
van jones was one of the early proponents of the green new deal concept, which he outlines in his 2008 book, the green collar economy: how one solution can fix our two biggest problems. an amazon book review describes the book as a re-imagining of fdr's original new deal that makes the government 'a partner' of the people, and sets about defining the principles of a 'smart, supportive, reliable' partnership. this also happens to be exactly what ocasio-cortez promises in her version of the green new deal. wiki said, the book is a detailed proposal for a 'green new deal.' in 2009, jones resigned from the white house under a cloud for supporting the view that president bush was complicit in the september 11 terror attacks, and his treatise on the green new deal failed to get traction.
as breitbart news and other outlets have reported, 30 democrats traveled to puerto rico over the weekend on a chartered plane with over 100 lobbyists. their itinerary included meetings with local officials — as well as parties, a local premiere of hamilton, and free time on the beach.
armstrong bet that the global mean temperature would not change; in other words, that temperature increases and decreases would tend to balance out over time. that forecast is consistent with a statement in the aforementioned ipcc technical report: in climate research and modeling, we should recognize that we are dealing with a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore that the long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.
mcclintock is among the skeptics. he told breitbart news that he has been hearing talk about the sites reservoir for decades, and that californians are constantly told that construction is imminent. but somehow, that reservoir, and others, are never built.
yet in addition, brazil's potential wealth extends far beyond the resources that have already been identified.
using his speech to call for concerted global action on the climate emergency at the summit, gove noted the lack of efforts on the issue by president trump and the brazilian leader, jair bolsonaro. i shan't mention any world leaders by name in a critical fashion, he began. however, it's important in the united states and in brazil that we recognise that there will be people, at the state and at the city level, who can play a vital role in driving change that we all need to see. predicting that nonetheless cop 26 would be a success, gove pointed to what he called politically, a realisation of the scale of the challenge and the emergency across the globe.
350.org is so invested in the green new deal that it is quietly transforming its college divestment campaign, the fossil fuel divestment student network, into the sunrise movement, which serves as shock-troop protesters for the green new deal. for example, as college divestment campaigns close up shop, they encourage their followers to check out sunrise movement! in addition, two co-founders of the sunrise movement, sara blazevic and varshini prakash, left the fossil fuel divestment student network to create the sunrise movement. sunrise activists have protested on capitol hill and, encouraged by ocasio-cortez, have engaged in sit-ins in congressional offices, including three in the offices of rep. nancy pelosi (d-ca), to push house democrats to create a special committee next year focused entirely on climate change initiatives.
this is america. we shouldn't be doing this, the former mayor told the dallas morning news at the time. it's not good for texas. it's not good for america.
to that end, proponents often exaggerate the threat of climate change and other environmental challenges. aoc herself has warned of cataclysmic climate disaster unless the united states moves to 100% renewable energy sources in the next ten years.
and while it's unclear who paid for it, signs like this appeared outside the trump rally in dalton on monday night:
we might pause over that word: contain. that is, the people of brazil just elected a new leader, knowing full well of his pro-growth agenda. and yet now, the sierra club, and other western greens, seek to contain him—and, by extension, to contain the brazilian standard of living.

mckay has always had a smug problem. this is what undermined his comedies with will ferrell, what most undermines vice, and why he wears a scarf in public. mckay despises anyone not enlightened enough to share his beliefs and is even more disgusted with those who enjoy life rather than obsess over politics, those more interested in the next fast & furious movie than they are in using twitter to own the republicans.

the developing relationship between macron and merkel blossomed at the end of last year, when the french president announced that the franco-german couple would become the heart of europe and work to stop the world descending into chaos — making not-so-thinly veiled criticisms of u.s. president donald j. trump's policy of putting the american electorate first, rather than globalist endeavours.

life as we know it in california today would be unthinkable without the extensive system of dams, reservoirs, pumps and aqueducts that make urban life possible and that have transformed the drought-prone central valley into the most productive farming region on earth.
as a result, much of brazil's land became off-limits to development. today, indigenous tribes account for .4 percent of brazil's population, and yet they inhabit 13 percent of the land. to put that another way, natives are about 32 times more land rich than the average brazilian. admittedly, there are often violations of these pro-native restrictions, as illegal poachers and loggers seek quick profits in no-go zones. and yet because these violations are illegal, they are episodic, not offering the potential economic benefits of permanent settlements and systematic development—that is, of the kind that could offer good jobs at good wages to all brazilians.
we must look at climate change as if it were a devastating military attack against the united states and the entire planet. and we must respond accordingly, mr. sanders said in a tweet.
and oh yes, it's good news, as well, for the united states, since energy security is a big part of national security. as any baby boomer remembers, all through the 60s, 70s, and 80s, we were told by the experts that the u.s. faced an energy crisis. thus we needed to take dramatic steps to deal with this supposed shortfall—everything from cutting back on consumption to invading other countries to seize their oil.
we must not downplay the importance of our own responsibility in interaction with nature, francis told the diplomatic corps accredited to the holy see. climate changes, with the global rise in temperatures and their devastating effects, are also a consequence of human activity.

another project, the sites reservoir, has been debated for decades. rather than capturing water by blocking a river with a dam, the reservoir would be built in a valley with minimal water and would receive excess water during floods, relieving pressure on other dams and allowing them to store more.
this is why i call ocasio-cortez a care bear communist. she comes across as ditzy, cute, approachable but the policies she wants to enact are pure hard-left poison.
he added that on day one of his administration, he would legalize the sale of marijuana in every state in this country.
the poll finds a plurality of democrats, republicans and independents likely to vote in the state's march 3, 2020 primary election in agreement that homelessness is the most important issue for gov. gavin newsom and state lawmakers to work on in 2020. twenty-one percent of democrats and independents called it the top issue, compared to 29 percent of republicans. housing affordability and the environment were the next highest priorities for likely democratic primary voters, while republicans were more concerned about immigration and taxes.
there's a cardinal, cardinal zen, i believe, who spent a lot of time in a communist prison, and he feels completely betrayed by the fact that they're making a deal with his persecutors, said zmirak. vatican officials are saying, 'oh, [joseph zen is] out of touch. he doesn't know what he's talking about.' they're dismissing the guy who lives in the country and has been in its prisons while they sit in their little italian hideaways eating gnocchi, drinking wine, and imagining that they're great realpolitik practitioners.

take john bercow. as speaker of the house, he is supposed to be non-partisan. bercow's idea of non-partisanship where brexit is concerned is to turn up to work in a car (with the personalised number plate b13rco) with a rear window sticker that says bollocks to brexit.

vice media's hypocrisy may be the least of its concerns these days, however. the site started off 2018 by being rocked with a litany of sexual harassment allegations. that year, the company also lost shane smith as ceo. in november, the vice media reportedly was on track to lose $50 million and was reportedly looking to make major staff cuts.

not to turner, who said that sanders's views fit within a proud left-wing tradition in america:
this exemption was designed as a mechanism to ram through socialist policies like the green new deal and other ideas aimed at hurting american workers, families, and farmers, smith said.
curtis described the value of the project in terms environmentalists might understand: given that the state's climate is changing, and becoming warmer, that means more of california's annual precipitation is falling as rain, rather than snow.
the political outlook for the legislation remained unclear. in a joint statement, house speaker nancy pelosi and senate democratic leader chuck schumer praised biden for including liberal priorities, saying they would move quickly to pass it. but democrats have narrow margins in both chambers of congress, and republicans will push back on issues that range from increasing the minimum wage to providing more money for states, while demanding inclusion of their priorities, such as liability protection for businesses.
of course, not everything has to be a fight. this author has argued for years that the overlooked middle ground in the climate change debate is carbon capture: that is, sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide, preferably as a solid, so that it can't contribute to the greenhouse effect. one would bet that if the green new deal were ever to really get going, carbon capture would loom large, offering a win-win for both sides. that is, we put less co2 in the atmosphere—or even start removing it—but we still get the energy benefit of our natural resources.
in fact, as cnbc noted, the new discovery will inspire $1.3 billion in investment to actually get the oil out. and that's good news for all the workers who will get jobs and overtime out of this additional economic activity; according to zip recruiter, energy jobs in the gulf pay an average of $80,201 a year. and so there's good news, too, for families, neighbors, storekeepers, and stakeholders.

the facts need not detain us here – because there aren't any. it's just speculation – could, may – gleaned from conversations with tame experts at institutions like the notoriously alarmist and fervently left-wing potsdam institute for climate impact research in germany. and there's plenty more nonsense where this came from, as thomas williams reported here earlier.
new york mayor bill de blasio is suing five major oil companies for causing bad weather in the hope of defraying part of the cost of much needed and overdue infrastructure work to protect against severe weather.
while germany and france are uniting to create progressive-globalist union, nationalist and populist groups are working to reshape the eu into a europe of independent nations ahead of european parliament elections in may, with right-populist italian deputy prime minister matteo salvini meeting with poland's conservative leadership in warsaw on wednesday.
there will be no lasting prosperity for our people if we do not protect our planet, chancellor of the exchequer rishi sunak announced at the latter end of his budget speech in the house of commons on wednesday, stating: the treasury's net-zero review will set out the strategic choices ahead of cop26 [un climate summit] later this year. today's budget takes the first step.
the french leader, whose popularity ratings hit record lows at the end of last year, hopes the process will help quell anger over his economic policies.
trump's refugee policy, which has shrunk the number of incoming individuals to levels unseen since 1980, is central to his agenda for raising wages and living standards for the american worker. the president and his allies have argued that a tight labor market benefits workers already in the country by pushing companies to invest in skill training and development. it also has the benefit of boosting wages, as there is a smaller pool of workers competing for open positions.
in an interview with punchbowl news posted monday morning, rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez refused to rule out a 2022 run against current senate minority leader chuck schumer.
7) most of the efforts by drug cartels to control migration happens south of the texas border. criminal organizations like the reynosa faction of the gulf cartel profit more from human smuggling than drug trafficking.
the study revealed that during the course of the year 2017, at least 485 scientific papers were published that in some way questioned the supposed consensus regarding the perils of human co2 emissions or the efficacy of climate models to predict the future.

as bill mcgurn argues in the wall street journal monday, in his day, dr. ehrlich's assertion about the limited 'carrying capacity' of the earth was settled science. never mind that it is rooted in an absurdity: that when a calf is born a country's wealth rises, but when a baby is born it goes down.
ultimately, this campaign is a throwback to the worst of the obama era – and betrays the hallmarks of one of the obama era's most notorious and discredited figures, van jones, who wrote the book the green collar economy on which the green new deal is based.
that is, dam projects would go forward — if there were the political will to build them.

john zmirak, senior editor of the stream, joined tuesday's edition of siriusxm's breitbart news tonight to discuss sorondo's praise of china. sorondo heads the vatican's academies of science and social science.
the concern is that base voters may or may not turn up. but while trump has expressed his disdain over the nov. 3 election, he has been equally clear to georgians in two different rallies and a number of other public statements that he needs and wants them to show up and vote for loeffler and perdue.
extending the eviction and foreclosure moratoriums until the end of september
the remainer deep state is killing brexit.
biden has committed to embracing the democrat party's pro-abortion agenda that includes codifying roe v. wade, funding planned parenthood, and forcing american taxpayers to fund abortions through a repeal of the hyde amendment.

in fact, vice assures and reassures us that cheney believes in nothing (literally nothing) other than the uet, but mckay cannot explain why. for example, after an hour or so of presenting cheney as power hungry, when the opportunity finally arises to run for president, mr. power hungry chickens out based on one bad poll. and his wife lynne (amy adams), who is supposed to be the true power behind the snarl, agrees, and they happily retire from politics.
these statutes were certainly not written with the intent to give a man like donald trump the power that he's now claiming, said lessig, but it's not an efficient process to check him and that's the uncertainty i think congress now has to face.
santiago abascal, the leader of the spanish populist party vox, took the opportunity of tuesday's confidence vote to denounce the coalition government, saying that the formation was an illegitimate union with the communist podemos. he went on to criticise the government for failing to tackle the violence and rape associated with mass migration to spain.

on venice boulevard in front of vice media's offices, a chain-link fence was erected to prohibit tents from going up. residents around penmar golf course have started a gofundme page and have hit their goal of raising $80,000 to fill a pedestrian pathway with native plants and landscaping — a project being called the frederick avenue pass-through but whose real objective is to deter the large encampment that has ballooned there.
it is also a system replete with ironies. the state that gave ronald reagan to america, and with him a new brand of unapologetic conservatism, is one in which the survival of the population depends on massive investments in infrastructure — albeit paid for, ultimately, by water users themselves.
look, folks, it is what it is, limbaugh said. the media wants it to be what it not yet is. now, it could be. it could evolve and who knows what it could be. right now, the media is reporting on the coronavirus as they hope it evolves. they hope for hurricanes on the first day of hurricane season. they hope for hurricane katrina, so they can say, climate change!
trump had criticized california for poor forest management, echoing critics who say that environmentalists have been so successful in pushing the government to restrict logging that they have inadvertently created conditions in which wildfires are likely to spread rapidly through dead trees and dense underbrush, and in which the lack of logging roads makes fighting fires harder. (democrats prefer to blame climate change, though without evidence.)
biden has long held that economic recovery is inextricably linked with controlling the coronavirus. our work begins with getting covid under control, he declared in his victory speech. we cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life's most precious moments until we get it under control.
a challenge for biden is that he and his campaign has spent months raising expectations for south carolina, in part to offset losses they anticipated in states that vote earlier and are less diverse. biden has argued that his campaign would essentially begin in south carolina, where a win would propel him into the clutch of states that vote in march where black and latino voters will be key.
out of the 350-seat parliament, sánchez's spanish socialist workers' party (psoe) currently has 120 mps and the podemos have 35 seats, meaning that the government will govern from a minority position. spain will now be governed by a coalition government for the first time since democracy was restored following the collapse of the franco dictatorship in 1978.
the sites reservoir would be filled by significant water diversions from the sacramento river, which could harm the river's dynamic flow-based ecosystems. more than 20,000 acres of federal and state public lands along the river that were acquired to protect and restore the river's riparian and aquatic habitats, could be degraded by the diversions. in addition to reducing flows in the sacramento river, the reservoir would drown up to 15,000 acres of existing oak woodlands, grasslands, wetlands, and agricultural land in the western sacramento valley. impacts associated with the reservoir footprint would harm the federally protected bald eagle, a host of other sensitive wildlife species, several rare plants, and significant historical and cultural resources. the sites project authority, a consortium of water districts and local governments, claim that the reservoir could store up to 1.8 million acre feet of water (making it the seventh largest reservoir in the state) and reliably yield about a half million acre feet of water annually for communities, farms, and the environment. but this yield estimate fails to adequately consider the effects of climate change, chronic drought, and reservoir evaporation on project storage and deliveries. …
13) the presence of physical barriers in cities like el paso has led to fewer people coming over the border to commit petty crimes or bring loads of drugs on their backs. the criminal organizations in the area shifted toward corrupting u.s. customs and border protection officials to smuggle harder drugs.

my point is that statistical cooling outliers garner no media attention. the global average temperature numbers come out monthly. if they show a new hottest year on record, that's a big story. if they show a big increase over the previous month, or the same month in the previous year, that's a story. if they represent a sequence of warming months or years, that's a story. when they show cooling of any sort—and there have been more cooling months than warming months since anthropogenic warming began—there's no story.

but tn times of drought, such as the unusually severe drought that gripped the state from 2011 to 2017, storage is the most salient priority. and mcclintock believes there is too little of it.

while the un and other supranational groups seek to facilitate migration, rank and file europeans are desperately looking for ways to slow it down.
in the short run, the green goal is moot because republicans control the white house and the senate; there are, to be sure, differing opinions on climate in republican ranks, but there's no appetite for anything like what the greens have in mind.
hayhoe thinks that american's resistance to climate change has more to do with the perceived solutions such as taxes, government legislation, and loss of personal liberty than with the theory of climate change and its causes.

of course, all that could change after 2020, if the democrats do well in the next election. if so, then the democrats' green agenda, which is coming to be known as the green new deal, has a chance of becoming law.

his campaign is making payments to nativeenergy, based in burlington, vermont, which is the same company that clinton used for them during her presidential bid in 2016. that's also the same firm warren uses, with her campaign paying a little more than $10,000 to it in september.
the ad focused on trying to split trump from loeffler, by highlighting how kemp—georgia's governor who trump says he intends to back a primary challenger against in two years—appointed her to the seat vacated by the now retired former sen. johnny isakson (r-ga). but the most interesting part of the ad may be how it opens: i'm raphael warnock and i approved this message.
he also promised that medicare for all would include dental care, hearing aids, eyeglasses, and all health care.
this determination to argue, against all evidence, that the planet is in a warming phase and that we must do more to try to cool it down would be quite funny if it didn't have such terrible real world consequences.
after that, greta tells sanders that he was recruited by the kgb in 1988 when he visited russia and has since been a sleeper agent.
biden believes the key to speeding that up lies not only in delivering more vaccine but also in working closely with states and local communities to get shots into the arms of more people. the trump administration provided the vaccine to states and set guidelines for who should get priority for shots, but they largely left it up to state and local officials to organize their vaccination campaigns.

in an era constrained by sustainability and affordability, a big house with a backyard should be a rarity. much of california is straining under its own success: we have too many people and too few places for them to live, offered at too-high prices, in too many areas touched-by-climate-change-related menaces, like wildfires, all too far from where people work. and the solution is so painfully obvious it feels almost reductive to point it out: make it legal to build more housing that houses more people.

gerson continued that harris and her senate colleagues attempted to force the narrative that americans can believe what they want in private, but can't act on that belief in the public square.
one person who seems particularly worried about the outcome, at least privately, is president-elect joe biden. according to a report tuesday morning from politico, the democrat presidential candidate who became the first since bill clinton in the early 1990s to flip georgia—biden finished barely ahead of trump on nov. 3, and trump contends he still won the state and that fraud led to biden's victory—believes that both warnock and jon ossoff will lose their races on tuesday.
the massively disappointing reality (nb – this is not what remotely what smith, ricardo or cobden had in mind…)
this need to use all our energy, including carbon fuels, becomes all the more apparent if it proves to be true that the earth is literally making more oil, coal, and gas—even as you read these words.
and at that point, that $59 billion in new oil money from the waters off louisiana might come in handy. yes, with new technology, it can be made as clean, but energy is energy, and so if the goal is to create more jobs and more wealth for people, then, for sure, we need to think hard about using all of it. that is, we must do the opposite of leave it in the ground. after all, we have a lot of children to educate, streets to protect, and elderly to take care of.
but trump is unlikely to notice, let alone care. most americans just don't see climate change as a credible problem.
we might further observe that world war two was many things—beyond, of course, the necessary and righteous defeat of fascism. world war two was also about growing the economy; during the four years of fighting, america's gdp rose 48 percent. of course, most of that growth went to war production, and yet even so, personal consumption rose 20 percent, as unemployment fell to one percent. not bad.

but that is a fight about allocation. mcclintock focused on storage, noting that the cheapest and best way to solve the state's water problems — measured in cost per acre-foot — is to build more reservoirs rather than letting much of the state's rainfall run out to sea. mcclintock reminded me that it has been 40 years since california's last dam, the new melones dam, was completed in 1978.

complicating matters is the education levels of recently admitted refugees has plummeted, according to data analyzed by cis. in 1996, only 35 percent of incoming refugees lacked a high school diploma. by 2015, the number had skyrocketed to 51 percent. the low educational attainment levels help explain why 56 percent of refugee households received food stamps or other government benefits in 2015.
sanders has pledged a $16.3 trillion environmental plan that would declare climate change a national emergency and calls for the u.s. to move to renewable energy across the economy until 2050. warren wants to spend $3 trillion over 10 years to move the u.s. to 100% clean energy. and both are aggressive supporters of the green new deal, a sweeping plan to combat climate change.
the new thinking focused on preservation, of both the land and the native people. some of this new thinking was guilt about past ill-treatment of indigenous folk, leading to the present-day idea that they should remain in their environment, living as they always had. and some of it, too, was an emerging ecological consciousness; amazonia is, undeniably, a fascinating and abundant region, and as such, it has become a preoccupation of greens around the world.

and it was important for me to state to the over 30 congressional leaders that were here that the main, the root cause of the problem is that we are a colonial territory of the united states and i wanted to ask them to forcefully take this as a battle of their own, as they have with, for example, statehood for washington, d.c.
so we can see that in his fierce antagonism toward foreign hegemonists, araújo almost sounds like a leftist himself. and yet he's not: he's simply a brazilian nationalist, tired of other countries imposing their will on his country.
ocasio-cortez is a looker and i hazard a guess has had the privilege of turning men into gibbering idiots for most of her adult life. i have little doubt she has been trotting out utter nonsense and yet can make it look convincing and credible because she has hardly ever been challenged on it. this is what happens when beautiful women grow up in leftist circles and are rarely called out for mixing up a billion with a trillion. this builds confidence and sense of entitlement and soon you end up with alexandria ocasio-cortez. then suddenly when she enters congress and her policies are examined by people on the right, she thinks this is down to sexism. no. it's not your sex we have a problem with; it's the socialism.

moreover, the majority of europeans believe that the influx of immigrants into their respective countries will increase both the crime rate and the threat of terrorism. a majority of citizens (57 percent) said that the arrival of large numbers of immigrants will change the culture of their countries.
this brings projected global warming from being potentially dangerous to being easily manageable. which is why, of course, it is unlikely to get much attention from a scientific establishment and a complicit media that much prefers to ramp up the global warming scare – even when the evidence doesn't support it.
trump urging republicans to get out the vote:
the successful government deal comes after kurz was able to score a resounding victory in the austrian national election in september of last year.
biden, however, has shown no indication that he values religious freedom on the domestic front.
can you imagine the scandalised response it would get from the bbc and most of the rest of the mainstream media?
there would be calls for bercow's resignation; endless why oh why? editorials about the decline of parliamentary standards; indignant commentary that parliament's sovereignty was being suborned by narrow cliques…
the argument over climate change has been raging for decades, and yet only in the past few years has it really gained momentum. the 2016 democratic platform was ambitious; it called for getting 50 percent of our electricity from clean sources within a decade, and for reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 80 percent by 2050.

green turtles are in fact remarkably widespread, and are found in tropical, subtropical and temperate waters around the world. they certainly are not dependent on a narrow set of weather conditions. in australia alone, there are seven regional populations of green turtles that nest in different areas; the southern great barrier reef, the northern great barrier reef, the coral sea, the gulf of carpentaria, western australia's north-west shelf, the ashmore and cartier reefs and scott reef. they have also been around for more then 100 million years, so the idea that they will all die out if it gets a bit warmer is palpable nonsense.

the consequences of poor planning, and political infighting, have become clear — from a distance, at least for now. across the ocean, the south african city of cape town, africa's most advanced and cosmopolitan city, provides a new warning. its population has doubled over the past two decades, but it has not built much new water storage capacity — thanks, in part, to the fact that the national government has authority over water and the local government is controlled by the opposition. as a result, the city nearly ran out of water in 2018, forcing severe restrictions on residents.

given that no formal opposition was raised by environmentalists during the approval process for sites, he said, he did not anticipate significant opposition from them — though they were skeptical the reservoir would provide the water promised. watson said the project was consulting with environmental interests to allay those concerns, and to explore their thoughts about how the water should be managed once it had been stored, in the reservoir. he said the management process the project had developed would include local communities and native american groups. and he added that the sites reservoir will have statewide reach by helping recharge depleted aquifers throughout california — an urgent necessity once the state's new groundwater management requirements go into effect in 2020.

the other, johnson, will be leading an economy which has chosen to prioritise virtue-signalling over efficiency, hobbled by any number of green targets, regulations, misallocations of capital and crony-capitalist boondoggles; crippled by needlessly high energy costs. and with his most able minister michael gove in charge — and rumoured to be the man chosen, inter alia, to head britain's hosting of the cop26 climate summit — it's a racing certainty that britain's green-managed decline will be handled with great efficiency.
while perhaps failing to observe the irony of its own reporting, the times juxtaposed the thoroughly discredited population explosion theories of the 1970s with the (equally alarmist) global warming predictions of our day.
smith said that democrats want to strip the paygo provision to pass their progressive agenda.
if such dependency on a potential foe doesn't seem to be a good idea, that's because it isn't. the trump administration has emphasized the need for domestic rare-earth production, but with distinctly limited success, at least so far. and so in the meantime, it would be enormously helpful if we could import rare earths from brazil.
most migrants are clever and hard-working. so their intense competition for jobs and housing lowers wages and inflates housing prices. the resulting housing crisis is most obvious in manjoo's high-migration state of california:

the california department of water resources notes: on average, california receives about 200 million acre-feet of water per year in the form of rain and snow. (it adds that the state rarely experiences an average year.) the state's reservoirs can capture about 42 million acre-feet of that — roughly one-fifth. the rest seeps into underground aquifers, or flows out to the sea.
trump's wall won't stop climate change migrants from streaming into the us
house minority leader kevin mccarthy (r-ca) rushed to minimize the political damage — as well as the potential loss of funds — with a statement assuring the public that the president and his administration understand the severity of the devastation and have delivered for californians.  he added: republicans will offer an amendment to the democrat's [sic] spending bills that will be voted on the floor this week to increase money for forest management that will help prevent and reduce the devastation from wildfires that we saw a couple months ago.

this theory of the non-biological origins—abiogenesis–of oil goes back to the 19th century. and yet even today, among geologists, it's still a decidedly minority viewpoint. still, every time we discover additional carbon-based fuel reserves, that's an indicator that we might be dealing with a lot more than just the remains of the jurassic period. (as an aside, we might observe that the debate over the origins of oil puts useful perspective on the question of whether or not there is truly such a thing as settled science.)
about 84,000 people turned out last weekend for the ninth straight round of anti-government demonstrations across france, according to the french interior ministry.
young has been a longtime critic of trump, even lamenting his past use of his music.
if that is not baffling enough, after cheney comes out of retirement to become vice president under george w. bush (sam rockwell), he puts the uet to work, but only to protect the country from terrorists via the war on terror — all of which mckay rages against in that same tired way michael moore did more than a decade ago.
privately, biden's team does not expect to win the races, according to democratic officials, but they are more optimistic about their chances than they were weeks ago, pager and cassella wrote. though the president-elect narrowly won the state in november, they attribute that to a powerful anti-trump sentiment that did not translate down the ballot. perdue received about 88,000 more votes than ossoff, and the top two republicans combined got more than 636,000 votes than warnock in the special election. one former democratic official said few democrats, if any, are preparing for victory. it's not 'their organizing principle,' the official said of the incoming transition team, adding that their planning has focused on democrats not having control of the senate.
17) the decriminalization of marijuana and the production of higher quality plants in the u.s. versus mexico had a series of unspoken consequences. after marijuana from mexico was not able to compete with u.s.-grown plants, some cartels shifted their model more toward human smuggling–becoming a factor in the 2014 migrant crisis and the current one at the u.s. border.
he also pledged to invest £300 million to tackle nitrogen dioxide emissions in towns and cities, and we are investing £500 million to support the rollout of new rapid charging hubs so that [electric car] drivers are never more than 30 miles away from being able to charge up their car.
and it all ends with mckay blaming cheney for everything wrong in the world, including the california wildfires, isis, and trump — again in that tired michael moore style.
(also, i'm sorry, but using insults like nazi is just moronic. apart from being inaccurate — there are plenty of more damning epithets you could reasonably use on soubry — they're just a gift to the enemy. i'm reminded of those idiots you occasionally see being caught at tommy-robinson-type rallies giving nazi salutes. yes, we know guys that you're doing it sarcastically, in response to endless provocation from leftists doing nazi salutes at you. but don't you realise: that's not how it's going to look after the footage has been edited?)

despite the murky economic picture, bloomberg is not only promising to accept more refugees, but he's also lashing out at those who disagree. last month, during a campaign swing through texas, the former mayor attacked gov. greg abbott (r-tx) for his decision to halt refugee resettlement.

gabbard enters a 2020 democrat primary field which will likely go into double-digits. on new year's eve, sen. elizabeth warren (d-ma) was the first serious democrat presidential contender to launch a white house exploratory committee. former vice president joe biden and former rep. robert francis beto o'rourke (d-tx) are also reportedly considering running for president.
the tragic fact is that as a credentialed scientist—a biologist lecturing at stanford university—ehrlich's proclamation of the end times as well as the means to confront them struck many as the plausible theory of an expert.
the water burst out through the spillway in a constant gush, a mad torrent of white, unstoppable and ferocious. it swept down the smooth concrete — then pounded into the new cracks in the failed spillway, sending a spray hundreds of feet into the air and carving a new chasm in the hillside.

the plan provides $50 billion to expand testing, which is seen as key to reopening most schools by the end of the new administration's first 100 days. about $130 billion would be allocated to help schools reopen without risking further contagion.

since then, the greens and the democrats have upped the ante: in 2017, some congressional democrats introduced legislation eliminating carbon fuel emissions by 2035. more recently, rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez has rallied democrats to the target of ending carbon emissions by 2030.
green leader kogler, meanwhile, stressed the importance for austria to combat climate change and said that the pricing of co2 will be implemented into what he called a greening of the tax system. he also proposed a nation-wide public transit ticket that would cost around three euros per day.
like donald trump in north america, jair bolsonaro in south america is an experiment. both are conservative economic nationalists, both promised during their campaigns to unleash prosperity. both are challenging the entrenched forces of orthodoxy, including green orthodoxy, at home and abroad:

a few brave souls resisted the urge to jump on the population explosion bandwagon, urging calm and rationality. one was economist julian l. simon, who later noted that whatever the rate of population growth is, historically it has been that the food supply increases at least as fast, if not faster.
although de blasio's lawyers have not yet revealed their legal strategy for the lawsuit, they will have to show a connection between the actions of the oil firms and real material damages. since a suit cannot be brought over hypothetical future damages based on climate prophecies, the legal team will be obliged to link the behavior of oil companies to real events — such as hurricane sandy.
during the 2016 republican primary, and as that state's sitting governor, kasich was only able to win with a plurality of ohio votes. other than sen. marco rubio (r-fl) losing his home state to trump, it does not get any more pathetic than that.

the deal — which was not done in consultation with the united states — is seen as a big diplomatic loss for the incoming biden administration, which had promised to develop closer ties with the eu to counteract the rise of china as opposed to president trump's tougher unilateral approach.
we can say that brazil today is a bit like what the u.s. would be like if the land west of the appalachian mountains was mostly proscribed from economic development. (in fact, the u.s. federal government owns a prosperity-crimping 28 percent of the land in this country, although that's a tale for another time.)
in his inaugural address, bolsonaro made it clear that his views haven't changed. for instance, pledging his strong support for the police and the military, he recalled the words ordem e progresso, emblazoned on his country's flag: the national motto is order and progress. no society can develop without respecting these:

berman: you mentioned the hamilton premier in puerto rico over the weekend. some democratic officials were at that event — i think we have some pictures of it which we can show here. do you think that the democrats should have been down there watching a play, instead of working with the president to try to end the shutdown? rosselló: well, they were here also listening for over four hours. they had a hearing. this is the largest congressional delegation in the history of puerto rico, and i thank them for coming over here. i had an opportunity to explain to them the root cause of the problems in puerto rico. we had a discussion about the [hurricane maria] recovery, how some of the recovery's being stalled because of bureaucratic processes that are imposed in puerto rico that are not imposed elsewhere. how we need to start the rebuilding phase to be very effective, and how puerto rico can become a model, and how we're going to implement some of these core concepts that we value, such as tackling inequality, and battling climate change. but it is important underneath all of that, it's the reality that puerto rico, we are treated as second-class u.s. citizens. because we're not a state, we — you know, we get a third of the federal funding for healthcare, for example.

in calling for the rapid implementation of expensive policies, gore was presumably highly confident about his alarming forecast. armstrong was not: a simulation using 150 years of temperature data suggested that, due to natural variation in global temperatures, his chance of winning a bet for as short a period as ten years was only 70 percent.

gore's warning of dangerous warming was based on the predictions of experts. experts, however, have a poor record in forecasting. politicians are not exceptions. as winston churchill observed, the most essential qualification for a politician is the ability to foretell what will happen tomorrow, next month, and next year, and then to explain afterwards why it did not happen.
while he has yet to officially announce steps towards launching a white house bid, o'rourke and his inner circle are said to be courting political operatives in key battleground states and meeting with prominent democrat figures as buzz continues to build around the progressive darling. in november, o'rourke reportedly sat down with former president barack obama in washington, d.c. for what observers believe was a discussion about a potential run. further, david wysong, o'rourke's chief of staff, is said to be in touch with those who worked on obama's presidential campaigns in new hampshire and iowa.

transportation emissions overall make up the largest share of u.s. climate-damaging emissions, according to the u.s. energy information administration. globally, air travel pumps out about 3% of overall emissions of climate-destroying carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. surging growth of air travel in asia and around the world means those emissions will triple by 2050, the united nations says, and recent studies say even that figure underestimates the explosive growth of air travel and its emissions.

another proposal is to build the sites reservoir in the foothills west of the small town of maxwell, just over an hour north of sacramento. as noted earlier, the sites reservoir would store 500,000 acre-feet of off-stream water, meaning that it would not dam an active river, but rather be a site for water from other sites to be stored as available and used as needed. proponents argue that it would contribute to environmental quality as well as the state's storage capacity.

there's a reason barack obama built an entire national campaign apparatus outside of the democratic national committee. there's a reason that, when he didn't activate or continue that, we lost house majorities. because the party — in and of itself — does not have the core competencies, and no amount of money is going to fix that.
under the green new deal, congress must develop a plan for the transition of the united states economy to become carbon neutral by 2030. and to accomplish that, the u.s. will need to make big investments today to jump-start and develop new projects and sectors to power the new economy, which are estimated to be in the tens of trillions of dollars. some of these activists are hoping to get that money by diverting the trillions of dollars needed to build and upgrade our current energy and transportation infrastructures to entirely rebuild the u.s. economy to suit their utopian and unrealistic world view. with hundreds of state and local officials and likely 2020 presidential candidates signing on to support the green new deal, this campaign isn't going anywhere. and neither is its supporters' strong aversion to the oil and natural gas that has made the us a leader in affordable energy, environmental progress, and economic advancements.

because incubation temperature of turtle eggs determines the animal's sex, a warmer nest results in more females. increasing temperatures in queensland's north, linked to climate change, have led to virtually no male northern green sea turtles being born. for the study, scientists caught green turtles at the howick group of islands where both northern and southern green turtle populations forage in the great barrier reef. using a combination of endocrinology and genetic tests, researchers identified the turtles' sex and nesting origin. of green turtles from warmer northern nesting beaches, 99.1% of juveniles, 99.8% of subadults, and 86.8% of adults were female. turtles from the cooler southern reef nesting beaches showed a more moderate female sex bias (65%–69% female).

7:20 pm: breitbart's matt boyle on the ground in georgia, citing a gop campaign official with knowledge of the matter: in hall county alone, there has been a massive increase in election day turnout–which significantly favors republicans. in november, there were 15,000 approximately election day voters there. this time a huge surge to approximately 23,000. at an approximately 70-30 percent split favoring republicans among election day voters, that represents thousands–maybe as many as 7,000 plus–extra votes for the gop candidates this time in that one county alone as compared with november 2020. the gop campaign source told breitbart news that's just one county, and expect to see similar trends across the board in several others.

the vatican just cut a deal with the collaborationist chinese communist party-controlled catholic church, said zmirak. there's a real church, which has been underground and illegal since mao zedong, and then there's been kind of like a vichy french collaborationist wing, where they work for the government. the government appoints the bishops. the government controls everything. the catholic church always condemned that as a communist front group. the vatican just made a deal with the communist front group that they are going to be regarded as the real church, and the underground church has to resign and just go join the communist church.
at the time of the challenge, gore warned that the climate was warming at such a rate that, without immediate action, disasters would occur. his book assault on reason — published in april 2007 — stated that: many scientists are now warning that we are moving closer to several 'tipping points' that could — within as little as ten years — make it impossible for us to avoid irretrievable damage of the planet's habitability for human civilization.
in an opinion piece for the globalist, establishment newspaper, the financial times, gideon rachman said that the european union's claims that the deal will discipline the behaviour of the communist regime are in fact naive.
merkel enthusiastically backed macron a week later, calling for a real, true european army — the prospect of which was often dismissed as a dangerous fantasy by remain campaigners in the run-up to the british vote to leave the bloc.
from boyle in atlanta: the crowd is ecstatic now as loeffler takes her first lead of the night over warnock.
what we have got to do now, sanders said, is to see if we can get a handful of republican senators to understand that climate change is real, that environmental protection is enormously important for this country, and get them on board to demand that trump appoint an epa administrator who represents the american people and not just the fossil fuel industry.
to be a socialist, said sanders, in the sense of what the pope is talking about, what i'm talking about, is to say that we have got to do our best and live our lives in a way that alleviates human suffering, that does not accelerate the disparities of income and wealth.

for decades, policymakers have debated whether to build new reservoirs. one project, the auburn dam, was authorized by congress in 1965 for flood control, but later abandoned over structural and environmental concerns. numerous other proposals have been studied for decades, with little progress at the state or federal level — though local authorities have built their own projects, such as the los vaqueros reservoir in the east san francisco bay, one of the few projects environmentalists have not opposed (though many have since opposed its expansion.)

put simply, researchers such as marlene kretschmer – the expert from the potsdam institute heavily quoted in the new york times piece – are trying to pin recent cold winters on movements of the jet stream. this enables them to promote their global warming is still happening narrative. but for it to work it requires them to write off the recent cold winters, such as the one in 2013/14, as being anomalous – ie abnormally cold.

this is a temptation present in our world, understandable because it is part of our nature, he said.
streisand accuses the trump administration of botching its response to the deadly chinese coronavirus and claims the president stole credit for his red hot economy from former president barack obama. in contrast to streisand's assertions, dr. marc siegel, professor of medicine at new york university, has said the administration has addressed earlier emerging contagion better than the previous administrations.
still, biden is being outspent and sometimes outmaneuvered by rivals with deeper pockets.
nonetheless, the singer-songwriter also took issue with trump continuing to use his music at his famous maga rallies.

so it's entirely likely that we'll be in a political standoff: if not after the 2020 elections, then sometime soon enough. on the one side will the greens, and on the other side will be the carbons. who will win in the end? there's no way to know, of course, but the greens' losing fight with france's yellow jackets should give them pause.
would you still have voted for brexit under those circumstances?
shantytown-caliber poverty is non-existent in china, said sorondo, following a state-supervised visit to the authoritarian country.
that would be perfectly fine with many environmental groups, for whom opposition to dams has become something of an article of faith over the past several decades. dams were once thought to provide an environmentally-friendly source of renewable energy, through hydroelectric power. but they destroy whatever habitat finds itself submerged by reservoirs; impede fish migration; and — if managed poorly — create new hazards, such as mechanical failure.
what we are going to do is take on the health care industry and their $100 billion in profits and move this country toward 'medicare for all', he declared.
a self-professed catholic, as vice president, biden did nothing to interfere with former president barack obama's pro-abortion agenda. in fact, his plans to defend abortion rights will undermine the beliefs of the majority of americans of faith.

indeed, with a bit of whimsy, one might even ask: if mother nature is giving us a gift, should we not feel an obligation to accept it? surely we wouldn't want to offend her by refusing such a gift. after all, as the classic tv commercial from the 70s, warned us, it's not nice to fool mother nature.

but one thing we can say for sure about world war two: it wasn't green. that is, all those factories, all those oil pipelines, all that technology—it was the opposite of the al gore worldview. (or should we say, the world that al gore wants for us.)
that foreshadows california's grim fate — if it cannot find solutions now.
according to mckay, cheney's decades-long obsession to fulfill his destiny through the uet was all about being able to drop bombs and water board a handful of terrorists. to what end? it's like watching the kid in christmas story deliberately destroy his red ryder bb gun after scheming for months to get his hands on it.
needless to say, the thought of digging up amazonia in pursuit of minerals is horrifying—horrifying, that is, to western environmentalists. yet for their part, brazilians seem okay with it; after all, they just voted bolsonaro into office. as this author has argued in the past, if a resource is sitting there, it only makes sense that hungry people will wish to see it utilized. green elites may sentimentalize poverty as living in harmony with nature, but the poor would rather have refrigerators, automobiles, and good health care.
yet brazilians will likely judge bolsonaro on that most familiar of metrics: the economy. the country is, after all, poor—it ranks 110th in the world—and it shouldn't be.

manjoo does not entirely break the media taboo against mentioning the harms caused by mass migration. but he gets close by blaming california's crisis on too many people:
viewed from a small airplane above the oroville dam — at 770 feet, the highest in the u.s. — in march 2017, the future of water storage in california looked doubtful. that year, california's deep drought was broken by record rainfall, filling that dam and many others.

on november 4, 2015, sen. bernie sanders (i-vt) introduced the keep it in the ground act which, according to the weekly standard, would enact [350.org founder bill] mckibben's vision in toto. rep. jared huffman (d-ca) introduced a companion bill in the house a few months later. but soon after, the #nodapl protests at standing rock—which were supposed to galvanize public support behind the keep it in the ground movement and usher in the dawn of the post-fossil fuel era—turned violent. recognizing that extreme activism was not generating the public support they needed to upend u.s. energy policy, the leaders of the kiitg movement made a deliberate decision to change their tactics. almost overnight, orchestrated militant actions were replaced with promises of guaranteed green jobs for all. since then, sanders and rep. huffman have abandoned the keep it in the ground campaign entirely and instead now publicly and enthusiastically endorse the green new deal.
with warming global temperatures and most sea turtle populations naturally producing offspring above the pivotal temperature [14], it is clear that climate change poses a serious threat to the persistence of these populations.
crucially, the sites reservoir appears to have some startup funding. as much as half of the money will come from a special water bond passed by voters in proposition 1 of 2014, which set aside $2.7 billion (of $7.5 billion) for water storage projects. the rest of the project would theoretically be funded by long-term contracts for water not reserved for public use.

some climate advocates said they weren't bothered by the private travel, especially because they view a more carbon-conscious administration as a far better result for the climate than four more years of trump in the white house.

since the end of the little ice age in the 1880s, the planet has warmed by about 0.8 degrees c. you might think that was not a particularly drastic rate of warming to worry about. you might also note that such a rate of warming is well precedented in periods throughout history, such as during the minoan, roman and medieval warming periods. nonetheless this 0.8 degrees c rise – 0.9 degrees c, at a push – is the terrible climatic event the alarmist establishment has been assuring these last few decades is the worst thing ever and something that should worry us awfully.

virtually every labour mp in the commons, formerly proud advocates of women's and workers' rights to workplaces free from bullying, chose to suspend that particular principle last year when serious accusations against the speaker, from more than one reliable source, emerged. normally – and especially if such allegations had involved a conservative minister – labour would have demanded immediate action. but in bercow's case – as lucidly explained by dame margaret beckett mp – the cause of opposing brexit trumps any less important issue such as the rights of commons members of staff.

the perception of the causes of migration has also changed, as a majority of europeans are now convinced that most migrants are attracted to europe by pull factors such as the eu's economy and social benefits, rather than propelled by push factors such as wars, poverty or climate change.

the chinese government attaches great importance to the accident, said chinese foreign ministry spokesperson geng shuang.
are these states, and their elected officials, ever going to submit meekly to some green dictate that says leave it in the ground? that doesn't seem likely. and will lawmakers from, say, louisiana—seeking to defend the new $59 billion worth of newly discovered oil, on top of the previously discovered $2.61 trillion, still waiting to be tapped—find a way to make constructive political alliances with those from states that don't produce energy, but merely consume it? that does seem likely.

yep. it's true that mostly liberals are affected by this – and created this mess. but still, liberals' children feel the cold as badly as conservatives' children. in fact, being less robust and more snowflakey, probably even more so. must they really suffer for their parents' stupidity?
though smaller than nature's own reservoir, california's system of man-made reservoirs is vast — and complex. the public policy institute of california notes that state and federal agencies manage 240 large reservoirs that account for 60% of the state's storage capacity, with the rest of the state's reservoirs owned and operated by local water agencies, or by private entities for use on private lands.

the comparison of this view to the united states' long history of anti-catholic bigotry has been disputed. actually, it is exactly the same as this history in every important respect. a 19th-century bigot would have regarded catholicism as fundamentally illiberal — a backward faith characterized by clerical despotism — and thus inconsistent with america's democratic rules. the same attitude seems currently present in the u.s. senate.
but instead of pursuing these allegations — which normally it would have done, especially in the post #metoo witch hunt climate — our virtue-signalling parliamentarians have proved oddly reluctant to boot out this charmless bruiser. why? because bercow has made it his business to sabotage brexit and most mps, whatever they may think of him personally, are remainers.
