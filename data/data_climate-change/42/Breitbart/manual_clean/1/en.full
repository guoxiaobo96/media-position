The liberal vanguard Tlaib belongs to seeks massive change, from Medicare for all to a grand climate bargain.

Most of the smart money already knew that about renewables and is deeply sceptical. The not-so-smart money still laps the deals up.

But once you get to like the tippy tops, on your 10 millionth dollar, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 percent or 70 percent, that doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more."}
