this might suit johnson and his green crony capitalist chums in the westminster bubble, but as paul homewood notes, metropolitan greenies will largely insulated from the disastrous effects of their eco-fascist policies in the country at large.
friends said that after he left the organization, mr. buckel became involved in environmental causes, which he alluded to in his note as the reason he decided to end his life by self-immolation with fossil fuels, the new york times reported.
material promoting gay and trans lifestyles could be spread across all parts of the curriculum in 120 uk schools. https://t.co/92rpsf1zbu — breitbart london (@breitbartlondon) may 17, 2017
organised by subject, the guide lists suggestions to ensure lgbt visibility across the curriculum, for example recommending teachers set questions which reference homosexual relationships in maths and science, and introduce terminology specific to the lifestyles of sexual minorities in foreign language lessons.
this makes a nonsense of johnson's airy claim that his green revolution will create hundreds and thousands of new jobs. of course it won't. there is plenty of evidence to support heymann's claim. none to support johnson's.
the number of times trump mentioned the following in the #sotu the middle class: 0 climate change: 0 medicaid: 0 student debt: 0 preventing school shootings: 0 plan for dreamers: 0 — young democrats of america (@youngdems) february 5, 2020
in the report, titled climate neutrality: are we ready for an honest discussion?, eric heymann warns that the eu's green ambitions of 'net zero' carbon emissions cannot be achieved without a fall in standards of living, a reduction in international competitiveness, and a loss in personal freedom.
democrat rashida tlaib during her first day as a u.s. congresswoman: we're going to go in and impeach the motherf**ker. pic.twitter.com/hg538zoqlb — kyle morris (@realkylemorris) january 4, 2019
announcing an 'lgbt-inclusive' update to all of its products, education giant pearson has launched a guide to pushing 'social justice' activism in every part of the school curriculum.
blain sees the makings of a 'financial crash' driven by the renewables sector, for wind turbines are not the panacea they may look to gullible investors.
in the year 2020, how can a president of the united states give a state of the union speech and not mention climate change? sanders asked following the conclusion of trump's address to the nation:
in a sit-down interview with anderson cooper for cbs's 60 minutes, rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-ny) floated taxing the wealthy as much as 70 percent to fund her climate change plan called the green new deal.
a friday-published washington post opinion editorial — written by molly roberts and entitled what so wrong with motherf***er? — dismisses criticisms of rep. rashida tlaib's (d-mi) derision of president donald trump as a motherf****r, framing concerns of civility as manifestations of linguistic timidity.
the handbook calls for schools to push a left-wing agenda across every subject, recommending science teachers explore gender stereotypes and barriers to participation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (stem) subjects.
a better politics isn't necessarily a more profane politics. but the left half of the left wants to push broader boundaries, and it's no wonder they worry when the rest of the party starts to pull instead. the liberal vanguard tlaib belongs to seeks massive change, from medicare for all to a grand climate bargain. they see no hope for compromise now, so they look to a future of democratic control, when ramming transformation through will require breaking things. the party establishment so far has shown small desire to do so. and that, tlaib might say, is a motherf—ing shame.
ukip education spokesman david kurten stated that the despicable move is bad news for children and parents, who he pointed out will effectively have no choice but to be exposed to politicised education material due to pearson's position as the largest supplier of textbooks for schools, and the owner of britain's largest exam board, edexcel.
at the moment, he notes, we all get to take key consumption decisions — whether we travel at all, how much we travel and which means of transport we use, whether we live in a large house or a small apartment and how we heat our homes, how many electronic devices we have and how intensely we use them or how much meat and exotic fruit we eat — on the basis of 'income, not on climate considerations.'
she was spotted hopping off a private jet in des moines, iowa, this week and, as the video shows, appears to strategically place herself behind a staffer out of the camera's view:
cooper: do you call yourself a radical?
suggested activities include tasking pupils with devising a campaign to get more women involved in stem, and discussing questions such as why is it important that diverse groups of people, including lgbt people, enter stem professions?
ocasio-cortez: well, i think that it only has ever been radicals that have changed this country. abraham lincoln made the radical decision to sign the emancipation proclamation. franklin d. roosevelt made the radical decision to embark on establishing programs like social security. that's radical.
this, heymann goes on to say, will lead to massive political resistance because prosperity and employment are likely to suffer considerably.
'motherf—er' is filler, writes roberts. it means little more than someone more unpleasant than 'unpleasant' can convey. saying you grab women by the p—y, on the other hand, is truly damaging: it turns members of that gender into something to be played with. calling immigrants an infestation dehumanizes them.
sanders is a huge proponent of the green new deal and has proposed a massive $16 trillion plan as a hallmark of his presidential platform, describing climate change as the single greatest challenge facing our country.
this will feel very familiar to many investors who have seen all the blithe assumption about operating and maintenance costs on all kinds of technological green marvels fail to meet expectations. biowaste generators, biomass, thermal pellets – you name it, and the rosy assumptions failed to materialise because the difficulties in making them work and keeping them working were glossed over by the promoters. most of the smart money already knew that about renewables and is deeply sceptical. the not-so-smart money still laps the deals up. sadly, renewables is likely to become another charming but flawed investment thesis. i am no stranger to investment madness – three times i've invested in airships and lost my dosh every time.
roberts heralds the democrat party's most openly left-wing politicians, casting them as trailblazers pushing against an insufficiently left-wing party establishment. concerns over profanity, she argues, are secondary to championing those with the vision to break what must be broken in america towards ushering in transformational political change:
ocasio-cortez: you know, you look at our tax rates back in the '60s, and when you have a progressive tax rate system, your tax rate, you know, let's say from 0 to $75,000 may be 10 percent or 15 percent, et cetera. but once you get to like the tippy tops, on your 10 millionth dollar, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 percent or 70 percent, that doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more.
ocasio-cortez: yeah, you know, if that's what radical means, call me a radical.
he was not the only democrat outraged over the absence of climate change from tuesday's address.
for example, a study by economics professor dr gabriel calzada alvarez of madrid's university of rey juan carlos found that for every 'green job' created by the spanish government, another 2.2 jobs were destroyed in the real economy. another study, this time in the uk, found that for every green job created by government 'investment' in the renewables industry, 3.7 jobs were destroyed in the real economy.

the charred remains of david buckel were found by a jogger in brooklyn's prospect park.
buckel worked on cases for lamda legal, one of the largest lgbt advocacy and legal groups in the nation.

the climate change agenda is being driven by the metropolitan liberal consensus in london, where few jobs will be at risk. outside of london there is little support for net zero, but people there have little say in policy decisions. polling may suggest otherwise, but the public have been deliberately kept in the dark about the real costs and implications involved.
at a thursday evening moveon.org-hosted event in washington, dc, hours after her swearing-in ceremony as a congresswoman, tlaib said, we're going to go in and impeach the motherf**ker.
uk prime minister boris johnson says he is becoming 'more and more obsessed' with cop26 (the united nations climate conference which britain is hosting later this year).
more recently, a report by the think tank onward has warned that ten million jobs in 'red wall' seats (i.e. traditional labour constituencies in the midlands and north which lent their votes to the conservatives in the 2019 election so that johnson could deliver brexit) face being wiped out in johnson's attempt to reach his 'net-zero by 2050' emissions target.
i pointed this out in june last year in a piece titled britain unleashes a green new deal to kill what's left of the economy.
possibly this is good news for johnson, who, as a reward for this nonsense, may now get more nookie from his eco-activist girlfriend carrie symonds (aka princess nut nut). but it will be an absolute disaster for the country at large, as a number of recent reports and articles make clear.
in history lessons, pupils should study the links between different social justice movements, while art teachers are urged to explore the way that art has been, and is being, used to effect social and political change, including lgbt equality, race equality and tackling climate change.
however, sanders has yet to address his excessive use of private air travel on the campaign trail. federal election commission (fec) filings reveal that the socialist senator spent more on private air travel than his rivals in the final quarter of 2019, spending $1,199,579, precisely, on apollo jets, llc, which the free beacon notes is a luxury private jet charter service.
[it goes, almost without saying, that 'offshore wind' will be playing a major part in boris johnson's green revolution – the one that will supposedly create those 'hundreds of thousands of jobs']
prosperity and employment are likely to suffer considerably.
a recent analysis by a senior economist at deutsche bank, for example, says that the way the european union is selling its 'green deal' is 'dishonest' and poses massive risks for prosperity, the economic system and democracy itself.

despite brushing off criticisms of tlaib's use of vulgar language from unspecified pro-civility crusaders, in a column published in november, roberts called for amplified political censorship across facebook and twitter. she encouraged social media companies to further flex their power to shut down disinformation and false news, terms she neglected to define.
a lifetime of service may best be preserved by giving a life. … honorable purpose in life invites honorable purchase in death. 'this is not new, as many have chose [sic] to give a life based on the view that no other action can most meaningfully address the harm they see. here is a hope that giving a life might bring some attention to the need for expanded actions, and help others give a voice to our home, and earth is heard.
sen. bernie sanders (i-vt), who spent $1.2 million on private air travel in the final quarter of 2019, is outraged that president trump did not mention climate change during tuesday's state of the union address.
boris johnson's obsession with green issues is steering the uk economy to disaster. he needs to go now.

roberts praises tlaib — a self-described democratic socialist aligned with sen. bernie sanders (i-vt) and rep. alexandria ocasio-crotez (d-ny) — for articulating a cogent case of the country in crisis via the trump administration.
ocasio-cortez: there's an element where, yeah, people are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes.
claiming an inclusive curriculum is a crucial part of tackling homophobic bullying in schools, the handbook advises ways in which teachers can alter lessons across the syllabus so lgbt pupils see themselves represented in what they're learning.
a gay man and attorney who worked on high-profile lgbt cases, including a challenge the boy scouts ban on homosexual members, set himself on fire on saturday at a public park in new york city to protest fossil fuels and climate change, according to a suicide note.
the vast majority of suggestions go far beyond issues of visibility and representation, however, with most of the handbook's tips for creating an lgbt-inclusive curriculum promoting hard-left 'social justice' activism and identity politics in the classroom.

david buckel, 60, was found in the park at 6.30 a.m. on saturday before hundreds descended on it to enjoy the warm spring weather. he left a note in a bag for police which read: 'my name is david buckel and i just killed myself by fire as a protest suicide. i apologize to you for the mess, the note said.
former vice president joe biden (d) also spent over $1 million on private air travel, followed by sen. elizabeth warren (d-ma), who spent $720,518 in the fourth quarter of the year.

advice on teaching maths includes an example lesson in which children learn about codebreaker alan turing. teachers are instructed to provide pupils with some information about alan turing's life, including the arrest and trial for his relationship with another man, and to introduce a discussion on the historical treatment of gay people by the secret services.
not mentioned during #sotu: – the climate disaster
'the green agenda is not just a load of green nonsense,' he claims. 'if you do it right, it's the opportunity to create hundreds of thousands of jobs.'
writing about the need to stamp out anti-lgbt bullying in a foreword to the guide, the senior vice-president for schools at pearson uk, sharon hague, said: lgbt students will only feel comfortable to be themselves if they also get to see themselves in their classrooms.
the brutal reality is offshore wind is far less efficient than promised and requires much more expensive maintenance. they break down, sink into their foundations and don't generate anything like the power expected. for all the due diligence, they simply won't ever make any money unless the price at which they sell energy is dramatically increased – at which point they make zero sense.

pearson's president for core markets, rod bristow, said the company will use the handbook to help update our own products and resources to ensure they are lgbt inclusive.
[p]eople are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes, ocasio-cortez told cooper in a preview clip of sunday's show while comparing herself to former presidents abraham lincoln and franklin d. roosevelt.
i know that 'eco-dictatorship' is a nasty word. but we may have to ask ourselves the question whether and to what extent we may be willing to accept some kind of eco-dictatorship (in the form of regulatory law) in order to move towards climate neutrality.
pollution ravages our planet, oozing inhabitability via air, soil, water, and weather, buckel wrote in the email sent to the times. most humans on the planet now breathe air made unhealthy by fossil fuels, and many die early deaths as a result — my early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves.
cooper: what you are talking about, just big picture, is radical agenda compared to the way politics is done right now.
if we are to achieve climate neutrality, we will need to change our behaviour in all these areas of life because it is impossible to do any of the above things in a carbon neutral way. the only way this is likely to happen, he warns, is through government compulsion.
boris johnson's green revolution is a slow motion train crash in the making. even those invested in 'climate change' as a genuine threat are starting to wake up to the problem.
maths should be about maths, it should not be about sexualizing children, he told breitbart london, warning the new textbooks will make it significantly more difficult for parents to protect their children from the malign influence of left-wing identity politics.
he was protesting over climate change, his note read, and the dramatic method was intended as a metaphor for how fossil fuels are destroying the planet, the mail reported.

'creating an lgbt-inclusive curriculum' was produced by lgbt activist group stonewall and is sponsored by pearson, which owns the exam board edexcel and publishes thousands of school textbooks as one of the uk's biggest education companies.
let's repeat that phrase for the dimmer kids at the back of the class, johnson.
