what biden had initially anticipated would be announced by christmas day, has stretched into the new year. that breaks with recent norms for an incoming president to make attorney general among his first cabinet picks. it's also heightened the calls for biden to address issues of diversity and racial injustice through his selection to lead the department.
though there have been no credible allegations of any issues with voting that would have affected the election, a dozen gop senators -- a handful of whom will be sworn-in sunday -- have announced they will object to counting votes in biden's clear electoral college win during what has traditionally been a ceremonial exercise on capitol hill. president donald trump has been pushing for congress to try to overturn the election result, but his vice president has sought to keep a safe distance from the more inflammatory claims and behavior of his fellow republicans -- while subtly egging them on when it suits him.

consumers can also take little comfort from firestone's explanation of why it took so long to identify the firestone failure problem. according to firestone, the problem eluded them because manufacturers never properly analyzed data and personnel claims to identify defects or problems with tires. they say the university of claims data is simply too small. but a staff examination of the records, revealed since 1995 firestone had reports on more than 1,600 lawsuits, property claims and personal injury claims involving their recalled tires. i must say i find it curious that firestone did not regard 1,600 claims as significant when it took only 21 claims for state farm insurance company to decide that a potential problem existed. records available to the committee also indicate that some in firestone, in apparent contradiction of its statements to committee staff and others, analyzed their claims dated 1998. these firestone analyses show that the claims were especially high for atx tires, and the claims were highest for tires produced at the decatur, illinois, plant. contrary to firestone's other assertions, at least one other american tire company, goodyear, says it routinely looks at all its customer data, including claims data, to identify defect or failure trends with its tires. whatever else we learn at the hearing today, we hope that we will find that all involved will find the need for more open and detail communication regarding these critical products and how they perform in the field.

your workplace retirement plan (whether 401(k), 403(b), tsp, etc.) comes with specific tax benefits. if it's a traditional 401(k) (or equivalent plan), you get to reduce your taxable income by a dollar for every dollar you put in. so if you save $18,500 (the limit for 2018 if you're under 50 years old; it's $24,500 if you're age 50 or older) in a 401(k), your taxable income will be reduced by $18,500 that year. that means you'd get to pocket a rather nice tax savings that year and not have to pay taxes on any of that money until you withdraw it in retirement.

god's faithful people and the church's mission continue to suffer greatly as a result of abuses of power and conscience and sexual abuse, and the poor way that they were handled, as well as the pain of seeing an episcopate (body of bishops) lacking in unity and concentrated more on pointing fingers than than on seeking paths of reconciliation.
in new jersey's liberty park, he shed coat and tie to speak before a backdrop containing the statue of liberty, ellis island and the skyline of lower manhattan. scarlet-clad korean girls sang god bless america; an irish war-pipe band in kilts played martial music from the homeland of reagan's ancestors; and polish dancers stepped out gracefully in their peasant regalia. reagan's main coup was to present stanislaw walesa, 64, the father of the leader of the workers' protest in poland, to the cheering crowd. walesa, who lives in jersey city, is not a u.s. citizen and has no political preferences. no matter. he helped reagan by joining in a chorus of god bless america. reagan candidly proclaimed his reason for opeing this phase of his campaign in hudson county, n.j. i'm here because it's the home of democrats, he said. in this great country there are millions of democrats as unhappy as we are with the way things are going. honoring the generations of immigrants, reagan, in top oratical form, once again evoked the words of a democratic president by putting a twist on jack kennedy line: they didn't ask what this country could do for them, but what they could do for them, but what they could do to make this refuge the greatest home of freedom in history. but today a president of the u.s. would have us believe that dream is over, or at least in need of change.

sen. john kerry celebrates on stage after winning the new hampshire primary in 2004. your e-mail alerts new hampshire nevada south carolina iowa or or create your own washington (cnn) -- nevada and south carolina will likely join iowa and new hampshire as kickoff states for the democratic presidential nominating process in 2008 after a panel voted to recommend the measure to the party's national committee saturday. the full democratic national committee is expected to approve it when it meets next month in chicago, illinois. the dnc's rules and bylaws committee chose nevada and south carolina over eight other states and the district of columbia, which petitioned the dnc for an early position on the presidential primary and caucus calendar. alabama, arizona, arkansas, colorado, hawaii, michigan, mississippi and west virginia were also vying for early slots. if the measure is approved, democrats will schedule four nominating contests before february 5, 2008, forcing the party's presidential hopefuls to expand their campaign efforts beyond the hawkeye and granite states. the goal is to increase diversity in the nominating process, according to the dnc. the republican party is not planning to alter its 2008 presidential primary calendar. the nevada caucus would fall between the iowa caucus and new hampshire primary, and south carolina would hold a primary one week after the granite state contest. some democrats say the move would encourage candidates to devote too many resources at the beginning of the nomination process, and could lead to an all-but-official nominee by the first week in february.

moreover muskie hurt his own image as the judicious, controlled candidate by sobbing in the snows of new hampshire, ironically at the very time that nixon in peking was acting as the healer of international passions. this outburst was partly the result of muskie's emotional and physical fatigue. trying to be all things to all people, and torn by his commitments to so many primary campaigns, he lost his sense of direction, creating doubts about his ability to stand up under pressure. fed up. muskie's overconfident staff had also erred badly in ignoring grass-roots organizational work. in a primary, voters have to be coaxed to go to the polls and persuaded to select a particular name out of a crowded field. in new hampshire, the muskie camp had to send out-of-state organizers in at the last minute to get out a favorable vote. muskie now concedes that entering the florida primary was a mistake; once wallace had entered, he should have known it was hopeless and avoided that first big blow to his front-running status. he relied heavily for support in florida upon its democratic state legislators -- but they were tied down by their duties in tallahassee and were of little help. muskie came out of his florida defeat in a new fighting mood. he tackled specific issues, such as taxes and the economy, and began berating his competitors. yet the turnabout gave muskie the impression of a man lashing out in desperation, seeking a new image. muskie's dilemma is painfully difficult.

jinju's unique bibimbap comes with yukhoe -- raw strips of julienned beef. graham holliday
the mood of the voter as the race begins in earnest, the public is wary, worried -- and waiting (time, september 15, 1980) -- disenchanted, but not apathetic. caring about issues, although much more concerned about character. longing for a strong person to trust, but fearful of strength lacking sound judgment. leery of weakness, but edgy about brashness. all too mindful of the disappointments of the past, but seeking hope in the future. leaning toward one man, but often out of desperation and a sense of disdain for the others. uncommitted. unpredictable. as the 1980 presidential campaign swings into full stride, the american voter is displaying a show-me attitude as perhaps never before: wary, worried and waiting to see how the candidates perform. this unwontedly watchful and volatile electorate has already turned the race into a highly personal, potentially nasty, intensely competitive -- and, yes, exciting -- contest. the voters who could give republican challenger ronald reagan a lead as high as 28% over president jimmy carter in july and then snatch it all away in august can hardly be regarded as the rock- ribbed supporters of party and candidates that flourished in days of yore. and if the reagan rise was giddy and the carter comeback startling, the gadfly persistence of independent john anderson adds even more bite and confusion. he blithely dismisses reagan as irrelevant -- a product of the '20s -- and accuses carter of abandoning his autobiographical guery of why not the best?

the final takeaway is that we as a society need investigative journalists more than ever. what finally started this reckoning and ended this decadeslong cycle of abuse was investigative reporting. without that first indianapolis star story in august of 2016, without the story where rachael came forward publicly shortly thereafter, he would still be practicing medicine, treating athletes and abusing kids. let that sink in for a minute. right now, he would be at his office … not far from this courtroom and the michigan state university campus abusing children, had it not been for the investigative reporters and rachael who brought this case. we know federal law enforcement did not stop him nor did trainers or coaches or deans or medical supervisors. victim disclosures to adults didn't stop him. reporters began the story and excellent victim-centered, offender-focused police and prosecutors grabbed the baton and brought us here today.

raising your deductible is a good idea only if you have money to cover costs in an emergency. one option: set aside money saved on premiums to pay your deductible if something goes wrong. drivers nationwide paid average premiums of $1,325 in 2016, so if you pay the average, raise your deductible from $250 to $500, and save 7%, you'd pay $92.75 less each year for auto insurance. put the $92.75 into savings, and you'll have $250 to cover the higher deductible in just 2 1/2 years. drivers make claims around once every 17.9 years -- so there's a good chance you'll have time to save up and be able to pocket extra premium savings for many years to come.

anderson's prospects of taking more votes from carter in new york will be strengthened if, as expected, he gets a place on the state's liberal party ballot. as for the carter staff, it has been astonished by its candidate's catch-up last week: that reagan is doing our work for us.' other advisers are more cautious. campaign manager robert strauss professes to be worried that carter's rally will generate overconfidence. says he: i don't think reagan necessarily is dumb. i don't think he is going to get us into atomic warfare. i don't think he is evil. he's a very likable, attractive man. but strauss pinpoints carter's re-election strategy: to portray reagan as simplistic and not equipped to be president. proud of his presidential performance, carter intends to play up his record. still, the president's main theme will be to attack reagan. sums up hamilton jordan, carter's chief strategist: we can have a philosophical discussion about all the issues that face the american people, but the fact is the american people face a choice: jimmy carter or ronald reagan. strauss long ago correctly guessed that reagan's advisers would limit his public appearances. says strauss: they're going to try to show just a little bit of leg, but not enough to get him into trouble. by contrast, carter will join the rough-and- tumble exchange of town meetings and press interviews, where he has invariably been at his best. contends strauss: the public likes very much to see the president in the flesh, nonstructured and nonpackaged.

so how is this a tax trap? the potential problem is that the exclusion is available only for property that's been used as your principal residence during at least two of the five years preceding the sale. there are special rules that reduce that requirement to just one year if you need to leave your home for long-term care in a nursing home or other institution, but failing to meet the requirement can eliminate the exclusion entirely. moreover, if you decide to change the nature of the home to a nonqualified use -- such as renting it out -- then capital gain that's attributed to the period of nonqualified use can be taxable.

the second lesson i take away and hope others do, is that anyone can be a perpetrator, anyone can be a serial sexual abuser. this defendant stole, cheated and lied. he stole these victims' innocence. he lied about his behavior and he cheated parents and the community and the world of the trust they held in doctors, prominent physicians and prominent community members. experts teach on this issue. russell strand teaches on offender dynamics and behavior. strand talks about how abusers have three personas. the first is the public one for all to see. the second is the uninhabited persona, what you only let others close to you see. we all have those two personas, but the third is the hidden and secret one. it's hidden in the mind and the eyes and beliefs of the perpetrator. and that persona is often hidden well. serial child molesters hide among us. we know that this defendant had a good persona, a good public persona at least. he was the good guy, the goofy guy and olympic doctor, the medical school professor, the gymnastics god. he was a religious and pious man, a father, a husband, a friend, a school board candidate, a man of honor and passion. so kind and giving and always approachable. he never charged for his services and he saw patients basically anywhere.

research backs them up. in a 2016 study by the center for american women and politics, a large majority of 83 representatives used personal anecdotes to describe how they and their colleagues are more collaborative and results-oriented than men. with notable exceptions, the cross-party women-to-women partnerships have been impressive, especially given the stunning disparity (about four to one) between the democratic and republican percentages of women in the two parties. from that point of view, even as an ardent democrat myself, i see the value of increasing the number of republican women in the house. what i know is that women at the edge of a political spectrum have told me, in dozens of conversations, that they can often find common cause with women on the opposite edge.

we may now have a nominee by the time the window opens, said harold ickes, a dnc member from the district of columbia. choosing the nominee so early would preclude other states from taking part in the process, which could result in republicans getting more media coverage later on because gop contenders will still be battling it out, critics say. supporters contend a change is necessary to bring diversity into the selection process. south carolina's black population is about 29 percent, and nevada's hispanic's population is about 23 percent, according to the u.s. census bureau. nevada also has a heavy union population, 14 percent, a key constituency for the democrats. this is a net plus for democracy, but it is also a net plus for the democratic party which is trying to rebuild from the bottom up and also trying to include more voices in the process of who selects our nominee, said donna brazile, a dnc rules committee member from the district of columbia, who also serves as a cnn political commentator. she also was former vice president al gore's campaign manager in the 2000 presidential race. the new structure could dilute the influence new hampshire wields in choosing the democratic presidential nominee. it affects iowa less because the iowa caucus remains the first contest on the nominating calendar. new hampshire officials have led opposition to the plan, fearing that it will marginalize the state's role of holding the first-in-the-nation primary.

the central problem today with the income tax is not its rate structure, but with what it covers – and what it doesn't cover. in particular, the income tax rates do not apply to unrealized appreciation, which is what happens when the rich get richer without so much as touching actual cash. to illustrate, the radical corporate income tax cuts in president trump's signature tax bill, the tax cuts and jobs act, led to a rise in stock prices that benefitted stock owners, tax-free. warren buffett's berkshire hathaway, for one ready example, got a one-time $29 billion windfall from trump's tax cuts. as the principal owner, buffett himself benefited to the tune of billions. but buffett paid no tax on his very good day.

president dudley: i think it means what it says. it doesn't say it's a week, a month, a couple months. fairly soon means in the relatively near future. i think the key thing in terms of thinking about monetary policy is -- what are we basically communicating to people in the markets? we've basically been saying that if the economy continues on the trajectory that it's on, slightly above-trend growth, gradually rising inflation, we're going to continue to remove monetary policy accommodation. so let's look at what we've actually gotten. it seems to me that most of the data we've seen over the last couple months is very much consistent with the economy continuing to grow at an above-trend pace, job gains remain pretty sturdy, inflation has actually drifted up a little bit as energy prices have increased. so we're very much on the trajectory that we said -- that we thought we'd be on and we said if we were on that trajectory we're going to gradually remove accommodation. what else have we seen? we've also seen things that should make us even more confident that this is going to continue in the future. after the election we've seen very large increases in household and business confidence, we've seen very buoyant financial markets -- the stock market is up, credit spreads are narrow. and we have the expectation that fiscal policy will probably move in a more stimulative direction.

by contrast, voters were urged to trust muskie, the man of integrity. that strategy might have been sound if the premises had been right. muskie at his best is far more inspiring than nixon, who does have credibility problems and is unpredictable. nixon had sounded shrill and unfair as he tried to link democrats with crime, drugs and antiwar violence during the 1970 congressional campaigns, while muskie on that election eve effectively deplored such tactics and appealed for a return to reason. perhaps the voters did long for a calmer, loftier leader. to further the bandwagon psychology, the muskie strategists won endorsements from big names in the party: california senator john tunney, ohio governor john gilligan, illinois senator adlai stevenson iii, iowa senator harold hughes, pennsylvania governor milton shapp. each new name made the nomination seem that much more inevitable. this was organizing the party drive from the top down, rather than from the bottom up. suddenly, the edifice began to crumble, and the entire strategy was shattered. democratic voters showed that in primaries, at least, they were not all that concerned about finding a contrast with nixon. they were not looking for a unifier and mollifier. they were in a balky, grumpy mood. they wanted specific answers to specific problems that plagued them. they were more interested in voting against the status quo, and men like george mcgovern and george wallace seemed to offer that chance to protest.

he likes it too. the carter television campaign will stress his heavy responsibilities as president and portray him as being deeply concerned about the particular problems of unemployed blue-collar workers and older people. to tape his commercials, carter has slipped quietly into a suburban alexandria, va., home to chat with eight housewives in a backyard. he has eluded the press to go to a construction site in maryland to listen to workers, and he has visited a senior citizens' center in the district of columbia. so far, the carter travel schedule is much more flexible than reagan's; stops are generally set for only a week or two in advance. he expects to travel just two or three days a week, holding just one major event a day -- appearances timed of maximum free tv news coverage. to cut costs, he intends to avoid overnight trips as much as possible and has asked campaign aides to double up in hotels or stay with friends while on trips. geographically, the carter advisers place great emphasis on the president's need to hold the south, where in 1976 he electoral votes. the democrats know they must also win some states that carter lost to gerald ford in 1976, including michigan, connecticut, iowa and new mexico. differing with reagan's assessment, they now see new hope of mounting a serious challenge in california, where carter pollster pat caddell has the president trailing by only eight points. similarly, carter will work hard in texas, where he sees possibilities.

cnn's john king: campbell, senators, good evening, first.
significantly, the survey found that voters still saw centrist humphrey as the democrat with the best chance to be nominated and, if nominated, to beat nixon. according to the time/yankelovich survey, mcgovern trailed both wallace and humphrey among blue-collar workers and union members, but he still got 25% of their votes. more than any other, mcgovern came through as someone you can trust. improbably, he won the fourth congressional district, on the blue-collar and ethnic south side of milwaukee, with the largest concentration of poles in the state. muskie, who had emphasized his polish ancestry, finished fourth. cross-overs. wallace and mcgovern worked the same vein of economic distress, but the mcgovern vote was moderate-liberal, according to the survey, while the wallace vote was essentially moderate- conservative. mcgovern fared well with young voters (47%); wallace did poorly. the final results were complicated, of course, by the fact that 26% of the votes cast in the democratic primary came from republicans and independents. the cross-overs cost humphrey a second-place finish, since most of them went to wallace. yankelovich found, however, that most of the cross-overs came not as spoilers but as voters anxious to make their views known on the economy and other issues. wisconsin served to prolong and compound the suspense of the race. it established the major democratic theme -- a profound economic disgruntlement -- but not a party leader. it's kind of a scramble now, humphrey said last week. coming out of wisconsin, muskie still led in committed delegate votes, with 96 1/2.

: we love you. but you're voting for mcgovern, replied humphrey. said the woman: yes, but we love hubert humphrey. george wallace planned only a minimal campaign in wisconsin, where busing was not an issue, and he had virtually no organization. but when he sensed the crowd's mood at his first rally in milwaukee on march 23, wallace abruptly changed his schedule. suddenly all his earlier explanations about our inability to rent halls because of basketball games became academic. wallace sought his little man with eleven rallies in eight days and a flurry of local television interviews. he repeatedly brought up busing as a philosophical issue. he complained that the other candidates were horning in on his populist issues: i dig the bone up and throw it out there, and the big dogs grab it. i'm just a little dog from alabama. mcgovern's television commercials confirmed the wallace complaint. if you want lower property taxes, you want george mcgovern, said one. it's as simple as that. but mcgovern emphasized direct campaigning. in oblique reference to lindsay's stylish and futile tv campaigns in florida and wisconsin, one mcgovern press release claimed: the day of the media candidate is over. people have stopped watching television commercials and started listening to details. top-heavy. despite his efforts to sharpen his stand on issues, muskie failed to come across clearly on any topic. his organization, top-heavy with endorsements and contributors, never took root on the local levels where primaries are won. he failed to define a constituency.

washington (cnn) -- president bush, in philadelphia on tuesday urging americans to perform community service, has directed his cabinet to report within 30 days on ways to boost volunteerism, an administration official said. the directive is part of the president's usa freedom corps initiative, detailed in his state of the union address in january, calling on americans to give at least two years of service, the equivalent of 4,000 hours, to others. bush renewed that call in philadelphia, where he participated in a discussion on volunteerism that was preceded by a tour of the people's emergency center, a shelter for homeless women and children. this is a good place to come and start a dialogue, the president said. societies change one heart, one soul, one conscience at a time, and government can hand out money but it cannot put hope in people's hearts. bush said volunteerism has increased since his state of the union address, and said he had instructed government agencies to make it easier for americans to volunteer. a senior administration official said the president wants federal agencies to review service opportunities and barriers. lindsey kozberg, communications director for the usa freedom corps, said the goal is to get the federal house in order so that we know where service opportunities exist, we make sure the public knows about those opportunities and we ... break down any barriers or hindrances to volunteer service that exist in our regulations or programs.

voter confidence in reagan's ability to handle the economy has dropped from an impressive 75% to 66%, and his perceived competency in foreign affairs has slipped from 72% to 63%. the californian still worries voters on a basic level: 54% of those surveyed feel that he often does not get his facts straight, and 48% fret that he may be trigger happy. despite these declines, reagan still scores higher than carter in such voter-valued categories as standing up to the soviets, keeping our defenses strong, getting the hostages out of iran and making americans feel good about themselves. on other matters, voters cannot see a major difference between carter and reagan on such matters as who could find more jobs for the unemployed, provided moral leadership, cut back u.s. dependence on foreign oil, or avoid making too many campaign promises. geographically, there has been a significant shift in carter's 1980 popularity in the south. among white southern protestants, reagan leads by 48% to 39%, indicating he has made inroads among the potentially influential evangelical and fundamentalist voters who supported carter in 1976. this leaves carter with a statistically insignificant 1% lead in his home territory. reagan commands a 10% margin in the west, while carter barely stays ahead in the northeast and midwest. this time the survey was deepened to poll more thoroughly in the nation's key industrial states (indiana, michigan, illinois, ohio, pennsylvania, new jersey and new york). the aim was to detect any notable shifts in the blue-collar vote.

as a society, our response cannot be that he couldn't do this. or that i knew his character, i knew he wasn't capable of this kind of crime. it's because no one wants to see it. the only person who sees this side are his victims. then the perpetrator goes back, shows only what he wants the world to see. this is how he got away with this for so long and got people to believe him over the many, many, many victims who reported. anyone can be an abuser. the third takeaway from this week is that delayed disclosure of child sexual abuse is not unique. in fact, it's quite the norm. kids don't report sexual abuse right away, either because the abuser is a trusted adult, especially when it's a doctor, especially when they are so young and have no sexual experience to understand what is wrong.

he cited recent news stories about a newly developed technique for shielding aircraft and other weapons against detection by enemy radar. before a cheering audience of businessmen in jacksonville, reagan claimed this had been the most tightly classified, most highly secret weapons information since the manhattan project. disclosure normally would be illegal, he said. but he charged that the breach of secrecy was blessed and sanctioned by the carter administration itself clearly for the sole political purpose of aiding mr. carter's troubled campaign. as a result, the soviet union has been handed a ten-year head start on developing ways to counter this type of ultrasophisticated weapons system. defense secretary harold brown angrily denied that the leaks about the defense technique were politically motivated. responding to the reagan blast, press secretary jody powell declared: any implication that the president or secretary of defense acted in a manner which damaged the security of this country is wrong and not responsible and goes beyond the acceptable grounds of political partisanship. governor reagan doesn't know what he's talking about. with each candidate so eagerly on the attack so early, the 1980 presidential campaign could swing on a single event in such a volatile year. if held, the debates could turn the trick- perhaps even the very first one. but the candidates are all anxiously looking over their shoulders, wondering when lightning might strike. the reaganites talk nervously, and sarcastically, of an october surprise, some international event that carter will be able to exploit as the incumbent.

sun flips magnetic field (cnn) -- the poles of the sun's powerful magnetic field have reversed, signaling a time of peak solar activity that could spell trouble for planet earth, astronomers said this week. the sun's magnetic north and south poles were in their respective northern and southern hemisphere several months ago. yet since then they have migrated to the opposite sides of the star. the bipolar flip did not take astronomers by surprise. it takes place like clockwork on the sun, once about every 11 years. this always happens around the time of solar maximum, nasa physicist david hathaway said in a statement. the magnetic poles exchange takes place at the peak of the sunspot cycle. in fact, it's a good indication that solar max is really here. during solar max or solar maximum, the sun tends to exhibit more sunspots and eruptions, and jettison more solar flares, which send powerful streams of charged particles into the solar system. solar blasts heading toward earth can stoke up beautiful auroras in the nighttime sky, and wreak havoc on communications satellites and electrical power grids. astronomers consider the current solar maximum more powerful than average, but less intense than the last two in 1989 and 1979. earth's magnetic fields also change places but with much less predictability and frequency. the reversals take place between intervals lasting from 5,000 to 5 million years. the last one happened 740,000 years ago, scientists estimate. some suggest the planet is overdue for another one.

earlier this week u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said he believed bin laden and taliban spiritual leader mullah mohammed omar were inside afghanistan but we are looking at some other places as well from time to time. rumsfeld noted there were dozens of conflicting intelligence reports each day and said most of them were wrong. most of the reports are based on sightings by local afghans that cannot be verified. there are reports that bin laden and his convoys have been sighted recently by a predator unmanned aerial vehicle. a senior defense department source said the lack of credible information about the two was so severe that many officials believe the u.s. would catch bin laden or omar only through pure luck, or an intelligence break -- essentially one of their associates turning them in. top cia analysts who track bin laden and omar have been asked for their best assessment on the two men's whereabouts. that has led to a variety of thoughts, placing bin laden in afghanistan, in pakistan or iran, on the open ocean onboard a ship, or headed north through tajikistan or uzbekistan -- if he is still alive. the videotape seen worldwide several weeks ago of bin laden talking about the september 11 attacks was made in kandahar. he then apparently disappeared -- possibly going north to tora bora. franks said there was evidence bin laden was in tora bora but he gave no indication of when that might have been.

those charges, of course, are coming from the same cohort of lawmakers now trying to refashion them as evidence to support their actions. the group's citation of a poll that underscores voters' distrust in the election process ignores trump's role in ginning up an increasingly paranoiac strain of conservatism -- one that is shape-shifting now, in the final days of his presidency, into what is likely to become an enduring and corrosive political faction. that their announcement came on the eve of a new congress, and for some less than a day before they take their oaths on the senate floor, provided an immediate preview of trumpism's sticking power and how it might manifest itself -- with more diplomatic language, but no less authoritarian tendencies -- in the coming years.

tonight, we open a new door to the future. mr. reagan calls it tokenism. we call it america. ever since i graduated from elmore high, i've been a democrat. i was attorney general of my state; then a u.s. senator. then, an honest, caring man - jimmy carter - picked me as his running mate and in 1976 i was elected vice president. and in 1980, ronald reagan beat the pants off us. so tonight, i want to say something to those of you across our country who voted for mr. reagan - republicans, independents, and yes, some democrats: i heard you. and our party heard you. after we lost we didn't tell the american people that they were wrong. instead, we began asking you what our mistakes had been. and for four years, i listened to all of the people of our country. i traveled everywhere. it seemed like i had visited every acre of america. it wasn't easy. i remember late one night, as i headed from a speech in one city to a hotel a thousand miles away, someone said to me, fritz, i saw you on tv. are those bags under your eyes natural? and i said, no, i got them the old-fashioned way. i earned them. to the thousands of americans who welcomed me into your homes and into your businesses, your churches and synagogues: i thank you. you confirmed my belief in our country's values. and you helped me learn and grow.

all calmness on the outside -- serene -- but when crisis strikes, it's into the phone booth. he has other useful traits as well. accused at a university of wisconsin rally of being a warmonger for voting for passage of the gulf of tonkin resolution, mcgovern did not turn peevish as muskie has done in the face of similar baiting. instead, mcgovern asked that those who believed the charge raise their hands; when less than six hands shot up, mcgovern moved on to other matters. he has successfully overcome his image as a one-issue peace candidate by promoting his stands on income distribution, tax, reform and decreased defense spending. mcgovern projects simplicity, honesty and candor. he remains confident despite the many democratic leaders who still dismiss his candidacy. meanwhile, stone by stone, george moves on. what happened to muskie? in just one month, maine's ed muskie slipped from the position of the serene front runner to that of an embattled man on the verge of being knocked completely out of the race for his party's nomination for president. before the plunge, much of the press (including time) and many politicians saw him as almost a certain first-ballot winner at the democratic convention in july. now he could easily turn out to be what president nixon derisively termed him after the 1970 congressional elections: the george romney of the democratic party. what went wrong? no single reason, or incident, can be cited to explain muskie's decline.

the simple fact is that even if a deal gets cuts tonight to keep the government open, we will almost certainly be right back at the brink of shutdown in five days or two weeks or a month. passing any sort of continuing resolution won't preserve the daca program or provide funding for president donald trump's much-ballyhooed border wall. it won't change the dynamic at all.

there is no easy or risk-free course of action. some have argued we should wait -- and that is an option. in my view, it is the riskiest of all options -- because the longer we wait, the stronger and bolder saddam hussein will become. we could wait and hope that saddam does not give weapons to terrorists, or develop a nuclear weapon to blackmail the world. but i am convinced that is a hope against all evidence.

what they're trying to do is hold the republicans in line by raising questions about judgment, about loyalty, about maybe political motivations or we're you leaking. it's all a side show, but it's an important side show politically to keep republicans from breaking. tapper: laura coates, your take on, this time, not the president but

the policy represents a major reversal from the approach of the obama administration which in 2014 committed the us to largely adhering to the 1997 ottawa convention, the international agreement which banned the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel landmines. the obama policy committed to replacing landmines in the us stockpile after they expire and directed the destruction of stockpiles not required for the defense of south korea.
speaking of paperwork, you may need to bring a lot more with you. pandemic aside, spain, for instance, reserves the right to refuse entry to tourists -- even those with valid visas, or who qualify for visa-free travel -- if they cannot provide proof of where they will be staying, a documented itinerary or a round-trip flight. in addition, anyone wishing to enter spain must demonstrate that they have sufficient means of support available to enter spain -- that means at least €90 per day of your trip, and a minimum of €810 for your entire trip (even for a cheeky weekend city break). the days of freewheeling around europe as the mood takes you may be over for the brits.

let's make this abundantly clear: this process ends with the certification of joe biden as the 46th president of the united states. everything in between now and the final elector tally being read off is noise. boisterous. unruly. likely unseemly. at times barely tethered to reality. but it's not actionable or tangible in terms of having an actual effect. that being said, however long it takes -- and it will not be a short day -- this ends the same way: biden is inaugurated on january 20.

in a moment of rare introspection for a presidential candidate, anderson last week talked at length to time correspondent eileen shields during a flight from detroit to washington about the dilemma posed by the nature of the politician process in 1980. i have a fundamental conflict in my thinking that troubles me deeply, he said. i know if i want to please a crowd i repeat, just as reagan does, the tried-and-true crowd-pleasers over and over again. but i am really going to repeat in my prayers every night the hope that i can resist the temptation. you know, when carter and reagan are so vulnerable it is hard to resist the temptation. but i don't think that is what the campaign should be about -- or what the country wants. i can't in the end really sell myself to the country if i am just going around knocking those two. i've got to have something fresh, constructive and different to offer, and it is hard. it is so hard to stay off that other kick, particularly when reagan shoots four out of five toes as he has done the last couple of weeks. i am not contemptuous of applause. i want people to listen. i want them to respond. i want to inspire them. but i would hope that i have a higher calling than to simply play to the lowest common denominator. still, conceded anderson, we are like performers. you're up and you're down.

the challenge for these subcommittees is to dig beneath the headlines of the last month and the events of the past few years because if the answer is too easy, the question probably wasn't good enough. i extend a welcome to our witnesses, and i particularly note the presence of ford president jacques nasser, and the ceo of bridgestone/firestone, mr. ono. you can't write the history of the automotive industry without the names of ford and firestone and the advances from the model t to the cars of the new millennium that they have been part of. the first thing that i'm looking for is assurances that every driver is being protected. suspect tires must be replaced now. tire manufacturers are boosting production to help fill the current shortfall, and the exchange terms for consumers should be hassle-free. the replacement program must also be fair nationwide. vehicle owners in states with relatively low accident rates, like ohio, have the same right to new tires as people who live in states where there have been more incidents. experts are already at work trying to determine what caused the problem and whether it is a single cause or many. why? is one question. when? is another. why weren't any trends detected earlier? i find it remarkable that nhtsa did not follow up on findings made by a researcher for the nation's largest auto insurer, state farm, all the way back in 1998. recalls of this magnitude inevitably prompt a review of regulations and practices.

even without trump, our biggest challenge as we move forward is that we have become exhausted parents of our infant (and infantile) social media children. and because of the cycle, we at nbc (and all others in the field of journalism) suffer from a really bad case of not being able to ever take a breath. we are a long way from resolving the rules of the road in this age, whether it be with regard to our personal conduct or anything related to hard news. i also don't think that we are on a straight line towards digital nirvana, that is, that all of this information will democratize and improve society. i sense that there is already smartphone and social media fatigue creeping across the land, and my guess is that nothing we currently see – nothing that is snappy or chatty – will solve our horrific challenges of information overload or the role (and nature) of journalism. andi am sure that once trump leaves center stage, society will have a gigantic media hangover. thus for nbc – and for everyone else – there is challenge and opportunity ahead. i'd particularly like to think and write more about that.

still, when it comes to dealing with isis or al-qaeda we need to understand that the us will not fully and permanently defeat these forces (as we did with germany and japan) by breaking their will to fight, destroying their military capabilities, or helping to create new political structures in countries where they operate. isis in syria or iraq will not be defeated until the underlying political, sectarian and economic grievances that fuel their movements are addressed; and this is well beyond america's capacity.
anyone could resist the food under those circumstances. and even though nicky doesn't really need willpower in this situation, if she did need it, it would function quite well because she's not dieting. on top of everything else, dieting disrupts cognition, especially executive function, which is the process that helps with self-control. so dieters have less willpower right when they need more willpower. and non-dieters have plenty, even though they don't need any.

the overall message from wisconsin is of a contrary mood, an impatience with more traditional candidates and a deep undercurrent of economic dismay. most specifically, wisconsin signaled a massive discontent with taxes and inflation -- the pocketbook issues that mcgovern and wallace hit the hardest. in a study of time, the attitude research firm of daniel yankelovich inc. found that four of the five top issues that influenced wisconsin voters were economic. the sixth was the vietnam war, and mcgovern made that into an economic issue as well, emphasizing its continuing costs. according to the survey, 82% of those interviewed said that the administration's wage and price policies are not working. fifty-two percent called for overall tax reform, with 41% complaining about high prices and 36% about high unemployment. mcgovern and humphrey both hammered away on the issue of tax reform, of giving the little taxpayer and the working man a fairer break. they shared the rewards: well over half of mcgovern's voters and almost two-thirds of wallace's assailed tax loopholes. the issue cut across both party and ideological grounds, attracting liberals as well as conservatives, republicans as well as democrats. the yankelovich pollsters found a surprising degree of second-choice support for mcgovern among the wallace voters -- support rooted in mcgovern's broad anti-establishment campaign. it was not that wisconsin voters were running to ideological extremes at the expense of centrist candidates, but rather that both mcgovern and wallace seem to have located an authentic area of concern that the other candidates failed to articulate.

i do note that after my letter of august 11, firestone agreed to speed up its recall by reimbursing consumers who had replaced their tires with those of a competitor. more is riding on this hearing, however, than the reputations of firestone and ford. countless americans are on the road today picking up their kids, driving to work, and the last thing that should worry them is the quality and the soundness of their tires. it is unconscionable that so many have been placed in this kind of situation. today, almost one full month after the recall was announced, neither firestone nor nhtsa, the government agency responsible for tire safety, has been able to identify why these tires are failing and why serious accidents are occurring. consumers, therefore, have justifiably expressed a great deal of concern for their safety and for that of their loved ones, as well as a lot of frustration about the way this story has unfolded. every day there seems to be some new disclosure, fostering apprehension that firestone may not yet have control of the problem. the concern was compounded by a recent full-page ad placed by firestone in major countries -- in major papers around the country assuring consumers that it acted appropriately but acknowledging it does not know what's causing the tires to fail. in order to restore public confidence, firestone must identify the root cause of its failure problem, and quickly and fully disclose their findings.

somewhere in all of that, and particularly as the social media wave began, it was clear that nbc (like the rest of the news media) could no longer keep up with the world. added to that was the intellectual challenge of how to report our new kind of wars when there were no real fronts and no actual measures of success. to me there is also a larger problem: though they produce nothing that resembles actual safety and security, the national security leaders and generals we have are allowed to do their thing unmolested. despite being at war, no great wartime leaders or visionaries are emerging. there is not a soul in washington who can say that they have won or stopped any conflict. and though there might be the beloved perfumed princes in the form of the petraeus' and wes clarks', or the so-called warrior monks like mattis and mcmaster, we've had more than a generation of national security leaders who sadly and fraudulently have done little of consequence. and yet we (and others) embrace them, even the highly partisan formers who masquerade as analysts. we do so ignoring the empirical truth of what they have wrought: there is not one county in the middle east that is safer today than it was 18 years ago. indeed the world becomes ever more polarized and dangerous.

there was, in fact, a whole series of mistakes made by political pros, journalists, muskie strategists and muskie himself. in the first place, he probably should never have been rated so far ahead. that status was based largely on the fact that national surveys showed him to be the democrat with the best chance to defeat nixon -- but those polls do not translate into strength in state primaries. yet that impression of muskie's popularity had never really been tested in voting booths nationwide. muskie had looked cool and impressive as hubert humphrey's running mate in 1968, and he exuded much more of a presidential aura than did his g.o.p. counterpart, spiro agnew. yet few voters select a president primarily by looking at the vice presidential candidates, and muskie's appeal was not really an issue in that election. muskie was now recognized by most democratic voters all right, but how did they really feel about him? no one could be sure. euphoric. nevertheless, muskie and his advisers almost euphorically accepted the pleasant notion that he was far ahead of the field -- and they designed a campaign based on that assumption. he would speak cautiously, even vaguely, if need be, on most issues, so as not to antagonize any large blocs of voters. ignoring his rivals for the nomination, he would campaign against the president. the essence of that campaign would be to portray nixon as an excitable, expedient politician whose statements were rarely credible.

rm: i always have been a quantitatively driven decision-maker. so when we think about what we're doing on the field, we have one really good guidepost, and that is, what do our fans think? we do quantitative research, we do focus groups, we read, we listen, and you can find the sweet spot of what fans want and change the game in response to that and get away with it without a lot of controversy. best single example in recent memory: instant replay. people wanted us to use technology to get calls right, and even though there are some downsides, right—it takes time, it does take some of the human element out of it—overwhelmingly, people agree it's made the game better. you get there by listening to the fans.

it was also a win for black joy over a certain kind of white rage. so much of our politics since trump emerged on the scene has been about right-wingers stoking or managing white anger. and so much of 2020 was understandably and inevitably about black heartbreak -- from the covid-19 catastrophe to police abuse . but the first election of 2021 was powered by black joy, instead. i talked to organizers who said they used music, food, dance and fun to engage people at a deeper level. their efforts helped the rev. raphael warnock to become only the 11th black us senator in history -- the first in georgia .

for a current claim of i'm not the worst. with such a tight contest now taking shape, anderson and his appeal to the disgruntled of both parties could prove to be the decisive difference in a few key states and swing the election, most likely to reagan. the latest public opinion poll conducted for time by yankelovich, skelly and white discloses just how close the race is once again. carter and reagan are deadlocked at 39% each, while anderson's support is 15% -- precisely the level set by the league of women voters for him to qualify as a viable candidate and therefore earn a third spot in its crucial opening debate, set tentatively for sept. 21 in baltimore. carter, who insists on meeting reagan first without anderson, still threatened last week not to appear if the congressman was included. the league's directs were to meet this week to examine the range of recent poll results and decide whether or not to invite anderson. for so early in the campaign, a surprisingly low 7% of registered voters claim to be undecided about whom they now favor. (the study was based on a national sample of 1,644 registered voters interviewed between aug. 26 and 28. the sampling error is thus plus or minus 3% and 4.5% when comparing present trend readings with previous time studies.) still, the survey discloses just how shaky those current preferences are. fully 55% say they are not personally interested or excited about any of the candidates.

background: time for a new approach? franklin d. roosevelt signed the first federal poverty assistance law in 1935, called the aid to dependent children act, a little-noticed add-on to the social security law designed to aid poor depression-era widows and their children. the act established what for the next sixty years became the core of federal welfare -- open-ended payments from the federal government to single mothers with dependent children. as the depression lifted, caseloads remained low during the post-war years. then in 1962, at john f. kennedy's urging, congress raised welfare payments, and renamed the program aid to families with dependent children (afdc). under the new law, states were permitted to require beneficiaries to do community work and attend training programs. kennedy articulated what has since been a central goal of federal welfare policy: to end poverty, not just alleviate it. welfare should be a hand up, not a hand out, in kennedy's words. it wasn't until lyndon b. johnson's war on poverty, beginning in 1965, that welfare spending began to take off. eligibility requirements were broadened and benefits increased for afdc and a bevy of federal programs designed to lower the 14 percent poverty rate. but some 27 years and $6 trillion later, the official poverty rate had notched up to 15.2 percent. more ominously, perhaps, out-of-wedlock births jumped from 5 percent (2 percent of white children, 19 percent of black children) in 1965 to its current level of 32 percent (23 percent of white children, 68 percent of black children).

in addition to lying more as he realized he could get away with it, he also began to use more abusive language. as helio fred garcia wrote in his 2020 book words on fire: the power of incendiary language and how to confront it, over time, the frequency and intensity of trump's language (on social media as well as in speeches and with the media) changed. without anyone or anything to stop it ... he became more aggressive and his language more directly incendiary when discrediting his political rivals. and, predictably, garcia noted, after trump insulted members of different groups, hate crimes against them spiked. so, let's be clear: this is not the first time he has incited violence.

i spent 14-plus years as a federal and state prosecutor. i understand how difficult it can be to prove a crime based on the subject's state of mind. and i fully appreciate the political and practical issues that could accompany a potential criminal charge against the prior president. it is fair for prosecutors to weigh these concerns. but prosecutors are simply not doing their jobs if they don't at least commit to investigate, find all the relevant facts, and then make a decision about whether a criminal charge is warranted. to not even open an investigation -- to refuse to even dig in and get all the facts -- would be an abdication of prosecutorial duty.

the new fault lines for democrats may track economic issues. members from the party's growing suburban center will likely be more hesitant about expensive new government programs, and especially raising income taxes, than their colleagues from lower-income and urban districts. and more of those new members from districts with large numbers of globally connected white-collar professionals may challenge the hostility to international trade that now dominates the party. those suburban members are going to look at the economic stakes in trade differently, predicts price, an advocate of expanded trade. that's still really a work in progress, though.

decency and doggedness -- traits that served him well when he first ran for congress in 1956, traveling the dusty side roads for one-to-one meetings in farmhouses and general stores. taken singly, the encounters were insignificant; taken together, they meant the margin of victory. recalls journalist harl andersen, who covered the campaign for the associated press: george only builds a stone at a time. after a while, though, it begins to show up. in 1962 he moved on to the senate, winning a seat by only 597 votes. one of the earliest and most persistent antiwar senators, mcgovern began building a small but strong following with his co- sponsorship of the 1968 mcgovern-hatfield resolution calling for an end to the war. though unsuccessful, the legislation occasioned a rare flash of fire from the quiet man. every senator in this chamber is partly responsible for sending 50,000 young americans to an early grave. mcgovern fumed. this chamber reeks of blood! when robert kennedy was assassinated, mcgovern sought to keep bobby's antiwar supporters together by entering the race in his stead less than three weeks before the 1968 convention. though he polled only 146 1/2 of the 2,622 delegate votes, the effort gave mcgovern the presidential bug. the candidate of 1972 has changed little; he is still the personable but plodding campaigner. mcgovern's success is a combination of his persistence and a new, high-powered, appealingly unprofessional organization.

sometimes you think of something and it inspires you and sometimes you look at your watch and you are not so inspired. more than the other candidates. anderson can move an audience with his oratory one day, only to turn off his next crowd with a ponderous and even pontificating style of delivery. the president and the former governor seem far less concerned about resisting the temptation that worries anderson; they have been zapping each other with increasing zing almost daily. the attacks are deliberate. reagan is the best standup performer in politics today says john sears, the campaign manager whom reagan fired last february. but the fact remains that reagan's position in the polls is derived from what people think of carter. thus the central issue for reagan's campaign will be to denigrate carter's record. despite his speaking skills, reagan has of course, been too busy trying to explain away a series of bloopers either to maintain a consistent attack on carter's performance or to attract attention to the republican policies that he has proposed. not only has reagan fallen into uttering such needlessly provocative comments as advocating official governmental contacts with taiwan, praising the viet nam war as a noble cause, suggesting that darwinism be countered by teaching the biblical story of creation as well, and terming the current recession a severe depression, but his own advisers have jumped readily into the ensuing fray, like a greek chorus of mourners, to concede in most cases that reagan was wrong.

in october, intelligence officials thought they had bin laden pinned down to a 10-square-mile area in the eastern central mountains of afghanistan. two senior military officers told cnn it would not have been hard for bin laden to change location several times because vast areas of afghanistan are virtually unseen by the u.s. military, and he would have been even harder to spot if he moved without his telltale large security contingent. even before the war, bin laden moved around frequently, making it difficult for the united states to determine his location and launch an attack against him.

strike zones, great example of it. years ago, we thought when the strike zone was higher on the knee that the low pitch wasn't getting called. we moved it to the hollow of the knee to try to get the umpires to call that. interesting thing happens: technology gets laid on top of that, our umpire force starts to turn over, they all get used to being evaluated and all of a sudden, they're actually calling it where we told them to call it. you can't blame the umpires on this. they're doing exactly what we told them, and the technology told them that they were doing what we told them to do. the problem with that pitch is, it's tough to hit. so the question becomes do you make an adjustment? and honestly, if we moved it from the hollow of the knee up to where it was before, i think modern civilization is going to survive.

at this particular moment in history, this sentencing hearing will be viewed as a turning point in how our community, our state, our nation, our culture looks at sexual abuse. this courtroom … was where the shame that many survivors felt was exorcised from them and put where it belongs, right on him. when each survivor came forward and shared their name, told their truth, supported each other, that shift grew. the world has witnessed what happens when victims are treated with respect, dignity, empathy, compassion and are truly supported by police, prosecutors and the criminal justice system and courts. what is obvious is that a strong group of determined women can, in fact, change the world and will. the fact that women led the investigation, the prosecution team, and that three female judges now sentenced defendant nassar is poetic justice.

while he has talked repeatedly about the need for the u.s. to regain nuclear superiority over the soviet union, prompting carter to accuse him of announcing that he would start an arms race, reagan's tv pitch will be milder. seated in an easy chair, he says disarmingly. to preserve our peace and freedom, we must maintain a margin of safety -- not numerical superiority . . . but a balance. the basic reagan geographical strategy remains unchanged. his aides estimate his firm base in the west will produce about 150 electoral votes. east of the mississippi, such states as indiana, new hampshire, vermont and virginia are seen as reasonably safe, giving him another 30 votes, just 90 short of election. even if carter should hold the deep south, which is far from certain, reagan will look for his victory margin in five targeted states: ohio, illinois, pennsylvania, texas and florida. they have 121 electoral votes, and if reagan can win just the largest three, he should wind up in the oval office. thus nearly 40% of his currently scheduled campaign time (49 days of travel and 95 major appearances) will be devoted to these five states. at the moment, reagan's aides consider his home state, california, safe enough to be downplayed a bit. new york looks fairly solid for carter, but with the president being increasingly whittled away there by anderson, the californian may step up his efforts to win the state's 41 electoral votes.

simon rosenberg, president and founder of ndn, a democratic group that studies the political implications of demographic and economic trends, says the new distribution of seats shows that the party's house caucus has finally caught up with the changes in the party that barack obama consolidated. obama built his two presidential victories around a coalition that was younger, more diverse, better-educated and more urbanized – at a point when the democratic house majority still relied on large numbers of right-leaning blue dog members clinging to mostly white and culturally conservative rural and small-town seats, including many in the south.

the backstop is unlikely to be up for debate, but there is optimism that eu leaders can give more ground in agreeing a deal that the uk parliament would vote for. while eu commission president jean-claude juncker, german chancellor angela merkel and french president emmanuel macron have talked tough over brexit in recent weeks, ultimately they would prefer the uk to have a working relationship with the eu rather than a no-deal scenario – the likely outcome if the commons refuses to support may's deal.

for many of these girls, nassar was not just a doctor but a confidant, a role model, sometimes the only affirming male influence in their lives. the level of nassar's predation reaches even higher because he often knew the victim's parents, some of whom were fellow doctors, others who unwittingly sent patients to him. he even knew some of the parents were police officers. he was so well practiced in his abuse and continually empowering himself that he believed he would get away with it despite any parents' profession. he believed he was untouchable. this defendant not only robbed these children of their innocence, he robbed many of them of their good health. he performed no healing, only hurt. with so many heartbreaking stories of unnecessary treatments, misdiagnoses, inaccurate medical treatment, which we know has resulted in lasting permanent damage. many of these survivors wonder whether their now lifelong injuries could have been treated had he not wanted the continued access to their young bodies. he wasn't a world-renowned doctor. as one of our experts so eloquently put it in preparing this case for trial, he was performing hocus pocus medicine.

his most optimistic scenario now is to win massachusetts, where his liberal following is strong, on april 25, then nebraska on may 9, run well enough (meaning third behind humphrey and wallace) in michigan on may 16 and then go on to take oregon, california and new york. for humphrey and muskie, april 25 will be critical. that is the date of both the massachusetts and pennsylvania primaries. humphrey, badly needing a victory, will count on his support among organized labor for a win in pennsylvania. despite wisconsin, humphrey's camp insists that mcgovern is not really a factor -- this is a race between humphrey and muskie. mcgovern's advisers, meantime, regard muskie as a political corpse, seeing the race as a head-on collision between mcgovern and humphrey. muskie had planned to run in pennsylvania against humphrey and in massachusetts against mcgovern, to regain momentum. last week, however, his advisers were discussing a stop-humphrey ploy with mcgovern's forces -- muskie would concentrate on winning in pennsylvania while leaving massachusetts to mcgovern. with each future contest, the political equations will change and the pressures increase. it is now highly likely that after all the bloodshed of the primaries, no one will go to miami beach with a lock on the nomination. if so, it will be a fascinating week in july. a deadlock would probably eliminate mcgovern as too leftward and experimental, even though that might provoke a fourth-party rebellion. humphrey might also be unacceptable: too much like 1968...a loser's image.

such numbers fueled arguments that welfare was actually exacerbating america's poverty problems. citing the emergence of an entrenched urban underclass, welfare critics stepped up their arguments during the 1980s that government poverty assistance was destroying personal initiative and self-responsibility, and breeding a dependent class, virtually trapping generations of families in welfare. and, some analysts warned welfare spending was rising at unsustainable levels. the conservative heritage foundation predicted that, left unchecked, combined federal and state welfare spending from 1996-2000 would total $2.38 trillion. enter clinton, stage ... wherever democrats had long argued that the poor lacked adequate employment and education opportunities. candidate bill clinton in 1992, however, echoed republican criticisms, decrying permanent dependence on welfare, and asserting, no one who can work should be able to stay on welfare forever. his own welfare plan, presented in june 1994, proposed limiting welfare recipients to two years of aid, while adding some $9.3 billion in new spending for community service jobs for those who couldn't find private sector work. but republicans, taking control of congress in 1994, were not interested in expanding washington's role. they embraced a more watershed approach: putting state governments in charge of welfare policy, while imposing work requirements coupled with lifetime limits on cash benefits. and, republicans proposed ending welfare for all immigrants, legal or illegal.

mr. chairman, we're going to hear a lot today about firestone didn't know there was a problem, ford didn't know there was a problem, nhtsa didn't know there was a problem until a houston television station told them there was. the documents the committee has received, along with the news reports, indicate that all these parties knew a great deal more in 1998 and 1999 about tire failures than the houston television station did. they just ignored it. we also are going to hear from a number of witnesses that the number of failures was so small that no one could have been expected to pay attention. yes, the numbers begin small, but because the propensity of the suvs to rollover when a tire fails, the cost in deaths and injuries was inordinately high and increasingly at an alarming rate. both ford and firestone should have known and should have watched this particular vehicle more closely. with less than 6,000 vehicles in the entire country of saudi arabia, there were 18 accidents in saudi arabia, including seven fatalities in 1999. the u.s. had four. and there was another large group in venezuela. despite what anyone says about the conditions in all these countries, one fact remains: other tires under same conditions did not fail. that should have alert everyone. it alerted the state farm insurance company, it alerted the center for auto safety. unfortunately ford, firestone and nhtsa failed to act.

a message of discontent from wisconsin (time, april 17, 1972) -- like some metaphysical lottery, with hazards of sudden political death or prizes of resurrection, the american primary system ramshackled through wisconsin last week to the end of its first phase -- and a pause before the next series, starting april 25, in such crucial industrial states as pennsylvania, ohio and michigan. the wisconsin primary left the eventual outcome of the long spring campaign more enigmatic than ever, but some of the election results were startling: -- george mcgovern, hitherto regarded as a one-issue antiwar champion of the liberal-left, exploited his own superb organization in the state, tapped deep wells of economic discontent and, by winning a 30% plurality, transformed himself at last into a major candidate. in wisconsin his support was astonishingly broad, bracketing liberals, conservatives, blue- collar workers, farmers, suburbanites and the young. -- george wallace, with the help of 35% of the g.o.p. voters who crossed over to vote democratic, similarly appealed to a restive mood of the little man. although he campaigned for only eight days in wisconsin, wallace came in second, with 22% of the vote. adding the wallace and mcgovern totals, 52% of the voters cast ballots for anti-establishment candidates. -- minnesota's hubert humphrey, who had counted on his longtime popularity in neighboring wisconsin to catapult him into the democratic lead, came in third, with 21%. it was a serious, though by no means fatal blow for humphrey, who has yet to win a presidential primary.

every administration factors domestic politics into its foreign policy. but rarely has any president allowed those politics – particularly political commitments made during an election campaign, or personal opposition to the policies of his predecessor – to outweigh national security and foreign policy considerations. trump's unilateral withdrawal from the 2015 iran's nuclear accord – a flawed but functional arms-control agreement – isolated the us, strained relations with allies and removed constraints on tehran's nuclear weapons program without offering any alternative approach.

the foreign policy establishment is rightly horrified by the way trump makes decisions. but politically inconvenient as it may be, when it comes to a dysfunctional middle east, some of his instincts are right on target. his own risk aversion has wisely led him away from nation-building and new military engagements and toward the difficult but necessary process of disengaging from old and unwinnable ones.

the carter advisers are counting on vice president walter mondale to shepherd unhappy kennedy supporters back into the democratic fold. one recruit about to sign up: robert kennedy jr., now a law student at the university of virginia law school. mondale is also busily holding unity meetings to strengthen the old democratic coalition that many experts feel will grudgingly regroup as nov. 4 and the prospect of a ronald reagan presidency loom ever closer. as for john anderson, the carter tactic is to ignore him publicly and try to downgrade his importance. privately, however, the white house is deeply worried about the congressman's threat. in 1976 eugene mccarthy, running independently, won just 1% of the vote, but the carterites insist that was enough to tip maine, iowa, oklahoma and oregon into ford's column. carter desperately wants to keep anderson out of the first debate because of the invaluable exposure it would give him. indeed carter's men have even suggested that the league of women voters hold a five-way first debate, including libertarian candidate ed clark and the citizen's party's barry commoner, to take some of the play away from anderson. but the league turned down the proposal. the president's strategists concede that they have been boxed in by reagan and anderson on the debate issue; they fear public wrath if the president ducks a first debate with the other two. anderson's chances of at least finishing the race brightened considerably last week.

large-scale defections from the democratic party helped both dwight eisenhower and richard nixon win the presidency and today seem vital to reagan's prospects. so far, no real switch has been found. carter leads by 10 percentage points among blue-collar workers, setting these states up as some of the key battleground between now and november. the survey pinpoints one group of voters still posing a considerable problem for carter: the former followers of senator edward kennedy. despite the efforts at the democratic national convention to patch up the party's deep rift and kennedy's later pledges of support for carter, the senator's followers now split three ways on what they intend to do: 39% say they will back carter; 28% prefer anderson; a surprising 22% are so disaffected that they say they will jump over the wall and vote for reagan. that degree of party defection could cripple the carter candidacy. the mood could well be, however, just a passing stage of postconvention blues. while the kennedy problem lingers for carter, the anderson difference so confidently proclaimed by the earnest and stubborn congressman from illinois has not really faded either. if anderson were to drop out, 37% of his present share of the voters say they would switch to carter, 28% would go to reagan and 26% claim they would not vote at all. with anderson out, carter narrowly leads reagan in the nationwide popular vote, 44.5% to 43%.

about 90% of people will see more take-home pay, according to the u.s. treasury. that may sound like great news, but here's the problem: there's a chance you'll end up with too much money in your paycheck -- meaning you'll either be stuck paying it back at tax time next year or get a smaller refund.

walter hagen loved wearing smart clothing and was known to talk about being a millionaire. he really liked bright colors, fleming said. photos: club couture photo: fox photos/getty images/file australian golfer harry williams sported a particularly fine pair of plus fours, or knickerbockers as they were more commonly known, in 1931. people always ask about the plus four and the plus two -- the difference is the width of fabric that's left at the knee. plus fours equals four inches of fabric at the knee, fleming says. if you ask people to name the traditional golfing look, it's diamond jumpers and plus fours. they were worn for lots of outdoor pursuits and golfers took to the knickerbockers. even at the time people debated whether you looked silly! photos: club couture photo: gary newkirkallsport/file the late american golfer payne stewart revived the fashion for wearing plus fours and plus twos before his tragic death in 1999. people sometimes turn up at st. andrews to play the old course in plus fours because they want to wear this great outfit. payne stewart loved to wear outrageous things, fleming says. photos: club couture photo: topical press agency/getty images/file female golf attire wasn't exactly progressive in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. this outfit from circa. 1890 was typical of the heavy garb that women would wear. they were passionate about the game and careful about how they were perceived. they wanted to keep a good reputation, fleming says.

however, the sampling did not examine just how anderson has scored 20% or higher in key states, such as new york, california and massachusetts. one of the most dramatic findings of the survey came from a more indirect probing of voter sentiment -- and it looks potentially helpful to carter. in the survey's state of the nation indicator, which measures how people feel about the way things are going in the country in general and how much confidence they have in the future, voters are becoming increasingly optimistic. while only 11% took a positive view of the nation's well-being in may, 21% are upbeat now. as the incumbent, carter would presumably benefit from any continued upsurge in optimism, which seems centered on a belief that the economy may be revving up again. while nearly all the polls have found that the economy ranks first as an issue, well ahead of foreign affairs, the time study finds that, surprisingly, neither has much impact on voter preferences for the presidential candidates. many polls reveal the voters are thoroughly confused when asked to make judgments about the candidates on most issues; the election seems much more likely to turn on personality than on policy, notes time national political correspondent john stacks. one intriguing but as yet unexplained phenomenon that might be linked to issues is yankelovich's discovery that 10% more women prefer carter than reagan. this is balanced, however, by reagan's 10% edge among men.

windrem again convinced me to return to nbc to join the new investigative unit in the early days of the 2016 presidential campaign. i thought that the mission was to break through the machine of perpetual war acceptance and conventional wisdom to challenge hillary clinton's hawkishness. it was also an interesting moment at nbc because everyone was looking over their shoulder at vice and other upstarts creeping up on the mainstream. but then trump got elected and investigations got sucked into the tweeting vortex, increasingly lost in a directionless adrenaline rush, the national security and political version of leading the broadcast with every snow storm. and i would assert that in many ways nbc just began emulating the national security state itself – busy and profitable. no wars won but the ball is kept in play.

given that 70 million americans have high cholesterol, i approached big food companies and investors, naively thinking they would love my idea and want to help. they did not. food manufacturers thought our ingredients (such as real almonds, walnuts, pecans and blueberries) were too expensive. they wanted to replace them with flavorings, artificial sweeteners and fruit bits. investors thought the clinical trial we proposed doing to confirm efficacy was too uncertain. they told us we needed to have patents so we could charge prices like the pharmaceutical companies. no wonder this had never been done before. there was simply not enough profit in it. patient health, it seems, is not very valuable.
couples are spending less on their weddings, but they're still shelling out big money to walk down the aisle.
