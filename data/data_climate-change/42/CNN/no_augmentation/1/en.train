{"original": "none of these challenges should be excuses for negligence, but they explain why change has been painfully slow. we must focus our attention and advocacy on the people who can really change all of this: our legislators, especially our state legislators and governors, who have the power to remove financial, bureaucratic, and policy hurdles that slow reform. congress has a unique ability to bring financial and intelligence resources to bear.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there is good legislation ready for a vote. at the federal level, a bipartisan group of senators have introduced a very sound bill that would provide states with an infusion of money, badly needed intelligence on cyberthreats, and federal support to get election technology up to date and keep it current. yet another bipartisan bill has been introduced to better utilize national security tools to reduce foreign manipulation of elections.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "univision's jorge ramos: thank you very much (speaking in spanish).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "thank you so much for being with us, and let me start with a little news. after nearly half a century in office, fidel castro resigned as the head of the cuban government. ninety miles off the coast of the united states, we might have a new opportunity.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the question for you, senator clinton: would you be willing to sit down with raul castro, or whoever leads the cuban dictatorship when you take office at least just once, to get a measure of the man?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: well, jorge, i hope we have an opportunity. the people of cuba deserve to have a democracy. and this gives the cuban government, under raul castro, a chance to change direction from the one that was set for 50 years by his brother.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm going to be looking for some of those changes: releasing political prisoner, ending some of the oppressive practices on the press, opening up the economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "of course the united states stands ready. and, as president, i would be ready to reach out and work with a new cuban government, once it demonstrated that it truly was going to change that direction.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i want to bring the region together, our european allies who have influence with cuba, to try to push for some of those changes, and to make it very clear that, if cuba moves toward democracy and freedom for its people, the united states will welcome that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: and as president, i would look for opportunities to try to make that happen and to create the momentum that might eventually lead to a presidential visit.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but there has to be evidence that indeed the changes are real; that they are taking place; and that the cuban people will finally be given an opportunity to have their future determined by themselves.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ramos: very simply, would you meet with him or not, with raul castro?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: i would not meet with him until there was evidence that change was happening, because i think it's important that they demonstrate clearly that they are committed to change the direction. then i think, you know, something like diplomatic encounters and negotiations over specifics could take place.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but we've had this conversation before, senator obama and myself, and i believe that we should have full diplomatic engagement where appropriate. but a presidential visit should not be offered and given without some evidence that it will demonstrate the kind of progress that is in our interest, and in this case, in the interests of the cuban people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: senator obama, just to follow up, you had said in a previous cnn debate that you would meet with the leaders of cuban, iran, north korea, among others, so presumably you would be willing to meet with the new leader of cuba.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: that's correct. now, keep in mind that the starting point for our policy in cuba should be the liberty of the cuban people. and i think we recognize that that liberty has not existed throughout the castro regime. and we now have an opportunity to potentially change the relationship between the united states and cuba after over half a century.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i would meet without preconditions, although senator clinton is right that there has to be preparation. it is very important for us to make sure that there was an agenda, and on that agenda was human rights, releasing of political prisoners, opening up the press. and that preparation might take some time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i do think that it's important for the united states not just to talk to its friends, but also to talk to its enemies. in fact, that's where diplomacy makes the biggest difference.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: one other thing that i've said, as a show of good faith that we're interested in pursuing potentially a new relationship, what i've called for is a loosening of the restrictions on remittances from family members to the people of cuba, as well as travel restrictions for family members who want to visit their family members in cuba.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i think that initiating that change in policy as a start and then suggesting that an agenda get set up is something that could be useful, but i would not normalize relations until we started seeing some of the progress that senator clinton was talking about.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: but that's different from your position back in 2003. you called u.s. policy toward cuba a miserable failure, and you supported normalizing relations.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: i support the eventual normalization. and it's absolutely true that i think our policy has been a failure. i mean, the fact is, is that during my entire lifetime, and senator clinton's entire lifetime, you essentially have seen a cuba that has been isolated, but has not made progress when it comes to the issues of political rights and personal freedoms that are so important to the people of cuba.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so i think that we have to shift policy. i think our goal has to be ultimately normalization. but that's going to happen in steps. and the first step, as i said, is changing our rules with respect to remittances and with respect to travel.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and then i think it is important for us to have the direct contact, not just in cuba, but i think this principle applies generally. i recall what john f. kennedy once said, that we should never negotiate out of fear, but we should never fear to negotiate. and this moment, this opportunity when fidel castro has finally stepped down, i think, is one that we should try to take advantage of.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: senator clinton, do you want a quick response?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: well, i agree, absolutely, that we should be willing to have diplomatic negotiations and processes with anyone. i've been a strong advocate of opening up such a diplomatic process with iran, for a number of years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "because i think we should look for ways that we can possibly move countries that are adversarial to us, you know, toward the world community. it's in our interests. it's in the interests of the people in countries that, frankly, are oppressed, like cuba, like iran.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but there has been this difference between us over when and whether the president should offer a meeting, without preconditions, with those with whom we do not have diplomatic relations. and it should be part of a process, but i don't think it should be offered in the beginning. because i think that undermines the capacity for us to actually take the measure of somebody like raul castro or ahmadinejad and others.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: and, as president kennedy said, he wouldn't be afraid to negotiate, but he would expect there to be a lot of preparatory work done, to find out exactly what we would get out of it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and therefore, i do think we should be eliminating the policy of the bush administration, which has been very narrowly defined, and frankly against our interests, because we have failed to reach out to countries, we have alienated our friends, and we have emboldened our enemies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so i would get back to very vigorous diplomacy, and i would use bipartisan diplomacy. i would ask emissaries from both political parties to represent me and our country, because i want to send a very clear message to the rest of the world that the era of unilateralism, preemption and arrogance of the bush administration is over and we're going to...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: very briefly and then we're going to move on.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: i think, as i said before, preparation is actually absolutely critical in any meeting. and i think it is absolutely true that either of us would step back from some of the bush unilateralism that's caused so much damage.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i do think it is important precisely because the bush administration has done so much damage to american foreign relations that the president take a more active role in diplomacy than might have been true 20 or 30 years ago.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "because the problem is, if we think that meeting with the president is a privilege that has to be earned, i think that reinforces the sense that we stand above the rest of the world at this point in time. and i think that it's important for us in undoing the damage that has been done over the last seven years, for the president to be willing to take that extra step.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: that is the kind of step that i would like to take as president of the united states.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: a question now on the economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cnn's john king: campbell, senators, good evening, first.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i want to bring the conversation back home. you know from your travels -- you don't need to look at the polls or anything else -- that the economy is by far now the dominant issue that voters want to hear about from the candidates.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for some, that is a question about: what should we do about an economy that is at the edge or perhaps in the early stages of a recession? for some, it is more focused. maybe it is: will you raise the minimum wage? maybe it's about trade deals that they think leave them on the raw end, as you mentioned in your opening statement, senator obama.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but when we ask democrats, how are these two candidates different?, they even think they don't know.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "senator obama, beginning with you, tell us as specifically as you can, how would a president obama be different than a president clinton in managing the nation's economy?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: well, first of all, let me emphasize the point that you just made, which is: you don't need an economist or the federal reserve to tell the american people that the economy's in trouble, because they've been experiencing it for years now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "everywhere you go, you meet people who are working harder for less, wages and incomes have flatlined, people are seeing escalating costs of everything from health care to gas at the pump.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so people have been struggling for a long time. in some communities, they have been struggling for decades now. so this has to be a priority of the next president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, what i've said is that we have to restore a sense of fairness and balance to our economy, and that means a couple of things.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "number one, with our tax code: we've got to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas and invest those tax breaks in companies that are investing here in the united states of america.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we have to end the bush tax cuts to the wealthy...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... and to provide tax breaks to middle-class americans and working americans who need them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: so i've said that if you are making $75,000 a year or less, i want to give an offset to your payroll tax that will mean $1,000 extra in the pockets of ordinary americans. senior citizens making less than $50,000, you shouldn't have to pay income tax on your social security.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we pay for these by closing tax loopholes and tax havens that are being manipulated.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "on our trade deals, i think it is absolutely critical that we engaged in trade, but it has to be viewed not just through the lens of wall street, but also main street, which means we've got strong labor standards and strong environmental standards and safety standards, so we don't have toys being shipped in the united states with lead paint on them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so these are all issues that i've talked about repeatedly, and i think there are also opportunities in our economy around creating a green economy. we send $1 billion to foreign countries every day because of our addiction to foreign oil.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: and for us to move rapidly to cap greenhouse gases, generate billions of dollars that we can reinvest in solar and wind and biodiesel -- that can put people back to work. so...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, i don't want to take too much time. and i'm sure we'll be spend more time discussing this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "senator clinton and i, i think, both agree on many of these issues. and i think it's a credit to the democratic party as a whole that the other candidates who were involved earlier on agreed with us on many of these issues.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think that there is a real, solid agenda for moving change forward in the next presidency.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the question people are going to have to ask is: how do we get it done?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and it is my strong belief that the changes are only going to come about if we're able to form a working coalition for change. because people who were benefiting from the current tax code are going to resist. the special interests and lobbyists are going to resist.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i think it has to be a priority for whoever the next president is to be able to overcome the dominance of the special interests in washington, to bring about the kinds of economic changes that i'm talking about.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: and that's an area where senator clinton and i may have a slight difference. but i'm happy to let her speak first and then can pick up on anything that's been left out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: let's give senator clinton that opportunity then.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as you have campaigned, senator, on this issue and others, but specifically on this issue, you have said, i am ready on day one to take charge of the economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the clear implication, since you have one opponent at the moment, is that you're ready; he's not.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what would you do differently on day one than a president obama would when it comes to managing the nation's economy?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: well, i would agree with a lot that senator obama just said, because it is the democratic agenda.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: we are going to rid the tax code of these loopholes and giveaways.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we're going to stop giving a penny of your money to anybody who ships a job out of texas, ohio or anywhere else to another country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we're certainly going to begin to get the tax code to reflect what the needs of middle class families are so we can rebuild a strong and prosperous middle class.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, the wealthy and the well-connected have had a president the last seven years, and i think it's time that the rest of america had a president to work for you every single day.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we will also have a different approach toward trade.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we're going to start having trade agreements that not only have strong environmental and labor standards, but i want to have a trade time-out. we're going to look and see what's working and what's not working, and i'd like to have a trade prosecutor to actually enforce the trade agreements that we have before we enter into any others.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we're also going to put much tougher standards in place so that people cannot import toys with lead paint, contaminated pet food, contaminated drugs into our market. we're going to have much more vigorous enforcement of safety standards.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: now, in addition, there are steps i would take immediately. one is on this foreclosure crisis. i have been saying for nearly a year we had to crack down on the abusive practices of the lenders. but we also need a moratorium on home foreclosures.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "everywhere i go, i meet people who either have been or about to lose their home. 85,000 homes in foreclosure in texas; 90,000 in ohio. i've met the families: the hairdresser, the single mom who's going to lose her home, the postal worker who got really hoodwinked into an agreement that wasn't fair to him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so i would put a moratorium for 90 days, to give us time to work out a way for people to stay in their homes, and i would freeze interest rates for five years. because these adjustable-rate mortgages, if they keep going up, millions of americans are going to be homeless. and vacant homes will be across the neighborhoods of texas and america.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: now, in addition, there are three ways we need to jump start the economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clean green jobs; i've been promoting this. i wanted it to be part of the stimulus package. i thought a $5 billion investment in clean green jobs would put hundreds of thousands of americans to work helping to create our future.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we also need to invest in our infrastructure. we don't have enough roads to take care of the congestion, we have crumbling bridges and tunnels. we need to rebuild america, and that will also put people to work.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and, finally, we need to end george bush's war on science, which has been waged against scientists and researchers...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: thank you, senator. and we've got a lot of ground to cover...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: this is about how we fund the future. we've got to get back to being the innovation nation. think of everything that goes on at this great university to create the new economy...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: all right. senator clinton, thank you very much.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: and, as i was saying, we've got a lot to get through. so i do want to shift gears and go on to another topic especially important here in texas, which is immigration.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and, jorge, you have a question.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ramos: (speaking in spanish) federal raids by immigration enforcement officials on homes and businesses have generated a great deal of fear and anxiety in the hispanic community and have divided the family of some of the 3 million u.s.-born children who have at least one undocumented parent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "would you consider stopping these raids once you take office until comprehensive immigration reform can be passed?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: i would consider that, except in egregious situations where it would be appropriate to take the actions you're referring to.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but when we see what's been happening, with literally babies being left with no one to take care of them, children coming home from school, no responsible adult left, that is not the america that i know.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: that is against american values. and it is...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and it is a stark admission of failure by the federal government. we need comprehensive immigration reform. i have been for this. i signed onto the first comprehensive bill back in 2004. i've been advocating for it: tougher, more secure borders, of course, but let's do it the right way, cracking down on employers, especially once we get to comprehensive immigration reform, who exploit undocumented workers and drive down wages for everyone else.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'd like to see more federal help for communities like austin and others like laredo, where i was this morning, that absorb the health care, education, and law enforcement costs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i personally, as president, would work with our neighbors to the south, to help them create more jobs for their own people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "finally, we need a path to legalization, to bring the immigrants out of the shadows, give them the conditions that we expect them to meet, paying a fine for coming here illegally, trying to pay back taxes, over time, and learning english.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if they had a committed a crime in our country or the country they came from, then they should be deported. but for everyone else, there must be a path to legalization. i would introduce that in the first 100 days of my presidency.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: senator obama, is your position the same as hillary clinton's?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: there are a couple of things i would add. comprehensive immigration reform is something that i have worked on extensively.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "two years ago, we were able to get a bill out of the senate. i was one of the group of senators that helped to move it through, but it died in the house this year. because it was used as a political football instead of a way of solving a problem, nothing happened.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so there are a couple of things that i would just add to what senator clinton said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "number one, it is absolutely critical that we tone down the rhetoric when it comes to the immigration debate, because there has been an undertone that has been ugly.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "oftentimes, it has been directed at the hispanic community. we have seen hate crimes skyrocket in the wake of the immigration debate as it has been conducted in washington, and that is unacceptable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we are a nation of laws and we are a nation of immigrants, and we can reconcile those two things. so we need comprehensive reform...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... we need comprehensive reform, and that means stronger border security. it means that we are cracking down on employers that are taking advantage of undocumented workers because they can't complain if they're not paid a minimum wage.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: they can't complain if they're not getting overtime. worker safety laws are not being observed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we have to crack down on those employers, although we also have to make sure that we do it in a way that doesn't lead to people with spanish surnames being discriminated against, so there's got to be a safeguard there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we have to require that undocumented workers, who are provided a pathway to citizenship, not only learn english, pay back taxes and pay a significant fine, but also that they're going to the back of the line, so that they are not getting citizenship before those who have applied legally, which raises two last points.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "number one, it is important that we fix the legal immigration system, because right now we've got a backlog that means years for people to apply legally.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and what's worse is, we keep on increasing the fees, so that if you've got a hard working immigrant family, they've got to hire a lawyer; they've got to pay thousands of dollars in fees. they just can't afford it. and it's discriminatory against people who have good character, we should want in this country, but don't have the money. so we've got to fix that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: so we've got to fix that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the second thing is, we have to improve our relationship with mexico and work with the mexican government so that their economy is producing jobs on that side of the border.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and the problem that we have...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the problem that we have is that we have had an administration that came in promising all sorts of leadership on creating a u.s.- mexican relationship. and, frankly, president bush dropped the ball. he has been so obsessed with iraq that we have not seen the kinds of outreach and cooperative work that would ensure that the mexican economy is working not just for the very wealthy in mexico, but for all people. and that's as policy that i'm going to change when i'm president of the united states.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we're going to stay with this topic. i want to have john king ask another question.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: i want to stay on the issue, but move to a controversial item that was not held up when the immigration debate collapsed in washington, and that is the border fence.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: to many americans, it is a simple question of sovereignty and security. america should be able to keep people out that it doesn't want in.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but, as you know in this state, especially if you go to the south of here, along the border, and in other border states, to many people it's a much more personal question. it could be a question of their livelihood. it could be a question of cross-border trade. it might be an issue to a rancher of property rights. it might be a simple question of whether someone can take a walk or a short drive to see their family members.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "senator, back in 2006, you voted for the construction of that fence. as you know, progress has been slow.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as president of the united states, would you commit tonight that you would finish the fence and speed up the construction, or do you think it's time for a president of the united states to raise his or her hand and say, you know what? wait a minute. let's think about this again. do we really want to do this?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: well, i think both senator obama and i voted for that as part of the immigration debate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: and having been along the border for the last week or so -- in fact, last night i was at the university of texas at brownsville -- and this is how absurd this has become under the bush administration. because, you know, there is a smart way to protect our borders, and there is a dumb way to protect our borders.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and what i learned last night when i was there with congressman ortiz is that the university of texas at brownsville would have part of its campus cut off.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this is the kind of absurdity that we're getting from this administration. i know it because i've been fighting with them about the northern border. their imposition of passports and other kinds of burdens are separating people from families, interfering with business and commerce, the movement of goods and people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so what i've said is that i would say, wait a minute, we need to review this. there may be places where a physical barrier is appropriate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think when both of us voted for this, we were voting for the possibility that where it was appropriate and made sense, it would be considered. but as with so much, the bush administration has gone off the deep end, and they are unfortunately coming up with a plan that i think is counterproductive.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: so i would have a review. i would listen to the people who live along the border, who understand...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... what it is we need to be doing to protect our country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: let me go on, again -- john?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: does that mean that you think your vote was wrong, or the implementation of it was wrong?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "because, as you know, when they first built the fence in the san diego area, it only went so far. and what it did was it sopped the people coming straight up the path of where that was built, and they simply moved. and california's problem became arizona's problem.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: but, you know, john, there is -- there's a lot we've learned about technology and smart fencing. you know, there is technology that can be used instead of a physical barrier.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: it requires us having enough personnel along the border so that people can be supervising a certain limited amount of space and will be able to be responsive in the event of people attempting to cross illegally.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think that the way that the bush administration is going about this, filing eminent domain actions against landowners and municipalities, makes no sense.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so what i have said is, yes, there are places when after a careful review, again listening to the people who live along the border, there may be limited places where it would work. but let's deploy more technology and personnel, instead of the physical barrier.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i frankly think that will work better and it will give us an opportunity to secure our borders without interfering with family relations, business relations, recreation and so much else that makes living along the border, you know, wonderful.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: and the people who live there need to have a president who understands it, will listen to them and be responsive.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: well, this is an area where senator clinton and i almost entirely agree. i think that the key is to consult with local communities, whether it's on the commercial interests or the environmental stakes of creating any kind of barrier.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and the bush administration is not real good at listening. that's not what they do well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so i will reverse that policy. as senator clinton indicated, there may be areas where it makes sense to have some fencing. but for the most part, having border patrolled, surveillance, deploying effective technology, that's going to be the better approach.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the one thing i do have to say, though, about this issue is, it is very important for us, i think, to deal with this problem in terms of thousands of -- hundreds of thousands of people coming over the borders on a regular basis if we want to also provide opportunity for the 12 million undocumented workers who are here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: senator clinton and i have both campaigned in places like iowa and ohio and my home state of illinois, and i think that the american people want fairness, want justice. i think they recognize that the idea that you're going to deport 12 million people is ridiculous, that we're not going to be devoting all our law enforcement resources...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but what they do also want is some order to the process. and so, we're not going to be able to do these things in isolation. we're not going to be able to deal with the 12 million people who are living in the shadows and give them a way of getting out of the shadows if we don't also deal with the problem of this constant influx of undocumented workers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and that's why i think comprehensive reform is so important. that's the kind of leadership that i've shown in the past; that's the kind of leadership that i'll show in the future.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one last point i want to make on the immigration issue because we may be moving to different topics: something that we can do immediately that i think is very important is to pass the dream act, which allows children who through no fault of their own are here but have essentially grown up as americans, allow them the opportunity for higher education.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: i do not want two classes of citizens in this country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i want everybody to prosper. that's going to be a top priority.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: ok, we've got one last question on immigration.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ramos: (speaking spanish) right now, there are more than 30 million people in this country who speak spanish.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "many of them are right here. by the year 2050, there will be 120 million hispanics in the united states. now, is there any downside, senator clinton, to the united states becoming (speaking spanish) becoming a bilingual nation? is there a limit?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: well, i think it's important for as many americans as possible to do what i have never been able to do, and that is learn another language and try to be bilingual because that connects us to the rest of the world.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think it is important, though, that english remain our common unifying language because that brings our country together in a way that we have seen generations of immigrants coming to our shores be able to be part of the american experience and pursue the american dream.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, i have been adamantly against the efforts by some to make english the official language. that i do not believe is appropriate, and i have voted against it and spoken against it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: i represent new york. we have 170 languages in new york city alone. and i do not think that we should be, in any way, discriminating against people who do not speak english, who use facilities like hospitals or have to go to court to enforce their rights.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i do think that english does remain an important part of the american experience. so i encourage people to become bilingual. but i also want to see english remain the common, unifying language of our country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ramos: senator obama, is there any down side to the united states becoming a bilingual nation?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: well, i think it is important that everyone learns english and that we have that process of binding ourselves together as a country. i think that's very important.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i also think that every student should be learning a second language, because...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... you know, so, when you start getting into a debate about bilingual education, for example, now, i want to make sure that children who are coming out of spanish-speaking households had the opportunity to learn and are not falling behind.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: if bilingual education helps them do that, i want to give them the opportunity.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i also want to make sure that english-speaking children are getting foreign languages because this world is becoming more interdependent and part of the process of america's continued leadership in the world is going to be our capacity to communicate across boundaries, across borders, and that's something frankly where we've fallen behind.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one of the failures of no child left behind, a law that i think a lot of local and state officials have been troubled by, is that it is so narrowly focused on standardized tests that it has pushed out a lot of important learning that needs to take place.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and foreign languages is one of those areas that i think has been neglected. i want to put more resources into it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we're going to take a quick break. we've got to go to a commercial. we'll be back with a lot more. there is also a debate we should mention raging online right now. go to our web site, cnnpolitics.com, and join in. the debate here at the university of texas in austin continues right after this.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the first question now goes to john king.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: senator, as i'm sitting here, we're about 45 minutes into the discussion tonight, and i'm having what i like to call one of those parallel universe moments.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i've been watching each of you give speeches in arenas not unlike this one individually. and the tone is often quite different than the very polite, substantive discourse we've had tonight.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so, i want to ask you about that. there are times when each of you seems to call into question the other one's credibility or truthfulness.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and, senator clinton, i want to talk specifically about some words you've spoken here in the state of texas over the past couple of days.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you've said, quote, my opponent gives speeches; i offer solutions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you said the choice for democrats in this campaign is, quote, talk versus action.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, in a campaign that some of us are old enough to remember, maybe not many of the students here, this would be called the where's the beef? question.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but, since we're in texas, i'd like to borrow a phrase that they often use here and you've used yourself in the context of president bush. are you saying that your opponent is all hat and no cattle, and can you say that after the last 45 minutes?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: well, i have said that about president bush, and i think our next president needs to be a lot less hat and a lot more cattle.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, i think you can tell from the first 45 minutes, you know, senator obama and i have a lot in common. we both care passionately about our country. we are devoted to public service. we care deeply about the future, and we have run a very vigorous and contested primary campaign, which has been by most standards, i think, very positive and extremely civil.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: but there are differences between us. and i think, in our efforts to draw those contrasts and comparisons, we obviously try to let voters know how we see the world differently.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i do offer solutions. that's what i believe in and what i have done. and it's what i offer to voters because it's part of my life, over the last 35 years, working to get kids health care, working to expand legal services for the poor, working to register voters, working to make a difference. because i think that this country has given me so much.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and there are differences between our records and our accomplishments. i have to confess, i was somewhat amused, the other night, when, on one of the tv shows, one of senator obama's supporters couldn't.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so i know that there are comparisons and contrasts to be drawn between us. and it's important that voters get that information. so, yes, i do think that words are important and words matter, but actions speak louder than words. and i offer...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: senator obama, do you want to respond?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: well, i think actions do speak louder than words, which is why over the 20 years of my public service i have acted a lot to provide health care to people who didn't have it, to provide tax breaks to families that needed it, to reform a criminal justice system that had resulted in wrongful convictions, to open up our government and to pass the toughest ethics reform legislation since watergate, to make sure that we create transparency...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... to make sure that we create transparency in our government so that we know where federal spending is going and it's not going to a bunch of boondoggles and earmarks that are wasting taxpayer money that could be spent on things like early childhood education.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, i think if you talk to those wounded warriors at walter reed who, prior to me getting to the senate, were having to pay for their meals and have to pay for their phone calls to their family while they're recovering from amputations, i think they've said that i've engaged not just in talk, but in action.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: now, i think that senator clinton has a fine record and i don't want to denigrate that record. i do think there is a fundamental difference between us in terms of how change comes about. senator clinton of late has said: let's get real. the implication is that the people who've been voting for me or involved in my campaign are somehow delusional.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and that, you know, the 20 million people who've been paying attention to 19 debates and the editorial boards all across the country at newspapers who have given me endorsements, including every major newspaper here in the state of texas.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: you know, the thinking is that somehow, they're being duped, and eventually they're going to see the reality of things.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "well, i think they perceive reality of what's going on in washington very clearly. what they see is that if we don't bring the country together, stop the endless bickering, actually focus on solutions and reduce the special interests that have dominated washington, then we will not get anything done. and the reason that this campaign has done so well...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the reason that this campaign has done so well is because people understand that it is not just a matter of putting forward policy positions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: senator clinton and i share a lot of policy positions. but if we can't inspire the american people to get involved in their government and if we can't inspire them to go beyond the racial divisions and the religious divisions and the regional divisions that have plagued our politics for so long, then we will continue to see the kind of gridlock and nonperformance in washington that is resulting in families suffering in very real ways.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm running for president to start doing something about that suffering, and so are the people who are behind my campaign.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: i think one of the points -- i think one of the points that john king was alluding to in talking about some of senator clinton's comments is there has been a lot of attention lately on some of your speeches, that they are very similar to some of the speeches by your friend and supporter deval patrick, the governor of massachusetts, and senator clinton's campaign has made a big issue of this. to be blunt, they've accused you of plagiarism.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: well, look, the -- first of all, it's not a lot of speeches. there are two lines in speeches that i've been giving over the last couple of weeks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i've been campaigning now for the last two years. deval is a national co-chairman of my campaign, and suggested an argument that i share, that words are important. words matter. and the implication that they don't i think diminishes how important it is to speak to the american people directly about making america as good as its promise. barbara jordan understood this as well as anybody.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: and the notion that i had plagiarized from somebody who was one of my national co-chairs...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... who gave me the line and suggested that i use it, i think, is silly, and...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... you know, this is where we start getting into silly season, in politics, and i think people start getting discouraged about it...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what they want is, how are we going to create good jobs and good wages?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "how are we going to provide health care to the american people?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "how are we going to make sure that college is affordable?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so what i've been talking about, in this speeches -- and i've got to admit, some of them are pretty good.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what i've been talking about is not just hope and not just inspiration. it's a $4,000 tuition credit for every student, every year, in exchange for national service...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... so that college becomes more affordable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: i've been talking about making sure that we change our tax code so that working families actually get relief. i have been talking about making sure that we bring an end to this war in iraq so that we can start bringing our troops home and invest money here in the united states.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so just to finish up, these are very specific, concrete, detailed proposals, many of them which i have been working on for years now. senator clinton has a fine record. so do i. i'm happy to have a debate on the issues, but what we shouldn't be spending time doing is tearing each other down. we should be spending time lifting the country up.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: senator clinton, is it the silly season?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: well, i think that if your candidacy is going to be about words, then they should be your own words. that's, i think, a very simple proposition.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and, you know, lifting whole passages from someone else's speeches is not change you can believe in, it's change you can xerox. and i just don't think...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: no, but, you know, but, barack, it is.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "because, you know, if you look -- if you look -- if you look at the youtube of these videos, it does raise questions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, there is no doubt that you are a passionate, eloquent speaker, and i applaud you for that. but when you look at what we face in this country, we do need to unite the country, but we have to unite it for a purpose around very specific goals.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: it is not enough to say, let's come together. we know we're going to have to work hard to overcome the opposition of those who do not want the changes to get to universal health care.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, when i proposed a universal health care plan, as did senator edwards, we took a big risk, because we know it's politically controversial to say we're going to cover everyone.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and you chose not to do that. you chose to put forth a health care plan that will leave out at least 15 million people. that's a big difference.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "when i said we should put a moratorium on home foreclosures, basically your response was, well, that wouldn't work.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and, you know, in the last week, even president bush has said we have to do something like that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i just believe that we've got to look hard at the difficult challenges we face, especially after george bush leaves the white house.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: the world will breathe a sigh of relief once he is gone. we all know that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but then we've got to do the hard work of not just bringing the country together, but overcoming a lot of the entrenched opposition to the very ideas that both of us believe in, and for some of us have been fighting for, for a very long time. you know, when i took on...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "when i took on universal health care back in '93 and '94, it was against a firestorm of special interest opposition. i was more than happy to do that, because i believe passionately in getting quality affordable health care to every american.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i don't want to leave anybody out. i see the results of leaving people out. i am tired of health insurance companies deciding who will live or die in america.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: all right, senator clinton, thank you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: well, i think that senator clinton mentioned two specific issue areas where we've got some differences. i'm happy to debate those, which is what i think should be the focus of this campaign. we both want universal health care.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "when i released my plan a few months later, we were in a debate and senator clinton said we all want universal health care. of course, i was down 20 points in the polls at the time, and so my plan was pretty good. it's not as good now, but my plan hasn't changed. the politics have changed a little bit.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we both -- 95 percent of our plans are similar. we both want to set up a system in which any person is going to be able to get coverage that is as good as we have as members of congress. and we are going to subsidize those who can't afford it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: we're going to make sure that we reduce costs by emphasizing prevention. and i want to make sure that we're applying technology to improve quality, cut bureaucracy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, i also want to make sure that we're reducing costs for those who already have health insurance. so we put in place a catastrophic reinsurance plan that would reduce costs by $2,500 per family per year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so we've got a lot of similarities in our plan. we've got a philosophical difference, which we've debated repeatedly, and that is that senator clinton believes the only way to achieve universal health care is to force everybody to purchase it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and my belief is, the reason that people don't have it is not because they don't want it but because they can't afford it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so i emphasize reducing costs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and as has been noted by many observers, including bill clinton's former secretary of labor, my plan does more than anybody to reduce costs, and there is nobody out there who wants health insurance who can't have it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: now, there are legitimate arguments for why senator clinton and others have called for a mandate, and i'm happy to have that debate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but the notion that i am leaving 15 million people out somehow implies that we are different in our goals of providing coverage to all americans, and that is simply not true. we think that there's going to be a different way of getting there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one last point i want to make on the health care front. i admire the fact that senator clinton tried to bring about health care reform back in 1993. she deserves credit for that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i said before, i think she did it in the wrong way, because it wasn't just the fact that the insurance companies, the drug companies were battling here, and no doubt they were. it was also that senator clinton and the administration went behind closed doors, excluded the participation even of democratic members of congress who had slightly different ideas than the ones that senator clinton had put forward.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and, as a consequence, it was much more difficult to get congress to cooperate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: and i've said that i'm going to do things differently. i think we have to open up the process. everybody has to have a seat at the table. and most importantly, the american people have to be involved and educated about how this change is going to be brought about.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the point is this, you know, we can have great plans, but if we don't change how the politics is working in washington, then neither of our plans are going to happen, and we're going to be four years from now debating once again how we're going to bring universal health care to this country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: all right, we've got some time constraints here, so we've got to take another real quick break. stay with us. we've got a lot more ahead.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you can compare the candidates on the issues any time; just go to our web site, cnnpolitics.com. a lot more ahead here at the university of texas. we'll be right back.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: an enthusiastic crowd here at the university of texas.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "welcome back to the texas democratic debate. let's get right to it. jorge ramos with the next question.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ramos: senator clinton, yesterday you said, and i'm quoting, one of us is ready to be commander in chief.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "are you saying that senator obama is not ready and not qualified to be commander in chief?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: well, i believe that i am ready and i am prepared. and i will leave that to the voters to decide.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i want to get back to health care, because i didn't get a chance to respond after senator obama finished. no, let me finish, jorge...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ramos: but i would like to come back...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: this is a significant difference. you know, senator obama has said it's a philosophical difference. i think it's a substantive difference.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he has a mandate for parents to be sure to ensure their children. i agree with that. i just know that if we don't go and require everyone to have health insurance, the health insurance industry will still game the system. everyone of us with insurance will pay the hidden tax of approximately $900 a year to make up for the lack of insurance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and you know, in one of our earlier debates, john edwards made a great point. it would be as though social security were voluntary. medicare, one of the great accomplishments of president johnson, was voluntary.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i do not believe that is going to work. so it's not just a philosophical difference.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: you look at what will work and what will not work. if you do not have a plan that starts out attempting to achieve universal health care, you will be nibbled to death, and we will be back here with more and more people uninsured and rising costs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: all right. we appreciate that you want to make a point, senator obama. we have limited time, so i would like jorge to move on to another subject or we're going to be out of time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: well, i understand. but i think that senator clinton made a...", "augmented": []}

{"original": "clinton: wait a minute, no, this is too important. this is the number one issue that people talk to me about. you know, when a mother grabs my arm and says, i can't get the operation my son needs because i don't have health insurance, it is personal for me.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: and i just fundamentally disagree.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, senator obama's plan has a mandate on parents and a fine if parents do not...", "augmented": []}

{"original": "clinton: he's also said that if people show up at a hospital sick, without health insurance, well, maybe at that point you can fine them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we would not have a social compact with social security and medicare if everyone did not have to participate. i want a universal health care plan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: now, that's -- that mother -- that mother who is desperate to get health care for her child, will be able to get that health care under my plan. point number one.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "point number two, the reason a mandate for children can be effective is we've got an ability to make affordable health care available to that child, right now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: there are no excuses. if a parent is not providing health care for that child, it's because the parent's not being responsible, under my plan. and those children don't have a choice. but i think that adults are going to be able to see that they can afford it, under my plan; they will get it, under my plan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and it is true that, if it turns out that some are gaming the system, then we can impose, potentially, some penalties on them for gaming the system.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "and here's the question. are you suggesting that senator obama is not ready; he doesn't have the experience to be commander in chief? that's a question of: what did you mean by that phrase?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: what i mean is that, you know, for more than 15 years, i've been honored to represent our country in more than 80 countries to negotiate on matters such as opening borders for refugees during the war in kosovo, to stand up for women's rights as human rights around the world. i've served on the senate...", "augmented": []}

{"original": "you know, just this week, it's a good example. we had elections in pakistan, we had change in government in cuba -- or at least the leadership. we've had the elections that, you know, should have happened that haven't happened and just changed the leader the way they do in cuba. we've had kosovo declaring independence, and we have had our embassy set on fire in serbia.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so we have serious problems that pose a real question about presidential leadership, and also some great opportunities. you know, we now have opportunities perhaps with cuba, i hope with president musharraf, for him to do the right thing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: i supported the independence of kosovo because i think it is imperative that in the heart of europe we continue to promote independence and democracy. and i would be moving very aggressively to hold the serbian government responsible with their security forces to protect our embassy. under international law, they should be doing that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so when you think about everything that is going to happen, what we can predict and what we cannot predict, i believe that i am prepared and ready on day one to be commander in chief, to be the president, to turn our economy around, and to begin making a lot of these very difficult decisions that we will inherit from george bush. and that is what i am putting forth to the voters.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "obama: but it also means using our military wisely. and on what i believe was the single most important foreign policy decision of this generation, whether or not to go to war in iraq, i believe i showed the judgment of a commander in chief. and i think that senator clinton was wrong in her judgments on that.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "obama: and as a consequence, they didn't have enough ammunition, they didn't have enough humvees. they were actually capturing taliban weapons, because it was easier to get taliban weapons than it was for them to get properly equipped by our current commander in chief.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, that's a consequence of bad judgment. and you know, the question is, on the critical issues that we face right now, who's going to show the judgment to lead? and i think that on every critical issue that we've seen in foreign policy over the last several years -- going into iraq originally, i didn't just oppose it for the sake of opposing it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i said this is going to distract us from afghanistan; this is going to fan the flames of anti-american sentiment; it's going to cost us billions of dollars and thousands of lives and overstretch our military. and i was right.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "on the question of pakistan, which senator clinton just raised -- we just had an election there. but i've said very clearly that we have put all our eggs in the musharraf basket. that was a mistake. we should be going after al qaeda and making sure that pakistan is serious about hunting down terrorists, as well as expanding democracy. and i was right about that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "on the issues that have come up that a commander in chief is going to have to make decisions on, i have shown the judgment to lead. that is the leadership that i want to show when i'm president of the united states.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "king: i want to continue in this vein, and hone in on the very point you just made. because one of you, unless this remarkable campaign here takes another wacky, unpredictable turn, is going to be running against a decorated war hero, who is going to say that you don't have the experience to be commander in chief.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and you have both said, it's not about that type of experience; it's about judgment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you both had to make a judgment, a short time ago, in your job in the united states senate, about whether to support the surge. and as that was going on, senator clinton, you had the commanding general in iraq before you. and you said, i think that the reports provide to us really require the willing suspension of disbelief -- your words to general petraeus.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "is iraq today better off than it was six months or a year ago because of the surge?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: well, john, i think you forget a very important premise of the surge. the rationale of the surge was to create the space and time for the iraqi government to make the decisions that only it can make.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, there is no doubt, given the skill and the commitment of our young men and women in uniform that putting more of them in will give us a tactical advantage and will provide security in some places, and that has occurred.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: but the fact is that the purpose of it has not been fulfilled. the iraqi government has slowly inched toward making a few of the decisions in a less than complete way, but it hasn't taken advantage of the sacrifice and the losses of life and billions of dollars that have occurred since the surge began.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that is why i have said, upon taking office i would ask the secretary of defense and the joint chiefs of staff and my security advisers to give me a plan so that i could begin withdrawing our troops within 60 days.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i would begin that with...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... with a very clear message to the iraqis that they no longer had a blank check, as they had been given by president bush, that as we withdraw our troops, probably one to two brigades a month, they would have to step up and make these decisions.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "last night in brownsville, you know, a woman grabbed my hand and said, please, my husband's there for the third time. bring him home.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i told her privately what i have said publicly many times -- i will bring him home because i do not think it is in the interest of america or of the iraqis that we continue to be there. it is up to the iraqis to decide the kind of future they will have.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: senator obama, in the same vein, you were also opposed to the surge from the beginning. were you wrong?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: well, i think it is indisputable that we've seen violence reduced in iraq. and that's a credit to our brave men and women in uniform.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in fact, you know, the 1st cavalry, out of fort hood, played an enormous role in pushing back al qaeda out of baghdad.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "but this is a tactical victory imposed upon a huge strategic blunder.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "... than having to argue about the tactics subsequent to the decision.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "because, ultimately, that's what's at stake. understand, not only have we been diverted from afghanistan. we've been diverted from focusing on latin america.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we contribute -- our entire foreign aid to latin america is $2.7 billion, approximately what we spend in iraq in a week.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: and it is any surprise, then, that you've seen people like hugo chavez and countries like china move into the void, because we've been neglectful of that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "iran is the single biggest strategic beneficiary of us having invaded iraq, and that is something that i think john mccain has to come to terms with.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so that is a debate that i'm happy to have.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one last point i want to make on this, and that is, the incredible burden that has been placed on the american people, starting with military families, and the fact that we still are not doing right by our veterans, that we still don't honor their service, that there are still homeless veterans, that we still don't screen properly for post-traumatic stress disorder and make sure that they're getting mental services that they need, that we are still...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... having veterans in south texas have to drive 250 miles to access a veterans hospital.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: that's unacceptable. but we talked about the economy earlier, the fact that we're spending $12 billion every month in iraq means that we can't engage in the kind of infrastructure improvements that are going to make us more competitive. it means that we can't deliver on the kinds of health care reforms that both senator clinton and i are looking for.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and that is also an argument that we have to have with john mccain because he has said that he is willing to have these troops over there for 100 years. the notion that we would sustain that kind of effort and neglect not only making us more secure here at home, more competitive here at home, allow our economy to sink. as john mccain says, he doesn't really understand the economy that well. it is clear from his embrace of george bush's policies that he doesn't, and that's what i intend to change when i am president of the united states of america.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: all right. we've got to take another quick break. we've got a lot more ahead. stay with us. we'll be right back.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "stay with us after the debate. anderson cooper and the best political team on television will have lots of analysis.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "both of you have been harshly critical of the bush administration for its secrecy, what you consider overuse of secrecy and executive power.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "tonight, senator obama, you've talked about more transparency. you also at one point criticized earmarks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and yet, a recent report came out that identified you -- lower on the list in terms how much money senators seek and sneak into the budget for these pork barrel spending projects, but it still said you were responsible for $91 million in earmarks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and you have refused to say where the money went, what it's for. why?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: no, that's not true. we've actually disclosed, john, all our earmarks. and so, you know, we'll be happy to provide you with that information, because i believe very strongly in transparency.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: as i indicated earlier, one of the things that i did last year was to pass a bill with tom coburn, very conservative republican but a sincere fiscal conservative. and we got together and created what we call google for government. it's a searchable database, where every single dollar of federal spending is posted on the internet, so that ordinary voters can take a look. and if they see a bridge to nowhere being built, they know where it's going and who sponsored it. and if they see a no-bid contract going to halliburton, they can check that out, too.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and you know, the idea is that we open up the process so that the american people can make judgments about whether or not government is doing what it's supposed to be doing with its taxpayer money. and i've been consistently in favor of more disclosure around earmarks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: now, keep in mind, a lot of these are worthy projects in our states. i have actively pursued projects that i think are important. but i want to make sure that they're not done in the dark of night, that they're not done in committee, that everybody stands up and says, this is the kind of spending that i think is important.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i have consistently supported those efforts. i will push for those as president of the united states of america.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: senator clinton, as you know, i think your number was about $342 million. you say they're worthy projects, as senator obama did, for your state and that's part of your job, to get money for worthy projects back in your state.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "senator mccain, as you know, is proud of going around the country earmark.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "on the specific issue of pork barrel spending, fiscal accountability by the government at a time when many americans frankly think, whether it is the house or the senate, that you all waste money on things that aren't important to them, don't affect their daily lives, does he have a better case to make to the american people that, i have done this my entire career; i will do it as president, on the issue of on the issue of wasteful pork barrel spending?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "you know, when president bush came into office, he inherited a balanced budget and a surplus. and it is gone. and we now are looking at a projected deficit of $400 billion, under the new bush budget, and a $9 trillion debt.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we borrow money from the chinese to buy oil from the saudis. that is not a winning strategy for america.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i will get us back to fiscal responsibility. and i will make it clear that the bush tax cuts on the upper income, those making more than $250,000 a year, will be allowed to expire.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: middle-class tax cuts and support for the middle class, to make college affordable, retirement security possible, health insurance affordable: those will be my priorities.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i think it's important that we look at where the money has gone under president bush -- no-bid contracts, cronyism, outsourcing the government in ways that haven't saved us money and have reduced accountability.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so the larger question is, who really is going to move us toward fiscal responsibility, and i believe that we can get back on the path we were on. it was working well. it was one of the reasons why the economy was booming.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i've got that, you know, clearly in my economic blueprint, which is something that i've published the last few days, because it's part of what we have to do again. and i think that i will be very comfortable and effective in taking on senator mccain over the fiscal irresponsibility of the republican party that he's been a part of.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "clinton: well, you know, these are the rules that are followed, and you know, i think that it will sort itself out. i'm not worried about that. we will have a nominee, and we will have a unified democratic party, and we will go on to victory in november.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "and i have no doubt that the democratic party at its best can summon a sense of common purpose again and higher purpose for the american people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: and i think that the next nominee going into the november election is going to have a lot to talk about because the american people are tired of politics that is dominated by the powerful, by the connected. they want their government back, and that's what i intend to provide them when i'm nominated for president of the united states.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: we have time for just one final question, and we thought we would sort of end on a more philosophical question. you've both spent a lot of time talking about leadership, about who's ready and who has the right judgment to lead if elected president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "a leader's judgment is most tested at times of crisis. i'm wondering if both of you will describe what was the moment that tested you the most, that moment of crisis.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: well, you know, i wouldn't point to a single moment. but what i look at is the trajectory of my life because, you know, i was raised by a single mom. my father left when i was two, and i was raised by my mother and my grandparents.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and, you know, there were rocky periods during my youth, when i made mistakes and was off course. and what was most important, in my life, was learning to take responsibility for my own actions, learning to take responsibility for not only my own actions but how i can bring people together to actually have an impact on the world.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the defendant is a twisted, beloved, renowned doctor who used his prestige to gain the trust of these girls, to exploit them, leaving many of them emotionally shattered, used by a man that they not only trusted but also loved. he supposedly practiced osteopathic manipulative medicine but in truth, he was simply a master manipulator. he manipulated victims and parents. he manipulated his community through the press and social media early in this case. and he tried to manipulate the police department in his interviews. he tried to manipulate prior investigators. he even tried to manipulate your honor and this court through his pathetic letter. all while knowing the truth, that he did the things he was accused of doing. and in competitive gymnastics, he found the perfect place for this master manipulation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in gymnastics, young girls do what they are told. they hide their pain, they hide their injuries. these young girls bared all of it. their bodies were constantly on display and under scrutiny. it takes some kind of sick perversion to not only assault a child but to do so with her parent in the room. to do so while a lineup of eager young gymnasts waited to see the gymnastics god, larry nassar. it's a sick perversion when a defendant's close family, friends were upstairs in his own home while he abused young kyle stephens, just 6 years old when it began.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "his own wife and children sat upstairs for years while he gave his basement treatments. to unnecessarily and without warning penetrate an unsuspecting minor for your own selfish sexual gains while her parent sat just feet away, unknowing, had to be part of the rush or the thrill for this defendant. the thrill that he might just get caught.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but he was a master. he had developed a built-in defense. no coach should be in a shower with a boy. no priest has an excuse for any type of sexual touching. but nassar perfected a built-in excuse and defense. he was a doctor and a good one. so the world thought. and this makes up the other half of his scheme. the trust he could garner from being not only a doctor, a respected professional but an olympic doctor, one who treated these young girls, these young victims' heroes. he adorned his office with pictures of olympians he treated, with the far-off places his supposed expertise took him. he brought back tokens for his precious victims, regalia from competitions around the world. in doing so, he made each of his victims feel special. as kassie powell said, the defendant hid behind olympic rings and spartan green and white.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for many of these girls, nassar was not just a doctor but a confidant, a role model, sometimes the only affirming male influence in their lives. the level of nassar's predation reaches even higher because he often knew the victim's parents, some of whom were fellow doctors, others who unwittingly sent patients to him. he even knew some of the parents were police officers. he was so well practiced in his abuse and continually empowering himself that he believed he would get away with it despite any parents' profession. he believed he was untouchable. this defendant not only robbed these children of their innocence, he robbed many of them of their good health. he performed no healing, only hurt. with so many heartbreaking stories of unnecessary treatments, misdiagnoses, inaccurate medical treatment, which we know has resulted in lasting permanent damage. many of these survivors wonder whether their now lifelong injuries could have been treated had he not wanted the continued access to their young bodies. he wasn't a world-renowned doctor. as one of our experts so eloquently put it in preparing this case for trial, he was performing hocus pocus medicine.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "over the last 16 months, as i have prepared this case and lived this case and thrown my heart and soul into this case, i have often wondered: did he really think he was going to get away with this? abusing so many for so many years over two decades. so many sports. no patient, no child was safe. and yet, he also abused some of our most prominent national heroes. maybe he did think he could beat the odds and you know what, for years he did. what that did, that beating of the odds to kyle stephens, to jessica thomashow, to madeline jones, kaylee lorincz and bailey lorencen, to victims d, and g and i, to rachael denhollander. history gave him guidance for the future, every previous time there had been an allegation, nothing happened. his lies worked.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "we have all learned a few lessons from this case and these past seven days of powerful testimony. as i reflect back, an entire semester of a college class in sexual abuse – grooming behaviors and why victims delay and predatory behavior has played out this past week and a half. but as we look back on this case in the last seven days, i'm struck by a number of observations. what does it say about our society that victims of sexual abuse have to hide their pain for years when they did nothing wrong? what does it say about our society when victims do come forward and they are automatically met with skepticism and doubt, treated as liars until proven true? what do we take away from this?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "these have been important narratives to hear and witness and listen to. they will be the words that burn down cultural stereotypes and cultural myths. and i have a few takeaways and lessons i hope anyone watching these past seven days has learned and will take away with them. the first is that we must start by believing. other adults must start by believing when children and young people report abuse, regardless of who the perpetrator is. no matter his education, his position, the respect he commands, or the awards and adoration he has received. research shows that false allegations are slim, that most perpetrators are serial offenders and that how a victim, especially a child, is treated when they disclose, if they are believed and supported and not blamed, can affect their well-being for years and can support better outcomes within the criminal justice system and protect other victims.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "yet, even after the first day and the conclusion of the first week, it was brought to my attention by many involved in this case that there are still people in this very community and elsewhere, i would imagine, who are saying that these women were all in it for the money or the attention. are you kidding me? after 150 heart-wrenching, raw, graphic, visceral impact statements, how can anyone … believe that? even to this day, even as this historic sentencing hearing is broadcast around the globe, there are still likely people who doubt. perhaps those 2,000 folks who voted for this defendant as school board member. perhaps the many petition writers we're aware of – who included doctors and trainers and athletes and lawyers – who spared nothing to come to the defense of this defendant over 16 months ago. and continued to defend him for months even after he had been charged with kyle stephens' abuse. i hope and pray that they are watching, that they are listening and that they have learned their lesson.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the second lesson i take away and hope others do, is that anyone can be a perpetrator, anyone can be a serial sexual abuser. this defendant stole, cheated and lied. he stole these victims' innocence. he lied about his behavior and he cheated parents and the community and the world of the trust they held in doctors, prominent physicians and prominent community members. experts teach on this issue. russell strand teaches on offender dynamics and behavior. strand talks about how abusers have three personas. the first is the public one for all to see. the second is the uninhabited persona, what you only let others close to you see. we all have those two personas, but the third is the hidden and secret one. it's hidden in the mind and the eyes and beliefs of the perpetrator. and that persona is often hidden well. serial child molesters hide among us. we know that this defendant had a good persona, a good public persona at least. he was the good guy, the goofy guy and olympic doctor, the medical school professor, the gymnastics god. he was a religious and pious man, a father, a husband, a friend, a school board candidate, a man of honor and passion. so kind and giving and always approachable. he never charged for his services and he saw patients basically anywhere.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but we know, without a doubt after the seven days, what we on this team have known for 16 months: that nassar's third hidden persona, just as strand discusses, that he is possibly the most prolific serial child sexual abuser in history. a selfish child molester who spared no one. nassar hid behind that outer facade that is different and faked and not real but that people believed were real. people came to his defense. they believed that they were the man that he wanted them to see and not the monster hiding beneath.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as a society, our response cannot be that he couldn't do this. or that i knew his character, i knew he wasn't capable of this kind of crime. it's because no one wants to see it. the only person who sees this side are his victims. then the perpetrator goes back, shows only what he wants the world to see. this is how he got away with this for so long and got people to believe him over the many, many, many victims who reported. anyone can be an abuser. the third takeaway from this week is that delayed disclosure of child sexual abuse is not unique. in fact, it's quite the norm. kids don't report sexual abuse right away, either because the abuser is a trusted adult, especially when it's a doctor, especially when they are so young and have no sexual experience to understand what is wrong.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the fourth takeaway is that predators groom their victims and families. this is so confusing to so many women. he was so nice, he gave them presents and trinkets and desserts. he broke rules for them, especially when you contrast his behavior and relationship to the harsh and cruel and abusive coaches that these girls were exposed to. he was only doing that to gain their trust, to confuse them and get what he wanted. the (fifth) takeaway, is we must teach our girls and boys to speak up. kids are told to be respectful of adults. girls and boys don't speak up. it is easier to put up with discomfort than cause waves. and when they are brave, nothing happens. we teach our girls and daughters to be too nice, to just ignore and put up with uncomfortable situations, to stay silent when they should be allowed to be heard. we need to teach them to continue to speak up until someone listens and helps.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the sixth takeaway from this week and a half is that police and prosecutors must take on hard cases regardless of who the offender is. they cannot shy away from tough cases because of who the offender is or his position in the community. they cannot victim-blame or wait until they have the perfect case. they cannot wait until they have dozens of victims who have come forward. police and prosecutors must also start by believing, be victim centered and offender focused in their work.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the final takeaway is that we as a society need investigative journalists more than ever. what finally started this reckoning and ended this decadeslong cycle of abuse was investigative reporting. without that first indianapolis star story in august of 2016, without the story where rachael came forward publicly shortly thereafter, he would still be practicing medicine, treating athletes and abusing kids. let that sink in for a minute. right now, he would be at his office … not far from this courtroom and the michigan state university campus abusing children, had it not been for the investigative reporters and rachael who brought this case. we know federal law enforcement did not stop him nor did trainers or coaches or deans or medical supervisors. victim disclosures to adults didn't stop him. reporters began the story and excellent victim-centered, offender-focused police and prosecutors grabbed the baton and brought us here today.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm proud of the work of the michigan state university police department and our team at the attorney general's office. there is no more supportive police chief in this country than chief jim dunlap. and our victims and the public are incredibly lucky to have their case investigated by arguably the best sex crimes detective in the country and her team. detective lt. andrea munford is not only a smart, dedicated and hard-working investigator, but she is also empathetic and compassionate. our victims are also lucky to have the full and unwavering support of michigan attorney general bill schuette, who from day one of taking on this case has supported this prosecution fully. our team is so proud of these young women for speaking. so many have shared their story and name and face and they should feel no shame because they did nothing wrong. he did.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's worth remembering once again that it was one woman who came public first, and when she did, she was ridiculed. folks rallied behind him. they tried to discredit her. they signed petitions in support of him. they believed him over her because of who he was purported to be. people continued to support him in this very community and believe him after we charged kyle stephens' case, after he faced multiple counts of criminal sexual conduct first against a minor. they chose to believe his lies over the words of a young woman who had nothing to gain by coming forward. nothing. some of his support wavered after he was charged with possessing tens of thousands of images of child pornography.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "yet, still there were people in power who had ideas he was framed and the images were planted, who were telling other victims this as they knew their truth. at the same time that these folks were supporting him and putting out those false narratives, these women and countless more you haven't met and who may be watching and reading, knew their truth. they knew he had abused them and they watched him continue to lie about committing that abuse. it has not been an easy process for these victims, especially rachael, all alone publicly for many, many months. to be accused of being a pied piper of sorts in court, in the press, to be accused of somehow planting this idea of victimhood in other women's minds, the gripping testimony these past two weeks have shown how absurd those arguments are.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you have seen first hand the effects this abuse has had on these women. that is tangible, physical evidence that this happened, that these women were abused, not bandwagon jumpers, not money grabbers. women and girls who were abused. for victims to realize years and decades later that they were, in fact, abused, sometimes hundreds of times when they really thought they were receiving legitimate treatment, it shifts their equilibrium. it shatters their sense of the world, their sense of safety, their conception of trust. it has caused them to question what they believe and know, and that has lasting consequences. unlike any other crime that comes before you judge aquilina, sexual abuse and assault so deeply affects and alters victims' lives. it seeps and oozes and permeates into every pore and crevice of a victim's life. it can alter their life's trajectory. we've seen that time and time again this week when we've heard mention of depression and anxiety and panic attacks, suicidal thoughts, self-medication, self-harm, question of self-worth, and even when we heard from donna markham some seven days ago about the suicide of (her daughter) chelsey.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the goal of these, frankly, large-scale human experiments is to increase the number of people given their first dose and thereby partially protected. similar proposals about delaying the second dose have been discussed in the us, though on monday, top officials from the us food and drug administration said in a statement that the fda does not support changing the vaccine administration protocol initially set forth, based on a lack of evidence that the vaccine would still be sufficiently effective with an altered administration plan. pfizer, for its part, has said that the trial data do not support that the first dose alone is effective beyond 21 days after injection.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in the us, whatever public confidence has been gained in covid-19 vaccines is largely rooted in the thorough and transparent evaluation process that allows anyone to attend fda and us centers for disease control and prevention advisory panel meetings, inspect the data and raise questions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "hence scientists and physicians can understand what is being evaluated and are able to recommend the vaccines to friends, family and the wider public. the authorization procedures in the uk are far less transparent. so when significant deviations from the recommended use of the approved vaccines are applied, how can the public trust the right decisions were made? how can knowledgeable independent healthcare professionals endorse those decisions when they are not privy to the process?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "making matters all the more concerning, the uk clinical trials of the oxford/astrazeneca vaccine were confusing and problematic. it's difficult to understand the basis of various conclusions drawn in the uk about the efficacy of this particular vaccine under various dosing conditions. perhaps for that reason, the fda is presumably waiting for an american efficacy trial to be completed before deciding on the approval of this vaccine.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the pfizer vaccine data, on the other hand, is very solid, but it appears to be badly misinterpreted in the uk. the fda briefing document specifically states in its efficacy summary of the vaccine that the available data cannot support a conclusion on the efficacy of a single dose of the vaccine. however, uk authorities say the plan to delay a second dose of the vaccines is based in part on efficacy data, citing calculations that estimate a single dose of the pfizer vaccine to have a 90% short term efficacy, and a single dose of the oxford vaccine to have a 70% short term efficacy.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "why the employer match is so important", "augmented": []}
{"original": "here's a simplified example that shows why this is so important. let's say that you earn $100,000 per year and that your employer will match 50% of your contributions, up to 5% of your salary. so, you choose to contribute $5,000 into your 401(k) each year and your employer matches 50% of your contributions for a total of $7,500 flowing into your account annually. over a 30-year period, your account could be expected to grow to approximately $708,000, assuming 7% annualized investment returns.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "on the other hand, let's say that you choose to contribute just 3% of your salary, which is a common automatic contribution level set by many employers. including the employer match, this means that just $4,500 will go into your account per year. each year, you're missing out on $1,000 in employer contributions that you could have received for contributing the 5% matching limit. what's more, a move like this can really add up over time -- assuming the same 7% annualized returns, your account would only grow to about $425,000. that $283,000 difference could have a big impact on your financial security after retirement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for this reason, the maximum contribution level your employer is willing to match should be the bare minimum you choose to put into your 401(k). not doing so is literally turning down free money. would you turn down a raise? of course not. not taking advantage of your employer match is just as silly.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "sure, not only is it possible to convert $400,000 -- or retirement savings of almost any amount -- to monthly income by buying an immediate annuity, that's exactly what an immediate annuity is designed to do: turn a lump sum of money into guaranteed payments that can support you throughout retirement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and for many people, although certainly not all, an immediate annuity can be an excellent way to generate at least some of the retirement income they require. after all, one of the most valuable features of immediate annuities is that they can churn out monthly income that's guaranteed to last no matter how long you live (which, given today's longer lifespans, might be well into your 90s).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "aside from the financial advantages of having income you can count on for the rest of your life, research also shows that retirees who receive income from a pension or annuity tend to be more satisfied with their life in retirement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "related: is a 15% savings rate enough for a secure retirement?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but immediate annuities also have downsides, the main one being that once you invest your money in such an annuity, you generally give up access to it. that means whatever portion of your savings you devote to an annuity will no longer be available to cover unexpected expenses that may pop up in retirement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so you don't want to put all of your savings into an immediate annuity. you'll want to have other assets, like a diversified portfolio of stock and bond funds and a cash reserve, that can provide some long-term capital growth to help you maintain your living standard in the face of inflation and that you can tap for emergencies and such.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "all of which is to say that the real issue you need to consider is whether an immediate annuity fits into an overall retirement income plan that makes sense for your situation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "answering these three questions can help you decide whether that's the case and, if so, just how much of your four hundred grand you might want to devote to an annuity.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "1. how much retirement income do you actually need? the first step toward gauging whether you're a candidate for an immediate annuity is to get a handle on how much annual income you'll require to cover your retirement expenses. and the best way to do that is to create a retirement budget.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this budget doesn't have to be accurate down to the last cent. rather, if you estimate your expenses as best you can and then refine your figures as you get a better sense of your actual retirement spending, that should be fine. you want to come away with as realistic an idea as you can of what your outlays will be during retirement so you can gauge how much income you'll need to cover them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you can create a retirement budget with pencil and paper if you like. but i think you'll find it easier (and more accurate) to use an online tool like blackrock's retirement expense worksheet. this free interactive worksheet allows you to enter upwards of 50 separate expenses. it includes a section for discretionary items (entertainment, dining out, hobbies, traveling, etc.), which gives you a sense of how much maneuvering room you have should you need to reduce expenses and makes it easy to identify specific expenses you can easily pare.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "while you're doing your budget, i suggest you also take the time to do a little lifestyle planning -- that is, consider such issues as whether you'll stay in your current home, downsize or maybe even relocate to a less expensive area; whether you'll seek part-time work after you call it a career; and, whether you plan to spend most of your time pursuing activities close to home or do lots of traveling. the more you can factor the way you plan to live in retirement into your budget, the more accurate it will be.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "2. how much income will you receive from social security and other assured sources? before you commit to buying more guaranteed income via an annuity, you should check to see how much assured income you're already scheduled to receive.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for example, if you're among the minority of workers these days who qualifies for a traditional check-a-month pension, you can check with your hr department to see what size benefit you'll receive after retiring. (some pension plans offer the choice of taking your pension benefit in monthly payments or as a lump sum (or even both), in which case you'll need to consider which option makes the most sense.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for most people, though, social security will be their main, if not only, source of guaranteed retirement income. if you haven't already begun collecting benefits, you can see what size payments you're projected to receive based on your work history by going to the social security administration's retirement estimator tool.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you can (and should) also use the tool to see how much your monthly social security payment may increase if you delay collecting for a few years. the amount you receive rises roughly 7% to 8% for each year you postpone taking benefits between the ages of 62 and 70. unless you have good reason to believe you'll live less than your life expectancy, it's generally a good idea to hold off claiming social security, provided you have sufficient assets to fund your retirement while you delay.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the main idea, though, is to gauge how much guaranteed income you can count on without buying an annuity. by comparing that figure to the amount of income you'll need to cover your retirement expenses, you'll be in a much better position to decide whether it makes sense to devote a portion of your savings to an annuity to generate even more guaranteed income.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "3. how much additional guaranteed income, if any, do you feel you need? if the monthly income you'll get from social security and any pensions is sufficient to pay all or nearly all of your essential retirement expenses, then from a purely financial standpoint you probably don't need additional guaranteed income from an annuity. you can probably draw as needed from your retirement nest egg to cover any expenses beyond what social security and any pensions will cover as well as any money you may need for emergencies and unplanned expenses.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that said, if you feel that additional assured income from an annuity will give you greater peace of mind or allow you to better enjoy your retirement, then, hey, go for it. just be sure that you'll still have enough savings in stocks, bonds and cash to give yourself enough financial flexibility should your income needs change in retirement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if, on the other hand, your basic living costs are greater than what you'll collect from social security and any pensions -- which will probably be the case for most people -- then you might want to at least consider bridging some or all of the gap by using a portion of your nest egg to buy income with an immediate annuity.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "today, for example, investing $100,000 in an immediate annuity will get a 65-year-old man about $560 a month in guaranteed income for life. that same $100,000 would buy about $530 a month in lifetime income for a 65-year-old woman and about $480 a month in monthly payments that would be paid as long as either member of a 65-year-old couple (man and woman) is still alive.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "of course, even if your expenses exceed the income you'll receive from social security and any pensions, that doesn't automatically mean you need an annuity. if the gap between your expenses and assured income is relatively small -- or if your nest egg is so large that you run very little risk of running through it during your lifetime -- then you may very well be able to rely on withdrawals from savings for any additional income you need.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "to get an idea of how long your nest egg is likely to last given different levels of withdrawals, you can check out this retirement income calculator.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "finally, if you do decide you're a likely candidate for an annuity, i recommend that you learn a bit more about how immediate annuities work and get to know their pros and cons. you might also want to check out these 5 tips for choosing the best annuity.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if you feel you need some help in assessing whether an immediate annuity is a good choice, you can always consult an adviser. but if you do, be sure you're dealing with a financial pro who can be objective when it comes to annuities, not one who would never recommend an annuity under any circumstances, nor one who's really more about selling annuities than providing financial advice.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "but after the debate, weber called a biden campaign aide.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we said, 'hey, we know you guys have your own plan, but it's really not helpful for you to be sh*tting on the green new deal, weber recalled. he prodded the campaign to stick to the language it embraced in more comfortable settings and its own website, which described the project gauzily as a useful framework for boosting the economy, fighting for environmental justice and addressing the climate crisis -- all of it baked into biden's own build back better agenda.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but that crossroads moment was about more than climate policy. young voters were the foundation of the sunrise-biden relationship during the campaign. biden wanted their support. sunrise understood what it took to unlock it. the desire of democrats to keep them energized now is what could, potentially, sustain the coalition going forward.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what we wanted to make clear to them, weber said of the post-debate conversation, was our perspective that ... just as there's a fierce right wing constituency and it's animated against the green new deal, there's an even bigger constituency of young people for whom the green new deal is something that they are dedicating their lives to realizing and making possible.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "by shoving it aside on such a big stage, weber believed, biden had, in effect, telegraphed to young voters that he did not take the issue -- one they prized above all others -- seriously.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biden's rhetoric mostly stayed the same. he spent parts of the final few weeks of the campaign insisting that he had never supported, or even hinted, that he wanted to ban fracking. but on the ground, the campaign targeted young voters with information about its climate plan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one foot in, one foot out", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sunrise leaders, along with other progressives who have established relationships with biden's inner circle, have praised his close aides for keeping a thick skin. the richmond episode didn't shut the door on communications. other criticism of his picks has been largely brushed off -- a departure from the obama administration, which had the reputation of taking less kindly to sharp, public pushback.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "prakash never lobbied the obama team -- she was in her teens during the last democratic transition -- but said she has heard from older allies that the attitude of (biden chief of staff) ron klain vs. (obama chief of staff) rahm emanuel is night and day.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the first clash could come in the opening days and weeks of the biden presidency, when the administration and democrats in congress craft and begin negotiations with republicans on what he has promised will be a transformative stimulus bill. this summer, prakash told cnn she believed that if the first leg of this is a massive infrastructure and jobs plan to reboot the economy and climate isn't a central pillar of that, we're totally screwed.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the uncertainty surrounding control of the senate, where democrats need to sweep a pair of runoff elections next week to win a majority, had created additional murkiness around sunrise's plan of action. the details of the stimulus bill will be important, she said, but we can't bank on congress to legislate and have that be the be-all-end-all for climate policy in 2021 or in the biden administration.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "representative greene said if we don't impeach him the president's going to win reelection. we got to do it. mot importantly, most importantly five democrat members of this committee voted to move forward with impeachment before the phone call ever happened. the truth is the attacks actually started before the inauguration even before the election. ranking member talked about this. hi opening statement july 2016 fbi opens investigation so called trump-raja (ph) coordination collusion which was never there. opened an investigation spied on two american citizens associated with the presidential campaign. my guess is that's probably never happened in american history, but they did it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and for 10 months jim comey fbi investigated the president, guess what after 10 months they had nothing. and you know why we know that because when we disposed mr. comey last congress he told us they didn't have a thing. no matter, special counsel mueller gets appointed and they do a two year $40 million, 19 lawyer unbelievable investigation and guess what they come back and they got nothing. but the democrats don't care. so now we get this, a bunch of depositions in the bunker and the basement of the capital, witnesses who aren't allowed to answer questions about who they talked to about the phone call. we get this all based on some anonymous whistleblower, no first hand knowledge biased against the president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "these facts have never changed, we learned these right away. who worked with vice president biden , who wrote a memo the day after somebody talked to him about the call, awaited 18 days to file a complaint, 18 days to file a complaint. what did he do in those 18 days? we all know, ran off and talked with chairman schiff's staff. and then hired the legal team that i just talked about, one of those steps in the whole impeachment coup as his legal team has said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this is scary what these guys are putting our country through. it is sad, it is scary, it is wrong. and the good news is the american people see through it all, they know the facts are on the president's side as representative stefanik said, four facts will never change. we've got the transcript which they never thought the president would release. shows no coordination, not conditionality, no linkage. we got the two guys on the call president trump, president zelensky, who have side nothing wrong no pressure no pushing here. we've got the fact that ukrainians didn't even know aid was held up at the time of the call and most importantly we have yet to have one witness tell us that the any evidence from anyone that president zelensky did anything on investigations to get the aid released.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "those facts will never change. the facts are on the president's side, the process is certainly not. it has been the most unfair process we have ever seen and the american people understand that. those 63 million americans they understand it and frankly i think a lot of other do as well. they see what this for what it is. and they know this is wrong, especially wrong just 11 months before the next election. i yield bank.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "welch: thank you. what this hearing is about, i think was best stated by colonel vindman's opening statement. the question before us is this, is it improper for the president of the united states to demand a foreign government investigate the united states citizen and political opponent? it's very well stated.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i just listened to mr. jordan, as you did as well, and i heard his criticisms in the process, nothing really happened, a lot of people are out to get the president. i didn't hear an answer to the question, as to whether it's proper for the president of the united states to demand a foreign government to investigate a u.s. citizen and political opponent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and to date, i haven't heard any one of my republican colleagues address that question.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "colonel vindman and ms. williams, thank you. i want to ask some questions that go through the background. what's come out during this process is that we had two ukraine policies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one was bipartisan and long-standing, and that was to assist ukraine, which had freed itself from the domination of russia, to fight corruption and to resist russian aggression. is that a fair statement, colonel vindman?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "vindman: i think that's a fair characterization, congressman.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "welch: and to give folks a reminder of the extent of corruption, by the way, a legacy of putin's russia, is your understanding that when their prior president, mr. yanukovych fled to russia into the arms of mr. putin, he took with him $30 to $40 billion of that impoverished country?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "vindman: those -- there are different estimates, but it's on that scale, yes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "welch: vast scale for a poor country. and is it your understanding that powerless, but motivated ukrainians rose up in protest to this incredible graft in theft and abuse by their president?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "welch: and that was in the maidan -- it was called the maidan revolution, the revolution of dignity, correct?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "welch: one hundred and six died, including people who were shot by snipers, kids, and yanukovych had put snipers on the rooftops of buildings to shoot into that square and kill, murder, slaughter, those young people. is that your understanding?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "welch: in our bipartisan support, and by the way, i want to say to my republican colleagues, a lot of leadership to have this bipartisan support came from your side, thank you. but our whole commitment was to get rid of corruption and to stop that russian aggression, is that correct?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "vindman: that amounts to some of the key pillars. welch: that's right. and the giuliani, sondmand (ph), and it appears, trump policy was not about that, it was about investigations into a political opponent. correct? i'll take that question back, we know it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and you know, i'm going to say this to president trump, you want to investigate joe biden, you want to investigate hunter biden, go at it. do it. do it hard. do it dirty. do it the way you do do it. just don't do it by asking a foreign leader to help you in your campaign. that's your job, it's not his.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "my goal in these hearings is two things, one is to get an answer to colonel vindman's question. and the second, coming out of this, is for us, as a congress, to return to the ukraine policy that nancy pelosi and kevin mccarthy both support. it's not investigations, it's the restoration of democracy in ukraine and the resistance of russian aggression. i yield back.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "maloney: i can't blame you for feeling that way, sir. particularly when i've been sitting here listening to my republican colleagues, one of the advantages of being down here at the kids table, is that you get to hear the folks above your ask their questions. and i've been listening closely to my republican colleagues and i've heard them say just about everything except to contradict any of the substantive testimony you've both given.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "vindman: frankly, i couldn't believe what i was hearing. there was probably an element of shock that maybe in certain regards my worst fear of how our ukraine policy could play out was playing out. and how this was likely to have significant implications for u.s. national security.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "it is vitally important that the american people understand how president trumps unethical demand that ukraine deliver a politically- motivated investigation in exchange for military assistance created a security risk for our, the united states of america, national security. the president was not just playing a political game by upholding military aid and meetings with ukraine, threatening the hundreds of millions of dollars of military assistance that congress had appropriated has real-life consequences for ukraine and for the usa.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "my colleagues have tried to make the argument here today and we've heard it before that the president was just interested in fighting corruption. that's our goal, fighting corruption in ukraine, this terribly corrupt country. the problem of course with that is there is no evidence of the president trying to fight corruption. the evidence all points in the other direction. the evidence points the direction of the president inviting ukraine to engage in the corrupt act of investigating a u.s. political opponent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ambassador yovanovitch was known as a strong fighter of corruption so what does the president do? he recalls her from her post. ambassador yovanovitch, in fact, was at a meeting celebrating other anticorruption fighters including a woman who had acid thrown in her face on the day she was told to get on the next plane back to washington. you prepared talking points for the president's first conversation with zelensky. he's supposed to talk about rooting out corruption. if this president had such a deep interest in rooting out corruption in ukraine, surely he would've brought it up in the call but of course we now know that he did not.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we then see rudy giuliani not fighting corruption but asking for an investigation of the bidens and my colleagues say well maybe he was acting on his own. even though he says he's acting as the president's lawyer, maybe he was really acting on his own but the two investigations that rudy giuliani wanted, come up in the meeting you participate in on july 10th at the white house, when ambassador sondland brings up the bidens and burisma of 2016, tells the ukrainians who want that meeting at the white house, you've got to do these investigations.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "and it's also made clear they want the white house meeting and ultimately if they want $400 million in u.s. aid, this is what they have to do. the only lament i hear from my colleagues is it wasn't successful, they got caught, they didn't get the political investigations and they still had to release the money. now, they still haven't gotten the white house meeting but they had to release the money because the whistleblower blew the whistle -- the whistleblower the president wants to punish -- and because congress announced it was doing investigations, and very soon thereafter, the president was forced to lift the hold on the aid.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they argue well this makes it -- this makes it ok, that it was a failed effort to bribe ukraine, a failed effort to extort ukraine. that doesn't make it better, it's no less odious because it was discovered and it was stopped. and we have courageous people like yourself who come forward, who report things, who do what they should do, who have a sense, as you put it, colonel, of duty -- of duty. not to the person of the president, but to the presidency and to the country, and we thank you for that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "at the end of the day, i think this all comes back to something we heard from another career foreign service officer just last friday, in a conversation he overheard with the president in a restaurant in ukraine, in which the president, not rudy giuliani, not anyone else, the president of the united states wanted to know are they going to do the investigation? this is the day after that july 25th call -- are they going to do the investigations? and he's ensured by ambassador sondland they're going to do it.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "at a minimum, prosecutors at both the federal and state levels need to dig in and take a hard look here. trump's conduct first could have violated federal law that prohibits a person from knowingly and willfully depriv(ing) or defraud(ing)... the residents of a state of a fair and impartially conducted election process by... the procurement, casting, or tabulation of ballots that are known by the person to be materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there's no real question that trump asked raffensperger to count ballots that were never actually cast for him. trump's theory that he won georgia, and the presidential election as a whole, is a madcap patchwork of self-perpetuating conspiracy theories, utterly divorced from reality. in fact, everybody from trump's former attorney general to the fbi to the department of homeland security to dozens of judges across the country (appointed by both political parties) have soundly rejected trump's claim of widespread voter fraud.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "perversely, trump's best defense here might be that he actually -- however delusional it may sound -- believes he won georgia and had votes stolen from him. in that case, it would be difficult for prosecutors to prove that the ballots trump seeks to have counted were known by the person to be materially false.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but a prosecutor might point to trump's own language to counter that defense. trump didn't ask raffensperger simply to count all the votes, but rather to find -- trump's own word -- exactly 11,780 ballots , which would give trump a win in georgia by one vote . that doesn't sound like a true belief that he won; that sounds like an effort to manufacture a win.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "but, according to nbc news, biden also reportedly does not want his presidency to be distracted by investigations of the former president. if true, on that count, biden would be wrong. it's simply not acceptable for prosecutors to glide past trump's misconduct -- and to decline even to investigate -- solely for fear of ruffling some feathers. sometimes prosecutors have to take hard looks at powerful people. it's unacceptable to take a pass on a case merely because it might upset political tranquility in washington, dc.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "georgia state-level prosecutors also have a role to play here. georgia state law is similar to federal law; it prohibits a person from solicit(ing) or request(ing) that another person violate election law, including tampering with vote counts or reporting false election returns.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ultimately, georgia prosecutors could be the only ones left standing. if trump tries to issue a pardon to himself during his last days in office, that pardon -- even if it was legally valid, which is far from certain -- would protect him only against federal charges. but a presidential pardon has no impact on state-level charges.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i spent 14-plus years as a federal and state prosecutor. i understand how difficult it can be to prove a crime based on the subject's state of mind. and i fully appreciate the political and practical issues that could accompany a potential criminal charge against the prior president. it is fair for prosecutors to weigh these concerns. but prosecutors are simply not doing their jobs if they don't at least commit to investigate, find all the relevant facts, and then make a decision about whether a criminal charge is warranted. to not even open an investigation -- to refuse to even dig in and get all the facts -- would be an abdication of prosecutorial duty.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "special event joint committees deliver opening statements at congressional hearing on firestone recall aired september 6, 2000 - 1:41 p.m. et this is a rush transcript. this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. lou waters, cnn anchor: we are covering the testimony about to be heard up on capitol hill before two house subcommittees. opening statements are now being heard in the committee room. john dingell from michigan has the floor. let's listen. (joined in progress) rep. john dingell (d), michigan: ... bridgestone/firestone announced august 9 as the second largest tire recall ever. it is surpassed only by firestone's recall of 14.5 million tires in 1978. the recall in 1978 lead to hearings where this committee disclosed many of the same problems that are involved with the recall today. then, like now, tread belt separations on firestone tires were involved in accidents causing serious injury and death. then, like now, many of firestone's problems related to its client in decatur, illinois. the recent recall came about only after ford motor company, whose vehicles were equipped with many of the recall tires, was given access to firestone's claims data in late july, and was able to link 46 deaths and a large number of claims to accidents involving three 15- inch models of firestone tires: atx, atxii and wilderness at. since august 9, the number of fatalities attributed to these tires has grown to 88, according to the national highway traffic safety administration. time, then, is of the essence.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i do note that after my letter of august 11, firestone agreed to speed up its recall by reimbursing consumers who had replaced their tires with those of a competitor. more is riding on this hearing, however, than the reputations of firestone and ford. countless americans are on the road today picking up their kids, driving to work, and the last thing that should worry them is the quality and the soundness of their tires. it is unconscionable that so many have been placed in this kind of situation. today, almost one full month after the recall was announced, neither firestone nor nhtsa, the government agency responsible for tire safety, has been able to identify why these tires are failing and why serious accidents are occurring. consumers, therefore, have justifiably expressed a great deal of concern for their safety and for that of their loved ones, as well as a lot of frustration about the way this story has unfolded. every day there seems to be some new disclosure, fostering apprehension that firestone may not yet have control of the problem. the concern was compounded by a recent full-page ad placed by firestone in major countries -- in major papers around the country assuring consumers that it acted appropriately but acknowledging it does not know what's causing the tires to fail. in order to restore public confidence, firestone must identify the root cause of its failure problem, and quickly and fully disclose their findings.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "consumers can also take little comfort from firestone's explanation of why it took so long to identify the firestone failure problem. according to firestone, the problem eluded them because manufacturers never properly analyzed data and personnel claims to identify defects or problems with tires. they say the university of claims data is simply too small. but a staff examination of the records, revealed since 1995 firestone had reports on more than 1,600 lawsuits, property claims and personal injury claims involving their recalled tires. i must say i find it curious that firestone did not regard 1,600 claims as significant when it took only 21 claims for state farm insurance company to decide that a potential problem existed. records available to the committee also indicate that some in firestone, in apparent contradiction of its statements to committee staff and others, analyzed their claims dated 1998. these firestone analyses show that the claims were especially high for atx tires, and the claims were highest for tires produced at the decatur, illinois, plant. contrary to firestone's other assertions, at least one other american tire company, goodyear, says it routinely looks at all its customer data, including claims data, to identify defect or failure trends with its tires. whatever else we learn at the hearing today, we hope that we will find that all involved will find the need for more open and detail communication regarding these critical products and how they perform in the field.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if it is industry practice not to share claims with automakers, then it is time for that practice to change, by statute or otherwise. had the houston television station not run the story that we've seen today, perhaps we would not be discussing these matters. as to nhtsa, we need to know that its resources are adequate; that it can effectively perform its important safety work. if budget cuts and other restrictions placed on that agency prevent it from protecting the public, then this committee should seriously look at increasing the budget and freeing the agency from constraints. it is also entirely appropriate at a time like this to evaluate whether nhtsa's statutory authority is sufficient, and i trust we will hear about this as we go forward. again, mr. chairman, i thank you and chairman upton for holding this hearing, and i look forward to the testimony of the witnesses. waters: john dingell, whose michigan district includes ford headquarters. ed garsten up there in detroit. ed, i understand you talked to mr. dingell recently? ed garsten, cnn detroit bureau chief: i did, indeed, lou, last week. in fact, i sat in his townhouse, which is roughly one mile from the world -- ford world headquarters, and i asked him, i said, you know, how can you be impartial in this when ford is in your district? he said, my concern is for safety of all motorists, i'm not a defender of ford.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "although you might have noticed, lou, i don't think that i heard the word ford or ford motor company... waters: you did not, no, you did not. garsten: ... in his entire statement. and he has said all along, and he said flatly to us, that he puts the blame squarely on the part of bridgestone/firestone and on the nhtsa for the problem here with the tires. waters: and he mentioned nhtsa and their regulatory power and maybe might have to be enhanced by legislative action of some sort. do you expect that that might be the case? garsten: well, that may be the major outcropping of this whole investigation aside, of course, from finding out, perhaps, why this all happened. but they certainly -- the agency certainly either didn't feel that it wanted to act or that it should act, or just didn't do anything, got the data and either didn't analyze it or act on it properly in this. so you may very well find that this becomes an agency with a lot more power. now, you also have to remember, lou, that this is an agency that got its new administrator only a couple of weeks ago, so it's in a period of transition at this point still. waters: and there'll be a lot of answers: i don't know or we didn't have to know and there was no regulation suggesting that a report had to be made about this, that or the other thing? garsten: sure.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "it is surpassed only by the deaths and injuries that resulted from the ford pinto rear-mounted gas tank and a gmc pickup externally mounted gas tank. unfortunately, many things have not changed since 1978. firestone, then as now, has found no manufacturing or design defect, but blames the consumer for every single failure. firestone alleges that consumers drive too fast, under-inflate their tires, drive in hot climates, overload the vehicle, and don't do proper maintenance then, as now, firestone decatur plant showed up as a source of an unusual amount of failing tires. then, as now, firestone cannot explain why other brands of tires don't have the same failure rate. then, as now, the national highway transportation safety administration, nhtsa, standards for tire strength were and are grossly inadequate. in fact, they have not changed those standards since 1968, long before there were steel-belted radials and the popular sport utility vehicles. there are a few new wrinkles. this time, the tires are found mainly on one company's vehicle: the ford explorer suv and light trucks. and firestone has two new factors to blame: hot climates, which stress its tires, and high ozone, which degrades its tires. the other change is that ford, until recently, had agreed that -- with firestone, that there was nothing wrong with the tires. ford made these statements despite receiving more and more complaints from their dealers who were wondering why only firestone tires failed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mr. chairman, we're going to hear a lot today about firestone didn't know there was a problem, ford didn't know there was a problem, nhtsa didn't know there was a problem until a houston television station told them there was. the documents the committee has received, along with the news reports, indicate that all these parties knew a great deal more in 1998 and 1999 about tire failures than the houston television station did. they just ignored it. we also are going to hear from a number of witnesses that the number of failures was so small that no one could have been expected to pay attention. yes, the numbers begin small, but because the propensity of the suvs to rollover when a tire fails, the cost in deaths and injuries was inordinately high and increasingly at an alarming rate. both ford and firestone should have known and should have watched this particular vehicle more closely. with less than 6,000 vehicles in the entire country of saudi arabia, there were 18 accidents in saudi arabia, including seven fatalities in 1999. the u.s. had four. and there was another large group in venezuela. despite what anyone says about the conditions in all these countries, one fact remains: other tires under same conditions did not fail. that should have alert everyone. it alerted the state farm insurance company, it alerted the center for auto safety. unfortunately ford, firestone and nhtsa failed to act.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mr. chairman, if we cannot depend on ford and firestone to tell us what happened, the american consumers are tired of hearing firestone blame its customers for the problems found in their tires. american consumers are tired of hearing ford blame firestone. consumers don't want to go out and buy four tires and ask the dealer to throw in a vehicle; they buy a vehicle and the tires are part of that vehicle. today i'm going to ask firestone and ford to join with me in calling for and cooperating with an independent review of these tire failures worldwide to determine the cause of the failure and to propose solutions and report back to this committee and the public by the end of the year. in the meantime, i believe the recall should be widened to include all 15- and 16-inch firestone tires, as has been done in venezuela and saudi arabia. we here in the united states deserve to be treated no differently than people in other parts of the world. we deserve an answer to the many questions that will be raised here today. i'm afraid that firestone, ford and nhtsa can't find the answers. let's join together to call for and support a fully independent review of this situation so that we can find the answers. the public deserves an answer, this committee deserves an answer, and most of all, the families of the 88 people who've lost their lives deserve an answer.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "i suspect that there will be heightened cooperation within the automotive and tire industries from now on. the regulatory question to ask is whether agency resources have been put in the right place, and whether regulators are focusing their attention on the most important issues. we should also resolve to do the most good for the consumer, by putting agendas aside and responding on the basis of the facts as they emerge. i was disturbed to find a web site called, quote, the firestone tire recall legal information center, end quote. this seemed to be more devoted to finding cases for trial lawyers than for providing assistance to consumers. there will be some hard questioning today, and properly so. the commerce committee has a long tradition of oversight in the public interest. we must put safety first. i look forward to our witnesses and the questioning that will follow. and i yield back. waters: congressional hearing getting under way up on capitol hill with opening statements by members of two subcommittees. we're expecting to hear from witnesses who you've seen shots of along the way here. they include sue bailey, who is the administrator of nhtsa, the new administrator of nhtsa, the bridgestone/firestone ceo, masatoshi ono and the ford ceo, jacques nasser. we'll also be hearing from a spokesman for state farm and the center for auto safety this afternoon.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "now we begin the second year of the most decisive decade in history, where concrete action is crucial to meeting the goals of the landmark agreement. since paris, well over 100 countries have pledged to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner. this means only emitting as much as can be balanced through absorption -- for example, by forests, peat bogs, mangroves, soil and seaweed forests -- and will require massive reductions in the emissions currently being released into the atmosphere.", "augmented": []}

(the study was based on a national sample of 1,644 registered voters interviewed between aug. 26 and 28. the sampling error is thus plus or minus 3% and 4.5% when comparing present trend readings with previous time studies.) still, the survey discloses just how shaky those current preferences are. fully 55% say they are not personally interested or excited about any of the candidates.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "only 11% report genuine enthusiasm for reagan; a mere 9% feel that way about carter and 6% about anderson. in fact, much of the support given their preferred candidates is based on voters' opposition to the others, the choices are essentially anti votes. thus 43% of the voters who prefer reagan say they do so because they are really voting against carter. similarly, 34% of carter's supporters say their choice is based on opposition to reagan, while a hefty 61% of anderson's followers admit that they are motivated by being against carter and reagan. though carter and reagan are even up in the race, the poll discloses areas of serious slippage for reagan in important areas. for one thing, 59% of those preferring carter claim they do so out of a positive feeling for him: they like his experience, and consider him safer in foreign affairs. only 48% of reagan's followers feel a similar sense of confidence in their choice's ability to get things done and to answer the need for a change. at the same time, reagan's rating on abilities regarded as important by voters has declined. in time's last survey in may, 49% of those sampled agreed that reagan was a leader you can trust, while 42% believe that now. reagan was then considered acceptable as a president by 64%; the current figure is 54%.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "voter confidence in reagan's ability to handle the economy has dropped from an impressive 75% to 66%, and his perceived competency in foreign affairs has slipped from 72% to 63%. the californian still worries voters on a basic level: 54% of those surveyed feel that he often does not get his facts straight, and 48% fret that he may be trigger happy. despite these declines, reagan still scores higher than carter in such voter-valued categories as standing up to the soviets, keeping our defenses strong, getting the hostages out of iran and making americans feel good about themselves. on other matters, voters cannot see a major difference between carter and reagan on such matters as who could find more jobs for the unemployed, provided moral leadership, cut back u.s. dependence on foreign oil, or avoid making too many campaign promises. geographically, there has been a significant shift in carter's 1980 popularity in the south. among white southern protestants, reagan leads by 48% to 39%, indicating he has made inroads among the potentially influential evangelical and fundamentalist voters who supported carter in 1976. this leaves carter with a statistically insignificant 1% lead in his home territory. reagan commands a 10% margin in the west, while carter barely stays ahead in the northeast and midwest. this time the survey was deepened to poll more thoroughly in the nation's key industrial states (indiana, michigan, illinois, ohio, pennsylvania, new jersey and new york). the aim was to detect any notable shifts in the blue-collar vote.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "large-scale defections from the democratic party helped both dwight eisenhower and richard nixon win the presidency and today seem vital to reagan's prospects. so far, no real switch has been found. carter leads by 10 percentage points among blue-collar workers, setting these states up as some of the key battleground between now and november. the survey pinpoints one group of voters still posing a considerable problem for carter: the former followers of senator edward kennedy. despite the efforts at the democratic national convention to patch up the party's deep rift and kennedy's later pledges of support for carter, the senator's followers now split three ways on what they intend to do: 39% say they will back carter; 28% prefer anderson; a surprising 22% are so disaffected that they say they will jump over the wall and vote for reagan. that degree of party defection could cripple the carter candidacy. the mood could well be, however, just a passing stage of postconvention blues. while the kennedy problem lingers for carter, the anderson difference so confidently proclaimed by the earnest and stubborn congressman from illinois has not really faded either. if anderson were to drop out, 37% of his present share of the voters say they would switch to carter, 28% would go to reagan and 26% claim they would not vote at all. with anderson out, carter narrowly leads reagan in the nationwide popular vote, 44.5% to 43%.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "however, the sampling did not examine just how anderson has scored 20% or higher in key states, such as new york, california and massachusetts. one of the most dramatic findings of the survey came from a more indirect probing of voter sentiment -- and it looks potentially helpful to carter. in the survey's state of the nation indicator, which measures how people feel about the way things are going in the country in general and how much confidence they have in the future, voters are becoming increasingly optimistic. while only 11% took a positive view of the nation's well-being in may, 21% are upbeat now. as the incumbent, carter would presumably benefit from any continued upsurge in optimism, which seems centered on a belief that the economy may be revving up again. while nearly all the polls have found that the economy ranks first as an issue, well ahead of foreign affairs, the time study finds that, surprisingly, neither has much impact on voter preferences for the presidential candidates. many polls reveal the voters are thoroughly confused when asked to make judgments about the candidates on most issues; the election seems much more likely to turn on personality than on policy, notes time national political correspondent john stacks. one intriguing but as yet unexplained phenomenon that might be linked to issues is yankelovich's discovery that 10% more women prefer carter than reagan. this is balanced, however, by reagan's 10% edge among men.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the vacillations in the polls make most opinion analysts and political scientists leery about how the current campaigns and their various pitches will affect the voters. traditionally, of course, a majority of postwar voters have turned to the democratic candidates during a time of economic recession or depression on the theory that the party of f.d.r. is more likely to use government tools to check the decline. but now a democratic president is presiding over high inflation and a recession. simultaneously, government intervention in the economy has become more suspect. observes m.i.t. political scientist thomas ferguson: the signals coming down to the voters are incredibly mixed. there is an enormous amount of confusion even in the political parties. there is turmoil at all sectors of the electorate. appearing on a panel of pollsters convened in washington by the american political science association, warren mitofsky of cbs news's election and survey unit contended that the issues carry little weight with voters intent on examining the character of the candidates. said he: we are really seeing a loss of respect for our system of selecting our elective officials. this disenchantment with the candidates is causing voters to look at the personalities rather than the issues.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in a moment of rare introspection for a presidential candidate, anderson last week talked at length to time correspondent eileen shields during a flight from detroit to washington about the dilemma posed by the nature of the politician process in 1980. i have a fundamental conflict in my thinking that troubles me deeply, he said. i know if i want to please a crowd i repeat, just as reagan does, the tried-and-true crowd-pleasers over and over again. but i am really going to repeat in my prayers every night the hope that i can resist the temptation. you know, when carter and reagan are so vulnerable it is hard to resist the temptation. but i don't think that is what the campaign should be about -- or what the country wants. i can't in the end really sell myself to the country if i am just going around knocking those two. i've got to have something fresh, constructive and different to offer, and it is hard. it is so hard to stay off that other kick, particularly when reagan shoots four out of five toes as he has done the last couple of weeks. i am not contemptuous of applause. i want people to listen. i want them to respond. i want to inspire them. but i would hope that i have a higher calling than to simply play to the lowest common denominator. still, conceded anderson, we are like performers. you're up and you're down.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sometimes you think of something and it inspires you and sometimes you look at your watch and you are not so inspired. more than the other candidates. anderson can move an audience with his oratory one day, only to turn off his next crowd with a ponderous and even pontificating style of delivery. the president and the former governor seem far less concerned about resisting the temptation that worries anderson; they have been zapping each other with increasing zing almost daily. the attacks are deliberate. reagan is the best standup performer in politics today says john sears, the campaign manager whom reagan fired last february. but the fact remains that reagan's position in the polls is derived from what people think of carter. thus the central issue for reagan's campaign will be to denigrate carter's record. despite his speaking skills, reagan has of course, been too busy trying to explain away a series of bloopers either to maintain a consistent attack on carter's performance or to attract attention to the republican policies that he has proposed. not only has reagan fallen into uttering such needlessly provocative comments as advocating official governmental contacts with taiwan, praising the viet nam war as a noble cause, suggesting that darwinism be countered by teaching the biblical story of creation as well, and terming the current recession a severe depression, but his own advisers have jumped readily into the ensuing fray, like a greek chorus of mourners, to concede in most cases that reagan was wrong.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "says dean burch, the senior adviser to bush: there is a possibility that the caricature of reagan will become a reality. we have to guard against it. while some of the impulsive reaganisms may have pleased his more conservative supporters, they feed the doubts about his judgment that bother other voters. thus the tense staff is trying to set up fail-safe systems to protect reagan against reagan. his aides are more carefully reviewing every speech text for pitfalls and insisting that the governor just stick with the typed pages. in addition, an outside heavyweight adviser -- last week it was james lynn, who headed gerald ford's office of management and budget -- will ride shotgun on the campaign planes to help reagan. the staff itself, however, remains a problem: it is still far too disorganized. says an old reagan friend: ron doesn't know how to be tough with people. sometimes he tolerates so-so performances. more emphasis and money will go into reagan's paid tv commercials. the budget was pegged last week at about $15 million, up $1 million from original plans, and seven spots (three five-minute and four 30-second plugs) have begun to be aired. they are slotted within, before or after such well-watched family shows as the waltons, guiding light, angie and abc friday night movie. on tv, reagan's delivery is warm, low key and artfully staged to project an air of sincerity. contends peter dailey, reagan's tv ad producer: the camera can look into the soul. in reagan's case, that's a big asset.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "while he has talked repeatedly about the need for the u.s. to regain nuclear superiority over the soviet union, prompting carter to accuse him of announcing that he would start an arms race, reagan's tv pitch will be milder. seated in an easy chair, he says disarmingly. to preserve our peace and freedom, we must maintain a margin of safety -- not numerical superiority . . . but a balance. the basic reagan geographical strategy remains unchanged. his aides estimate his firm base in the west will produce about 150 electoral votes. east of the mississippi, such states as indiana, new hampshire, vermont and virginia are seen as reasonably safe, giving him another 30 votes, just 90 short of election. even if carter should hold the deep south, which is far from certain, reagan will look for his victory margin in five targeted states: ohio, illinois, pennsylvania, texas and florida. they have 121 electoral votes, and if reagan can win just the largest three, he should wind up in the oval office. thus nearly 40% of his currently scheduled campaign time (49 days of travel and 95 major appearances) will be devoted to these five states. at the moment, reagan's aides consider his home state, california, safe enough to be downplayed a bit. new york looks fairly solid for carter, but with the president being increasingly whittled away there by anderson, the californian may step up his efforts to win the state's 41 electoral votes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "anderson's prospects of taking more votes from carter in new york will be strengthened if, as expected, he gets a place on the state's liberal party ballot. as for the carter staff, it has been astonished by its candidate's catch-up last week: that reagan is doing our work for us.' other advisers are more cautious. campaign manager robert strauss professes to be worried that carter's rally will generate overconfidence. says he: i don't think reagan necessarily is dumb. i don't think he is going to get us into atomic warfare. i don't think he is evil. he's a very likable, attractive man. but strauss pinpoints carter's re-election strategy: to portray reagan as simplistic and not equipped to be president. proud of his presidential performance, carter intends to play up his record. still, the president's main theme will be to attack reagan. sums up hamilton jordan, carter's chief strategist: we can have a philosophical discussion about all the issues that face the american people, but the fact is the american people face a choice: jimmy carter or ronald reagan. strauss long ago correctly guessed that reagan's advisers would limit his public appearances. says strauss: they're going to try to show just a little bit of leg, but not enough to get him into trouble. by contrast, carter will join the rough-and- tumble exchange of town meetings and press interviews, where he has invariably been at his best. contends strauss: the public likes very much to see the president in the flesh, nonstructured and nonpackaged.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he likes it too. the carter television campaign will stress his heavy responsibilities as president and portray him as being deeply concerned about the particular problems of unemployed blue-collar workers and older people. to tape his commercials, carter has slipped quietly into a suburban alexandria, va., home to chat with eight housewives in a backyard. he has eluded the press to go to a construction site in maryland to listen to workers, and he has visited a senior citizens' center in the district of columbia. so far, the carter travel schedule is much more flexible than reagan's; stops are generally set for only a week or two in advance. he expects to travel just two or three days a week, holding just one major event a day -- appearances timed of maximum free tv news coverage. to cut costs, he intends to avoid overnight trips as much as possible and has asked campaign aides to double up in hotels or stay with friends while on trips. geographically, the carter advisers place great emphasis on the president's need to hold the south, where in 1976 he electoral votes. the democrats know they must also win some states that carter lost to gerald ford in 1976, including michigan, connecticut, iowa and new mexico. differing with reagan's assessment, they now see new hope of mounting a serious challenge in california, where carter pollster pat caddell has the president trailing by only eight points. similarly, carter will work hard in texas, where he sees possibilities.", "augmented": []}

(candidates who do not qualify for total federal funding are allowed to raise private funds to cover the difference between their eventual government grant and the full subsidy of $29.4 million.) for all the candidates, last week was a time to put the varied theories of their strategists to the test. determined to nominate the old confederacy once again, carter perspired in shirtsleeves amid some 25,000 labor day picnickers in a dusty, red-dirt park in tuscumbia, ala. he strummed all the southern heart-strings he plays so lovingly. he enjoyed the music of country stars charlie daniels and larry gatlin, and shared the stage with former alabama governor george wallace. he told how he had toured the gettysburg battlefield with his friends anwar sadat and menachem begin, and how it reminded him that we southerners believe in the nobility of courage on the battlefield, and because we understand the cost of war, we also believe in the nobility of peace. carter's not so subtle point: he has worked for arms control, while reagan encourages an arms race. well aware that a dozen ku klux klan members were watching in silent, white-sheeted protest some 20 yds.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "plus, your contributions to traditional retirement accounts are tax-deductible, so you can turn around and use the money you save on taxes to increase your net worth further. decreasing your debt is a worthwhile goal for a lot of reasons, especially if you have a lot of expensive credit card debt or other high interest debt. in fact, getting rid of high interest debt is a higher priority than bumping your retirement contributions, because the interest you pay on your debt will more than cancel out the returns you get on your retirement savings.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "now you've got an extra $400 every month cleared from your budget, so why not start putting that $400 toward your retirement contributions? assuming that you have $20,000 in retirement savings now and you've been contributing just $100 per month, increasing your contributions to $500 per month means that with an average annual return of 7%, your retirement savings balance will grow to $196,345 in 14 years. since you'll also be paying down your mortgage over those 14 years, that should be more than enough to get you to your target net worth even if your house doesn't increase in value at all.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "many workplace retirement plans also come in the roth flavor -- which means you don't get to save on taxes this year, but that money won't be taxed at all in retirement. iras (which you can open on your own, and fund with up to $5,500 per year -- or $6,500 if you're age 55 or older) also come in both flavors. there are arguments for both, so learn more about roth vs. traditional accounts if you're unsure where you stand.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's not just uncle sam who's trying to help you retire. chances are good that, if your employer offers you access to a retirement plan like a 401(k), they also offer you some incentives to participate. usually these incentives take the form of matching funds, whereby if you put a certain amount aside in your retirement plan, your employer will contribute some cash on top to help boost your account balance. for example, employers often offer a 50% match on contributions of up to 6% of an employee's salary. in that case, if you're setting aside 6% of your salary in your 401(k), your employer will contribute an additional amount equal to 3% of your salary.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in that example, you wouldn't get anything extra from your employer for anything you contribute above 6%, but you'd still get the tax benefits. anyway, bottom line: at the very least, if at all possible, make sure you max out your employer match. think about it this way: if you make $50,000 a year and contribute 6% for a 50% employer match, you're putting in $3,000 annually -- and your employer pays you an extra $1,500 in your 401(k) as a thank-you for doing that. that's a nice chunk of change.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the fact that neither side will control more than 52 seats after tuesday means that either party has held at least 55 senate seats in only three congressional sessions since 2000. by contrast, in the previous 20-year span, one party reached 55 seats or more in seven congressional sessions. in fact, the meager three majorities of 55 seats or more since 2000 represent the fewest times that any party has accumulated at least 55% of the senate seats over a 20-year span since the turn of the 20th century, according to official senate records.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the inability of either side to build a big cushion has contributed to a historic level of volatility in senate control, with neither party holding the majority for more than eight consecutive years since 1980, a span of turnover unprecedented in american history.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the narrow majorities have also contributed to a senate that has grown more rigid, with much more partisan conflict and less of the ad hoc bipartisan deal-making that characterized the body through the second half of the 20th century. the senate will mark a new high -- or low -- in its rising partisanship on wednesday when about a quarter or more of republican senators will vote against recognizing democrat joe biden's election as president, despite the complete inability of president donald trump to present any credible evidence of fraud.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the modern inability of either side to build a big advantage over the other in the upper chamber is rooted above all in the solidifying connection between senate and presidential outcomes, a factor that is also central to the body's escalating partisan hostilities. the huge democratic senate majorities that persisted from the late 1950s through the mid-1990s were rooted in the party's continued dominance of senate seats from southern states that routinely voted republican for president, notes sarah binder, a senior fellow in governance studies at the brookings institution. but over the past generation, it has become much more difficult for either party to win senate seats in states that usually vote the other way in presidential elections.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that powerful dynamic is grounded in the shrinking share of voters who split their tickets, voting for one party in the presidential contest and another in senate races. as recently as 2008, six senate candidates (five democrats and republican sen. susan collins of maine) won election in states that supported the other side's presidential candidate. in 2012, four democrats and republican dean heller of nevada won senate races in states that voted the other way for president.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "over that same period, almost all of the senators in both parties who had won their split-ticket victories in the 2008 and 2012 presidential races lost their seats in the next midterm elections (2014 and 2018, respectively). the result has been to deepen the overlap between states' presidential leans and their senate choices -- and in the process reduce the maximum number of seats each side can win under all but the most unusual circumstances.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the return of gop south and decline in split-ticket voting and increased nationalization of us politics generally explains a good amount of the decline in senate majority margins in recent decades, notes binder.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the solidifying connection between presidential and senate results provides republicans a small, but significant, advantage in the battle for control of the chamber. over the past two presidential elections, 20 states have voted both times against trump; democrats now hold fully 39 of their 40 senate seats, all but collins' in maine. but 25 states have voted both times for trump, and republicans now hold 47 of their 50 seats, all but joe manchin's in west virginia, jon tester's in montana and sherrod brown's in ohio.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in the five states (arizona, georgia, michigan, pennsylvania and wisconsin) that backed trump in 2016 but switched to biden in 2020, democrats now hold six senate seats and republicans two, pending the results in georgia on tuesday. but the gop dominance of the senate seats from the states that lean republican at the presidential level leaves democrats with a very narrow path to a senate majority.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "with senate results now so tightly correlated to presidential outcomes and most states leaning reliably toward one side or the other in the race for the white house, the battle for senate control has become a kind of grinding trench warfare. since 2000, either party has reached at least 55 senate seats in only three congressional sessions: republicans held 55 after president george w. bush's reelection in 2004, while democrats reached 59 after president barack obama's first victory in 2008 and 55 after his second in 2012. (for a time in 2009, democrats reached 60 seats when republican sen. arlen specter of pennsylvania switched sides to join them.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in sharp contrast, from 1981 through 2000, democrats held at least 55 seats in four sessions, while republicans reached that level of control in three. from 1961 through 1980, democrats -- still bolstered by their virtually unchallenged dominance of the south -- held at least 55 seats in nine of the 10 sessions. one party also controlled at least 55% of the senate seats (which were fewer than 100 at that point because there were fewer states) in eight of the 10 congressional sessions from 1921 through 1940 and seven of the 10 from 1901 through 1920. only the 1950s saw anything like today's precarious balances: while democrats controlled at least 55% of the seats four times from 1941 to 1950, neither side reached that level through four consecutive sessions beginning in 1951, until democrats broke through with big gains in the 1958 election.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "looking at the trend from the opposite direction completes the picture. unless republicans win both of tuesday's runoffs, the party controlling the senate will hold a majority of two seats or fewer. that would mark the fifth time since 2000 that the majority party held such a narrow advantage. again, in stark contrast, the majority party never held an advantage that slim in any congressional session from 1961 through 1999. only three times from 1901 through 1950 was the majority so narrow. the only real comparison is the 1950s, when no more than two seats separated the two sides in those four consecutive congresses from 1951 through 1958.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "back then, narrow senate majorities encouraged bipartisan deal-making between lyndon johnson, the titanic democratic senate leader, and republicans such as everett dirksen -- as well as president dwight eisenhower. but that was in an era when each party was so starkly split between liberal and conservative wings (including very conservative southern democrats and liberal northeast republicans) that scholars wrote of four-party politics in congress.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in today's more polarized politics -- with each party much more ideologically homogenous than in earlier generations -- the narrow senate majorities appear to be having the opposite effect. again, the growing correlation between presidential and senate outcomes may be a key factor in the shift. pending the georgia results, only three senators in each party represent states that supported the other side's presidential candidate this year. that means the vast majority of democratic senators have a strong electoral incentive to support biden --and the vast majority of republican senators have a comparable incentive to oppose him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the alignment of senate representation with presidential outcomes is a very real phenomenon and it means that senators have even less political incentive to cross the aisle, says jentleson. if a republican senator comes from a red state, which almost all of them do, their constituents don't want to see them cooperate with biden and they please their constituents and help ensure their own reelection by obstructing him.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the overall message from wisconsin is of a contrary mood, an impatience with more traditional candidates and a deep undercurrent of economic dismay. most specifically, wisconsin signaled a massive discontent with taxes and inflation -- the pocketbook issues that mcgovern and wallace hit the hardest. in a study of time, the attitude research firm of daniel yankelovich inc. found that four of the five top issues that influenced wisconsin voters were economic. the sixth was the vietnam war, and mcgovern made that into an economic issue as well, emphasizing its continuing costs. according to the survey, 82% of those interviewed said that the administration's wage and price policies are not working. fifty-two percent called for overall tax reform, with 41% complaining about high prices and 36% about high unemployment. mcgovern and humphrey both hammered away on the issue of tax reform, of giving the little taxpayer and the working man a fairer break. they shared the rewards: well over half of mcgovern's voters and almost two-thirds of wallace's assailed tax loopholes. the issue cut across both party and ideological grounds, attracting liberals as well as conservatives, republicans as well as democrats. the yankelovich pollsters found a surprising degree of second-choice support for mcgovern among the wallace voters -- support rooted in mcgovern's broad anti-establishment campaign. it was not that wisconsin voters were running to ideological extremes at the expense of centrist candidates, but rather that both mcgovern and wallace seem to have located an authentic area of concern that the other candidates failed to articulate.", "augmented": []}

(his principal financial contributors are max palevsky, chairman of the xerox executive committee, and henry kimelman, board chairman of west indies corp.) on the other are legions of young staffers and student volunteers bristling with go-for-george enthusiasm. the spectacle of the old kennedy pros followed by mcgovern's young crusaders, says eugene mccarthy, is like german officers leading irish troops. index cards. but they march well together. typical of mcgovern's young minions is gene pokorny, 26, a scholarly nebraskan who, says campaign manager gary hart, has the mind of a revolutionist in the body of henry aldrich. dispatched to wisconsin a year ago on a salary of $200 a month, he tirelessly crisscrossed the state with clipboard and index cards in hand, organizing and opening 39 mcgovern headquarters. when it was discovered that voting day fell during campus spring vacations, pokorny ran forms in students newspapers which could be exchanged for absentee ballots. by election day an estimated 70% of the students cast their votes for mcgovern and the number of workers had grown from 80 to 10,000. mcgovern, say staffers, is no softie, despite his easygoing ways. he's a classic clark kent, says aide ted van dyk.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "there was, in fact, a whole series of mistakes made by political pros, journalists, muskie strategists and muskie himself. in the first place, he probably should never have been rated so far ahead. that status was based largely on the fact that national surveys showed him to be the democrat with the best chance to defeat nixon -- but those polls do not translate into strength in state primaries. yet that impression of muskie's popularity had never really been tested in voting booths nationwide. muskie had looked cool and impressive as hubert humphrey's running mate in 1968, and he exuded much more of a presidential aura than did his g.o.p. counterpart, spiro agnew. yet few voters select a president primarily by looking at the vice presidential candidates, and muskie's appeal was not really an issue in that election. muskie was now recognized by most democratic voters all right, but how did they really feel about him? no one could be sure. euphoric. nevertheless, muskie and his advisers almost euphorically accepted the pleasant notion that he was far ahead of the field -- and they designed a campaign based on that assumption. he would speak cautiously, even vaguely, if need be, on most issues, so as not to antagonize any large blocs of voters. ignoring his rivals for the nomination, he would campaign against the president. the essence of that campaign would be to portray nixon as an excitable, expedient politician whose statements were rarely credible.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "by contrast, voters were urged to trust muskie, the man of integrity. that strategy might have been sound if the premises had been right. muskie at his best is far more inspiring than nixon, who does have credibility problems and is unpredictable. nixon had sounded shrill and unfair as he tried to link democrats with crime, drugs and antiwar violence during the 1970 congressional campaigns, while muskie on that election eve effectively deplored such tactics and appealed for a return to reason. perhaps the voters did long for a calmer, loftier leader. to further the bandwagon psychology, the muskie strategists won endorsements from big names in the party: california senator john tunney, ohio governor john gilligan, illinois senator adlai stevenson iii, iowa senator harold hughes, pennsylvania governor milton shapp. each new name made the nomination seem that much more inevitable. this was organizing the party drive from the top down, rather than from the bottom up. suddenly, the edifice began to crumble, and the entire strategy was shattered. democratic voters showed that in primaries, at least, they were not all that concerned about finding a contrast with nixon. they were not looking for a unifier and mollifier. they were in a balky, grumpy mood. they wanted specific answers to specific problems that plagued them. they were more interested in voting against the status quo, and men like george mcgovern and george wallace seemed to offer that chance to protest.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "moreover muskie hurt his own image as the judicious, controlled candidate by sobbing in the snows of new hampshire, ironically at the very time that nixon in peking was acting as the healer of international passions. this outburst was partly the result of muskie's emotional and physical fatigue. trying to be all things to all people, and torn by his commitments to so many primary campaigns, he lost his sense of direction, creating doubts about his ability to stand up under pressure. fed up. muskie's overconfident staff had also erred badly in ignoring grass-roots organizational work. in a primary, voters have to be coaxed to go to the polls and persuaded to select a particular name out of a crowded field. in new hampshire, the muskie camp had to send out-of-state organizers in at the last minute to get out a favorable vote. muskie now concedes that entering the florida primary was a mistake; once wallace had entered, he should have known it was hopeless and avoided that first big blow to his front-running status. he relied heavily for support in florida upon its democratic state legislators -- but they were tied down by their duties in tallahassee and were of little help. muskie came out of his florida defeat in a new fighting mood. he tackled specific issues, such as taxes and the economy, and began berating his competitors. yet the turnabout gave muskie the impression of a man lashing out in desperation, seeking a new image. muskie's dilemma is painfully difficult.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he has come across as a fuzzy establishment kind of politician in a year when voters seem in revolt, and has been unable to put his brand on any issue that can attract that fed-up, turned-off voter. if he cannot beat such lesser-known democrats, how can he be seen as the man to beat nixon? he's got to find the ways to tap the anger and frustration that people have about big government and big business, says senator tunney, one of his now-disillusioned supporters. i know muskie favors reform of institutions, but he hasn't been able to convey that. there is perhaps one consolation in all of the muskie miscalculations so far. if the voters are as unpredictable as they early primaries indicate, similar troubles could lie ahead for the other candidates. muskie may be no more finished now than he was a shoo-in in january. check out the back in time archive", "augmented": []}

{"original": "1) pay down a portion of your debt", "augmented": []}
{"original": "first, note that we said a portion of your debt, not the whole thing. studies show that the best way to make a new year's resolution stick is to set specific, obtainable goals, and if you've spent several years — or one very terrible 2020 — getting yourself into debt, it's going to be really hard and frustrating to try to get out of it all at once.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but you can take several manageable steps to not only pay down some of your debt but to also set yourself up so that the remainder of your debt is easier to pay off down the line. how? by reducing the interest you're paying on your debt.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "according to wallethub, the average credit card interest rate on existing accounts was 14.58% in october, and an even higher 17.98% for new accounts. those extraordinarily high rates make it harder and harder to pay down what you owe, even when you're making your minimum payments on time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so how can you lower your interest to a more manageable level? believe it or not, the best choice is a somewhat counterintuitive one: opening up a new credit card.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we know what you're thinking, but hang on! we're not advising you to open a new credit card to spend more money. rather, you'll want to look for a credit card with an introductory balance transfer offer.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "photo: istock a balance transfer credit card can temporarily reduce the interest rate to 0% on your debt.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "balance transfer credit cards are cards that offer a 0% interest rate for a temporary period of time on existing debt that you transfer over from other cards. the intro period can be anywhere between 15 and 20 months, depending on the card.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "by transferring over your debt to a new card with an introductory balance transfer offer, you'll be stopping the interest on that debt for more than a year. and even if you keep paying the same amount that you've been paying each month up until now, you'll be reducing your debt, because a portion of your payment is no longer for an exorbitant amount of interest.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "how can you find credit cards with balance transfer offers? just check out cnn underscored's list of the best balance transfer credit cards and see which card might be right for you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, the bad news is that credit card issuers got more stingy during 2020, and it's harder to get approved for a balance transfer credit card than it used to be, especially if you have a low credit score. it's worth trying, but if you get turned down, applying for a personal loan is another option.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the interest rate on a personal loan is likely to be higher than a credit card introductory balance transfer offer, but it may still be better than sticking with the interest rate you're currently paying. it's also easier to get approved for a personal loan, as there are options for people with all levels of credit, though the worse your credit is, the more you'll pay in interest for a personal loan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you can use a personal loan to pay off your existing debt, and with a personal loan, you'll have a set timetable for paying off your debt in full so it doesn't drag on forever. but if you're considering a personal loan, make sure the interest rate on it is lower than what you're currently paying — otherwise, it doesn't make sense to switch.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there are other factors to consider if you're applying for a personal loan, so if you're thinking about this option, make sure to read our guide on why you might consider a personal loan and how to apply for one. and for more ideas on how to make your debt more manageable in 2021, check out our four steps to getting rid of your credit card debt.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "if there's one thing that 2020 taught us, it's the importance of having some sort of savings or emergency fund.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "some people say that, as a rule of thumb, you should have three or six months of living expenses saved up. but if you don't have any savings at all right now, don't try to accumulate six months of savings all at once. again, your resolutions should be achievable so you have a good chance of accomplishing them and setting yourself up for future wins.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "once it's not in your daily budget and it's in an area you can't really get to, you need to live within your means, robertson says. you live within that budget.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "recognize hey, you just got a raise, maybe give your 401(k) a raise, too, robertson suggests.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "according to robertson, there are some good milestones to check along the way: aim to have saved the equivalent of your current salary by age 30. at 40, shoot to have saved three times your salary. and if you want to retire by 55, you'll need to have saved around 12 times your income.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "more and more people might want to quit the job or passion they've been doing to earn money over the last 20 to 30 years, but at retirement age they still want to do something productive, he says. so maybe it's not a 50-hour work week and it doesn't earn the same, but it's something you enjoy and you can still bring in income, if you aren't where you want to be in retirement savings.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "suddenly we find ourselves with a severe shortage of flu vaccine. how did that happen?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "bush: bob, we relied upon a company out of england to provide about half of the flu vaccines for the united states citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated. and so we took the right action and didn't allow contaminated medicine into our country.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "i haven't gotten a flu shot, and i don't intend to because i want to make sure those who are most vulnerable get treated.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we have a problem with litigation in the united states of america. vaccine manufacturers are worried about getting sued, and therefore they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "this president has turned his back on the wellness of america. and there is no system. in fact, it's starting to fall apart not because of lawsuits -- though they are a problem, and john edwards and i are committed to fixing them -- but because of the larger issue that we don't cover americans.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "he just said he wants everybody to be able to buy in to the same plan that senators and congressmen get. that costs the government $7,700 per family. if every family in america signed up, like the senator suggested, [it] would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's an empty promise. it's called bait and switch.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kerry: actually, it's not an empty promise.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "my question is, how can you or any president, whoever is elected next time, keep that pledge without running this country deeper into debt and passing on more of the bills that we're running up to our children?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kerry: i'll tell you exactly how i can do it: by reinstating what president bush took away, which is called pay as you go.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "during the 1990s, we had pay-as-you-go rules. if you were going to pass something in the congress, you had to show where you are going to pay for it and how.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "he's also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs -- 1.6 million jobs lost. he's the only president to have incomes of families go down for the last three years; the only president to see exports go down; the only president to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, i'm going to reverse that. i'm going to change that. we're going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "every plan that i have laid out -- my health-care plan, my plan for education, my plan for kids to be able to get better college loans -- i've shown exactly how i'm going to pay for those.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and we start -- we don't do it exclusively -- but we start by rolling back george bush's unaffordable tax cut for the wealthiest people, people earning more than $200,000 a year, and we pass, hopefully, the mccain-kerry commission which identified some $60 billion that we can get.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we shut the loophole which has american workers actually subsidizing the loss of their own job.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days: $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from china.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm going to stand up and fight for the american worker. and i am going to do it in a way that's fiscally sound. i show how i pay for the health care, how we pay for the education.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "bush: well, his rhetoric doesn't match his record.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "[he's] been a senator for 20 years. he voted to increase taxes 98 times. when they tried to reduce taxes, he voted against that 127 times.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he talks about being a fiscal conservative, or fiscally sound, but he voted over -- he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4.2 trillion.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he talks about pay-go. i'll tell you what pay-go means, when you're a senator from massachusetts, when you're a colleague of ted kennedy, pay go means: you pay, and he goes ahead and spends.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he's proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in america, raises $600 million by our account -- billion, $800 billion by his account.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there is a tax gap. and guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap? the middle class.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i propose a detailed budget, bob. i sent up my budget man to the congress, and he says, here's how we're going to reduce the deficit in half by five years. it requires pro-growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of congress.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "question 4: what do you say to someone who lost his job?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "schieffer: let's go to a new question, mr. president. two minutes. and let's continue on jobs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, there are all kind of statistics out there, but i want to bring it down to an individual.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mr. president, what do you say to someone in this country who has lost his job to someone overseas who's being paid a fraction of what that job paid here in the united states?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "bush: i'd say, bob, i've got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century. and here's some help for you to go get an education. here's some help for you to go to a community college.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we've expanded trade adjustment assistance. we want to help pay for you to gain the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, there's a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing. we talk about fiscal matters. but perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in america and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i went to washington to solve problems. and i saw a problem in the public education system in america.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so we said: let's raise the standards. we're spending more money, but let's raise the standards and measure early and solve problems now, before it's too late.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "no, education is how to help the person who's lost a job. education is how to make sure we've got a workforce that's productive and competitive.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "got four more years, i've got more to do to continue to raise standards, to continue to reward teachers and school districts that are working, to emphasize math and science in the classrooms, to continue to expand pell grants to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so the person you talked to, i say, here's some help, here's some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and that's what i would say to that person.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kerry: i want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "let me come back in one moment to that, but i want to speak for a second, if i can, to what the president said about fiscal responsibility.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "being lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like tony soprano talking to me about law and order in this country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this president has taken a $5.6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see. health-care costs for the average american have gone up 64 percent; tuitions have gone up 35 percent; gasoline prices up 30 percent; medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago; prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but guess what, america? the wages of americans have gone down. the jobs that are being created in arizona right now are paying about $13,700 less than the jobs that we're losing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and the president just walks on by this problem. the fact is that he's cut job-training money. $1 billion was cut. they only added a little bit back this year because it's an election year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they've cut the pell grants and the perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they've cut the training money. they've wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm going to do those things, because that's what's right in america: help workers to transition in every respect.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "question 5: is bush entirely to blame for loss of jobs?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "schieffer: new question to you, sen. kerry, two minutes. and it's still on jobs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, many experts say that a president really doesn't have much control over jobs. for example, if someone invents a machine that does the work of five people, that's progress. that's not the president's fault.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so i ask you, is it fair to blame the administration entirely for this loss of jobs?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kerry: i don't blame them entirely for it. i blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i've acknowledged that in union halls across the country. i've had shop stewards stand up and say, will you promise me you're going to stop all this outsourcing?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i've looked them in the eye and i've said, no, i can't do that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what i can promise you is that i will make the playing field as fair as possible, that i will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in america are not subsidizing the loss of your job.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "today, if you're an american business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas. you get to defer your taxes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so if you're looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, hey, i do better overseas than i do here in america.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i don't want american workers subsidizing the loss of their own job.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and when i'm president, we're going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we're going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in america for all corporations, 5 percent. and we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field. this president didn't stand up for boeing when airbus was violating international rules and subsidies. he discovered boeing during the course of this campaign after i'd been talking about it for months.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the fact is that the president had an opportunity to stand up and take on china for currency manipulation. there are companies that wanted to petition the administration. they were told: don't even bother; we're not going to listen to it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the fact is that there have been markets shut to us that we haven't stood up and fought for.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the american worker. and i will fight for the american worker just as hard as i fight for my own job. that's what the american worker wants. and if we do that, we can have an impact.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "plus, we need fiscal discipline. restore fiscal discipline, we'll do a lot better.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "let me start with the pell grants. in his last litany of misstatements he said we cut pell grants. we've increased pell grants by a million students. that's a fact.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "but you know why the pell grants have gone up in their numbers? because more people qualify for them because they don't have money.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "and i also know in a free society people, consenting adults can live the way they want to live.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but as we respect someone's rights, and as we profess tolerance, we shouldn't change -- or have to change -- our basic views on the sanctity of marriage.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i believe in the sanctity of marriage. i think it's very important that we protect marriage as an institution, between a man and a woman.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i proposed a constitutional amendment. the reason i did so was because i was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the constitution.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it has also the benefit of allowing citizens to participate in the process. after all, when you amend the constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the constitution.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the united states. you know, congress passed a law called doma, the defense of marriage act.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "and it's - it's a willingness on the part of the administration to understand that relationships in this part of the world have to be reciprocal that you don't simply apply honey in response to a security partner or an ally. sometimes, it's necessary to - to apply vinegar as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and if we don't inject this sort of reciprocity in our relations, we - we end up with a situation where you end up with bad allies, chris, and worse adversaries. and that is in fact the conundrum that the united states faces in the middle east today.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "blumenthal: well, first of all, as you have observed very correctly, the president has given the saudis a very wide berth. and the exact reasons for it are somewhat a mystery. he has financial interests that may be coming into play.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one of the reasons that i, and 200 members of congress, have sued the president in blumenthal versus trump, and there'll be a hearing this monday, is that financial interests, taking benefits and payments from foreign governments have been very much a part of this administration.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "cuomo: it doesn't have to be effected.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "cuomo: so, what do you do when the senate, if there's a trial, and it seems like there will be, and it's obviously controlled by the republicans, and they have rudy giuliani, and others, come in, and just dump tons of information about how ukraine was the source of interference, and the bidens and burisma were thick with corruption, that's what that trial could be about, if they want to. they control the rules. it's just a simple majority vote.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "blumenthal: their effort obviously is going to be to distract and distort. that's the meaning of giuliani's trip abroad insofar as it tries to aid the president's defense. but it's more than distracting.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: he says he'll testify, you know, this new friend of his over there says he wants to come in and talk about it.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "senator, thank you so much on a friday night.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: for being with us, and an important night as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: all right, so there is someone who knows a lot more about the ukraine showdown than even maybe some congressional investigators. has vladimir putin been closely listening in on president trump's calls?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's a big concern. why? andrew mccabe explains next.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: all right, if you're following rudy's rovings, he tells cnn he is no longer in ukraine, but he was there, and we know what he was doing, drawing a lot of attention, and really casting a pretty big shadow over this impeachment situation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and now let's talk about what it could mean. let's bring in andrew mccabe.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, there are two big things to look at in terms of significance. help me understand why i should care about this first one, which i only kind of care about. so, don't be nice about it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the idea that they were communicating over cell phones, and not secure lines, russia could be listening, why does that matter a lot?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "andrew mccabe, cnn contributor: ok. so, here's why it matters. the job of every foreign intelligence service is to collect what - what professionals refer to as information about the policies, plans, and intents, of your adversary.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, their job is to go out and collect information about what our leadership is thinking, what they're planning to do, and how they're going to execute those actions. there is no bigger target in the world for policies, plans, and intense information than the president of the united states. he is the crown jewel of all targets.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, let's put aside for a moment the question of whether or not the president is actually using a cell phone from the oval office, and think about the president speaking to someone else, in a country like ukraine, who's using a cell phone.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "right now, we know that rudy giuliani is - is supposedly doing that. we have reason to believe from the phone records that he has talked to the president from there before. and we know that gordon sondland did that as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ukraine is probably the most thoroughly-penetrated country on earth by the russian intelligence service. they operate almost com - with complete freedom there. rudy giuliani is known as a close adviser, and confidant, and counselor of the president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: how easily can they tap your phone?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mccabe: easily, chris, very easily. in that part of the world, intelligence services have almost unfettered access to cellular service providers, to internet service providers, things of that - that nature.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "also, the technology to intercept individual cell phones, that are in use is widely available now, things that were like totally, you know, cutting-edge a few years ago are widely used across intelligence services around the globe.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, the idea that rudy is being covered by a foreign intelligence service, i'd bet the farm on it. and if they are listening to his phone, they now know the private conversations of the president of the united states, and his attorney.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: and my point of emphasis is that all they have to do is watch the news, or read twitter, and they'll know more than they need to know about what the plans and the intent is right now because rudy giuliani said something that i can't believe the president's team wants him to say.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he said in a tweet, hey ukraine, you're not going to get u.s. help in your anti-corruption reform efforts if you don't help me with what i'm doing with the bidens.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "how is that helpful to the president's impeachment case?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mccabe: boy, it's not helpful at all. i mean it really resonates with all of the concerns that are being voiced by the democratic side, right, so.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and it also undercuts, in a significant way, the president's, one of his primary defenses, which is that he was - he was pressuring ukraine, not for his own benefit, but rather to address legitimate corruption issues.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "having his own personal attorney off the grid doing god-knows-what in ukraine, talking to people like andriy derkach who has a - an extensive historical connection with russian-backed politicians and intelligence officials in ukraine, i mean it's just a perfect storm of - of bad circumstances.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: well you're certainly not going to have a hard time finding russians in ukraine, who want to put stink on ukraine for what happened in 2016. we know that out of putin's own mouth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, here's the part i don't get andrew. this is why we need your mind on this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i don't understand how any of this helps the case. forget about the subtle threat to ukraine, to step up, otherwise they're not going to get the u.s. help, which is exactly what the president's accused of doing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but even if rudy's right about everything, obama was dirty, you can't - you know - you know, the former ambassador was dirty, the bidens with burisma was done a little dirty, even if he's right about all of it, how does it change the case against the president, because it's still how you went about getting that type of investigation done.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you should have done it yourself, or in the senate, with the doj. you're not supposed to go to ukraine, and hold up aid to get it, even if it's true. isn't that right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mccabe: that is right. that's absolutely right. so - so, why he's doing this? i mean only rudy knows. but two things i would suggest.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one, there is clear political value to the president to just create a distraction, to go, to put up as many false narratives and conspiracy theories to get people thinking about those potential bad things rather than the bad things that the president is alleged to have done.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and the second thing is i do think that there's an element here of rudy kind of saving himself in a way.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he seems to be going like further and further down this rabbit hole, in an effort maybe to find the one, you know, verifiable piece of proof that will show the world that ah-ha, he was right all along.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: and he may be right. he can be right. and it doesn't change the analysis. that's why i always say, you know, people think it's personal, even though, you know, rudy basically tried to decapitate me on television.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but that i say he's not the problem here. rudy is the agent. that's all he is. if he's right about all of it, burisma, the bidens, ukraine, fine. present the evidence. let's see what we do about it. it doesn't change the analysis. it's not about rudy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: it's about how the president went about getting what he wanted, and why. andrew, i'm out of time. thank you so much. have a great weekend. and i appreciate it. you're always a plus for the audience.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: all right, something very important has come up. the president's bringing it to our attention, and i pass it along to you right now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "trump: we have a situation where we're looking very strongly at sinks and showers and other elements of bathrooms where you turn the faucet on.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "people are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: and the democrats don't have somebody that for sure can beat this guy?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i want to bring in the wizard of odds. that's what they're up against, wiz. and democrats are scrambling to find an answer, next.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: first, the democrats seemed to believe that anyone they had could beat this president. now, it seems they're scrambling to find anyone who can beat this president. but today, we got a good look at what they are up against.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this was the president trying to attack the epa for over-regulating. but he did it like this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "trump: we have a situation where we're looking very strongly at sinks and showers and other elements of bathrooms where you turn the faucet on in areas where there's tremendous amounts of water, where the water rushes out to sea because you could never handle it, and you don't get any water.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you turn on the faucet. you don't get any water. they take a shower and water comes dripping out. it's dripping out, very quietly dripping out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "people are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once. they end up using more water. so, epa is looking at that very strongly, at my suggestion.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: at his suggestion! and you wonder why bloomberg got in! and yet, this president is seen as very formidable to the wizard of odds himself, harry enten, and here is why.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "harry enten, cnn politics senior writer and analyst: yes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: --and the hypocrisy of the fact that his administration has been hurting water standards, hurting the money for keeping things protected, he's basically attacking over-regulation, big government.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: he's still tough to beat not because of how he is, but because of what's gone on, despite him, mostly in the economy. what do we know?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "enten: yes. so, i think this is rather important. first, let me just say, what a shabbos (ph) conversation, toilets and so on, so forth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "enten: but ok - ha, ha, ha, hilarious!", "augmented": []}
{"original": "enten: look, this is basically the yearly job growth weighted each - weighted over each terms last two years. and what we see here is that the winners tend to have very good job growth, right? all of them had at least 1.1 percent or above.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the blow-outs, nixon, 3.6 percent, 4.1 percent for reagan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the losers on the other hand tended to have pretty poor job growth. carter and bush, of course, basically got blown out, and they were below 1 percent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, what we see here is very clearly what has often been described as it's the economy, stupid! and we see that to be the case. cuomo: we just got more good job numbers and some income pressure going up that helps the president as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "enten: yes, so look, let's put this into some context where the president is versus where the winners versus the losers were.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, the average yearly job growth, again, in those final two years, the presidents who won re-election, 2.5 percent growth, the presidents who lost, they averaged 1 percent growth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "where is trump? trump over the last year is right in the middle there at 1.5 percent. and i think this is rather important.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: but he sells it as being the best ever.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "enten: well he sells a lot of things at being the best ever, you know. so, that's not too much of a surprise. sometimes he sells toilet pressures being the best ever.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i think this is rather important is that growth is what's important. it's not the absolute levels. it's basically where you've grown, and basically with the economy at this point, we're kind of running into a wall, since we're near max employment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: so, you think that the democrats can use the economy against this president?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "enten: i - i - i think that the economy is not the silver bullet that he necessarily thinks it is, although it's certainly rather helpful because, you know, if you take a look here, what we see is trump standing on the economy, his approval rating 55 percent in our latest poll, but that is below his overall approval rating of 42 percent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so clearly, voters are judging him stronger on the economy than overall, which is perhaps why he should be talking more about the economy than about other things.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: but - and this also goes to the point i made on the last panel, which is he sells it as the best ever. it's obviously working.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: because the number of growth, that growth percentage you're showing, middle-of-the-road, would not justify 55 percent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "enten: yes. it's certainly working to the extent that if, you know, basically you were to say, ok, if you approve of trump's job, why is it? here are the top five reasons. this is rather interesting.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, among those who say they approve of trump's job, 26 percent say the economy, look at this, jobs and unemployment, 8 percent, getting things done, doing a good job, generally speaking, again, related to the economy, 10 and 9 percent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, people who approve of the job that the president is doing, they do so because of the economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: so, if you are looking to figure out what the best avenue is for change, what is it? is it to go with the man directly?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "enten: yes, i - i - i think that that's exactly right.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if you were to say why should we change this president, look at these, these are trump's qualities, essentially presidential qualities, has stamina and sharpness to be a president, could bring the type of change the country needs, so on, so forth, you can read that, you see it up on the screen.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "look at this. this is so important because on this, yes, what do we see? majorities all say in fact no, he does not have these qualities.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "majorities are saying the president doesn't have these presidential qualities. and that is why, in spite of what they approve of as a strong economy, he is behind, at least in a number of the horserace polls that we've seen so far.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, go after the man, say he's un-presidential. and that's why i think you saw a lot of good response to biden's ad this week.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: do you think you could have - you could name another person who could ever win a presidential election talking about people needing to flush 10 to 15 times?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "enten: no. but, you know, perhaps that might be a student council election. i should have used that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: wiz, thank you so much.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "nikki haley, hopefully, for her, it's not too late, but she's taking heat, and justifiably so. did you hear what she said about the confederate flag? i have it as the basis of the argument. it's bigger than her. but she's got to get away from what's coming her way. next.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "joe johns, cnn senior washington correspondent: right. well, the bottom line from stephanie grisham over here at the white house is that the president did nothing wrong, so it doesn't matter how many whistleblowers there are out there. but also important to say the president tweeted just this morning once again, discrediting this second whistleblower. you know he has a history of that, it goes all the way back even before robert mueller who he went after with a vengeance. the president this morning writing, the partisan whistleblower, apparently referring to the first whistleblower to come forward, was very wrong. the president writes what his, quote, perfect no pressure call with the ukrainian president was and then apparently referring to the second person, he writes, bring in another whistleblower from the bench.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so now you got the president once again going after the first whistleblower, the second whistleblower. we don't know any of their names at all and we can certainly expect this to continue over the weekend as well. the president also referring to an attorney for the whistleblowers as the same for both, and also indicating that that person is a democrat supporting both hillary clinton and obama. that's apparently -- apparently a reference to attorney andrew bakaj who in fact was an intern for hillary clinton and chuck schumer, the two new york senators back in 2001. back to you.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the november 2018 result is the bookend to that election. this election swept away dozens of republicans from suburban seats with large numbers of minority or white-collar white voters or both who had been increasingly voting democratic in presidential campaigns. those republicans, from reps. mimi walters and dana rohrabacher in orange county, california, to john culberson in texas and barbara comstock in northern virginia, could not survive the backlash among their voters to trump's tumultuous first years.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "spain views the lopsided deficits in those places as the inevitable price of his party's relentless focus under trump on mobilizing blue-collar and rural whites, especially men. you want to go all in on white votes, white male voters, sure, the reaction to that is massive hemorrhaging with female voters in the suburbs, says spain, who's now a partner at cgcn group, a lobbying and communications consulting firm.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the house democratic caucus now revolves around two principal poles. one is the white-collar suburban areas in which the party advanced in november. the other is heavily minority, lower-income districts mostly inside urban centers. those two poles become apparent when looking simultaneously at the income and racial composition of the democratic house districts. the 136 democratic districts that exceed the national median income split exactly in half between those that are more and less diverse than the national average. but three-fourths of the 99 democratic districts that lag below the median income contain more minorities than average – a reflection of the democratic dominance in mostly nonwhite lower-income inner cities.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "overall, with the party's big gains in suburbia, the share of democrats who hold seats in districts with more minorities than the national average is notably lower in this congress (61% ) than it was in the last (66%). but that's still a significant shift from the party's last majority in 2009, when it divided almost evenly between districts that were more and less diverse than the national average.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "simon rosenberg, president and founder of ndn, a democratic group that studies the political implications of demographic and economic trends, says the new distribution of seats shows that the party's house caucus has finally caught up with the changes in the party that barack obama consolidated. obama built his two presidential victories around a coalition that was younger, more diverse, better-educated and more urbanized – at a point when the democratic house majority still relied on large numbers of right-leaning blue dog members clinging to mostly white and culturally conservative rural and small-town seats, including many in the south.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's fair to say that the house campaign in 2018 executed on a politics that we first saw with obama in 2007 and 2008: it aligned the house with the way that obama began to reorient the democratic party, said rosenberg, who consulted with the democratic congressional campaign committee through the campaign. there were many people who were saying that obama's embrace of this new coalition was the cause of democratic decline in the senate and the house. it was never true. but what was true was that democrats had never resigned themselves to having to lean into this new coalition that obama constructed. now they did in 2018 – they leaned into it – and look what happened.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "but price said that with fewer members representing non-urban working-class districts, the party will likely find it easier to move forward on cultural issues including gun control, gay rights and immigration. resistance from the moderate coalition of blue dogs made it difficult for the party to act on any of those when nancy pelosi last held the speakership, between 2007 and 2010. that change is already evident during the government shutdown fight: hardly any house democrats have expressed unease with trump trying to portray the party as soft on border security, something difficult to imagine a decade ago.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the number of members in the house who are given serious heartburn by this shutdown over the wall … is considerably less than it would have been in the last (democratic-majority) congress, price says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the new fault lines for democrats may track economic issues. members from the party's growing suburban center will likely be more hesitant about expensive new government programs, and especially raising income taxes, than their colleagues from lower-income and urban districts. and more of those new members from districts with large numbers of globally connected white-collar professionals may challenge the hostility to international trade that now dominates the party. those suburban members are going to look at the economic stakes in trade differently, predicts price, an advocate of expanded trade. that's still really a work in progress, though.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for republicans, the principal challenge in the new alignment may be that they may further cement the changes in the party's coalition that trump has accelerated. the gop house caucus has been pushed back almost entirely into trump country: mostly white districts with very few immigrants that are also below the national average in education and income. nearly three-fifths of all house republicans now hold seats in districts that are below the median income and more white than the national average.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that means that as the caucus sets its direction, there are very few voices left in the room to worry about how its choices will affect the party's prospects in the upscale suburban areas that broke so sharply against them and trump last fall. that dynamic has been apparent in the party's near lockstep support for trump's partial government shutdown over a border wall, which was opposed by two-thirds of nonwhites and college-educated whites in the most recent cnn poll conducted by ssrs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "spain, who directed communications for the national republican congressional committee during the gop's 2010 landslide, said democrats could reopen the door for the gop in white-collar suburbs if they move too far left on spending or in their response to the agendas of the various minority groups in their coalition. but he acknowledges that recovery won't be easy as long as the gop under trump is defining itself so heavily toward the cultural priorities of older and blue-collar white men.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "at some point republicans are going to have to find an equilibrium if they plan to compete, he says. clearly there's no sign of that occurring in the immediate future. you want to go with older white men, the counterbalance to that is going to be millennials, females and diversity coming back with a vengeance.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "like almost every gtb player, evans is on another travel team, one located in her hometown of apopka, florida. she plays with all boys on that one. there are thousands of these youth baseball travel teams throughout the u.s., and most get together regularly to practice and then play in tournaments. gtb doesn't work that way. it has a much smaller pool of potential players because of how girls are squeezed out of baseball. they either get shuffled into softball—a fine sport but one that is different from baseball in mechanics, strategy and rules—or they quit baseball when they are left sitting on the bench.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gtb, however, makes space for girls. the team is run by ceo robert saven and josh devinney, the director of baseball operations. the two met and hit it off nearly four years ago because both have daughters who play baseball. when saven proposed an all-girls travel team to devinney, gtb was born. its vision is simple: form a team of the best girls out there and let those girls compete at the highest level. the organization will celebrate its two-year anniversary later this summer.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "this system has its drawbacks. unlike most youth travel sports teams, these girls do not all live in the same place. to get to miami, they flew or drove from all parts of florida, georgia, texas, north carolina, south carolina, massachusetts, new york and california. the roster is never the same, with school schedules and individual travel budgets determining who can show up each time. parents are responsible in most cases for paying their kid's way, and gtb plays in a tournament at least once every two months, if not more. just two weeks after the miami trip, they met again in north carolina, where the prime team won the championship in its division in the top gun baseball tournament. there is chatter about possibly heading to the bahamas to play later in the summer.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "teams only get to practice together the night before a tournament starts. sometimes that doesn't work well. the prime team couldn't find its rhythm or figure out its chemistry and struggled defensively until about halfway through each game during the summerslam tournament. but that same team, then a u12 squad but with a roster similar to the one that traveled to miami, beat the puerto rico national boys team last summer at the baseball youth majors tournament in kissimmee, florida. puerto rico was the odds-on favorite, the most athletic and experienced team in the division. gtb got down 4-0 in the first inning. but in the top of the fourth, it hit back-to-back home runs. with gtb ahead 5-4, evans went into the game to pitch. she threw 18 pitches, all of them strikes, across two innings, and gtb came away with a hard-earned win. since its inception, gtb teams have a combined record of 36-33 with two championships captured by the the prime team.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the time and money investment ($200 for uniforms, about $50 per tournament, plus travel and lodging costs) is worth it to parents because of what gtb has meant for their daughters. travis aldrich, whose daughter chloe plays for the young guns—her base hit drove home maston—has seen a change in his daughter over the last year since she joined gtb. she's definitely much more of a leader, he says, because she sees that she's not such a unicorn at things.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "this is a big part of why the organization is so important. you get along, and you can talk normal, evans says. she immediately adds: well, i can talk normal with the guys. but it's not that connection. some of the girls explain that gtb removes the feeling of always being on the outside looking in, the oddball in the mix. sometimes they use vague language, saying the other girls know what we've been through together or you feel more comfortable playing with people like you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there's one other thing about bringing an all-girls team to baseball tournaments, where there are rarely, if ever, any girls playing: it's important for the boys to see it. the night of the first game, as evans and the rest of the prime team played, a boy from another team who had played earlier in the day was standing around, watching gtb. suddenly, it dawned on him what he was seeing. oh, it's girls playing against boys? he asked loudly and apparently without first thinking about who could hear him. heads whipped around. he seemed to realize the importance of his next words. oh, he paused. awesome.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's the second game of the tournament for the prime team, and they're playing the commanders. gtb starts smoothly, ending its first defensive inning with a whip-fast double play at first and second. the next time the commanders are up to bat, they smash the ball deep into left field, and the runner on third has a clear path home. instead of just running across home plate, though, he slows down about six feet out, practically walks in, shuffling across the plate.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "here is the transcript of that interview.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "richard quest: mr. president, thank you, sir. much appreciated. there's a lot to talk about, but don't worry, we won't talk about it all. we'll be judicious in our time with you. but here, if you like, are the controversial bits, the sexy bits: the last minutes of the fomc used the phrase fairly soon. we all know what fairly soon means. if you and i go to have a cup of coffee, we'll have it fairly soon. we could meet for dinner fairly soon. what does fairly soon mean in the context of the minutes?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "president dudley: i think it means what it says. it doesn't say it's a week, a month, a couple months. fairly soon means in the relatively near future. i think the key thing in terms of thinking about monetary policy is -- what are we basically communicating to people in the markets? we've basically been saying that if the economy continues on the trajectory that it's on, slightly above-trend growth, gradually rising inflation, we're going to continue to remove monetary policy accommodation. so let's look at what we've actually gotten. it seems to me that most of the data we've seen over the last couple months is very much consistent with the economy continuing to grow at an above-trend pace, job gains remain pretty sturdy, inflation has actually drifted up a little bit as energy prices have increased. so we're very much on the trajectory that we said -- that we thought we'd be on and we said if we were on that trajectory we're going to gradually remove accommodation. what else have we seen? we've also seen things that should make us even more confident that this is going to continue in the future. after the election we've seen very large increases in household and business confidence, we've seen very buoyant financial markets -- the stock market is up, credit spreads are narrow. and we have the expectation that fiscal policy will probably move in a more stimulative direction.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, put it all together, i think the case for monetary policy tightening has become a lot more compelling.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: and that's obviously fairly soon, which implies sooner rather than later?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: there's also one new wrinkle into this, of course, which is the role of fiscal policy. a large increase in government spending is coming. we know it's coming. the president is going to talk about it tonight. how does the fed factor in what you know is coming but is not here yet?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: well, it's hard to actually put it into your forecast yet because we don't know what it is, how big it is or when it's actually going to hit the economy. but we do know that fiscal policy is going to move in a more stimulative direction. so what that says to me is that the risks to the outlook are now starting to tilt to the upside. so while i haven't really built it into my gdp forecast, when i think about the balance of risks -- up or down in terms of economic activity -- i think the fiscal side tends to push things -- the risks to the upside.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: but you can't wait for it to happen, can you? i mean the whole question of monetary lag. i know you've got to think about many of these policies not coming into force until 2018, but you have to plan now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: well, look, i think monetary policy is pursued on the basis on the economic outlook. fiscal policy outlook obviously affects that -- the trajectory of gdp, unemployment and inflation. so that's a factor weighing on us but the fact that we have so little specifics yet about what's going to happen -- it's got to wind its way through congress -- means i don't put a lot of weight on it in terms of my modal forecast. i just think it makes the risks to the outlook a little bit tilted to the upside at this point.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: and from what you've heard -- and i'll accept that the detail is few and far between -- from what you've heard, are the sort of spending, fiscal plans that you're hearing, are they the right sort in terms of productivity gains that the fed can live with?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: well, i think we're going to have to see. to the extent that you reduce the burden of regulation, that should lift productivity growth. to the extent that you pursue greater infrastructure spending, that should lift productivity growth. so those are the aspects of changes on the fiscal side that would actually be supportive to stronger economic activity.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: but, for instance, i'm going to throw the numbers that we've seen -- the $50 billion on defense spending that the president said that yesterday, $50-odd billion on defense. is that the sort of thing that you find is -- leads to greater productivity as opposed to just shear consumption?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: i wouldn't think that defense spending would have a huge benefit to the productivity growth, but obviously we have to spend money on the military to keep the country safe. also, if you're increasing spending on military but cutting spending on discretionary or domestic programs, the net effect may not be very powerful in terms of supporting the economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: into this difficult area we have the financial markets. they're on a tear. i mean today could be the 13th record high, we could be in record territory, you know the numbers better than myself. you can't wait for the fiscal plans completely until next year, but you have to take into account what's happening in the markets at the moment, don't you?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: well, financial conditions are very important in terms of how they influence economic activity. so if the stock market is up, credit spreads are narrow, financial conditions are more buoyant, that's going to tend to make the economy stronger. the important thing for us, though, is not to overreact to every little movement in the stock market. it's got to be something that lasts for a period of time for it to actually affect household and business behavior. so if the stock market goes up, and then goes right back down, it's not going to have much consequence for the economic outlook. but if it goes up and stays up, then that's going to support, presumably, consumption through higher household wealth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: what do you believe you're seeing at the moment?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: well, there's no question that animal spirits have been unleashed a bit post the election. stock market is up a lot. household and business confidence have increased significantly. there's a survey of small businesses that showed a very large increase in december and sustained that increase in january. so, there's no question that sentiment has improved quite markedly post the election.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: that -- animal spirits or whatever you want to call it -- that market influence. it transmits itself around to the entire economy, doesn't it?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: well, we would expect to have some consequence for economic activity. but we'll have to see if that actually -- one if the confidence is sustained, and whether it actually materializes in terms of increases in spending. i would say so far we haven't seen much effect of the improvement in confidence actually leading into greater spending. i think the economy is still on about a 2% gdp track, which about what it's been over the last year or so.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: when you hear the president looking for 3 to 4% -- and the treasury secretary looking for 3% to 4% economic growth -- admittedly not next week, next month, maybe not even next year. but as a medium-term, longer-term goal, do you find that acceptable?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: i think it would be great if we have 3% to 4% gdp growth because that would mean productivity growth is very strong and that would lead to rapidly rising living standards, so that would be good for everybody. the key is, what actually happens to productivity growth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: do you find 3% to 4% realistic?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: i would say it's possible. you know, we had productivity growth back in the late 1990s where productivity growth was averaging over 2.5% a year. if we could get back to that kind of level of productivity growth, then i think 3% plus growth would actually be achievable. but that's a pretty high standard to reach for.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: you are no longer the only game in town, to use the phrase. for the last five years, six years, seven years, you -- not you personally but you and your colleagues -- central bankers around the world have been saying 'hey, c'mon, we can't do this on our own. you're requiring us to do all the heavy lifting.' well, guess what, you've now got a bit of help from washington, haven't you?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: well, i think it is correct that monetary policy has had to do most of the heavy lifting over the last few years. and i think that's unfortunate because monetary policy is a blunt tool. monetary policy can't allocate resources across the economy. monetary policy can't do much to affect productivity growth. so i think it's good that the burden is going to be more broadly shared.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: how close do you believe -- and in this i'm not just asking about the fed but i'm thinking about the bank of japan, i'm thinking about the ecb, the boe -- how close do you believe central banks have come to being out of ammunition?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "dudley: well the president is obviously going to be able to make some appointment to the board of governors. of course, remember, the federal open market committee also consists of the federal reserve bank presidents and more importantly than that, the fed's mandate is set by congress. congress wants the fed to achieve maximum sustainable employment and price stability. so i would expect that whoever gets named to the federal reserve is going to try to carry out that task set for the fed by congress.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: oh sir, you know we talk about doves and we talk about hawks when we talk about fed governors.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: and therefore a new president can -- my word, not yours -- manipulate the board?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: i think -- i don't expect that. i think congress has been very clear about what the fed's objectives are and people who are named to the board of governors and people who serve on the fomc try to conduct monetary policy consistent with those goals of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. right now you'd have to say we're doing pretty well in those objectives. we're pretty close to full employment, and we're pretty close to our 2% inflation objective. so it's not clear why you'd want to change any of that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: that inflation objective, 1.6% at the moment, you can't -- inflation is one of those things, you dare not let it get ahead, because by the time it gets ahead it's too late to do anything about it. most people don't seem to understand this, do they?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: well you mean the long lags of monetary policy?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: look, i think it's very clear you don't want to keep monetary policy too accommodative for too long. this is something that chair yellen talked about in her testimony. because if you do, then you're going to have to hit the brakes really hard later, move up rates very sharply and that could actually cause the next recession. so slow and gradual seems to me the right way to proceed, moving monetary policy relatively early to make sure the economy doesn't overheat and that can actually allow you to sustain the economic expansion.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: i need to ask you, one of the biggest issues at the moment is cybersecurity. now, i emphasize when i mention the bangladesh case that i'm not suggesting for a moment that anything was wrong. i know the background to that particular case. we don't need to go into the minutiae of the whole swift system, but when we look at the issue of cybersecurity, do you believe it is one of the most significant threats facing us at the moment?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: i think it is one of the most significant threats because we have a lot of people out there that want to do us harm and they're building their capabilities just as we're building our capabilities, so it's little bit of an arms race on both sides. the other thing i think we need to be very conscious of in terms of cybersecurity is we need to really define well the roles and responsibilities of all the different actors. so the person who is making the payment, they need to make sure that their systems are secure. the person transmitting the payment has to make sure that the people that are transmitting payments through their payments mechanisms are well buttoned up. and the person receiving the payment has to be also secure. so it's very important to get those responsibilities well defined and insure that there's an assurance regime to make sure everyone is doing what they're supposed to be doing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: do you worry that there are weaknesses in the current system that make the global financial system vulnerable to cybersecurity? because it's the nightmare scenario, and we're sitting in the building, frankly, where if anything were to happen, financial armageddon is not far off if something happens to one of the major central banks in the world, or one of the big clearing banks or one of the big investment houses.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: well it's certainly something to be concerned about. that's why we spend so many resources trying to strengthen our defenses in the cybersecurity space -- both securing the perimeter but also teaching our employees the insider threat.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: but is it taken seriously?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: by policymakers, by ceos, by shareholders, by government leaders?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: i think so. i think so. because when i talk to other people, the ceos at major banks, that's the thing they worry the most about too. so it's definitely very, very high up on our agenda -- right at the top of our agenda. and i think it's right at the top of most people's agendas as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: as we come to the end here, mr. president, what is it about this job you enjoy? if you think about it, you're sitting at the top of the financial system, you're the president of the new york fed, which of course is responsible for monetary policy, the open market policies of the federal government. what is it that you enjoy about it?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: well, i mean, how i think about it is i spent a long career in the financial industry and i learned a lot about financial markets and learned a lot about the macro economy and to bring all that experience to bear in the context of monetary policy, to try to get good outcomes for the american people, that's challenging but also rewarding when we're close to achieving our objectives.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: but has there been a moment -- because you were here during the crisis --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: has there been a moment, where you suddenly say 'ah, i never realized it was that difficult to do that.' or 'i pontificated as a private economist about why doesn't the fed do this. well now i darn well see why they didn't do it. you can't do it' or 'it's too difficult to do it' or 'we tried to do it.' anything like that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: well, i think that, definitely i saw many things during the financial crisis that i never expected to see. there were a couple speeches i gave at the time, basically looking at all of the things that happened in financial markets that are totally outside the realm of our experience. i think when you're on the inside, you are constrained by the fact that the fomc is a committee and it consists of many different members. so even if you're seeing something, you have to convince your colleagues what you're seeing is actually important. so it's really important to bring along your colleagues so you can rise to the occasion and do what's necessary to actually stabilize the economy. i think one of the things that i brought to bear in terms of the crisis is that i know a lot about financial markets and the people within this institution know a lot about the financial market plumbing and i think that really helped the new york fed contribute to the fed's response during the financial crisis.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: did you ever fear that it was going to get away from you? that this train was going to run out of track?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: i definitely worried. there were days in the fall of 2008 that you really didn't know exactly what's going to happen. that's why we pulled out everything -- all the tools at our disposal to help support the economy because we were very, very close to a great depression.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: today i think we're in much better shape. i think the regulatory changes put in place post the financial crisis have made the banking system of the united states a lot more secure, higher capital, higher liquidity, a better means of resolving large institutions should they get in trouble. we've addressed some of structural weaknesses in the financial system, for example money markets. money market mutual fund reform.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: but you don't want those reforms to be taken away -- dodd-frank.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: well, look, i think it's fair that we want to take a look at regulations and make sure we got the cost-benefit right. but if you look at the u.s. banking system today, is it a good thing that we have more capital? that we have more liquidity? absolutely. we don't want to roll that back. because we saw in the financial crisis what happens to households and businesses if we don't have a financial system that can do what it needs to do in terms of intermediating flows of credit between savers and borrowers. we really had a fundamental breakdown in our financial system in the fall of 2008, and i don't ever want to go back there. therefore we certainly need to keep things like capital, like liquidity, like resolution in place so we don't ever have a financial crisis like that again. that was the worst economic environment of my lifetime. it was certainly the worst financial crisis of my lifetime. and i hope to never see one like that again.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "first, some ask why iraq is different from other countries or regimes that also have terrible weapons. while there are many dangers in the world, the threat from iraq stands alone -- because it gathers the most serious dangers of our age in one place.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "iraq's weapons of mass destruction are controlled by a murderous tyrant, who has already used chemical weapons to kill thousands of people. this same tyrant has tried to dominate the middle east, has invaded and brutally occupied a small neighbor, has struck other nations without warning, and holds an unrelenting hostility towards the united states.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "in 1995, after several years of deceit by the iraqi regime, the head of iraq's military industries defected. it was then that the regime was forced to admit that it had produced more than 30,000 liters of anthrax and other deadly biological agents. the inspectors, however, concluded that iraq had likely produced two to four times that amount. this is a massive stockpile of biological weapons that has never been accounted for, and is capable of killing millions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we know that the regime has produced thousands of tons of chemical agents, including mustard gas, sarin nerve gas, and vx nerve gas. saddam hussein also has experience in using chemical weapons. he has ordered chemical attacks on iran, and on more than forty villages in his own country. these actions killed or injured at least 20,000 people, more than six times the number of people who died in the attacks of september 11.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "some citizens wonder: after 11 years of living with this problem, why do we need to confront it now?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there is a reason. we have experienced the horror of september 11. we have seen that those who hate america are willing to crash airplanes into buildings full of innocent people. our enemies would be no less willing -- in fact they would be eager -- to use a biological, or chemical, or a nuclear weapon.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "clearly, to actually work, any new inspections, sanctions, or enforcement mechanisms will have to be very different. america wants the u.n. to be an effective organization that helps to keep the peace. that is why we are urging the security council to adopt a new resolution setting out tough, immediate requirements.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "among those requirements, the iraqi regime must reveal and destroy, under u.n. supervision, all existing weapons of mass destruction. to ensure that we learn the truth, the regime must allow witnesses to its illegal activities to be interviewed outside of the country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and these witnesses must be free to bring their families with them, so they are all beyond the reach of saddam hussein's terror and murder.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "i hope this will not require military action, but it may. and military conflict could be difficult. an iraqi regime faced with its own demise may attempt cruel and desperate measures. if saddam hussein orders such measures, his generals would be well advised to refuse those orders. if they do not refuse, they must understand that all war criminals will be pursued and punished.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if we have to act, we will take every precaution that is possible. we will plan carefully, we will act with the full power of the united states military, we will act with allies at our side, and we will prevail.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there is no easy or risk-free course of action. some have argued we should wait -- and that is an option. in my view, it is the riskiest of all options -- because the longer we wait, the stronger and bolder saddam hussein will become. we could wait and hope that saddam does not give weapons to terrorists, or develop a nuclear weapon to blackmail the world. but i am convinced that is a hope against all evidence.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "[06:15:06] and i think that we've gotten the answer, which is there was this ticking statute of limitations. i was surprised to hear there is an eight-year statute of limitations for at least one of his charges. and so it sounds like -- and correct me if i'm wrong -- is that why they had to move with alacrity?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carrie cordero, cnn legal analyst: i think it certainly was a factor. and i think it's important to keep in mind that this case against him and the investigations involving him and the process of extradition, this would have been work that was done behind the scenes by law enforcement and prosecutors and diplomats from the u.s., the u.k. and ecuador, which was housing him for some time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so i think it was a confluence, perhaps, where you had the statute of limitations. the legal process had been under seal. the indictment had been under seal in the eastern district of virginia for some time. and then we needed the other factor -- u.s. law enforcement needed the other factor in play, which was the government of ecuador finally making the decision to release him to u.k. authorities. camerota: yes, and it sounds like their patience really ran out with him. i mean, certainly, we hear nick paton walsh's reporting about the conditions that he was living in.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "millions of americans have tax time bombs lurking among their assets. often, it's a smart strategy to put these investments to good use, as long as you don't forget about their potential downsides.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "here are three of the most common tax time bombs that you'll find and what you can do to keep them from doing irreparable damage to your finances.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "1. traditional iras and qualified retirement plan accounts", "augmented": []}
{"original": "perhaps the largest ticking time bomb from a tax perspective comes from the money that americans have in iras, 401(k) plans, and other qualified retirement plans. 401(k)s have about $5.3 trillion in assets, according to the investment company institute, and total retirement assets amount to $27.2 trillion. that second number includes annuities and traditional pensions, and both figures consist of both traditional and roth-style iras and 401(k) plans. nevertheless, it's fair to assume that there's somewhere between $10 trillion and $20 trillion in pre-tax assets held in retirement plans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the problem with traditional iras, 401(k)s, and similar retirement accounts is that when you withdraw money from them, you have to pay income tax on what you pull out, and that reduces the size of your effective after-tax nest egg.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "even if you don't want to withdraw your pre-tax retirement money, these accounts are almost universally subject to required minimum distribution rules that kick in at age 70 1/2. once you reach that age, you have no choice: you must start withdrawing a portion of your account and paying taxes on it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what's more, the withdrawals you have to include in taxable income can subject other sources of income to tax. the most common example is social security, where benefits become taxable if your outside income lifts you over certain threshold amounts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one solution is to make greater use of roth iras and roth 401(k) plan options. roth accounts let you save after-tax money, with distributions being tax-free in retirement. not all employers offer roth 401(k)s, but conversions of existing traditional retirement assets to roths are generally available.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "many people own savings bonds without even knowing it. as popular gifts from older generations to children, savings bonds differ from most bonds in that they accumulate interest on a tax-deferred basis. you don't have to pay taxes on the income that they generate each year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the price you'll pay, though, is that you have to pay tax when you cash in your bonds. because currently issued savings bonds stop earning interest after 30 years, you either have to cash them in and suffer the tax consequences or allow them to sit without earning any interest at all after their final maturity date.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "fortunately, one solution is to take the money from maturing bonds and transfer it into a 529 college savings plan account. doing so lets you exclude the accumulated interest from taxation. otherwise, you'll have to pay tax on the entire increase in value from what you paid for the bond and what you received when you cashed it in.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "finally, your personal residence can be a ticking tax time bomb. most homeowners get the benefit of one of the most lucrative tax breaks on the books: the capital gains exclusion of up to $250,000 for singles or $500,000 for joint filers. what that means is that if a couple saw their home rise in value from $300,000 to $800,000 over their lifetimes, they can sell it and pay no tax at all.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so how is this a tax trap? the potential problem is that the exclusion is available only for property that's been used as your principal residence during at least two of the five years preceding the sale. there are special rules that reduce that requirement to just one year if you need to leave your home for long-term care in a nursing home or other institution, but failing to meet the requirement can eliminate the exclusion entirely. moreover, if you decide to change the nature of the home to a nonqualified use -- such as renting it out -- then capital gain that's attributed to the period of nonqualified use can be taxable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the solution is to sell your home long before there's any danger of losing the personal residence exclusion. otherwise, you could turn the most profitable investment of your life into a major tax hassle.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "i first started my association with nbc 30 years ago, feeding cold war stories to bob windrem and fred francis at the pentagon. i became an on-air analyst during the 1999 kosovo war, continuing to work thereafter with nightly news, delighting and oftentimes annoying in my peculiar position of being a mere civilian amongst the generals and former government officials. a scholar at heart, i also found myself an often lone voice that was anti-nuclear and even anti-military, anti-military for me meaning opinionated but also highly knowledgeable, somewhat akin to a movie critic, loving my subject but also not shy about making judgements regarding the flops and the losers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "when the attacks of 9/11 came, i was called back to nbc. i spent weeks on and off the air talking about al qaeda and the various wars we were rushing into, arguing that airpower and drones would be the centerpiece not troops. in the new martial environment where only one war cry was sanctioned i was out of sync then as well. i retreated somewhat to writing a column for the los angeles times, but even there i had to fight editors who couldn't believe that there would be a war in iraq. and i spoke up about the absence of any sort of strategy for actually defeating terrorism, annoying the increasing gaggles of those who seemed to accept that a state of perpetual war was a necessity.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i thought then that there was great danger in the embrace of process and officialdom over values and public longing, and i wrote about the increasing power of the national security community. long before trump and deep state became an expression, i produced one ginormous investigation – top secret america – for the washington post and i wrote a nasty book – american coup – about the creeping fascism of homeland security.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "looking back now they were both harbingers for what president obama (and then trump) faced in terms of largely failing to make enduring change.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "somewhere in all of that, and particularly as the social media wave began, it was clear that nbc (like the rest of the news media) could no longer keep up with the world. added to that was the intellectual challenge of how to report our new kind of wars when there were no real fronts and no actual measures of success. to me there is also a larger problem: though they produce nothing that resembles actual safety and security, the national security leaders and generals we have are allowed to do their thing unmolested. despite being at war, no great wartime leaders or visionaries are emerging. there is not a soul in washington who can say that they have won or stopped any conflict. and though there might be the beloved perfumed princes in the form of the petraeus' and wes clarks', or the so-called warrior monks like mattis and mcmaster, we've had more than a generation of national security leaders who sadly and fraudulently have done little of consequence. and yet we (and others) embrace them, even the highly partisan formers who masquerade as analysts. we do so ignoring the empirical truth of what they have wrought: there is not one county in the middle east that is safer today than it was 18 years ago. indeed the world becomes ever more polarized and dangerous.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as perpetual war has become accepted as a given in our lives, i'm proud to say that i've never deviated in my argument at nbc (or at my newspaper gigs) that terrorists will never be defeated until we better understand why they are driven to fighting. and i have maintained my central view that airpower (in its broadest sense including space and cyber) is not just the future but the enabler and the tool of war today.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "i'm a difficult guy, not prone to either protocol or procedure and i give nbc credit that it tolerated me through my various incarnations. i hope people will say in the early days that i made brokaw and company smarter about nuclear weapons, about airpower, and even about al qaeda. and i'm proud to say that i also was one of the few to report that there weren't any wmd in iraq and remember fondly presenting that conclusion to an incredulous nbc editorial board. i argued endlessly with msnbc about all things national security for years, doing the daily blah, blah, blah in secaucus, but also poking at the conventional wisdom of everyone from matthews to hockenberry. and yet i feel like i've failed to convey this larger truth about the hopelessness of our way of doing things, especially disheartened to watch nbc and much of the rest of the news media somehow become a defender of washington and the system.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "windrem again convinced me to return to nbc to join the new investigative unit in the early days of the 2016 presidential campaign. i thought that the mission was to break through the machine of perpetual war acceptance and conventional wisdom to challenge hillary clinton's hawkishness. it was also an interesting moment at nbc because everyone was looking over their shoulder at vice and other upstarts creeping up on the mainstream. but then trump got elected and investigations got sucked into the tweeting vortex, increasingly lost in a directionless adrenaline rush, the national security and political version of leading the broadcast with every snow storm. and i would assert that in many ways nbc just began emulating the national security state itself – busy and profitable. no wars won but the ball is kept in play.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'd argue that under trump, the national security establishment not only hasn't missed a beat but indeed has gained dangerous strength. now it is ever more autonomous and practically impervious to criticism. i'd also argue, ever so gingerly, that nbc has become somewhat lost in its own verve, proxies of boring moderation and conventional wisdom, defender of the government against trump, cheerleader for open and subtle threat mongering, in love with procedure and protocol over all else (including results). i accept that there's a lot to report here, but i'm more worried about how much we are missing. hence my desire to take a step back and think why so little changes with regard to america's wars.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i know it is characteristic of our overexcited moment to blast away at former employers and mainstream institutions, but all i can say is that despite many frustrations, my time at nbc has been gratifying. working with cynthia mcfadden has been the experience of a lifetime. i've learned a ton about television from her and kevin monahan, the secret insider tricks of the trade and the very big picture of what makes for original stories (and how powerful they can be). the young reporters at nbc are also universally excellent. thanks to noah oppenheim for his support of my contrarian and disruptive presence. and to janelle rodriguez, who supported deep expertise. the nightly crew has also been a constant fan of my too long stories and a great team. i continue to marvel as phil griffin carries out his diabolical plan for the cable network to take over the world.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm proud of the work i've done with my team and know that there's more to do. but for now it's time to take a break. i'm ever so happy to return to writing and thinking without the officiousness of editorial tyrants or corporate standards. and of course i yearn to go back to my first love, which is writing boring reports about secret programs, grateful that the american government so graciously obliges in its constant supply. and i particularly feel like the world is moving so quickly that even in just the little national security world i inhabit, i need more time to sit back and think. and to replenish.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in our day-to-day whirlwind and hostage status as prisoners of donald trump, i think – like everyone else does – that we miss so much. people who don't understand the medium, or the pressures, loudly opine that it's corporate control or even worse, that it's partisan. sometimes i quip in response to friends on the outside (and to government sources) that if they mean by the word partisan that it is new yorkers and washingtonians against the rest of the country then they are right.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for me i realized how out of step i was when i looked at trump's various bumbling intuitions: his desire to improve relations with russia, to denuclearize north korea, to get out of the middle east, to question why we are fighting in africa, even in his attacks on the intelligence community and the fbi. of course he is an ignorant and incompetent impostor. and yet i'm alarmed at how quick nbc is to mechanically argue the contrary, to be in favor of policies that just spell more conflict and more war. really? we shouldn't get out syria? we shouldn't go for the bold move of denuclearizing the korean peninsula? even on russia, though we should be concerned about the brittleness of our democracy that it is so vulnerable to manipulation, do we really yearn for the cold war? and don't even get me started with the fbi: what? we now lionize this historically destructive institution?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "even without trump, our biggest challenge as we move forward is that we have become exhausted parents of our infant (and infantile) social media children. and because of the cycle, we at nbc (and all others in the field of journalism) suffer from a really bad case of not being able to ever take a breath. we are a long way from resolving the rules of the road in this age, whether it be with regard to our personal conduct or anything related to hard news. i also don't think that we are on a straight line towards digital nirvana, that is, that all of this information will democratize and improve society. i sense that there is already smartphone and social media fatigue creeping across the land, and my guess is that nothing we currently see – nothing that is snappy or chatty – will solve our horrific challenges of information overload or the role (and nature) of journalism. andi am sure that once trump leaves center stage, society will have a gigantic media hangover. thus for nbc – and for everyone else – there is challenge and opportunity ahead. i'd particularly like to think and write more about that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there's a saying about consultants, that organizations hire them to hear exactly what they want to hear. i'm proud to say that nbc didn't do that when it came to me. similarly i can say that i'm proud that i'm not guilty of giving my employers what they wanted. still, the things this and most organizations fear most – variability, disturbance, difference – those things that are also the primary drivers of creativity – are not really the things that i see valued in the reporting ranks.", "augmented": []}
