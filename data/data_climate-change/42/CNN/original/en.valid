(cnn) in recent years and especially since the death of george floyd, high school and college students have been using social media to expose everyday racism they confront at school. a r ecent story in the new york times about two high school graduates from virginia was particularly dramatic.\n\naccording to the times, one student, jimmy galligan, shared in june 2020 a three-second snapchat video of his classmate, mimi groves, using a racial slur. groves had first sent the video message to a friend in 2016 when she was 15 and had just gotten her learner's permit. in the video, she looks into the camera and says, i can drive, [racial slur].\n\nsomeone shared it with galligan a few years later, when both he and groves were seniors. galligan kept the video and after groves had chosen a college, he posted the video publicly. as he later described it to the times, the video taught someone a lesson.\n\nshortly after galligan posted the video, groves' acceptance to the university of tennessee's cheer team was revoked. according to the times, under pressure from their students, alumni and the public, the university encouraged groves to withdraw, which she did.\n\ngroves told the times that the clip began as a private message and that she is disgusted that such a word came out of her mouth. at the time, she said, i didn't understand the severity of the word, or the history and context behind it, because i was so young.\n\ngalligan has said he does not regret his actions. their story has drawn an uproar of commentary in response, especially on social media, and among other media outlets, some referring to galligan as vindictive for his lack of regret about the consequences groves has faced. the times has also come under criticism for amplifying the story.\n\nthis story comes at a time when many schools, like other public institutions, are struggling to address their failures to address systemic racism. and while a very public outing and shaming of a few students here and there might offer some sense of justice, it, unfortunately, lets too many students, parents and educators -- really the whole community -- off the hook.\n\ntoo often, finding offenders and outing them becomes the focus, instead of how the adults -- the educators and parents -- can support black, indigenous and students of color and give all students a thoughtful education. it allows too many communities to smugly point fingers and not to look at themselves.\n\none problem with making someone like groves emblematic of broader racism harbored within an institution is that it risks absolving others of examining their own behaviors. it makes her the exception, instead of recognizing what she said as a symptom of the prevailing climate at her school and in her school district.\n\nwhen galligan posted the video on social media, in june 2020, both he and groves were seniors and had spent four years steeped in the culture of heritage high school in leesburg, virginia, which students of color there say was, as the times described it , rife with racial insensitivity, including casual uses of slurs.\n\nthe loudoun county school district -- one of the wealthiest counties in the country -- commissioned a report , presented to the superintendent in june 2019, which showed a pattern of students and teachers using racial slurs widely and disproportionate disciplinary measures meted out to white and black students, who spoke of their growing sense of despair that racist events, large and small, are ignored and school leaders do not believe their reports of mistreatment.\n\njust watched activist: i'm genuinely exhausted as a young black woman replay more videos ... must watch activist: i'm genuinely exhausted as a young black woman 19:12\n\nafter the report published, the district released a plan to fight systemic racism and issued a formal apology for the district's history of segregation. in june 2020, the school board also put out a statement following the death of george floyd affirming their commitment to a safe, empathetic, respectful, and supporting learning environment for every student, acknowledging that loudoun county is not immune from the effects of systemic racism and noting that even as we work for positive change, we recognize that harm is done by racist and hate-filled statements and acts.\n\nheritage high school officials did not respond to the times' requests for interviews.\n\ngalligan, whose mother is black and father is white, told the new york times that he and other students had endured years of racist harassment. when students like galligan and classmate muna barry (also quoted in the times sharing her experiences as a black student) are in the position where reporting racism doesn't bring about real change, educators have failed.\n\nloudoun county may be notable for the previous failures of some of their educators to lead by example. unfortunately, they are not alone. too many high schools are unsafe environments where students who are targeted for their racial identity are left to fend for themselves. it should surprise no one to see young people wielding their skills on social media as a weapon or a shield when they have been otherwise ignored.\n\nstudents at many predominantly white private high schools and colleges across the united states, and at some public schools, have shared on instagram examples of racism from other students as well as their teachers. many of these conversations focus on students and alumni supporting one another, and validating the difficult experiences they have gone through.\n\nschool leaders who have not already done so should take a long hard look at these instagram accounts, which detail painful experiences of social exclusion, overt racism and academic discrimination. real change requires more than just discipline for the offenders. schools need to proactively teach anti-racism without doing more harm -- which means they need training in the best methods to do so.\n\nin addition to incorporating anti-racist teaching into the curriculum, schools must hold young people accountable for racist actions in the immediate setting where they occur and later offer a thoughtfully planned restorative process that offers a chance for students to learn, heal and understand the impact of their actions.\n\nit is especially important for students who have been targeted to be heard and to be able to participate in the restorative process in a way that prioritizes their safety.\n\nfinding the student who is imprudent about using a slur on social media focuses all the anger on that student. what about the student who anonymously leaves a note in a locker? what about the student who keeps other kids off the team? what about the kids who quietly make it so uncomfortable for outsiders that some extracurricular activity is completely closed to kids of a certain ethnic group, religion or gender? what about a school counselor who systematically counsels black students away from ap or honors classes?\n\nanother challenge with canceling someone for racial ignorance, particularly in a case like groves, who expressed deep regret for her behavior, is where do they go? how do they move forward? as the times story points out, groves posted in support of black lives matter as a senior and yet had used the n-word as a 9th grader. (a black friend of groves told the times groves had apologized about the offensive post long before it went viral. the friend defended groves in a snapchat post: we're supposed to educate people, not ruin their lives all because you want to feel a sense of empowerment.)\n\na true education in racial inequity would help any young teen understand how the word and the system that produced it have destroyed black lives before things ever got to this point and help them reckon with the both the reality of white privilege and their role in it.\n\ncollege can be a time for kids with white privilege to ask hard questions about how we live and the history of housing discrimination that produced environments like loudoun county and countless other communities in america. and about the ways that racism stokes fears that can put their black classmates' lives at risk\n\na lot of the reaction to the times story has focused on the cost to groves for something she did at 15: admission to her dream college and sports goals she'd pursued for years.\n\nof course, community college, which groves now attends, can offer a chance to learn about white privilege, too. but it might have been a great learning opportunity for groves to leave home and to live somewhere else for a bit. when i taught first year students at depaul university, i witnessed and encouraged this process with students in a new environment, reckoning with what they thought they knew, firsthand.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter. join us on twitter and facebook\n\nthe university of tennessee told local media that groves withdrew voluntarily. her lawyer (who is also a cnn legal analyst) contested that characterization, saying she was forced to withdraw or her offer of admission would be rescinded. the case does nothing to change the wider culture of racism on college campuses. that change will take a lot more work than singling out one student.\n\neducators and parents need to focus on character over consequences. when a very few kids receive an outsized consequence and many others escape notice, the message can all too easily become a smug see we got that racist over there -- or, worse don't get caught -- instead of examine your bias and do the right thing.\n\na previous version of this op-ed listed an incorrect month and year for when jimmy galligan posted the video of mimi groves. it was posted in june 2020.
editor's note — follow anthony bourdain parts unknown on twitter and facebook\n\n(cnn) — with a climate that ranges from desert dry to tropical lush to freeze-your-north-face-off in the andes, peru packs a ton of diversity between its sea level elevation pacific beaches and the 22,204 foot top of its highest mountain, nevado huascaran.\n\nthere's pisco. there's ceviche. and, yes, there's that famous trail. don't worry, we'll get to all of those. first, some things you may not already know:\n\n1. lima is worth seeing\n\nwhile most international travelers land in peru's current capital, many immediately continue on to the country's former capital, cuzco, in their rush to get to machu picchu.\n\nthat's a mistake.\n\nlima is peru's largest city by far. it's home to more than a quarter of peru's roughly 30 million people, has wonderful food, the beautiful miraflores district (where you can drink while overlooking beaches lined with small rocks that form eye-catching patterns each time the tide rolls out) and excellent museums.\n\nthe museo larco and its erotic gallery is devoted to sculptures from more than a thousand years ago celebrating sexual congress in all of its least procreative forms. reproductions of these works pop up all over peru, notably in the form of a bottle of pisco shaped like a fellow in an extremely good mood.\n\nmuseo larco (larco museum), bolivar 1515, lima; +51 1 461 1312\n\n2. you're gonna love the ceviche\n\nfresh, raw fish marinated in citrus juices and spiced with chili peppers and sometimes other tongue-tingling spices, ceviche is peru's most popular dish, a must-try for any visitor.\n\nin lima, internationally famed la mar is a great place to try it, but ceviche is prepared differently throughout the country, from humble street stalls to elegant restaurants.\n\nla mar , 770 av. la mar, lima; +51 1 421 3365\n\n3. there's more to peru than incas\n\nmost tourists come to peru to see machu picchu or other inca ruins, with maybe a few catholic churches thrown in for balance. this makes it easy to conclude, there were the incas, then the spanish came, which brings us to where we are now.\n\nin fact, the inca were a bit like mitt romney's bain capital: they had a knack for taking control of long-established things and making them their own. the incan state didn't emerge until the 1200s. it became an empire in the 1400s, and its final sovereign emperor died in 1533, officially ending the period of constructing the buildings and roads that lure visitors to this day.\n\nthat said, the norte chico people of peru built a civilization 5,000 years ago and the centuries that followed saw the emergence of other significant cultures, such as the paracas and the moche.\n\nwas the incan era a highlight of peruvian history? unquestionably. but when peruvian museums boast artifacts from before christ, focusing exclusively on atahualpa and his predecessors is akin to being so impressed by books that you conclude world history began with the gutenberg press.\n\n4. pisco rules\n\nwatch out for this stuff -- pisco goes fast. sean cunningham\n\nperu's beverage of choice is pisco, a brandy made from grapes. it's also adored in chile, inspiring an epic rivalry over which nation is its true birthplace.\n\navailable in numerous brands at varying prices, pisco is usually consumed in cocktail form, meaning other ingredients largely hide its nuances, which can be a good thing for novices unaccustomed to pisco's blowtorch nuances.\n\nthe most famous cocktail is the pisco sour, consisting of lime juice, simple syrup, egg white, ice and angostura bitters. there are assorted variations, such as the coca sour for those who feel the pisco sour requires more bitterness.\n\nif you'd rather just have a beer, you're in luck -- the local brews are good, with cusqueña being a particularly refreshing option.\n\n5. cash is king, ideally in small bills\n\ntravelers in less trafficked areas of the world often find businesses that won't take mastercard or visa, much less american express. peru offers an extra twist: occasionally shops refuse these cards despite displaying signs advertising them.\n\nin general, peruvians like their soles (the currency is the nuevo sol) in small denominations: a fifty (roughly $20) is ok, but denominations of twenty and under are better to ensure merchants can make change.\n\nthat noted, peruvians tend to put great stock in u.s. dollars, so even if an establishment doesn't take credit cards and you don't see an atm, you may still be able to buy dinner or souvenirs. make sure your u.s. and other foreign currency is in pristine shape -- many merchants and hotels will reject torn or overly worn bills.\n\n6. altitude adjustment amounts to common sense\n\nperu is a mountainous land, and you have to handle heights if you're going to cuzco, machu picchu and other landmarks of incan culture.\n\nhow to prepare? the easiest method is drink lots of water, get plenty of sleep and ease off the booze -- just imagine how your mother would like you to conduct your life at every elevation and you'll be fine. you can also consume stimulating coca leafs, whether in tea or by chewing them.\n\n7. the plumbing requires some tlc\n\nmachu picchu leaves visitors breathless. cris bouroncle/afp/getty images\n\nexpect to see trashcans in bathrooms next to the toilet.\n\nwhile peruvian plumbing handles your waste, it doesn't do toilet paper, which must be put in the bin next to the bowl. some bathrooms have signs stating this rule, others assume you know: remember and spare yourself begging for a plunger in broken spanish.\n\n8. the inca trail is genuinely difficult\n\nalong the famed trail you'll often be reminded of the peruvian proverb: when the road is long, even slippers feel tight.\n\nthe inca trail largely consists of stone stairs -- often steep ones -- and those stone stairs weren't meant to be covered by mortals. the result is that the steps feel quite high for those who don't answer to kobe or lebron.\n\nif just reading this makes your knees swell, you may be in trouble. in addition, while altitude sickness tends to be exaggerated, there'll come a moment when you're going up a hill and find that your lungs have betrayed you.\n\nthrow in the chance of heavy rains -- test your waterproof gear pretrek to make sure it's just that -- and the trail can feel less like vacation than boot camp.\n\n9. there are ways to ease your inca pain\n\ndepending on the company guiding you on the trail, it's possible to get porters to carry your tent, sleeping bag, food and ... well, they'll essentially carry everything, including you, should your body completely fall to pieces.\n\nporters race ahead to the night's camp and assemble everything before parties arrive, then cook and serve multiple-course meals, in certain cases on white linen table clothes. the result after a hard day's walk is that you feel like you've stepped out of deliverance and into howard's end. speaking of porters ...\n\n10. porters are the toughest guys in the country\n\nmachu picchu porters are even tougher than the trail. sean cunningham\n\nwhether you're on your own or traveling like an english lord in the colonies, you'll encounter porters on the inca trail. these men tend to be farmers or laborers looking to earn extra money.\n\nthey carry up to 20 kilograms (44 pounds) of gear -- the weight limit is a recent development, they used to handle positively spine-shattering loads -- and they carry it fast. some actually run along the trail, somehow avoiding shredded ankles as they navigate uneven, wet stones just to ensure all's ready before the tourists stagger into camp.\n\nif you feel like racing your fellow hikers, great. do not test the porters: they're pros, and you're at best a promising amateur.
wanted: $6 million in missing gaming chips. last seen: the lavish wynn casino in macau.\n\npolice are hunting for millions of dollars in casino chips after they were stolen -- allegedly by one of wynn's own croupiers -- raising security concerns in the world's biggest gambling hub.\n\nthe heist happened tuesday at the wynn macau (wynmf), one of the marquee destinations in a chinese territory whose gambling revenues dwarf those of las vegas.\n\nmacau police told cnnmoney that a dealer at the wynn macau and a potential accomplice have been arrested and that they are not currently looking for other suspects. they declined to identify the two people by name.\n\nrelated: macau's best casinos: a 2018 guide\n\npolice didn't say how the stolen chips were taken past casino security. but local media reported that the suspect allegedly stuffed them into a bag in a vip room and simply carried them out.\n\nto turn the chips into hard cash, the thieves or their associates would eventually need to bring them back into the casino.\n\nwynn macau is controlled by wynn resorts (wynn), the las vegas casino firm founded by billionaire mogul steve wynn. wynn macau didn't respond to requests for comment friday.\n\ncasino operators could face pressure from authorities to tighten up oversight of gaming rooms following the theft, according to vitaly umansky, an analyst at investment firm sanford bernstein.\n\nrules around gambling in macau are more relaxed than in las vegas, he said. most of the high-stakes action in macau takes place in so-called vip rooms, which aren't run by the casinos themselves but by separate junket operators from mainland china.\n\nthat makes it difficult for casinos to manage exactly what goes on inside.\n\nthe junkets get a lot of leeway inside the rooms in terms of how money changes hands and how chips change hands. that's something that may need to get evaluated, umansky said.\n\nbig heists in the city's casinos are rare, but they do happen. in 2015, a junket operator said it had been scammed out of more than $30 million. that incident also happened at a wynn casino.\n\nrelated: china jails top casino exec over gambling crimes\n\ngambling is a big business in macau, a former portuguese colony.\n\nthe city's revenues from games like baccarat and blackjack are about five times bigger than those generated on the las vegas strip.\n\nmacau's casinos raked in just over $33 billion last year, an increase of about 20% from the year before.\n\nthat snapped a multi-year losing streak for the gambling industry in the city. macau is popular with visitors from mainland china, where gambling is illegal.\n\nrevenues began falling in 2014, hurt by a far-reaching crackdown on corruption by chinese president xi jinping. that deterred some big spenders from visiting macau's vip rooms.\n\n-- qiaoqiao yu contributed to this report.

(cnn) —\n\nimpeachment is the fever dream of democrats and progressives whose engagement brought democrats into the house majority.\n\nthat's why one congressman pledged to re-introduce articles of impeachment as soon as possible, and another said she promised her son of the president, we're going to impeach the motherf****r.\n\nit's a topic that's been on democrats' tongues since trump took office. but newly elected house speaker nancy pelosi and other democratic leaders have argued against serious consideration of that option.\n\ncontrolling the urge to impeach could be pelosi's most difficult challenge in her first months back in the speaker's office.\n\ndemocrats really want to impeach trump, but the country doesn't\n\n01:37 - source: cnn listen to rep. tlaib's controversial comments\n\nin a cnn poll conducted by ssrs in december, 80% of democrats said they thought the president should be impeached and removed from office. that's a strong tide for pelosi to fight.\n\nbut the reason she'll fight it is expressed in the same poll, where just 36% of independents and 7% of republicans said trump should be impeached and removed from office.\n\njust 43% of the respondents at large said he should be impeached and half – 50% – said he should not.\n\ndemocrats want it. the country does not.\n\nimpeaching trump is different than removing him from office\n\ngetting rid of a president using impeachment is a two-step process. the house investigates the president for high crimes and misdemeanors and votes to impeach. but it's the job of the senate to hold a public trial and remove the president from office. and while democrats seized control of the house and the power to impeach trump, they actually lost a net of two seats in the senate. it would take 67 senators to vote to remove a president from office in the senate. there are 47 democrats and two independents who usually vote with them. unless and until a large number – 20! – of republican senators are willing to vote to remove trump from office, impeaching him in the house would only accomplish making impeachment the cause celebre of trump and his supporters.\n\npelosi noted this in an interview with usa today when she said any impeachment effort should be heavily bipartisan.\n\nif there's to be grounds for impeachment of president trump – and i'm not seeking those grounds – that would have to be so clearly bipartisan in terms of acceptance of it before i think we should go down any impeachment path, she said.\n\ntrump's approval rating is not at impeachment levels\n\nthat 43% support for trump being impeached is nothing to sniff at – it's on par with the 43% who said richard nixon should be impeached in march of 1974, not long before he resigned to avoid impeachment. but trump's approval rating is much higher than nixon's at that time.\n\ngranted, trump's approval rating is much lower than bill clinton's at the time of clinton's impeachment. but the clinton lesson is one pelosi probably remembers very well. republicans' impeachment effort against clinton backfired and his popularity actually grew as the process wore on. he also survived the trial in the senate.\n\nthe real prize for democrats would be winning in 2020\n\ndemocrats won't have a chance to strengthen their hand in the senate until the next election in 2020, which also happens to be when trump is up for re-election. beating him and putting a democrat in office is probably a much more tantalizing idea to someone like nancy pelosi than impeaching trump. her most recent comments on impeachment, made to nbc news just before she was sworn in as speaker, were interesting on this point, when she said no decision should be made until special counsel robert mueller delivers his report on the russian election interference investigation.\n\nwe shouldn't be impeaching for a political reason and we shouldn't avoid it for a political reason, she said.\n\nimpeachment takes a long time\n\nif democrats do ultimately move to impeach trump, the process would be all-consuming and take a long time. the starr report was released on september 11, 1998. the house voted to impeach bill clinton three months later on december 19, 1998. the senate didn't acquit him until february of 1999.\n\nnixon resigned rather than be impeached, but the process was taking even longer. impeachment hearings against nixon began in the house judiciary committee in may of 1974 and nixon didn't resign until early august of 1974.\n\nit would be very hard for democrats to find oxygen for any other political platform during that time.\n\nmueller could change everything you've just read\n\nthe important caveat in what pelosi has said this week about impeachment is that mueller has not yet completed his investigation or issued any kind of report. key former trump aides are still cooperating with the russia investigation. whatever mueller finds could change the impeachment equation immediately and dramatically. or not. that's why it's important to wait and see what he finds. there are plenty of democrats who think there are already grounds to impeach trump right now. but they are not, as described above, in the majority.\n\nwhat mueller's report, if and when it comes, won't change is the date of the next general election. and while pelosi said democrats shouldn't avoid impeachment for political reasons, the fact remains that if or until republicans turn en masse against the president, it is probably a less attractive option for democrats to pursue than making a political argument to voters.

are his own. view more opinion articles on cnn.\n\n(cnn) —\n\nchina started out the year by doing something that no nation has done before: it landed a spacecraft and an accompanying rover on the far side of the moon with an ambitious scientific payload package and an exciting mission ahead to study the interior structure of the moon with the help of ground-penetrating radar, among other things.\n\nalmost equally impressive from a technical standpoint, china successfully placed a communication relay satellite into a lunar halo orbit to enable the command of, and communication with, both the spacecraft and rover, which do not have line-of-sight views of earth for direct radio contact.\n\nleroy chiao\n\ni had mixed feelings about these events.\n\ni was born in the united states, but my parents were both born in china, before they made their way to taiwan and immigrated to america in the 1950s. on the one hand, i am proud of my heritage and what china has accomplished. on the other, my family is american, and we take pride in us accomplishments. and because the apollo moon landing in 1969 was what inspired me to become an astronaut, i strongly believe the us can and should maintain a leading role in space exploration.\n\nchina has surpassed all other nations with a new achievement. though not exactly poised to take the united states' spot, china has fired a warning shot. the us must now step up its game to maintain its place as the leader.\n\nwhile china is preparing its space station, with plans to start sending parts up in 2020, america is planning to exit the international space station – the collaborative effort of 15 nations – in 2024-2025. according to an internal nasa document obtained by the washington post in early 2018, the plan is based on the unrealistic idea that we can transition management of the facility to a commercial entity.\n\nthe iss was never designed to be operated profitably. mission control centers in houston and moscow must be permanently staffed to support it, and launch and landing costs would be prohibitive to any commercial entity.\n\nmeanwhile, china could land astronauts on the moon as early as the 2030s, leapfrogging nasa in their lunar capabilities.\n\nbut perhaps the us should have seen this coming. in 1965, at the height of the apollo program, nasa had 5.3% of the federal budget. today, even though the budget is a slightly higher than it has been in recent years, it sits at around just 0.4%.\n\nwith those measly funds, nasa's ambitions are inevitably limited. this doesn't seem likely to change, with the white house seemingly more intent on creating the so-called space force, a new military branch, than investing in a real space exploration program.\n\nto be fair, we are still doing some amazing things in space. very recently, the new horizons spacecraft, after making groundbreaking discoveries and images of pluto, went on to image ultima thule – by far the most distant object ever imaged – at about 4 billion miles from earth. the osiris rex spacecraft established orbit around the 500 meter-diameter asteroid bennu, some 100 million km from earth. it will bring back a sample of the asteroid for analysis. the parker solar probe is performing ground-breaking measurements of our sun. the mars insight spacecraft just landed on mars to do studies that have never been done before, like seismic studies.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\nthese great missions notwithstanding, our space program could be on the verge of being outdone. it is a classic case of the tortoise and the hare. we have been so used to being on top for so long that our politicians have gotten complacent.\n\nindeed, the failure to prioritize our space capabilities is nothing new. president barack obama proclaimed that america would go to mars by the 2030s but did not sufficiently prioritize funding the program.\n\nnow we have come to the moment of china's ascendency in space exploration. we must face the reality that it has, in a small but significant way, shown the world that it can be the first to accomplish things in space, too. we had better realize this soon, or we may very well wake up to find that we are no longer top dog in the space business. and if we don't learn from our complacency in space, we could end up losing our edge in other areas as well.\n\ncorrection: this piece originally misstated how far bennu is from earth. it has been updated to reflect the correct distance.

why has he suddenly – and surprisingly – resigned? the clue is in the key section of his lengthy resignation email to his staff:\n\nserious multilateral negotiating experience is in short supply in whitehall, and that is not the case in the commission or in the council.\n\nthe government will only achieve the best for the country if it harnesses the best experience we have - a large proportion of which is concentrated in ukrep - and negotiates resolutely.\n\nsenior ministers, who will decide on our positions, issue by issue, also need from you detailed, unvarnished - even where this is uncomfortable - and nuanced understanding of the views, interests and incentives of the other 27.\n\nthe structure of the uk's negotiating team and the allocation of roles and responsibilities to support that team, needs rapid resolution.\n\nblunt and to the point. theresa may and brexit secretary david davis need unvarnished and uncomfortable advice. and they need to resource properly the machine that can deliver this advice.\n\nsir ivan did not suffer fools gladly. that is the best kind of person to work with if you are a politician who wants to know the facts – the full facts – so that you can craft a full and effective strategy.\n\nbut the current uk government seems intent on centralizing power and only hearing good news. for sir ivan rogers, the politics of brexit – and the future of his country – was too important to play along with this.\n\nin his email he carefully puts the word brexit in quotation marks, preferring to use the word exit about the uk's future. in similar fashion he talks about invoking article 50 rather than triggering it.\n\nthe more passive tone will have infuriated no. 10, because it reflects a horrible truth: that the uk is in a weak negotiating position. no amount of bluster from the pm or david davis can change that. what they can change – and what they have changed – is who leads for the uk in negotiations. but by forcing rogers out they have revealed how weak the current no. 10 operation is. as he says:\n\nwe do not yet know what the government will set as negotiating objectives for the uk's relationship with the eu after exit.\n\nthat is undoubtedly a question he has repeatedly internally. rather than answer it, no. 10 has made it clear that he is not needed. the broader signal is clear too: civil servants have to toe the government line and hide uncomfortable facts and challenging questions from ministers.\n\nthat is never a good idea. intellectual challenge leads to good policy and – in the end – good policy is good politics. when you face a negotiation which will determine the uk's prosperity for the coming decades, it is a dereliction of duty and leadership for no. 10 to want to close down internal debate.\n\nnegotiating brexit successfully with 27 different countries requires skills and deep relationships. one of the central relationships – between the government and the permanent civil service – has just been trashed and it will ultimately be to britain's cost when it comes to dealing with brussels.
(cnn) in a year of despair and a world full of hate, one fast food manager is doing what she can to spread a message of love.\n\napril didonna told a customer that she loved him after he ordered at the wendy's drive-thru where she works in oak harbor, washington. three months later, she's told thousands of people i love you.\n\nto know that the little three words could mean so much to so many people, it's overwhelming my heart with so much more love, didonna told cnn. i truly believe that if we just love each other, the world would be better.\n\nthe love routine kept going and didonna started tallying how many people have said i love you back. about 2,700 customers have reciprocated the message since she began counting on october 3, as of friday before her shift.\n\neach time a customer completes an order, the assistant manager sprinkles in her love message.\n\ni love you. you are loved. you matter. you do you. i love you, she says. that's what i say.\n\ndavid antis, senior vice president of operations for wtc ventures, the company that operates the wendy's franchise, said he's proud of didonna for spreading a positive message.\n\napril is a valued team member at our wendy's restaurant in oak harbor, washington. her kindness and positivity inspire us all, and we are grateful for the joy that she brings to our customers and restaurant team, he said.\n\nsometimes people are a little weirded out by hearing her message through a drive-thru speaker, didonna said.\n\nsometimes people are unsure, the 35-year-old said. then i kind of just explain it. if people can hate for no reason, why can't i love?\n\nusually, people see her point and many of them say i love you too, she said.\n\nher message can change someone's day\n\nother times, the positive message changes a person's day more than anyone would know, didonna said.\n\none time an elderly woman asked to speak with the voice behind the message. when didonna went to the window, she saw the woman crying.\n\nwhen didonna said she asked the woman if she was ok and what was wrong, the woman simply thanked her.\n\nthank you for telling me that you loved me, didonna said the woman told her.\n\nthe customer told didonna that her husband had passed away and her brother had recently died. i don't have anyone to tell me that they love me anymore and there is no one there to give me a hug, didonna said the woman said.\n\ndidonna, a widow herself and a mother of three boys, asked the woman to pull forward to the store's door. she asked if she could open the car door and then she hugged the woman.\n\nwhen i gave this woman a hug, she just melted in my arms and she just started crying, didonna said. i told her that if she needs to be told that she's loved to come back, and i'd give her a hug anytime she wanted.\n\ndidonna told the woman her name was april and the woman said her name was peggy.\n\nsince hugging her on october 2, didonna said peggy has been back to the wendy's about five times. more hugs have been shared.\n\nshe found the light after a time of darkness\n\npeggy's story was echoed in the facebook comments on the story first reported by local newspaper whidbey news-times\n\nwe love stopping through there when we're up on the north end and she makes us smile every time! a woman commented on the paper's facebook page . love you too april! you're the best!\n\nthere was a time, however, when didonna was in a dark place, she said. her husband died in 2019 and her life just turned upside down, she said.\n\ni was lost for a long time, didonna said. i was sad for a long time, but not anymore. there's so much light and i'm going to keep shining bright.\n\nthese days didonna tries to share her message of love with strangers daily, whether it's at the wendy's, when she is walking down the street or when she's at a store in town, she said.\n\nnowadays, some customers tell didonna they love her before they even order, she said.\n\ni love the people that i see every day, she said. there's just so much love now that i have that it's overflowing from me onto others.\n\nfor anyone left scarred by the many woes of 2020, didonna has a message of light.\n\n2021 is going to be a great year, didonna said. the universe is changing. everything's aligning.
washington (cnn) a second round of stimulus payments are on the way and many eligible families are expected to receive the money this month.\n\nthe first payments started going out on december 29 and will continue to be sent through january 15 . but anyone eligible who isn't automatically sent the money by then will have to claim it on their 2020 tax return, according to the internal revenue service.\n\ncongress included the $600 payments in a sweeping pandemic aid bill passed just before christmas. president donald trump stalled the bill, calling for $2,000 payments though he had largely left negotiations up to lawmakers and his treasury secretary steven mnuchin, then ultimately signed it into law after a week-long delay.\n\nthe money comes nearly eight months after the first round of stimulus payments, worth up to $1,200 per person, were sent as part of a larger coronavirus relief package passed last march. many of the same people will receive the money again, but there are some small eligibility differences.\n\nwhen and how will the money be sent?\n\nrecipients may have seen a direct deposit pending in their bank account as early as december 29, but the funds became officially available january 4.\n\npaper checks or debit cards will be sent to those who don't already have a bank account on file with the internal revenue service. checks also began going out last week.\n\nsome people may not receive the money the same way as in the first round. if you received a preloaded debit card last year, the payment will not be added to that card. you'll either receive a new card in the mail or a paper check.\n\nthe law requires the internal revenue service to stop issuing the payments after january 15. those not issued a payment by then will have wait to claim it on their 2020 tax return. the money will either increase your refund or reduce the taxes you owe. if the payment was sent to an old bank account, you will also have to wait to file your taxes in order to receive the money\n\npeople can check the status of both their first and second payments by using the internal revenue service's get my payment online tool\n\nwho is eligible?\n\neligibility is largely based on income. individuals earning less than $75,000 a year will receive the full $600. heads of household earning less than $112,500 and married couples filing jointly earning less than $150,000 are also due the full amount. they will receive $600 per child under the age of 17, which is $100 more than in the first round.\n\nthe payments start phasing out for people making more money, at a rate of $5 per $100 of additional income. some people who received the first payment may be phased out of the second round because the payments are smaller.\n\nthey will phase out entirely at $87,000 for single filers without children and $174,000 for those married filing jointly without children, according to an analysis by the tax foundation\n\nundocumented immigrants who don't have social security numbers remain ineligible for the payments. but in a change from the first round, their spouses and children are now eligible as long as they have social security numbers.\n\nthose who are claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return, like some college students, remain ineligible.\n\nlost your job? you may be able to claim more money\n\nboth the first and second round payments are based on 2019 adjust gross incomes. that means that someone who saw their income drastically fall in 2020 may be eligible for more money than they first received.\n\nif that's the case, they may claim a recovery rebate credit on their 2020 tax return. the credit eligibility and the credit amount will be based on the 2020 tax year income, according to the internal revenue service.\n\nthose who may have earned more in 2020 than 2019 are not required to pay back money they have already received.
conan o'brien's late night variety show conan is, contrary to reports, remaining nightly instead of going weekly. but it may not stay that way for long.\n\n[conan] has a very full plate in things that we're going to be going the next step on in the next six months, and that led him to ask me, 'well, how do we balance this with the talk show?' turner entertainment chief creative officer kevin reilly told variety thursday. he's going to have a show on tbs for many years to come. right now what form that takes in relation to these other endeavors is in flux. is going to once a week a possibility? it is. that's going to come from him when he's ready to get his hands around that.\n\nthe wrap reported earlier thursday that tbs is planning to retool... 'conan' to a weekly format instead of a nightly one. john martin, the ceo of turner -- which owns both tbs and cnn -- reportedly told the wrap that the move would be made, in part, due to an over-saturated late night lineup across tv.\n\nbut tbs put out a statement from reilly which suggested that if a move to a weekly format does happen, it won't be right now.\n\nas the media landscape continues to evolve, conan will continue to lead the evolution of what a talk show will be in the digital age. at this time, we have no plans to change the format or frequency of his popular tbs show, the statement said. in addition to conan's daily responsibilities to his talk show, we continue to have very ambitious plans that will further broaden and evolve our relationship with conan.\n\nreilly told the hollywood reporter that o'brien will continue to have a daily relationship with an audience. but, he said, i don't know whether that will be on a number of different services, including tbs. that's the part we're trying to figure out; how does that all work together?\n\nthe weekly format has worked for o'brien's talk show counterpart on tbs, samantha bee, whose full frontal stood out during the election.\n\no'brien's show currently ranks last among the major late night shows on broadcast and cable, averaging 597,000 viewers so far this season.\n\nconan premiered on tbs in 2010 following his short but much discussed stint as host of nbc's the tonight show.
michael moore: 'we're going to have the best chance with clark'\n\nmoore is the author of a book critical of president bush titled, dude, where's my country?\n\n(cnn) -- filmmaker and author michael moore, one of america's most outspoken liberals, has announced his choice for the democratic presidential nomination: retired gen. wesley clark.\n\nclark has been accused of being a republican in disguise. so what gets moore excited about clark? he discussed it with cnn anchor wolf blitzer.\n\nblitzer: i've got to tell you, michael, i was pretty surprised. why do you like wesley clark?\n\nmoore: first of all, i like him as a human being. i think he's a very decent and honorable person. i trust him. he seems very down to earth. and i like where he comes from. and, most of all, i think, as the new york times pointed out last week, he's actually slightly to the left of dean.\n\nand this is something i think a lot of people don't realize, especially probably a lot of young people. women, african-americans, labor people, should really take a close look at this guy, because i did and i really liked what i saw.\n\nblitzer: i read the article that you posted on your web site. i got the sense, though, that, for practical political reasons, the main reason you like wesley clark is that you think he can beat george w. bush more than the other democratic candidates.\n\nmoore: well, that is a very good reason. i think certainly you have the best chance with him.\n\nas you know, and you've pointed out many times, wolf, this election is going to really come down to 15 states and a few percentage points [in] those states. and you have to ask yourself, who has the best chance of winning these states, florida, west virginia, arizona, nevada, ohio, missouri? when you put it like that, i think he definitely has the best chance.\n\nbut it's not just a matter of strategy for me, because, honestly, i think, you know, other candidates could also beat bush. i think bush is beatable. that's my main position. and i'll support whoever the candidate is.\n\nmoore: but i think we're going to have the best chance with clark.\n\nbut my reasons for supporting him are the things that he stands for. he's going to end this war. he's going to change the tax rate, so that families of four who make under $50,000 a year are not going to have to pay federal income tax. and the rich are going to have to pay an extra 5 percent.\n\nblitzer: i also noticed in the article that you wrote, you -- explaining why you like wesley clark so much, you said this, he is clearly not from park avenue. well, we all know howard dean was born on park avenue. was that a swipe at howard dean? what do you have against howard dean?\n\nmoore: nothing.\n\nit was more what i have against park avenue. it was not meant to be a swipe at dean. look, i think dean's a good guy. what's really been decent about wesley clark is that he's not participated in this kind of mud-slinging that the other candidates have.\n\nand i think i'd like to participate in that tone and not throw mud at dean and not bring up things that i think -- look, you could say so many things about any of the candidates, how -- positions they've taken that i don't like or haven't liked in the past, how they've changed their minds, things they've been involved in.\n\nwhen i hear dean say that he won't cut a dime out of the pentagon budget, that's inexcusable. but i also believe he's the kind of person you could possibly move along some day to a better position. so...\n\nblitzer: i want you to clarify another thing you said that was intriguing to me in the piece. you said, i will work enthusiastically for any of the non-lieberman eight who might get the nomination.\n\nmoore: yes.\n\nblitzer: now, what exactly does that mean?\n\nmoore: well, for a long time, i've been in the anyone-but-lieberman camp. and i think a lot of people are in that same camp.\n\nthe point being is that the other candidates -- of course, now with moseley braun out, it's now the non-lieberman seven -- all the democrats running, you could say something good about all of them. they all have good position on many of the issues. we're very fortunate this year to have this crop of candidates.\n\ni just happen to think clark is the best among them, best on the issues, best for the working people of this country, best to end this war, and the best to communicate this message to where i come from, in middle america.\n\nthis is a gift that the democratic party has been given. we have a four-star general, top of his class at west point, a rhodes scholar. and he's going to go out there and tell middle america what we need to do in terms of cutting the pentagon budget, of standing up for the rights of working people, affirmative action, nondiscrimination against gays and lesbians.\n\nmoore: go down the whole list, he's extremely strong on these issues.\n\nblitzer: i assume if lieberman for some reason were to get the nomination, you would support him, though, over bush, is that right?\n\nmoore: it would take a lot of medication, wolf.\n\nblitzer: what do you have against joe lieberman?\n\nmoore: well, he's running in the wrong party. lieberman is kind of like a liberal to moderate republican. you know, he's bush-light. and god bless him, but he just doesn't really belong in this party.\n\nblitzer: all right, michael moore explaining why he likes wesley clark so much. thanks for joining us.\n\nmoore: thank you for having me on.\n\nblitzer: you and madonna now are in the same camp.\n\nmoore: hey, just to hear those two names in the same sentence, you've made my day, wolf.\n\nblitzer: michael moore and madonna both support wesley clark.
katherine klein is the edward h. bowman professor of management at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania. shoshana schwartz is a doctoral candidate in the management department at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania. sandra maro hunt is a senior director at the wharton social impact initiative.\n\ncbs' former chief executive les moonves is out. charged with sexual misconduct and a failure to cooperate with investigators, he has been terminated for cause and denied his $120 million severance.\n\ngiven the steady drumbeat of #metoo stories over the past year, the news from cbs is depressingly familiar. so, it's not surprising that a growing number of investors are interested in screening companies on their treatment of the women they employ.\n\nfor many, the goal is not just to avoid investing in companies that are bad for women. they'd like to invest in companies that are actually good for women.\n\nbut finding these companies is a challenge — not because they don't exist, but because investors too often rely on inadequate metrics.\n\nyou can't identify companies that are good employers for women simply by counting the number of women on a company's board or in its c-suite.\n\nsome studies find that when women hold positions of power, they foster positive working conditions — better pay, more promotions — for women lower in the company. but other equally rigorous studies find no evidence for this claim.\n\nyou can't identify companies that are good employers for women simply by counting the number of women on a company's board or in its c-suite. katherine klein, shoshana schwartz, sandra maro hunt\n\nwe reviewed hundreds of academic studies to identify the markers that distinguish the best employers for women. here's what we learned: to determine if a company is really a good employer for women, take a hard look at the representation, pay, health and satisfaction of the women who work there.\n\ncompanies that get these four fundamentals right are not just trying to be good employers for women, they're succeeding. and they are not just good employers for women, they're good employers for men, too.\n\nthe four fundamentals aren't difficult to measure. the problem is that very few companies share the information necessary to do so. but, if investors start asking for this information, that could change.\n\nrepresentation\n\na company can't be a good employer for women if it employs few or no women. it's not that such a company is necessarily a bad place for women to work. but, at best, it's a company with a limited record of hiring, retaining and promoting women. if you're looking to invest in companies that are good for women, it makes sense to invest in companies that employ a large percentage of women.\n\nit's not enough, though, for a company to employ a large percentage of women if women work exclusively at the lowest levels of the company or in a few silos. when this is the case, as it often is, women are denied the influence, opportunities and resources available to employees in more prestigious and diverse roles in the company.\n\namong the s&p 500 companies , nearly 45% of employees are women. but, women represent just 37% of first and middle-level managers, 27% of executives and senior-level managers, and 5% of ceos.\n\nand though women hold 52% of management, professional and related jobs in the united states, that number masks considerable gender-based occupational segregation. women represent 85% of meeting, convention and event planners and 72% of human resource managers, but just 19% of software developers and 9% of mechanical engineers. you can guess which roles come with more power, prestige and pay.\n\nto measure women's representation, compare the percentage of men and women in every quartile of the company's pay. the larger the percentage of women in every quartile — especially the upper quartiles, where women are most often underrepresented — the more likely the company is to be a good employer for women.\n\npay\n\nwomen in the united states are poorer than men. last year, 9.4% of men and 13% of women fell below the poverty level . and poverty takes a toll: it increases one's likelihood of disease, reduces life expectancy, and increases one's exposure to violence.\n\nso, pay matters — a lot.\n\na good employer pays its employees at least enough to live above the poverty line, and ideally much more. and of course, a good employer pays women and men equally for equal work. it's the law and it's only fair.\n\nstill, a company can pay men and women equally for equal work but pay women — on average — a lot less than men. that happens when women are underrepresented at the top.\n\nif you really want to understand how well a company pays women, look at the gender pay gap: the difference between a company's average compensation for men and for women.\n\nus employers aren't required to report their gender pay gap publicly, and few do. but, the uk government requires employers with 250 employees or more to report these numbers.\n\nof the more than 10,000 uk employers that reported their gender pay gaps in 2018, a whopping 78% had a median gender pay gap favoring men . it's safe to guess that the numbers in the united states would be similar.\n\nhealth\n\ngood employers for women provide paid maternity leave. but unlike the other 35 countries in the organisation for economic co-operation and development, the united states does not require that employers provide paid maternity leave. in 2016, only 13% of employees who worked in private industry in the united states had access to paid family leave.\n\ngood employers for women also limit employees' exposure to stress and sexual harassment. workplace stressors — layoffs, long and unpredictable work hours, micromanagement and excessive job demands — increase employees' risk of depression, anxiety, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and death.\n\nsexual harassment has much the same effect. the greater the sexual harassment a women experiences on the job, the more likely she is to suffer declines in job satisfaction, work performance and mental and physical health. anonymous surveys that assess employees' experiences of sexual harassment behaviors provide the most valid metric around how common it is.\n\nsatisfaction\n\nwe spend about a fifth of our waking lives at work. those hours should be a source of satisfaction — not stress, boredom and frustration.\n\nstudies show that when employees report their job satisfaction, they reflect on the aspects of the job that are most important to them — their work, boss, coworkers, stress, pay and more. this makes a company's average job satisfaction — what some people call employee morale — a simple and valuable metric to assess, in broad terms, what it's like to work at the company.

and alex and cleta mitchell — who is not the attorney of record but has been involved — myself and then the president. so mr. president, i'll turn it over to you.\n\ntrump: ok, thank you very much. hello brad and ryan and everybody. we appreciate the time and the call. so we've spent a lot of time on this and if we could just go over some of the numbers, i think it's pretty clear that we won. we won very substantially in georgia. you even see it by rally size, frankly. we'd be getting 25-30,000 people a rally and the competition would get less than 100 people. and it never made sense.\n\nbut we have a number of things. we have at least 2 or 3 — anywhere from 250-300,000 ballots were dropped mysteriously into the rolls. much of that had to do with fulton county, which hasn't been checked. we think that if you check the signatures — a real check of the signatures going back in fulton county you'll find at least a couple of hundred thousand of forged signatures of people who have been forged. and we are quite sure that's going to happen.\n\nanother tremendous number. we're going to have an accurate number over the next two days with certified accountants. but an accurate number but its in the 50s of thousands— and that's people that went to vote and they were told they can't vote because they've already been voted for. and it's a very sad thing. they walked out complaining. but the number's large. we'll have it for you. but it's much more than the number of 11,779 that's — the current margin is only 11,779. brad, i think you agree with that, right? that's something i think everyone — at least that's' a number that everyone agrees on.\n\nbut that's the difference in the votes. but we've had hundreds of thousands of ballots that we're able to actually — we'll get you a pretty accurate number. you don't need much of a number because the number that in theory i lost by, the margin would be 11,779. but you also have a substantial numbers of people, thousands and thousands who went to the voting place on november 3, were told they couldn't vote, were told they couldn't vote because a ballot had been put on their name. and you know that's very, very, very, very sad.\n\nwe had, i believe it's about 4,502 voters who voted but who weren't on the voter registration list, so it's 4,502 who voted but they weren't on the voter registration roll which they had to be. you had 18,325 vacant address voters. the address was vacant and they're not allowed to be counted. that's 18,325.\n\nsmaller number — you had 904 who only voted where they had just a p.o. — a post office box number — and they had a post office box number and that's not allowed. we had at least 18,000 — that's on tape we had them counted very painstakingly — 18,000 voters having to do with [name]. she's a vote scammer, a professional vote scammer and hustler [name]. that was the tape that's been shown all over the world that makes everybody look bad, you me and everybody else.\n\nwhere they got — number one they said very clearly and it's been reported they said there was a major water main break. everybody fled the area. and then they came back, [name] and her daughter and a few people. there were no republican poll watchers. actually, there were no democrat poll watchers, i guess they were them. but there were no democrats, either and there was no law enforcement. late in the morning, they went early in the morning they went to the table with the black robe, the black shield and they pulled out the votes. those votes were put there a number of hours before the table was put there. i think it was, brad you would know, it was probably eight hours or seven hours before and then it was stuffed with votes.\n\nthey weren't in an official voter box, but they were in what looked to be suitcases or trunks, suitcases but they weren't in voter boxes. the minimum number it could be because we watched it and they watched it certified in slow motion instant replay if you can believe it but slow motion and it was magnified many times over and the minimum it was 18,000 ballots, all for biden.\n\nyou had out-of-state voters. they voted in georgia but they were from out of state, of 4,925. you had absentee ballots sent to vacant, they were absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses. they had nothing on them about addresses, that's 2,326.\n\nand you had drop boxes, which is very bad. you had drop boxes that were picked up. we have photographs and we have affidavits from many people.\n\ni don't know if you saw the hearings, but you have drop boxes where the box was picked up but not delivered for three days. so all sorts of things could have happened to that box including, you know, putting in the votes that you wanted. so there were many infractions and the bottom line is, many, many times the 11,779 margin that they said we lost by — we had vast i mean the state is in turmoil over this.\n\nand i know you would like to get to the bottom of it, although i saw you on television today and you said that you found nothing wrong. i mean, you know, and i didn't lose the state, brad. people have been saying that it was the highest vote ever. there was no way. a lot of the political people said that there's no way they beat me. and they beat me. they beat me in the ... as you know, every single state ... we won every state. we one every statehouse in the country. we held the senate which is shocking to people, although we'll see what happens tomorrow or in a few days.\n\nand we won the house, but we won every single statehouse and we won congress, which was supposed to lose 15 seats, and they gained, i think 16 or 17 or something. i think there's a now difference of five. there was supposed to be a difference substantially more. but politicians in every state, but politicians in georgia have given affidavits or are going to that, that there was no way that they beat me in the election that the people came out, in fact, they were expecting to lose and then they ended up winning by a lot because of the coattails. and they said there's no way that they've done many polls prior to the election. there was no way that they won.\n\nballots were dropped in massive numbers. and we're trying to get to those numbers and we will have them.\n\nthey'll take a period of time. certified. but but they're massive numbers. and far greater than the 11,779.\n\nthe other thing, dead people. so dead people voted and i think the number is close to 5,000 people. and they went to obituaries. they went to all sorts of methods to come up with an accurate number and a minimum is close to about 5,000 voters.\n\nthe bottom line is when you add it all up and then you start adding, you know, 300,000 fake ballots. then the other thing they said is in fulton county and other areas. and this may or may not ... because this just came up this morning that they are burning their ballots, that they are shredding, shredding ballots and removing equipment. they're changing the equipment on the dominion machines and, you know, that's not legal.\n\nand they supposedly shredded i think they said 300 pounds of, 3,000 pounds of ballots. and that just came to us as a report today. and it is a very sad situation.\n\nbut brad, if you took the minimum numbers where many, many times above the 11,779 and many of those numbers are certified, or they will be certified but they are certified. and those are numbers that are there that exist. and that beat the margin of loss, they beat it, i mean by a lot and people should be happy to have an accurate count instead of an election where there's turmoil.\n\ni mean there's turmoil in georgia and other places. you're not the only one i mean we have other states that i believe will be flipping to us very shortly. and this is something that — you know, as an example, i think it in detroit, i think there's a section a good section of your state actually, which we're not sure so we're not going to report it yet. but in detroit, we had, i think it was, 139% of the people voted. that's not too good.\n\nin pennsylvania, they had well over 200,000 more votes than they had people voting. and uh that doesn't play too well, and the legislature there is, which is republican, is extremely activist and angry. i mean, there were other things also that were almost as bad as that. but, uh, they had as an example, in michigan, a tremendous number of dead people that voted. i think it was i think, mark, it was 18,000. some unbelievably high number, much higher than yours, you were in the 4-5,000 category.\n\nand that was checked out laboriously by going through, by going through the obituary columns in the newspapers.\n\nso i guess with all of it being said, brad, the bottom line and provisional ballots, again, you know, you'll have to tell me about the provisional ballots, but we have a lot of people that were complaining that they weren't able to vote because they were already voted for. these are great people.\n\nand, you know, they were shellshocked. i don't know if you call that provisional ballots. in some states we had a lot of provisional ballot situations where people were given a provisional ballot because when they walked in on november 3 and they were already voted for.\n\nso that's it. i mean, we have many many times the number of votes necessary to win the state. and we won the state and we won it very substantially and easily and we're getting, we have, much of this is a very, you know they're certified, far more certified than we need. but we're getting additional numbers certified, too. and we're getting pictures of dropboxes being delivered and delivered late. delivered three days later, in some cases, plus we have many affidavits to that effect.\n\nmeadows: so mr. president, if i might be able to jump in and i'll give brad a chance. mr. secretary, obviously there is, there are allegations where we believe that not every vote or fair vote and legal vote was counted and that's at odds with the representation from the secretary of state's office.\n\nwhat i'm hopeful for is there some way that we can we can find some kind of agreement to look at this a little bit more fully. you know the president mentioned fulton county.\n\nbut in some of these areas where there seems to be a difference of where the facts seem to lead, and so mr. secretary, i was hopeful that, you know, in the spirit of cooperation and compromise is there something that we can at least have a discussion to look at some of these allegations to find a path forward that's less litigious?\n\nraffensperger: well, i listened to what the president has just said. president trump, we've had several lawsuits and we've had to respond in court to the lawsuits and the contentions. um, we don't agree that you have won. and we don't — i didn't agree about the 200,000 number that you'd mentioned. and i can go through that point by point.\n\nwhat we have done is we gave our state senate about one and a half hours of our time going through the election issue by issue and then on the state house, the government affairs committee, we gave them about two and a half hours of our time, going back point by point on all the issues of contention. and then just a few days ago we met with our u.s. congressmen, republican congressmen, and we gave them about two hours of our time talking about this past election. going back, primarily what you've talked about here focused in on primarily, i believe, is the absentee ballot process. i don't believe that you're really questioning the dominion machines. because we did a hand retally, a 100% retally of all the ballots and compared them to what the machines said and came up with virtually the same result. then we did the recount, and we got virtually the same result. so i guess we can probably take that off the table.\n\ni don't think there's an issue about that. what you--\n\ntrump: well, brad. not that there's not an issue, because we have a big issue with dominion in other states and perhaps in yours. but we haven't felt we needed to go there. and just to, you know, maybe put a little different spin on what mark is saying, mark meadows, uh, yeah we'd like to go further, but we don't really need to. we have all the votes we need.\n\nyou know, we won the state. if you took, these are the most minimal numbers, the numbers that i gave you, those are numbers that are certified, your absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses, your out of state voters 4,925. you know when you add them up, it's many more times, it's many times the 11,779 number. so we could go through, we have not gone through your dominion. so we can't give them blessing. i mean, in other states, we think we found tremendous corruption with dominion machines but we'll have to see.\n\nbut we only lost the state by that number, 11,000 votes, and 779. so with that being said, with just what we have, with just what we have we're giving you minimal, minimal numbers. we're doing the most conservative numbers possible, we're many times, many, many times above the margin. and so we don't really have to, mark, i don't think we have to go through ...\n\nmeadows: right\n\ntrump: because, what's the difference between winning the election by two votes and winning it by half a million votes. i think i probably did win it by half a million. you know, one of the things that happened brad, is we have other people coming in now from alabama and from south carolina and from other states, and they're saying it's impossible for you to have lost georgia. we won. you know in alabama, we set a record, got the highest vote ever. in georgia, we set a record with a massive amount of votes. and they say it's not possible to have lost georgia.\n\nand i could tell you by our rallies. i could tell you by the rally i'm having on monday night, the place, they already have lines of people standing out front waiting. it's just not possible to have lost georgia. it's not possible. when i heard it was close i said there's no way. but they dropped a lot of votes in there late at night. you know that, brad. and that's what we are working on very, very stringently. but regardless of those votes, with all of it being said, we lost by essentially 11,000 votes and we have many more votes already calculated and certified, too.\n\nand so i just don't know, you know, mark, i don't know what's the purpose. i won't give dominion a pass because we found too many bad things. but we don't need dominion or anything else. we have won this election in georgia based on all of this. and there's nothing wrong with saying that, brad. you know i mean, having the correct — the people of georgia are angry. and these numbers are going to be repeated on monday night. along with others that we're going to have by that time which are much more substantial even. and the people of georgia are angry, the people of the country are angry. and there's nothing wrong with saying, you know, um, that you've recalculated. because the 2,236 in absentee ballots. i mean, they're all exact numbers that were done by accounting firms law firms, etc. and even if you cut 'em in half, cut 'em in half and cut 'em in half, again, it's more votes than we need.\n\nraffensperger: well mr. president, the challenge that you have is, the data you have is wrong. we talked to the congressmen and they were surprised.\n\nbut they — i guess there was a person mr. braynard who came to these meetings and presented data and he said that there was dead people, i believe it was upward of 5,000. the actual number were two. two. two people that were dead that voted. so that's wrong. there were two.\n\ntrump: well cleta, how do you respond to that? maybe you tell me?\n\nmitchell: well, i would say mr. secretary, one of the things that we have requested and what we said was, if you look, if you read our petition, it said that we took the names and birth years and we had certain information available to us. we have asked from your office for records that only you have and so we said there is a universe of people who have the same name and same birth year and died.\n\nbut we don't have the records that you have. and one of the things that we have been suggesting formally and informally for weeks now is for you to make available to us the records that would be necessary —\n\ntrump: but cleta, even before you do that, and not even including that, that's why hardly even included that number, although in one state we have a tremendous amount of dead people. so i don't know — i'm sure we do in georgia, too. i'm sure we do in georgia too.\n\nbut, um, we're so far ahead. we're so far ahead of these numbers, even the phony ballots of [name], known scammer. you know the internet? you know what was trending on the internet? where's [name]? because they thought she'd be in jail. where's [name]? it's crazy, it's crazy. that was. the minimum number is 18,000 for [name], but they think it's probably about 56,000, but the minimum number is 18,000 on the [name] night where she ran back in there when everybody was gone and stuffed, she stuffed the ballot boxes. let's face it, brad, i mean. they did it in slow motion replay magnified, right? she stuffed the ballot boxes. they were stuffed like nobody had ever seen them stuffed before.\n\nso there's a term for it when it's a machine instead of a ballot box, but she stuffed the machine. she stuffed the ballot — each ballot went three times they were showing: here's ballot no 1. here it is second time, third time, next ballot.\n\ni mean, look. brad. we have a new tape that we're going to release. it's devastating. and by the way, that one event, that one event is much more than the 11,000 votes that we're talking about. it's uh, you know. that one event was a disaster. and it's just, you know, but it was, it was something, it can't be disputed. and again we have a version that you haven't seen but it's magnified. it's magnified and you can see everything. for some reason they put it in three times, each ballot, and i don't know why. i don't know why three times. why not five times, right? go ahead.\n\nraffensperger: you're talking about the state farm video. and i think it's extremely unfortunate that rudy giuliani or his people, they sliced and diced that video and took it out of context. the next day we brought in wsb-tv and we let them show, see the full run of tape and what you'll see, the events that transpired are nowhere near what was projected by, you know —\n\ntrump: but where were the poll watchers, brad? there were no poll watchers there. there were no democrats or republicans. there was no security there.\n\nit was late in the evening, late in the, early in the morning, and there was nobody else in the room. where were the poll watchers and why did they say a water main broke, which they did and which was reported in the newspapers? they said they left. they ran out because of a water main break, and there was no water main. there was nothing. there was no break. there was no water main break. but we're, if you take out everything, where were the republican poll watchers, even where were the democrat poll watchers, because there were none.\n\nand then you say, well, they left their station, you know, if you look at the tape, and this was, this was reviewed by professional police and detectives and other people, when they left in a rush, everybody left in a rush because of the water main, but everybody left in a rush. these people left their station.\n\nwhen they came back, they didn't go to their station. they went to the apron, wrapped around the table, under which were thousands and thousands of ballots in a box that was not an official or a sealed box. and then they took those. they went back to a different station. so if they would have come back, they would have walked to their station and they would have continued to work. but they couldn't do even that because that's illegal, because they had no republican poll watchers. and remember, her reputation is deva — she's known all over the internet, brad. she's known all over.\n\ni'm telling you, where's [name] was one of the hot items ...[name] they knew her. where's [name]? so brad, there can be no justification for that. and i you know, i give everybody the benefit of the doubt. but that was — and brad, why did they put the votes in three times? you know, they put 'em in three times.\n\nraffensperger: mr. president, they did not put that. we did an audit of that and we proved conclusively that they were not scanned three times.\n\ntrump: where was everybody else at that late time in the morning? where was everybody? where were the republicans? where were the security guards? where were the people that were there just a little while before when everyone ran out of the room. how come we had no security in the room? why did they run to the bottom of the table? why do they run there and just open the skirt and rip out the votes? i mean, brad. and they were sitting there, i think for five hours or something like that, the votes. but they just all happened to run back and go, you know, brad...\n\nraffensperger: mr. president, we'll send you the link from wsb.\n\ntrump: i don't care about the link. i don't need it. brad, i have a much better link —\n\nmitchell: i will tell you. i've seen the tape. the full tape. so has alex. we've watched it. and what we saw and what we've confirmed in the timing is that. they made everybody leave, we have sworn affidavits saying that. and then they began to process ballots. and our estimate is that there were roughly 18,000 ballots. we don't know that. if you know that ...\n\ntrump: it was 18,000 ballots but they used each one three times.\n\nmitchell: well, i don't know about that.\n\ntrump: i do think because we had ours magnified out. each one magnified out is 18 times three\n\nmitchell: i've watched the entire tape.\n\ntrump: nobody can make a case for that, brad. nobody. i mean, look, you'd have to be a child to think anything other than that. just a child. i mean you have your never trumper...\n\nmitchell: how many ballots, mr. secretary, are you saying were processed then?\n\nraffensperger: we had gbi ... investigate that.\n\ngermany: we had our — this is ryan germany. we had our law enforcement officers talk to everyone who was who was there after that event came to light. gbi was with them as well as fbi agents.\n\ntrump: well, there's no way they could — then they're incompetent. they're either dishonest or incompetent, okay?\n\nmitchell: well, what did they find?\n\ntrump: there's only two answers, dishonesty or incompetence. there's just no way. look. there's no way. and on the other thing, i said too, there is no way. i mean, there's no way that these things could have been you know, you have all these different people that voted but they don't live in georgia anymore. what was that number, cleta? that was a pretty good number too.\n\nmitchell: the number who have registered out of state after they moved from georgia. and so they had a date when they moved from georgia, they registered to vote out of state. and then it's like 4,500, i don't have that number right in front of me.\n\ntrump: and then they came back in and they voted.\n\nmitchell: and voted. yeah.\n\ntrump: i thought that was a large number, though. it was in the 20s. the point is...\n\ngermany: we've been going through each of those as well and those numbers that we got that ms. mitchell was just saying, they're not accurate. every one we've been through, are people that lived in georgia, moved to a different state, but then moved back to georgia legitimately. and in many cases\n\ntrump: how many people do that? they moved out and then they said, ah, to hell with it i'll move back. you know, it doesn't sound like a very normal ... you mean, they moved out, and what, they missed it so much that they wanted to move back in? it's crazy.\n\ngermany: this is they moved back in years ago. this was not like something just before the election. so there's something about that data that, it's just not accurate.\n\ntrump: well, i don't know, all i know is that it is certified. and they moved out of georgia and they voted. it didn't say they moved back in cleta, did it?\n\nmitchell: no, but i mean, we're looking at the voter registration. again, if you have additional records, we've been asking for that, but you haven't shared any of that with us. you just keep saying you investigated the allegations.\n\ntrump: but, cleta, a lot of it you don't need to be shared. i mean, to be honest, they should share it. they should share it because you want to get to an honest election.\n\ni won this election by hundreds of thousands of votes. there's no way i lost georgia. there's no way. we won by hundreds of thousands of votes. i'm just going by small numbers when you add them up they're many times the 11,000. but i won that state by hundreds of thousands of votes.\n\ndo you think it's possible that they shredded ballots in fulton county? because that's what the rumor is. and also that dominion took out machines. that dominion is really moving fast to get rid of their, uh, machinery.\n\ndo you know anything about that? because that's illegal, right?\n\ngermany: this is ryan germany. no, dominion has not moved any machinery out of fulton county.\n\ntrump: but have they moved the inner parts of the machines and replaced them with other parts?\n\ngermany: no.\n\ntrump: are you sure, ryan?\n\ngermany: i'm sure. i'm sure, mr. president.\n\ntrump: what about, what about the ballots. the shredding of the ballots. have they been shredding ballots?\n\ngermany: the only investigation that we have into that — they have not been shredding any ballots. there was an issue in cobb county where they were doing normal office shredding, getting rid of old stuff, and we investigated that. but this is stuff from, you know, from you know past elections.\n\ntrump: i don't know. it doesn't pass the smell test because we hear they're shredding thousands and thousands of ballots and now what they're saying, oh, we're just cleaning up the office. so i don't think they're cleaning.\n\nraffensperger: mr. president, the problem you have with social media, they — people can say anything.\n\ntrump: oh this isn't social media. this is trump media. it's not social media. it's really not it's not social media. i don't care about social media. i couldn't care less. social media is big tech. big tech is on your side. i don't even know why you have a side, because you should want to have an accurate election. and you're a republican.\n\nraffensperger: we believe that we do have an accurate election.\n\ntrump: no, no you don't. no, no you don't. you don't have. not even close. you're off by hundreds of thousands of votes. and just on the small numbers, you're off on these numbers and these numbers can't be just — well, why wont? — okay. so you sent us into cobb county for signature verification, right? you sent us into cobb county, which we didn't want to go into. and you said it would be open to the public. and we could have our - so we had our experts there they weren't allowed into the room. but we didn't want cobb county. we wanted fulton county. and you wouldn't give it to us. now, why aren't we doing signature — and why can't it be open to the public?\n\nand why can't we have professionals do it instead of rank amateurs who will never find anything and don't want to find anything? they don't want to find, you know, they don't want to find anything. someday you'll tell me the reason why, because i don't understand your reasoning, but someday you'll tell me the reason why. but why don't you want to find?\n\ngermany: mr. president, we chose cobb county —\n\ntrump: why don't you want to find ... what?\n\ngermany: sorry, go ahead.\n\ntrump: so why did you do cobb county? we didn't even request — we requested fulton county, not cobb county. go ahead, please. go ahead.\n\ngermany: we chose cobb county because that was the only county where there's been any evidence submitted that the signature verification was not properly done.\n\ntrump: no, but i told you. we're not, we're not saying that.\n\nmitchell: we did say that.\n\ntrump: fulton county. look. stacey, in my opinion, stacey is as dishonest as they come. she has outplayed you ... at everything. she got you to sign a totally unconstitutional agreement, which is a disastrous agreement. you can't check signatures. i can't imagine you're allowed to do harvesting, i guess, in that agreement. that agreement is a disaster for this country. but she got you somehow to sign that thing and she has outsmarted you at every step.\n\nand i hate to imagine what's going to happen on monday or tuesday, but it's very scary to people. you know, where the ballots flow in out of nowhere. it's very scary to people. that consent decree is a disaster. it's a disaster. a very good lawyer who examined it said they've never seen anything like it.\n\nraffensperger: harvesting is still illegal in the state of georgia. and that settlement agreement did not change that one iota.\n\ntrump: it's not a settlement agreement, it's a consent decree. it even says consent decree on it, doesn't it? it uses the term consent decree. it doesn't say settlement agree. it's a consent decree. it's a disaster.\n\nraffensperger: it's a settlement agreement.\n\ntrump: what's written on top of it?\n\nraffensperger: ryan?\n\ngermany: i don't have it in front of me, but it was not entered by the court, it's not a court order.\n\ntrump: but ryan, it's called a consent decree, is that right? on the paper. is that right?\n\ngermany: i don't. i don't. i don't believe so, but i don't have it in front of me.\n\ntrump: ok, whatever, it's a disaster. it's a disaster. look. here's the problem. we can go through signature verification and we'll find hundreds of thousands of signatures, if you let us do it. and the only way you can do it, as you know, is to go to the past. but you didn't do that in cobb county. you just looked at one page compared to another. the only way you can do a signature verification is go from the one that signed it on november whatever. recently. and compare it to two years ago, four years ago, six years ago, you know, or even one. and you'll find that you have many different signatures. but in fulton, where they dumped ballots, you will find that you have many that aren't even signed and you have many that are forgeries.\n\nok, you know that. you know that. you have no doubt about that. and you will find you will be at 11,779 within minutes, because fulton county is totally corrupt and so is she, totally corrupt.\n\nand they're going around playing you and laughing at you behind your back, brad, whether you know it or not, they're laughing at you and you've taken a state that's a republican state, and you've made it almost impossible for a republican to win because of cheating, because they cheated like nobody's ever cheated before. and i don't care how long it takes me, you know, we're going to have other states coming forward — pretty good.\n\nbut i won't ... this is never ... this is ... we have some incredible talent said they've never seen anything ... now the problem is they need more time for the big numbers. but they're very substantial numbers. but i think you're going to find that they — by the way, a little information, i think you're going to find that they are shredding ballots because they have to get rid of the ballots because the ballots are unsigned. the ballots are corrupt, and they're brand new and they don't have a seal and there's the whole thing with the ballots. but the ballots are corrupt.\n\nand you are going to find that they are — which is totally illegal, it is more illegal for you than it is for them because, you know what they did and you're not reporting it. that's a criminal, that's a criminal offense. and you can't let that happen. that's a big risk to you and to ryan, your lawyer. and that's a big risk. but they are shredding ballots, in my opinion, based on what i've heard. and they are removing machinery and they're moving it as fast as they can, both of which are criminal finds. and you can't let it happen and you are letting it happen. you know, i mean, i'm notifying you that you're letting it happen. so look. all i want to do is this. i just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.\n\nand flipping the state is a great testament to our country because, cause you know, this is — it's a testament that they can admit to a mistake or whatever you want to call it. if it was a mistake, i don't know. a lot of people think it wasn't a mistake. it was much more criminal than that. but it's a big problem in georgia and it's not a problem that's going away. i mean, you know, it's not a problem that's going away.\n\ngermany: mr president, this is ryan. we're looking into every one of those things that you mentioned.\n\ntrump: good. but if you find it you've got to say it, ryan.\n\ngermany: ... let me tell you what we are seeing. what we're seeing is not at all what you're describing, these are investigators from our office, these are investigators from\n\ngbi, and they're looking and they're good. and that's not what they're seeing. and we'll keep looking, at all these things.\n\ntrump: well, you better check the ballots because they are shredding ballots, ryan. i'm just telling you, ryan. they're shredding ballots. and you should look at that very carefully. because that's so illegal. you know, you may not even believe it because it's so bad. but they're shredding ballots because they think we're going to eventually get ... because we'll eventually get into fulton. in my opinion it's never too late. ... so, that's the story. look, we need only 11,000 votes. we have are far more than that as it stands now. we'll have more and more. and. do you have provisional ballots at all, brad? provisional ballots?\n\nraffensperger: provisional ballots are allowed by state law.\n\ntrump: sure, but i mean, are they counted or did you just hold them back because they, you know, in other words, how many provisional ballots do you have in the state?\n\nraffensperger: we'll get you that number.\n\ntrump: because most of them are made out to the name trump. because these are people that were scammed when they came in. and we have thousands of people that have testified or that want to testify when they came in they were probably going to vote on november 3. and they were told i'm sorry, you've already been voted for, you've already voted. the women, men started screaming, no. i proudly voted til november 3. they said, i'm sorry, but you've already been voted for and you have a ballot and these people are beside themselves. so they went out and they filled in a provisional ballot, putting the name trump on it.\n\nand what about that batch of military ballots that came in. and even though i won the military by a lot, it was 100 percent trump. i mean 100 percent biden. do you know about that? a large group of ballots came in. i think it was to fulton county and they just happened to be 100 percent for trump — for biden, even though trump won the military by a lot, you know, a tremendous amount. but these ballots were 100 percent for biden. and, do you know about that? a very substantial number came in, all for biden. does anybody know about it?\n\nmitchell: i know about it, but —\n\ntrump: ok, cleta, i'm not asking you cleta, honestly. i'm asking brad. do you know about the military ballots that we have confirmed now. do you know about the military ballots that came in that were 100 percent, i mean 100 percent for biden. do you know about that?\n\ngermany: i don't know about that, i do know that we have when military ballots come in, it's not just military, it's also military and overseas citizens. the military part of that does generally go republican. the overseas citizen part of it generally goes very democrat. this was a mix of 'em.\n\ntrump: no, but this was. that's ok. but i got like 78 percent in the military. these ballots were all for ... they didn't tell me overseas. could be overseas too, but i get votes overseas too, ryan, you know in all fairness. no they came in, a large batch came in and it was, quote, 100 percent for biden. and that is criminal. you know, that's criminal. ok. that's another criminal, that's another of the many criminal events, many criminal events here.\n\noh, i don't know, look brad. i got to get ... i have to find 12,000 votes and i have them times a lot. and therefore, i won the state. that's before we go to the next step, which is in the process of right now. you know, and i watched you this morning and you said, uh, well, there was no criminality.\n\nbut i mean, all of this stuff is very dangerous stuff. when you talk about no criminality, i think it's very dangerous for you to say that.\n\ni just, i just don't know why you don't want to have the votes counted as they are. like even you when you went and did that check. and i was surprised because, you know ...the check... and we found a few thousand votes that were against me. i was actually surprised because the way that check was done, all you're doing is you know, recertifying existing votes and, you know, and you were given votes and you just counted them up and you still found 3,000 that were bad. so that was sort of surprising that it came down to three or five i don't know. still a lot of votes. but you have to go back to check from past years with respect to signatures. and if you check with fulton county, you'll have hundreds of thousands because they dumped ballots into fulton county and the other county next to it.\n\nso what are we going to do here folks? i only need 11,000 votes. fellas, i need 11,000 votes. give me a break. you know, we have that in spades already. or we can keep it going but that's not fair to the voters of georgia because they're going to see what happened and they're going to see what happened. i mean, i'll, i'll take on to anybody you want with regard to [name] and her lovely daughter, a very lovely young lady, i'm sure. but, but [name] ... i will take on anybody you want. and the minimum, there were 18,000 ballots but they used them three times. so that's, you know, a lot of votes. ...and that one event... and they were all to biden, by the way, that's the other thing we didn't say. you know, [name] , the one thing i forgot to say which was the most important. you know that every single ballot she did went to biden. you know that, right? do you know that, by the way, brad?\n\nevery single ballot that she did through the machines at early, early in the morning, went to biden. did you know that, ryan?\n\ngermany: that's not accurate, mr. president.\n\ntrump: huh. what is accurate?\n\ngermany: the numbers that we are showing are accurate.\n\ntrump: no, about [name] . about early in the morning, ryan. when the woman took, you know, when the whole gang took the stuff from under the table, right? do you know, do you know who those ballots, who they were made out to, do you know who they were voting for?\n\ngermany: no, not specifically.\n\ntrump: did you ever check?\n\ngermany: we did what i described to you earlier —\n\ntrump: no no no — did you ever check the ballots that were scanned by [name] , a known political operative and balloteer. did ever check who those votes were for?\n\ngermany: we looked into that situation that you described.\n\ntrump: no, they were 100 percent for biden. 100 percent. there wasn't a trump vote in the whole group. why don't you want to find this, ryan? what's wrong with you? i heard your lawyer is very difficult, actually, but i'm sure you're a good lawyer. you have a nice last name.\n\nbut, but i'm just curious why wouldn't, why do you keep fighting this thing? it just doesn't make sense. we're way over the 17,779, right? we're way over that number and just if you took just [name] , we're over that number by five, five or six times when you multiply that times three.\n\nand every single ballot went to biden, and you didn't know that, but, now you know it. so tell me, brad, what are we going to do? we won the election and it's not fair to take it away from us like this. and it's going to be very costly in many ways. and i think you have to say that you're going to reexamine it and you can reexamine it, but reexamine it with people that want to find answers, not people that don't want to find answers. for instance, i'm hearing ryan that he's probably, i'm sure a great lawyer and everything. but he's making statements about those ballots that he doesn't know. but he's making them with such — he did make them with surety. but now i think he's less sure because the answer is they all went to biden and that alone wins us the election by a lot. you know, so.\n\nraffensperger: mr. president, you have people that submit information and we have our people that submit information. and then it comes before the court and the court then has to make a determination. we have to stand by our numbers. we believe our numbers are right.\n\ntrump: why do you say that? i don't know. i mean, sure, we can play this game with the courts, but why do you say that? first of all they don't even assign us a judge. they don't even assign us a judge. but why wouldn't you — hey brad, why wouldn't you want to check out [name] ? and why wouldn't you want to say, hey, if in fact, president trump is right about that, then he wins the state of georgia, just that one incident alone without going through hundreds of thousands of dropped ballots. you just say, you stick by, i mean i've been watching you, you know, you don't care about anything. your numbers are right. but your numbers aren't right. they're really wrong and they're really wrong, brad. and i know this phone call is going nowhere other than, other than ultimately, you know — look ultimately, i win, okay?\n\nmitchell: mr. secretary...\n\ntrump: because you guys are so wrong. and you treated this. you treated the population of georgia so badly. you, between you and your governor, who was down at 21, he was down 21 points. and like a schmuck, i endorsed him and he got elected, but i will tell you, he is a disaster.\n\nand he knows, i can't imagine that people are so angry in georgia, i can't imagine he's ever getting elected again i'll tell you that much right now. but why wouldn't you want to find the right answer, brad, instead of keep saying that the numbers are right? cause those numbers are so wrong?\n\nmitchell: mr. secretary, mr. president, one of the things that we have been, alex can talk about this, we talked about it, and i don't know whether the information has been conveyed to your office, but i think what the president is saying, and what we've been trying to do is to say, look, the court is not acting on our petition. they haven't even assigned a judge. but the people of georgia and the people of america have a right to know the answers. and you have data and records that we don't have access to. and you keep telling us and making public statements that you investigated this and nothing to see here. but we don't know about that. all we know is what you tell us. what i don't understand is why wouldn't it be in everyone's best interest to try to get to the bottom, compare the numbers, you know, if you say, because - to try to be able to get to the truth because we don't have any way of confirming what you're telling us. you tell us that you had an investigation at the state farm arena. i don't have any report. i've never seen a report of investigation. i don't know that is. i've been pretty involved in this and i don't know. and that's just one of like , 25 categories. and it doesn't even, and as i, as the president said, we haven't even gotten into the dominion issue. that's not part of our case. it's not part of our, we just didn't feel as though we had any way to be able to develop —\n\ntrump: no, we do have a way but i don't want to get into it. we found a way in other states excuse me, but we don't need it because we're only down 11,000 votes so we don't even need it. i personally think they're corrupt as hell. but we don't need that. because all we have to do cleta is find 11,000-plus votes. so we don't need that. i'm not looking to shake up the whole world. we won georgia easily. we won it by hundreds of thousands of votes. but if you go by basic simple numbers, we won it easily, easily. so we're not giving dominion a pass on the record. we just, we don't need dominion, because we have so many other votes that we don't need to prove it any more than we already have.\n\nhilbert: mr. president and cleta, this is kurt hilbert, if i might interject for a moment. um ryan, i would like to suggest just four categories that have already been mentioned by the president that have actually hard numbers of 24,149 votes that were counted illegally. that in and of itself is sufficient to change the results or place the outcome in doubt. we would like to sit down with your office and we can do it through purposes of compromise and just like this phone call, just to deal with that limited category of votes. and if you are able to establish that our numbers are not accurate, then fine. however, we believe that they are accurate. we've had now three to four separate experts looking at these numbers.\n\ntrump: certified accountants looked at them.\n\nhilbert: correct. and this is just based on usps data and your own secretary of state's data. so that's what we would entreat and ask you to do, to sit down with us in a compromise and settlements proceeding and actually go through the registered voter ids and registrations. and if you can convince us that that 24,149 is inaccurate, then fine. but we tend to believe that is, you know, obviously more than 11,779. that's sufficient to change the results entirely in of itself. so what would you say to that, mr. germany?\n\ngermany: kurt, um i'm happy to get with our lawyers and we'll set that up. that number is not accurate. and i think we can show you, for all the ones we've looked at, why it's not. and so if that would be helpful, i'm happy to get with our lawyers and set that up with you guys.\n\ntrump: well, let me ask you, kurt, you think that is an accurate number. that was based on the information given to you by the secretary of state's department, right?\n\nhilbert: that is correct. that information is the minimum most conservative data based upon the usps data and the secretary of state's office data that has been made publicly available. we do not have the internal numbers from the secretary of state. yet, we have asked for it six times. i sent a letter over to mr... several times requesting this information, and it's been rebuffed every single time. so it stands to reason that if the information is not forthcoming, there's something to hide. that's the problem that we have.\n\ngermany: well, that's not the case sir. there are things that you guys are entitled to get. and there's things that under the law, we are not allowed to give out.\n\ntrump: well, you have to. well, under the law you're not allowed to give faulty election results, ok? you're not allowed to do that. and that's what you done. this is a faulty election result. and honestly, this should go very fast. you should meet tomorrow because you have a big election coming up and because of what you've done to the president — you know, the people of georgia know that this was a scam. and because of what you've done to the president, a lot of people aren't going out to vote and a lot of republicans are going to vote negative because they hate what you did to the president. okay? they hate it. and they're going to vote. and you would be respected. really respected, if this thing could be straightened out before the election. you have a big election coming up on tuesday. and therefore i think that it is really important that you meet tomorrow and work out on these numbers. because i know brad that if you think we're right, i think you're going to say, and i'm not looking to blame anybody. i'm just saying you know, and, you know, under new counts, and under uh, new views, of the election results, we won the election. you know? it's very simple. we won the election. as the governors of major states and the surrounding states said, there is no way you lost georgia, as the georgia politicians say, there is no way, you lost georgia. nobody. everyone knows i won it by hundreds of thousands of votes. but i'll tell you it's going to have a big impact on tuesday if you guys don't get this thing straightened out fast.\n\nmeadows: mr. president. this is mark. it sounds like we've got two different sides agreeing that we can look at these areas ands i assume that we can do that within the next 24 to 48 hours to go ahead and get that reconciled so that we can look at the two claims and making sure that we get the access to the secretary of state's data to either validate or invalidate the claims that have been made. is that correct?\n\ngermany: no, that's not what i said. i'm happy to have our lawyers sit down with kurt and the lawyers on that side and explain to my him, here's, based on what we've looked at so far, here's how we know this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong.\n\nmeadows: so what you're saying, ryan, let me let me make sure ... so what you're saying is you really don't want to give access to the data. you just want to make another case on why the lawsuit is wrong?\n\ngermany: i don't think we can give access to data that's protected by law. but we can sit down with them and say —\n\ntrump: but you're allowed to have a phony election? you're allowed to have a phony election right?\n\ngermany: no sir.\n\ntrump: when are you going to do signature counts, when are you going to do signature verification on fulton county, which you said you were going to do, and now all of a sudden you're not doing it. when are you doing that?\n\ngermany: we are going to do that. we've announced —\n\nhilbert: to get to this issue of the personal information and privacy issue, is it possible that the secretary of state could deputize the lawyers for the president so that we could access that information and private information without you having any kind of violation?\n\ntrump: well, i don't want to know who it is. you guys can do it very confidentially. you can sign a confidentiality agreement. that's ok. i don't need to know names. but we go the information on this stuff that we're talking about. we got all that information from the secretary of state.\n\nmeadows: yeah. so let me let me recommend, ryan, if you and kurt would get together, you know, when we get off of this phone call, if you could get together and work out a plan to address some of what we've got with your attorneys where we can we can actually look at the data. for example, mr. secretary, i can tell you say they were only two dead people who would vote. i can promise you there were more than that. and that may be what your investigation shows, but i can promise you there were more than that. but at the same time, i think it's important that we go ahead and move expeditiously to try to do this and resolve it as quickly as we possibly can. and if that's the good next step. hopefully we can, uh we can finish this phone call and go ahead and agree that the two of you will get together immediately.\n\ntrump: well why don't my lawyers show you where you got the information. it will show the secretary of state, and you don't even have to look at any names. we don't want names. we don't care. but we got that information from you. and stacey abrams is laughing about you know she's going around saying these guys are dumber than a rock. what she's done to this party is unbelievable, i tell ya. and i only ran against her once. and that was with a guy named brian kemp and i beat her. and if i didn't run, brian wouldn't have had even a shot, either in the general or in the primary. he was dead, dead as a doornail. he never thought he had a shot at either one of them. what a schmuck i was. but that's the way it is. that's the way it is. i would like you ... for the attorneys ... i'd like you to perhaps meet with ryan ideally tomorrow, because i think we should come to a resolution of this before the election. otherwise you're going to have people just not voting. they don't want to vote. they hate the state, they hate the governor and they hate the secretary of state. i will tell you that right now. the only people like you are people that will never vote for you. you know that brad, right? they like you know, they like you. they can't believe what they found. they want people like you. so, look, can you get together tomorrow? and brad. we just want the truth. it's simple. and everyone's going to look very good if the truth comes out. it's ok. it takes a little while but let the truth come out. and the real truth is i won by 400,000 votes. at least. that's the real truth. but we don't need 400,000. we need less than 2,000 votes. and are you guys able to meet tomorrow ryan?\n\ngermany: um, i'll get with chris, the lawyer representing us and the case, and see when he can get together with kurt.\n\nraffensperger: ryan will be in touch with the other attorney on this call, mr. meadows. thank you president trump for your time.\n\ntrump: ok, thank you, brad. thank you, ryan. thank you. thank you, everybody. thank you very much. bye.
(cnn) as the clocks struck midnight on tuesday, dozens of same-sex couples tied the knot in australia, marking the first legal ceremonies of their kind in the country.\n\nalthough australia passed a law l egalizing same-sex marriage last month, tuesday was the first day such couples could legally marry without applying for a special exception.\n\nthe law was passed in australia's parliament after a national postal survey found that a majority of people supported marriage equality in december.\n\naustralia is the 26th country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage, according to pew research . the measure was widely lauded as a victory for worldwide lgbti+ groups -- a term that refers collectively to people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans or intersex or other sexual minorities.\n\nhere's how some of the country's newest newlyweds celebrated on tuesday.\n\namong the first to wed were athletes craig burns (r) and luke sullivan, whose ceremony took place just after midnight at an estate in new south wales on tuesday.\n\nthe two runners quickly organized the wedding in the month since the law was passed, cnn affiliate seven network reported. all australian couples must provide a full month's notice of their intention to get married.\n\nin the port city of perth in western australia, gillian brady (l) and lisa goldsmith signed their marriage certificate at a ceremony at the court hotel.\n\nin sydney, local bakeries prepared commemorative cakes for the sydney festival's event in hyde park. in celebration of the historic event, festival organizers threw a public rainbow wedding reception in the park's meriton festival village complete with music, cake, champagne and pink swimming pools.\n\nwives rebecca hickson (l) and sarah turnbull exchanged in a ceremony in newcastle, new south wales.\n\nin melbourne, activists antony mcmanus (r) and ron van houwelingen were married at the david williamson theater, where they met 30 years earlier as students.\n\ntheir wedding cake was topped with a symbol of their love.\n\ni suppose it's been a wedding planned for 30 years but we've had really a month to get things together, ron van houwelingen, 50, told cnn's australian affiliate seven network.\n\nit's been quite hectic trying to organise that in such a short amount of time, he said.\n\nmost countries that have opted for marriage equality are in europe and the americas. in 2001, the netherlands was the first nation to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nireland was the first country to legalize the measure through popular vote in 2013, and in 2015 the united states supreme court ruled that same-sex couples could marry nationwide.
(cnn) — sleeping on a bus doesn't sound glamorous -- but california-based cabin is here to change your preconceptions.\n\nthis san francisco start-up has created a luxury hotel on wheels.\n\ninspired by the old time romance of mid-twentieth-century trains and ocean liners, cabin's guests to go to sleep in one city and wake somewhere else entirely.\n\nforget awkward sleep postures on planes, or slumping in the back of the car, cabin is kitted out with memory foam beds, leather seats and high-quality service.\n\n'an experience akin to teleportation'\n\ncozy but luxurious accommodation on board cabin. courtesy cabin\n\nit's an experience akin to teleportation -- you basically fall asleep and wake up somewhere new, says cabin ceo and co-founder tom currier.\n\nthis futuristic element is reflected in the state-of-the-art facilities on board -- cabin prides itself on using the same sheets as the ritz carlton.\n\nbut the real selling point is that cabin will get you from a to b, safely and smoothly -- although not as quickly as an airplane.\n\npassengers can sleep on memory foam beds. courtesy cabin\n\nnevertheless, the creators think the appeal is in the experience -- not the speed.\n\ndrivers opt for smoother, slower driving to ensure guests get a good night's sleep.\n\nin fact, drivers are trained via an ipad app that rates journeys based on smoothness.\n\ncalifornia here we come\n\ncabin is a double-decker bus with a difference. courtesy cabin\n\ncurrently cabin's sole route is between san francisco and santa monica.\n\nthis takes about eight hours, perfect for getting a good night's sleep.\n\ncabin's co-founders tom currier and gaetano crupi think they've created the future of travel. courtesy cabin\n\nsuitable refreshments are on hand -- guests are served camomile tea at night and espresso in the morning.\n\ntime will tell whether the initiative takes on -- but cabin plans to expand.
(cnn) wednesday started with a rump group of house and senate republicans preparing to object to the electoral college results to demonstrate their utter fealty. it ended with many of those same republicans retreating from their deeply held beliefs about election fraud, tails between their legs.\n\nit only took a violent seizure of the us capitol building by violent rioters -- the first time the capitol had been breached since 1814 during the war of 1812 -- to change their minds.\n\ni did think that today changed things drastically, indiana sen. mike braun, one of the 13 senators who had signaled he would object to the results, said in the wake of the storming of the capitol. yeah, whatever point you made before that should suffice. get this ugly day behind us.\n\nobviously the commission we have asked for is not going to happen at this point, said oklahoma sen. james lankford , another previous backer of the electoral college objection. i understand that. and we are headed tonight toward the certification of joe biden as president of the united states.\n\nin each episode of his weekly youtube show, chris cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. click to subscribe!\n\nditto montana sen. steve daines . and georgia sen. kelly loeffler. and washington rep. cathy mcmorris-rodgers . and likely many of the other republicans who started wednesday so gung-ho on challenging the results.\n\nwhat the rapid change of heart indicates is that there never -- really -- was much of a principle at stake here for the republicans who objected to the electoral college results. it was solely a political calculation -- a way of appealing to trump (and his base of voters) while not really having to worry about the election being overturned.\n\neven before the rioters stormed the capitol, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell had sniffed out the ploy. i will not pretend such a vote would be a harmless protest gesture while relying on others to do the right thing, he said on the senate floor in a not-so-subtle attack on his colleagues backing trump's attempts to overturn an election without any proof of wrongdoing.\n\nthis was a political stunt. except that the thousands of donald trump backers who, at the urging of the president took their unhappiness into the capitol itself, didn't know that. they believed that the election really was rigged and stolen. because trump and his complicit media told them so -- and the vast majority of republicans sat on their hands (and held their tongues) for fear of angering the president.\n\nit should not take an open insurrection in the heart of our government for these republican elected officials to realize that their words (or silence) have an impact that goes well beyond their own narrow political interests. that words matter. and that humoring trump and his election fantasies have real-world consequences. and, as we saw on wednesday, dangerous ones.\n\nrepublicans who needed to see the capitol seized by insurrectionists to realize what their actions had wrought should not be applauded or congratulated. the writing has been on the wall for a very long time. they just chose to put their heads in the sand.

33-year old senior policy adviser, is rumored to have written a good bit of the speech that the president delivered last night from the oval office. taken by itself, the speech and its horror-heavy rhetoric would suggest that the trump administration and miller take issue only with illegal immigration to the united states, the sort they believe authorities could stem with a physical barrier.\n\nthis is not true. for stephen miller, advocating for the border wall and railing against illegal immigrants is but one part of the transformation he envisions for the united states and its immigration system. the other parts have to do with legal immigrants and crippling the programs that allow them to come into the country.\n\nmiller, whose antipathy for immigration dates back to his high school years (when he wrote editorials critical of hispanic students while blasting bilingual high school announcements) and is himself descended from immigrants, has gone so far as to associate immigration, as he said in a june 2016 trump rally, with heartbreak, heartache and needless death. in august of 2018, miller's uncle denounced him as an architect of immigration policies that repudiate the very foundation of our family's life in this country. a former national security council official told politico in november that miller said at one meeting: we must save americans from these immigrant criminals! despite evidence showing that immigrants commit crimes at far lower rates than native-born americans, miller's persona and policy objectives make it clear that, to him, a fixed immigration system is one in which as few immigrants as possible cross america's borders, illegally or otherwise.\n\nin the first two years of the trump administration, miller, taking care not to leave a paper trail, has hacked away at america's legal immigration system using what one senior senate staffer described to vanity fair as the termite method: letting legal immigration programs erode from neglect and in some cases intentionally pulverizing them.\n\nwith pernicious regularity, miller – considered trump's most influential immigration adviser – has inserted himself into the construction of one executive order which bans travelers from seven countries, another that exhorts american employers to hire american, forced the state department to reject research that discounted a connection between refugees and terrorism, and inserted himself into high-level nsc meetings leading at least one official to label him president of immigration.\n\nthe details of how so many programs that enable legal migration to the united states have been debilitated are damning. the h-1b program, long the best way for highly skilled workers to migrate to the united states, will now be harder to access. according to data obtained by the national foundation for american policy, united states citizenship and immigration service (uscis) has begun to issue more visa denials and requests for evidence than it did before, with nearly 69% of applicants getting an rfe in the last quarter of 2017. the onerous requirement delays visa processing further and, along with new forms demanded from employers, contributes to costly delays, potentially suggesting a deliberate effort to deter employers from hiring foreign workers altogether.\n\nwhere all immigrant workers are concerned, statistics released by immigration and customs enforcement (ice) last month showed a 750% increase in the number of worksite investigations, administrative proceedings and raids over the previous year. ironically, the government shutdown has also led to the unavailability of the e-verify system that allows employers to check the immigration status of workers before they hire them, thwarting the administration's own concern with worker legality.\n\nh-1b applicants who get requests for evidence are actually the luckier bunch among all visa applicants. a new policy directive issued by uscis last summer permits the agency to summarily deny visa applications for immigrant visas, for green cards and for adjustments of status without first issuing a request for evidence or a notice to appear as they used to. instead, the agency can, at their discretion, deny the visa and immediately label the applicant illegal and deportable, without giving them an option to depart voluntarily. the real consequence of the policy change is to make many more people ineligible for re-entry into the united states, because they have been deemed deportable. in cases of immigrant visas, applicants appearing for green card interviews have been rejected and then immediately detained because, under this new policy directive, they had been declared illegal.\n\nthe virulence of miller's views toward international students also came through last fall when he argued that chinese students should be banned from us universities because of the possibility that they could be engaging in espionage for the chinese government, and because (in miller's view) such a ban would punish elite universities who have been critical of mr. trump. thirty percent of international students are chinese and most pay full price at american universities, subsidizing costs for american students. around the midterm elections, it was reported that further restrictions on all international students and student exchange programs would also be forthcoming.\n\nmiller has also been successful in arguing for a lower cap on the number of refugees coming to the united states, restricting the number to a record low of only 45,000 for 2018. in 2018, he turned his attention to asylum-seekers, championing a new rule that would disqualify those entering the country anywhere except a legal port of entry from claiming asylum. the law was struck down, but appeals are in progress. in late 2018, miller pushed for yet another proposal to force asylum applicants on the southern border to wait in mexico while their cases were processed.\n\ndestroying or disabling work, student, immigrant, asylee and refugee programs is apparently not enough to sate the nativist sentiment that undergirds this miller-led transformation of the us immigration system. early in 2018, the trump administration set about dividing real native-born citizens from naturalized citizens, inaugurating the denaturalization task force, whose operation janus and operation second look are pursuing denaturalization proceedings and screening old naturalization applications for fraud. no public guidelines exist for whom they may investigate or for how long. furthermore, naturalized citizens, along with all other visa holders, are being monitored by the government through their social media accounts, and the information is being stored in files known as a-files that are kept and maintained by uscis. a naturalized citizen, it seems, in the trump administration's view, is not entitled to the fourth and fifth amendment protections the constitution provides against just such surveillance.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\nthe current furor may be over the shutdown and the border wall, but regardless of how the cataclysm of the moment turns out, stephen miller will likely continue his campaign to deter, defeat and demonize immigrants to the united states. in the case of highly skilled workers, international students, refugees and naturalized citizens, he has already been successful. the much-touted wall may not be necessary after all – as the barriers, made up of policy briefs and administrative regulations and executive orders and task forces, have already been erected.

an outbreak of new coronavirus has sickened about 1,400 people worldwide and killed at least 41 in mainland china, while spreading to countries around the world.\n\nits emergence has fueled fears of a deadly epidemic as hundreds of millions of people travel in china, or around the asian region, during the lunar new year holiday.\n\nwhat is the virus?\n\ncoronavirus is a large family of viruses, which include severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers).\n\ncommon symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, and possibly a headache. those who have a weakened immune system, particularly the young and the elderly, are at risk of the virus turning into a more serious respiratory tract illness.\n\nauthorities said the wuhan coronavirus was passed from animals to humans; can be spread from person to person; and appears to cause pneumonia in people who have weakened immune systems.\n\nit is thought to be milder that sars and mers and take longer to develop symptoms. patients to date have typically experienced a mild cough for a week followed by shortness of breath, causing them to visit a hospital.\n\nexperts are now trying to understand how it is being transmitted, who is at most risk and whether transmission is occurring mostly in hospitals or in the community.\n\nin one instance, 14 doctors and nurses operating on a patient -- who was not known to be carrying the virus -- were all infected with it, suggesting it can be spread relatively easily.\n\nwhere is this happening?\n\nwhere it started: ground zero\n\nthe outbreak emerged last month in the largest city in central china, wuhan, a city of 11 million people in hubei province.\n\nofficials linked it to huanan seafood wholesale market, saying wild animals sold there are the likely source of the virus. the market has been closed since january 1 for disinfection and officials are scrambling to discover its animal source.\n\nsnakes -- the chinese krait and the chinese cobra -- may be responsible for transmitting coronavirus to humans.\n\nscientists in china say that the virus might have jumped from bats to snakes, which were sold in the local seafood market in wuhan, and then to humans.\n\nhowever, how the virus could adapt to both the cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts remains a mystery, and further tests are necessary to determine the source animal.\n\nat least 30 people died in the province, many of them elderly and suffering from pre-existing conditions.\n\nas deaths mount in the city, officials imposed a number of new measures including the postponement of new year celebrations in wuhan, a ban on tour agencies from bringing groups of people out of the city and thermal monitors and screening in public spaces.\n\nregional spread\n\nfrom the first reported case in december, in hubei province, the virus has spread to almost all of china's administrative regions this week.\n\nthe country has adopted prevention and control measures that are typically used for major outbreaks such as plague and cholera. this means health officials will get sweeping powers to lock down affected areas and quarantine patients.\n\nwuhan temporarily closed its airport and railway stations on thursday for departing passengers, and all public transport services are suspended until further notice.\n\nthe city's coronavirus task force also announced the closure of highways out of the city.\n\nmeanwhile, the city made it mandatory for everyone to wear face masks in public places after confirmed coronavirus cases passed the 500 mark.\n\nunprecedented lockdown\n\nauthorities in china have imposed indefinite travel restrictions in 15 cities in hubei province, the most affected area in the country, impacting an estimated 32 million people.\n\nwuhan, a city of 11 million, is under effective lockdown, with all public transport in and out of the city closed.\n\nother cities across the province are under less severe travel restrictions.\n\na global threat: confirmed cases around the world\n\nthe virus has spread well beyond mainland china, so far to 13 places including hong kong, macau, taiwan, singapore, south korea, thailand, japan, vietnam, australia and the united states.\n\nairports around the world have increased health screenings and implemented new quarantine procedures as officials race to slow the spread of the virus.\n\ninternational flights from wuhan\n\nwuhan is a major transportation hub.\n\nnot only is the city a center for china's high-speed rail network, it has flights going to more than 60 international destinations from tianhe international airport.\n\non thursday, as confirmed cases ramped up across the country, government officials announced the temporary closure of wuhan's airport and railway stations.\n\nall train tickets in and out of wuhan have also been suspended, while multiple international airlines have canceled flights to the city.\n\nchina has encouraged passengers traveling to and from wuhan to change their travel plans during the busy lunar new year holiday period, by exempting them from service charges for refunds for all modes of transport.\n\nhow does this compare to the sars virus?\n\nscientists say the infectiousness of the virus is not as strong as sars, but have added that the number of people infected is climbing.\n\na study by researchers in the uk estimated that the number of infections in wuhan is still grossly underestimated, with the real number closer to 4,000 as of january 18, based on the spread of the virus to other cities and countries in a relatively short period of time.\n\nsars infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 in a pandemic that ripped through asia in 2002 and 2003.\n\non thursday, david heymann, the chairman of a world health organization committee gathering data on the outbreak, said the virus spreads more easily from person to person than previously thought.\n\nbut there is still much that is not known about the virus and, as the above graphic shows, its death rate is far smaller than that seen during the sars outbreak.
(cnn) the discovery of important new coronavirus variants in the uk and south africa began with a bet of a bottle of wine.\n\nin mid-november, tulio de oliveira, who leads a genetics lab in south africa, began receiving anxious phone calls from physicians in the eastern cape province who were seeing an explosive growth in covid-19 patients. hospitals were quickly becoming overrun. the increase had seemingly come out of nowhere.\n\nit was shocking, said de oliveira, a professor at the university of kwazulu-natal in durban.\n\nde oliveira immediately asked for samples of the virus from patients' noses so he could genetically sequence them.\n\nin less than a week, he sequenced 16 samples. all 16 had similar mutations -- and an unusually high number of mutations.\n\ni said to myself, 'there's something very strange here,'  de oliveira said.\n\nde oliveira, a prominent virus hunter, had discovered a new variant of the coronavirus.\n\nthe 16 samples were hundreds of kilometers apart from each other in the eastern cape and kwazulu-natal provinces, so he had a hunch the variant was spreading quickly.\n\nto add to the concerns, some of the mutations were in the genes related to the spikes that sit atop the virus. tests to detect the virus, as well as covid-19 drugs and vaccines, have targeted those spikes. the concern is that if the spikes change, it's possible that tests, drugs and vaccines might not work as well.\n\nin the next step of his virus hunt, de oliveira reached out to labs in the network for genomic surveillance in south africa, asking them to send samples of viruses from their covid-19 patients from far and wide.\n\none of the labs was in stellenbosch, a town that's home to south africa's famed wineries.\n\nde oliveira said susan engelbrecht, the senior scientist at the stellenbosch lab, told him she'd be shocked if the new variant had reached her area, since it's more than 700 kilometers away from nelson mandela bay, where the spread of the variant was first spotted.\n\ni made a bet with her, that if we found the variant in more than 50% of the samples from stellenbosch, she would give me a bottle of wine, de oliveira said. she said not only would she give me bottle of wine, she would eat her hat, too.\n\nof the 67 samples from stellenbosch, 58 were the same variant found in nelson mandela bay.\n\nde oliveira is considering which stellenbosch wine he'll choose -- but he knows it will be an expensive one.\n\n\n\ntulio de oliveira, a professor at the university of kwazulu-natal in south africa, and his team identified a coronavirus variant there.\n\na few days later, on december 4, de oliveira sent an urgent email to the world health organization official who runs the agency's sars-cov-2 virus evolution working group.\n\ni would like to request an urgent addition to the agenda today - to raise an alert of some preliminary findings from south africa, de oliveira wrote.\n\npermission was granted, and de oliveira alerted the other scientists on the call, who hailed from around the world, about this strange new variant he was seeing in south africa. he noted that it included a mutation in a position of the spike protein called n501y, and he encouraged his colleagues to look for similar mutations in their countries.\n\nandrew rambaut, a professor at the university of edinburgh, took up the task. he and his colleagues looked in the uk's genomic database and found a variant containing the n501y mutation, which was spreading quickly in parts of southeast england. they published their findings on december 20.\n\nthat day, rambaut tweeted : the hint to look for n501y came from @tuliodna who was tracking this mutation in south africa.\n\ni think the fact that the mutation was identified first and then linked to a growing cluster rather than the other way round alters the likelihood that the variant is the cause of the cluster rather than just a randomly picked variant that happened to be present in the region. — andrew rambaut 🦠🧬🌲🔮🤦‍♂️ (@arambaut) december 20, 2020\n\nmaria van kerkhove, the technical lead for the who's coronavirus response, said de oliveira's discovery definitely triggered [british scientists] to look at the different type of variants.\n\ni'm just so grateful that we have this [international] collaboration, she said.\n\n'we're playing a very dangerous game with this virus'\n\nif a virus changes its genetics in just the right way, tests might not be able to detect it as easily, and vaccines might not work as well.\n\nwe're playing a very dangerous game with this virus right now, van kerkhove said, given the explosive growth in the united states and other countries. what worries us is that the longer this spreads, the more opportunities it has to change.\n\nthese variants were found in south africa and the uk, but it's not clear where they began. so far, it appears that both spread more quickly, but they are not more deadly. vaccine makers and other scientists are studying whether the variants pose a challenge to the vaccines.\n\nkeeping an eye on the virus -- genetically sequencing samples from large numbers of people -- is a fundamental aspect of controlling the virus and an important way to understand your enemy, van kerkhove said.\n\ntrevor bedford, a genomic epidemiologist at the fred hutchinson cancer research center, gives the example of how genetic sequencing this summer helped link 59 covid-19 cases in various parts of ireland back to one flight. knowing the passengers caught it on the plane helped with contact tracing and control activities.\n\nthe sequencing really kind of clinched it, bedford said.\n\nsequencing the coronavirus in the us\n\non december 20, the day the british scientists published their findings, a slack group for us virus hunters lit up.\n\nperhaps the uk and south africa variants or other worrisome mutations existed in the united states, too.\n\nthat kind of definitely lit a fire under people, said bedford, who's a member of a slack group for spheres , a new us consortium to coordinate coronavirus genetic sequencing led by the us centers for disease control and prevention.\n\nso far in the pandemic, us genomic sequencing has lagged behind other countries. for example, the uk has sequenced virus samples from about 146,000 people, and the us has sequenced samples from only 58,000 people, according to the gisaid database, even though the us had far more covid-19 cases.\n\nwatching other countries, like the uk and south africa, excel at genomic sequencing can be hard, bedford said.\n\nof course, it's frustrating, he said.\n\nin south africa, once de oliveira got the tip from physicians that case numbers were growing, it took him and his colleagues only about two weeks to identify the new variant. once british researchers got the tip from de oliveira, it took them less than three weeks to find their own variant and publish their study.\n\nthings don't move that quickly in the us, bedford said.\n\nin the united states, the labs that have coronavirus samples from patients often don't work directly with the scientists who will sequence those samples. that means the scientists have to identify those labs, ask them to save samples, and then make legal agreements for sharing the samples.\n\npart of the reason that we're doing such a bad job is we have [these] structural issues, bedford said.\n\nsouth africa and the uk, on the other hand, have national health services, so the labs that do covid-19 testing and the experts that do sequencing typically work for the same entity.\n\nthey've got a single national health system and a single national microbiology service, which makes coordinating things a lot easier, said dr. gregory armstrong, director of the office of advanced molecular detection at the cdc's national center for emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases. we don't have a system that's anywhere near as robust as the uk system.\n\nget cnn health's weekly newsletter sign up here to get the results are in with dr. sanjay gupta every tuesday from the cnn health team.\n\nanother reason the us lags behind is that the uk has invested huge sums of money in genomic sequencing.\n\nthe system in the uk is really the gold standard for how to do genomic surveillance, armstrong said. i don't think we're ever going to be able to get up to that level.\n\nthe cdc is trying to shore up the us surveillance system, with recent grants of millions of dollars to state and university labs.\n\nthe cdc's goal is to more than double the number of coronavirus genomes sequenced in the us, armstrong said. the sequencing is done in labs at the cdc, state health departments, universities and private companies.\n\nthe us is now sequencing about 3,000 samples a week, and the cdc hopes in the next two weeks to more than double that to about 6,500 per week, he said.\n\nscientists around the world are eager to see the change.\n\ni'm optimistic that this is going to get better quickly, van kerkhove said.

harris said.\n\nit was blatant. it was blatant. talking about african-americans and latinos, don't want this stuff happening, harris added, mocking trump's tone to laughter from the audience. what was that supposed to be about? tell me that – if not inserting race in a way that was intended to create fear and division.\n\nthat's not what a leader does and that's certainly not what the leader of the united states is supposed to do, she said.\n\nin her memoir, harris wrote about how her mother taught her to trust her gut instincts.\n\non wednesday night, she was questioned by the event's moderator jonathan capehart, a writer for the washington post, about how she would compare her instincts to trump's gut.\n\ni would actually say that assumes facts, not evidence that he has a gut, she said.\n\nin the interview, the democratic senator spoke about how her heritage as the daughter of immigrants from india and jamaica has shaped her outlook on the plight of immigrants under the policies of the trump administration.\n\nin her new memoir, the truths we hold, harris described her anger watching her mother become a target because she was brown-skinned and how that has driven her efforts to enhance the legal and humanitarian protections over immigrants coming into the us.\n\nharris said she was blessed with a nurturing, happy, healthy childhood, but has been dismayed by trump's vilification of immigrants.\n\nwhen we talk about the immigration debate, i think there is no question that there are powerful forces, including this president, that are attempting to vilify immigrants because they were born in another country, harris said, and suggest that they are therefore any different in terms of their fundamental values or beliefs, or priorities.\n\ni think all of us as americans should all be insulted by that suggestion, the democratic senator said, knowing that all of us are just a few generations, if not one generation away from immigrants who arrived in this country with the same hopes and dreams that we each have for our children.\n\nthe former california attorney general also expressed regret that she was not informed by her staff that her former top aide in that previous office was accused of gender harassment, a lawsuit that the attorney general'soffice settled for nearly $400,000 after she had moved on to the us senate.\n\nharris said that as a leader of the #metoo movement, it was a very painful experience to know that something could happen in one's office of almost 5,000 people, granted, but that i didn't know about it.\n\nthat being said, i take full responsibility for anything that has happened in my office, she said. i always do, and i always will. the buck stops with me.\n\neven in the office of someone who has been an advocate for women's rights, and all people's rights, there is no office that is immune from this kind of behavior, and that's something that we are also going to have to deal with. that's a sad statement, she added.\n\nlarry wallace, who headed the bureau of law enforcement at the california attorney general's office, was accused by his former assistant of forcing her to change the paper or the ink in a printer under his desk every day and refused to move the printer.\n\nwallace worked closely with harris for many years, and she praised his efforts to help root out racial bias in the attorney general's office in her recent memoir.
it seems like barnes & noble has been on its final chapter for years.\n\nslumping sales, closing stores, and a big swing and a miss on digital have hurt the book chain. the holidays were particularly miserable for barnes & noble (bks): sales fell more than 6%, while other retailers had a surprisingly merry christmas.\n\nbut barnes & noble may have life left in its story.\n\nthe company is taking measures to bring people into stores. it launched new concept stores with restaurants that serve avocado toast, kale salad and wine (among other things). it hosts in-store readings and community events.\n\nit's efforts may have been enough to keep barnes & noble afloat so far, said barbara kahn, a marketing professor at wharton. but it's going to have to do some work to turn things around.\n\nthe main problem is that barnes & noble doesn't seem to have a very clear proposition, said neil saunders, managing director of globaldata retail. in order for the company to survive, it needs to convince customers that they should shop at barnes & nobles, he argues.\n\nhere are steps barnes & noble can take to turn itself around.\n\ndownsize and curate\n\nin order to cut down on losses, barnes & noble could both decrease the size of its stores and shut down some locations, said saunders.\n\nsmaller stores could make for a better shopping experience, added kahn.\n\nkahn noted that amazon's bookstores are much smaller than barnes & noble's, focusing on a curated collection of recommended items.\n\nit makes the shopping very easy to do, she said.\n\nbarnes & noble can start by losing its most outdated products -- cds and dvds -- and doing a better job of curating the toys, journals and other non-book items it sells. right now, saunders said, shoppers face a random assortment of products, most of which can be found at stores like target (tgt) and walmart (wmt).\n\nrelated: barnes & noble losses: blame it on harry potter\n\nthe company may plan on making some of these changes. in its annual report for 2017, the company said it is hopeful that improving navigation and discovery throughout the store, including a customer friendly and more intuitive organization of books and improved signage for easier browsing, will help sales. and the brand is testing out smaller stores, and cutting back on gifts that don't sell.\n\nditch starbucks\n\nit's possible that barnes & noble's decades-old partnership with starbucks (sbux) has run its course, said kahn. people may pop into a barnes & noble to get a cup of coffee, but that doesn't mean they're going to buy anything else.\n\ni'm not sure the synergy works both ways, she said.\n\nsaunders doesn't think a coffee shop is a bad idea. but rather than partnering with a national chain, he suggested joining forces with a local cafe in order to distinguish a barnes & noble's coffee shop from one you can find on any corner.\n\nwe believe a differentiated experience is a must in today's retail landscape, added david schick, managing partner and lead retail analyst with consumer edge research. in this case that means merchandise and food / beverage offerings.\n\nthe companies have not disclosed the details of their partnership. starbucks did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nbarnes & noble cafes did have slightly positive results last quarter, thanks to buy-one-get-one and other deals, said ceo demos parneros when discussing second-quarter earnings.\n\nbuild a community\n\nbarnes & noble rides the waves on bestsellers like harry potter or hit records like adele's 25. that's a dangerous strategy, said saunders.\n\nif you're so reliant [on trends], your business doesn't work, he explained.\n\ninstead, barnes & noble could build a community by appealing to fans of those books and artists throughout the year.\n\nbarnes & noble was able to do that with university book stores, said kahn. students and alumni looking for college swag have a clear reason to walk into a university-affiliated barnes & noble over another store.\n\nbut barnes & noble spun off that part of its business into a separate entity called barnes & noble education, so it'll have to find a different way to keep customers coming back, whether by hosting more compelling events throughout the year or selling more merchandise and gifts for dedicated fans.\n\nrelated: barnes & noble surges on takeover rumors\n\ndouble down on home goods\n\nbarnes & noble could take a page from indigo, canada's largest book, gift and specialty toy retailer.\n\nindigo is doing well. sales are climbing thanks in particular to its home goods and toy businesses (indigo sells books, but it also sells cookware, furniture and home decor). the company has its own proprietary gift and merchandise, and recently launched concept stores to reflect its change from a bookstore to a cultural department store for booklovers, a distinction which seems to be working.\n\noften books are decorative accessories, said saunders.\n\neven people who prefer to read books on an e-reader might still want to buy coffee table books.\n\nindigo, saunders noted, is thinking of coming to the united states -- so barnes had better act fast, before a strong competitor makes a bad situation worse.\n\nkill nook\n\nnook, barnes & noble's digital arm, has long been a thorn in the book seller's side.\n\nin its 2017 annual report, barnes & noble noted that from april 2016 to april 2017, sales of nook devices and accessories plummeted by 34.9%. and digital content sales fell 18.1% in that period.\n\nstill, barnes & noble thinks it can turn nook around. the company said in the 2017 report that by outsourcing certain operations and making other changes, nook can stave off further losses.\n\nsaunders suggested that rather than try to salvage nook, barnes & noble should focus on bringing people into its brick-and-mortar locations. the company's many physical locations -- it owns more than 600 bookstores -- set it apart from online retailers like amazon. meanwhile, nook has failed as a competitor to the kindle and tablets -- so barnes & noble's energy would be better spent on revamping its stores.

(cnn) -- jennifer muzquiz was goth in high school. she had, and still has, multicolored hair, a face full of piercings, and an all-black wardrobe, even though she no longer identifies with the goth subculture. and while her style had always earned her her fair share of strange glances, she says everything changed for the worse after the columbine school shootings on april 20, 1999.\n\njennifer muzquiz, in all black, decided to study at home after feeling shunned as a goth after columbine.\n\nit was on that day that eric harris and dylan klebold killed 12 students and teachers in a shooting spree at columbine high school in littleton, colorado.\n\nthe massacre was one of the deadliest school shootings in history, and it had a profound effect on students and teachers across the country. as the media and the public groped for meaning behind the incident, there were plenty of theories about the motive behind the massacre.\n\none of these was that harris and klebold were members of the goth subculture, or trench-coat mafia as they were known at columbine, and thus had been outcasts.\n\nthis theory has been widely refuted, but for goth students around the country, the damage was done.\n\nas a result [of columbine], the public were afraid of the 'goths' and 'punks' and 'metalheads' at school, says muzquiz, who was a high school senior at the time.\n\nparents, often successfully, lobbied to get trench coats and all-black attire banned in their local schools. school administrators started considering these groups to be gangs and harassment of students was rampant, with unwarranted backpack searches, detainment in the hallways by security guards, and being called into the administrative offices for questioning.\n\nrumors ran rampant about kids who looked like they were going to bring a gun to school, and muzquiz says her classmates quickly learned if they wanted to cause trouble for a student, all they had to do was report that student had a list of enemies.\n\nthey could simply report to administrators that the person had an 'enemies list' and the school would quickly swoop in to rectify the situation, even when it wasn't the truth. ... the accused would forever be known as 'the kid with the list' and ostracized, she says.\n\nbecause of this and the new dress code restrictions, her goth friends were afraid to go to school. muzquiz herself caught so much flak for her appearance that she went into home studies. and though she was no longer in school, discrimination couldn't be avoided. people in town would cross to the other side of the street to avoid her and her friends, she says. ireport.com: 'sadly, teens still tend to shun those who are different than they are'\n\nmuzquiz was even interviewed by the national media about her experiences after columbine. at first she regretted it and feared backlash. i had already gotten enough crap since columbine about wearing all black, she says. but she was glad she did it after receiving e-mails from other students who identified with her and thanked her for the interviews, including one girl who was suicidal until reading an article about her.\n\none girl even had e-mailed me and said [she] was coming home to write a suicide note ... and kill herself after school. she read the article about me and it made her think twice, says muzquiz. in the article, i said it's not worth letting these people get to you. it's not up to them to tell you that you're wrong. she thanked me.\n\n[to have] a 14-year-old e-mail me ... it was just, like, whoa, i don't care who says anything bad ... i helped someone, says muzquiz. to this day that just sticks with me. anything i do in my life -- nothing's going to measure to that, the fact that i helped someone realize that there's more to life.\n\nthings changed for teachers after columbine, too. many say they realized they weren't just responsible for their students' knowledge, but for their overall well-being.\n\nlife was never the same after that day, says barbara rademacher, a veteran teacher from rogers, arkansas. schools across the country instituted new security measures such as see-through backpacks and metal detectors, and teachers were trained to deal with violent behavior. but more than that, says rademacher, teachers and students are always just a little afraid.\n\nwhat columbine said to me as an educator was that we in the education community hold people's lives in our hands. ... we as educators have a much higher duty, a much higher call, than just to teach our subject areas. ... columbine was to education what 9/11 was to the united states: a shattering wake-up call, a disaster so profound, it permanently changed our world view. ireport.com: 'education is literally a matter of life and death'\n\nkym godwin remembers a similar wake-up call after the shooting. she was a first-year teacher in ilwaco, washington, at the time.\n\ni think most people who go into teaching have the desire to go out there and change the world and enlighten kids and bring them to this great level of knowledge, she says. i remember when it happened, all of a sudden, it was like: 'how can i give them all of this knowledge if i can't keep them safe?' i realized at that moment that my job wasn't just giving them academic learning, it was also about protecting them and making them feel like they're in a safe place.\n\nthis realization hit home for her when her school had a lockdown. teenagers from another part of town had entered the school, allegedly looking for a student there. a school security guard apprehended them right outside the door to godwin's classroom.\n\ni remember thinking, what would happen if somebody actually walked in the door? ... and that's when it hit me, that the kids have to be able to trust me as their teacher to protect them regardless of who walks through that door. i told the kids, this is real, and i am the one in control and i will protect you. ... and i found out afterward that virtually every teacher in the building did the exact same thing. the kids looked to us and knew we were there to keep them safe.\n\ngodwin also means safe in a different way. it includes protecting her students from physical harm, yes, but also protecting them from bullying or social stigmas that could potentially lead to violent behavior. some investigators have said

(cnn) —\n\npsychological and emotional abuse in intimate relationships is now a crime in ireland.\n\nthe domestic violence act 2018 went into effect on tuesday and provides new protections for victims of coercive control, a type of emotional and psychological abuse aimed at stripping a person of their self-worth and agency.\n\nalthough psychological and emotional abuse – including controlling behavior, isolation, and threats of violence – can be more difficult to recognize than physical violence, it can be just as damaging, experts say.\n\nireland's minister of justice and equality charlie flanagan said in a statement wednesday that the new law recognizes that the effect of non-violent control in an intimate relationship can be as harmful to victims as physical abuse because it is an abuse of the unique trust associated with an intimate relationship.\n\nthis new provision sends a message that society will no longer tolerate the appalling breach of trust committed by one partner against the other in an intimate context, he added.\n\nin a 2014 european union agency for fundamental rights (fra) pan-european survey on violence against women, almost a third of irish women (31%) said they had experienced psychological abuse by a partner. a further 23% of respondents said they had experienced controlling behavior, 24% said they had experienced abusive behavior, and 12% said they had experienced stalking (including online stalking).\n\nwomen's aid, ireland's national domestic violence support organization, said that while it welcomed the new law, in order for it to be effective, it must be properly resourced.\n\nit must be positive, it must be practical and it must make them and their children safer from abuse. what is promised on paper must be fully resourced to be effective in protecting those affected by domestic violence. we are concerned that an already over-stretched system will see an increase in demand when the new provisions commence, margaret martin, women's aid director, said in a statement on monday.\n\nwomen must feel change quickly, she added.\n\nthe group, who runs the country's only free, national, domestic violence 24 hour helpline, reported that in 2017 there were 15,833 disclosures of domestic abuse, including 10,281 reports of emotional abuse. male intimate partners accounted for 83% of those abusers, women's aid reported.\n\nireland is one of only a few countries that have criminalized psychological or emotional abuse.\n\nin 2010, the french government criminalized psychological violence in intimate relationships, with the punishable offense carrying a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a €45,000 fine (approximately us $51,345). in england and wales, coercive control in intimate relationships became a criminal offense in 2015. last year, scotland also adopted a similar measure.\n\nthe new irish law has included additional measures to combat gender-based violence, including criminalizing forced marriages, repealing legislation that previously allowed underage couples to marry, and allowing for victims of domestic abuse to apply for safety protection orders – regardless of whether or not they live with their abuser.
washington (cnn) top us national security officials continue to defend the trump administration's claim that it killed iranian military commander qasem soleimani in response to an impending threat to american lives, but the lack of evidence provided to lawmakers and the public has fueled lingering skepticism about whether the strike was justified.\n\npresident donald trump, secretary of state mike pompeo and top military officials have offered similar explanations for targeting soleimani, citing an imminent threat from his plans to carry out what chairman of the joint chiefs mark milley called a significant campaign of violence against the us in the coming days, weeks or months.\n\nif you're an american in the region, days and weeks, this is not something that's relevant, pompeo told cnn's jake tapper on state of the union sunday, dodging a question on the imminence of such iranian attacks. we have to prepare, we have to be ready, and we took a bad guy off the battlefield.\n\nbut questions have continued to swirl in recent days over the timing, whether the administration fully considered the fallout from such a strike against soleimani, and if an appropriate legal basis was established for the presidential authorization of lethal force.\n\na republican congressional source familiar with the administration's decision to strike soleimani acknowledged that in the past the president has been reluctant to take military action. in this case, the killing of an american contractor , the wounding of others, and the subsequent embassy protests crossed his line. his advisers also pointed out to the president that if he didn't respond now, they (iran) will continue to cross it.\n\ni am very confident he was not reluctant, said the source. when trump finally gets ready to act, they added, you can't out escalate him.\n\ncnn has previously reported that there was internal debate over the decision and work behind the scenes to develop a legal argument before the operation was carried out.\n\nafter a meeting sunday in mar-a-lago where president donald trump was briefed by senior members of his national security team on options regarding iran, some officials emerged surprised the president chose to target soleimani, according to a source familiar with the briefing.\n\nthe officials who briefed trump included defense secretary mark esper, pompeo, national security adviser robert o'brien and milley.\n\nthe source said that some aides expected trump to pick a less risky option, but once presented with the choice of targeting soleimani he remained intent on going forward.\n\nfailure to connect the dots\n\nsince that time, the us has provided few details about those specific threats posed by soleimani and failed to clearly outline the legal underpinnings\n\nthe administration has failed to connect the dots in a way that provides a clear picture of an imminent threat and that argument has been obscured by inconsistent messaging from us officials.\n\none thing that has become relatively clear is that the operation to take out soleimani did not hinge on some kind of golden opportunity to target the quds force commander, unlike the missions that killed osama bin laden and isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi.\n\nsome information has surfaced.\n\na source briefed on the latest intelligence told cnn that before the strike, specific information showed iranian surface to air missiles and other military weaponry that the us had been watching, were moving in on at least two us air bases, as well as us embassies in the region.\n\nadditionally, the source said that the situation was different because the us had advanced notice of his plans to kill americans and that the previous reason not to kill him has gone away -- fear that it could cause the irgc to specifically target americans.\n\no'brien made the case friday that the strike was prompted by intelligence related to soleimani's movements coupled with ongoing attacks that he was planning against us diplomats and military personnel.\n\nsoleimani was in the middle east, in iraq, and traveling around the middle east. he had just come from damascus, where he was planning attacks on american soldiers, airmen, marines, sailors, and against our diplomats. so this strike was aimed at disrupting ongoing attacks that were being planned by soleimani, and deterring future iranian attacks, through their proxies or through the irgc quds force directly, against americans. as president trump said today, this action was taken to stop a war, not to start a war, he said.\n\nwhen asked by a reporter if the threat was imminent, milley responded friday saying, absolutely, but defined the time frame as days and maybe weeks.\n\nhe also warned that attacks could still happen, meaning the threat was not eliminated by killing soleimani.\n\none republican congressional source, when asked about whether there was intelligence that attacks were imminent, said there was no doubt he was there to plan attacks against the us, referring to soleimani.\n\nsoleimani was under frequent surveillance by the us intelligence community, according to a senior administration official.\n\ncapturing intel from this guy would be a top priority, the official said. counterintelligence officials were routinely monitoring his movements, gathering information on who he was meeting with and what he was doing as he moved around the region. the official said he was definitely not in a secure undisclosed location like bin laden and baghdadi.\n\nthat kind of visibility gave the intelligence community a multitude of options for taking out soleimani. this factor would obviously be of great use to the intelligence community were soleimani determined to be moving toward an imminent attack on us interests.\n\nthis official, however, could not confirm whether that was the case prior to the soleimani operation.\n\nlawmaker doubts\n\nsome lawmakers have said that the information provided in classified settings last week painted an incomplete picture, prompting more questions about whether the threats cited by the administration meet the legal standard of imminent.\n\none democratic source who was briefed friday by administration officials said the information offered was absolutely unconvincing as far as proving there was an imminent threat and democratic lawmakers have raised similar concerns.\n\nin an interview with cnn friday, democratic sen. tom udall of new mexico said more than once that he does not believe an attack on the united states was imminent as president donald trump and other top administration officials have said.\n\nmy staff was briefed by a number of people representing a variety of agencies in the united states government and they came away with no feeling that there was evidence of an imminent attack, udall said, adding he believed the president is only saying an attack was imminent to justify killing soleimani.\n\nstill, the us military remains comfortable with calling soleimani's potential plan imminent, a us defense official told cnn saturday.\n\nit all depends on what you call imminent, the official said, but we believe he was in the final stages of ordering attacks when he visited beirut and damascus in the days before he was killed.\n\nthe official added that while they continue to believe the intelligence showed soleimani was planning multiple attacks at multiple locations, they do not have absolute detailed evidence of everything he was trying to execute.\n\nseparately, a senior defense official told cnn there were multiple intelligence indicators that he was continuing to plan attacks. a significant turning point came when the us contractor was killed a week ago, the senior official said. the intelligence may be no different of him (soleimani) planning attacks as he had in the past, but this was different because an american had been killed, added the republican congressional source.\n\nanother us official hedged, saying said the threat posed by the attacks soleimani was accused of planning was pretty imminent.\n\nthe official added, when asked if soleimani was needed to be alive for these threats and plans to be executed in the same way that he planned them, that after his death things will change.\n\ntrump's assertion that the strike was meant to avoid a war and claims by administration officials that the operation was intended to de-escalate have also prompted confusion. however, a source familiar with the administration's thinking told cnn that those comments offer some insight into what the intention behind the attack was.\n\nthis source said the argument for targeting soleimani, rather than iranian assets, centers around the idea that it was a preemptive move intended to de-escalate the situation by deterring any plans to attack american embassies or bases.\n\nthe reasoning behind this, the same source told cnn, is that if iran were to fire on a us base or embassy, it would trigger a large-scale military response by the us, so by killing soleimani, the hope was that it would cause the iranians to change their behavior.\n\naim to reestablish a deterrent?\n\nbut that rationale may betray the administration's true goal of reestablishing a deterrent against iran -- a step national security officials have long said was necessary but does not necessarily provide evidence of an imminent attack as required for the president to legally authorize lethal force.\n\na separate us official raised additional questions about the motive for the strike, telling cnn it had presidential authorization at this level and they opted for a preemptive option after the previous moves of maximum pressure didn't change the iranian pattern of behavior.\n\nformer cia director david petraeus seemed to also conclude that the objective of the strike was deterrence in a recent interview with foreign policy\n\nthe reasoning seems to be to show in the most significant way possible that the us is just not going to allow the continued violence—the rocketing of our bases, the killing of an american contractor, the attacks on shipping, on unarmed drones—without a very significant response, he said.\n\nmany people had rightly questioned whether american deterrence had eroded somewhat because of the relatively insignificant responses to the earlier actions. this clearly was of vastly greater importance. of course it also, per the defense department statement, was a defensive action given the reported planning and contingencies that soleimani was going to iraq to discuss and presumably approve, petraeus added.\n\nbut petraeus' comment noting the pentagon's assertion that the strike was defensive underscores the confusion caused by the administration's shifting legal justifications for the operation and failure to explain its definition of imminent.\n\ndemocrat sen. chris van hollen of maryland also told cnn that one of his representatives was at the friday briefing and said nothing that came out of the briefing changed my view that this was an unnecessary escalation of the situation in iraq and iran.\n\nvan hollen went on to say: while i can't tell you what was said, i can tell you, i have no additional information to support the administration's claim that this was an imminent attack on americans.\n\nthis story has been updated with additional developments sunday.
(cnn) — historically, travel in the american south has evoked a specific romantic image: guests in wide-brimmed hats sip mint juleps and sweet tea in white rocking chairs beneath weeping willows or among the colonnades of antebellum and georgian revival mansions.\n\nnow, that picture is changing as new chic hotels from louisiana to the carolinas are throwing tradition to the wind by embracing a contemporary aesthetic, more urban bauhaus and mid-century modern than neoclassical.\n\nthis new look -- defined by a combination of a kind of organic minimalism and nostalgic references to the not-so-distant past -- tends to feature elements such as exposed brick walls and original industrial beams and eclectic details from vintage typewriters to local contemporary artwork.\n\nthese nine hotels across the south are turning their backs on tara, disrupting preconceived notions of southern hospitality when you stay here:\n\n1. ace hotel, new orleans, louisiana\n\nwhen ace hotel arrived in new orleans in march of 2016 -- taking up residence in a converted nine-story art deco building that was barnett's furniture store from 1928 through the 1970s (the first local shop to carry scandinavian modern furniture) -- it was obvious that change had come to the big easy.\n\nmany would argue that the hipster hotelier (which rejects that label) pioneered the prevailing contemporary hotel experience, being first to emphasize what is local, authentic, minimal and even eccentric. their mandate is to build hotels as monuments to the cities they live in.\n\nthis ace, set in a warehouse district near downtown, has a live music venue, three keys, as well as an adjacent four-story addition imagined by architects eskew+domez+ripple with events spaces and local indie boutiques defend new orleans and friend. plus, the hotel's oyster bar is housed in an original creole cottage.\n\nin the lobby and restaurant, the designers preserved details such as terrazzo floors, corinthian columns and salvaged wrought-iron deco gates. trinkets, art books, turkish kilim rugs and vintage leather furniture, all sourced at local flea markets, pervade.\n\nas an additional local touch, 32 southern artists -- including 13 from new orleans -- were tapped to paint armoires in the rooms.\n\nace hotel new orleans, 600 carondelet street, new orleans, la 70130; +1 504-941-9191\n\n2. quirk hotel, richmond, virginia\n\nlike many small cities in recent years, livable richmond has attracted an influential creative class, who brought restaurants, shops and galleries.\n\nthe arrival of quirk hotel in september 2015 was emblematic of that shift: at the center of richmond's burgeoning arts & design district, among record, vintage shops and up-and-coming boutique brands like ledbury, the property is housed in an historic landmark, once the city's finest department store, jb mosby & co.

high-ranking transportation security administration official wrote monday in an internal email obtained by cnn.\n\nthe email from martin elam, the deputy federal security director overseeing five california airports, directed to all tsa personnel at palm springs international airport, exposes for the first time an acknowledgement that the partial government shutdown – now stretching into a third week – is having some impact on aviation security in at least one airport.\n\nit comes amid safety warnings from the major pilot, flight attendant and tsa employee unions.\n\ntsa has argued that security effectiveness will not be compromised and performance standards will not change.\n\nbut concerns about the number of callouts in palm springs have reached the point that security operations may be impacted and employees may be disciplined for missed shifts – potential further hardship for those already going without a paycheck.\n\nrelated: tsa senior leaders discuss how to keep screeners at their posts\n\nmore than 2 million passengers passed through the airport last year, according to the city of palm springs website. los angeles international airport, by comparison, handled more than 80 million passengers.\n\npalm springs airport is a small airport that requires a full team effort, said jim gregory, tsa's deputy assistant administrator, in a statement.\n\nthe deputy fsd who is referenced in the email obtained by cnn was simply expressing that all screening employees must report to work during the current lapse in appropriations as required by federal rules. tsa is monitoring screening operations at palm springs and has not seen any adverse impacts to operations.\n\non friday, cnn first reported that hundreds of tsa officers have called out from shifts at four major us airports.\n\ntsa says security concerns are unfounded and screening times have not been impacted. agency spokesman michael bilello on monday said that 4.6% of tsa employees missed a shift on monday nationwide, compared to 3.8% on the same day in 2018. the agency has not released data dating to the beginning of the shutdown on december 21.\n\njanuary is generally a slower month for air travel, but the agency has warned that wait times could increase. it provided data on tuesday showing that nearly all travelers nationwide are waiting less than 30 minutes to be screened.\n\nin the email, elam, the deputy federal security director overseeing palm springs, lax and three other los angeles-area airports, acknowledged security staffing worries and warned of disciplinary action at palm springs airport.\n\nmanagement is appreciative and sensitive to the burden the ongoing government shutdown is placing on each one of you, elam wrote. you are an essential employee and you are required to report for work to carry out essential duties.\n\ndue to excessive unscheduled absences recently experienced at psp (palm springs international airport) that has adversely impacted security operations, if you have an unscheduled absence, you will not be placed in an intermittent furlough status, elam added. your unauthorized unscheduled absence will be coded by payroll as absent without leave (awol). at the conclusion of the government shutdown, an employee's awol status may result in progressive disciplinary action.\n\nelam referred questions to the tsa press office.\n\nunion officials have warned the shutdown places tsa officers in a difficult position, as they are not receiving paychecks to cover the costs of working, such as commuting and childcare. some are seeking temporary employment – with more reliable pay dates – to make ends meet, union officials said.\n\nhydrick thomas, president of the national tsa employee union, told cnn on friday the callouts will definitely affect the flying public.\n\nthe impacts could compound the longer the shutdown lasts, union officials say. those manning the security checkpoint can be demoralized by the lack of pay, or exhausted and less sharp from covering extra shifts, according to union officials who are also employed by tsa. with insufficient staff, managers may open fewer security lanes, causing lines to grow longer and move more slowly. new recruits cannot be hired or trained without funding.\n\nthe loss of officers, while we're already shorthanded, will create a massive security risk for american travelers since we don't have enough trainees in the pipeline or the ability to process new hires, thomas said in a statement on monday.\n\ntsa administrator david pekoske and other senior agency officials held a conference call on monday to discuss the shutdown, two sources told cnn. among the topics addressed was the increase in call outs and how to ensure officers show up to work. pekoske also told officials on the call that security standards will not be lessened during the shutdown.\n\nit was not clear if the palm springs email was spurred by the discussion in that meeting, or was separate.\n\nthomas nolan, executive director of the palm springs airport, says he has not noticed any malfunction in how the airport is operating but added that he wouldn't have visibility on tsa staffing issues.\n\nrep. bennie thompson, a democrat who chairs the house homeland security committee, has asked tsa for additional information on the call outs and whether it has a contingency plan to address mass callouts or resignations among its workforce.\n\noffice of personnel management guidelines do specify that employees required to work during a shutdown will be considered absent without leave if they fail to show up, and that the classification can subject an employee to unspecified disciplinary action.

next ten years, he racked up seven arrests and struggled with addiction and post-traumatic stress. his life fell apart.\n\nveterans treatment court helped put it back together.\n\nin 2013, after another arrest, tim was given the chance to participate in the philadelphia veterans treatment court. instead of sitting behind bars, he was connected to intense treatment. in a courtroom surrounded by other veterans, including judge dugan, who served in iraq and afghanistan, tim started to come to terms with his experience.\n\nphoto: c/o melissa fitzgerald former west wing castmates melissa fitzgerald and dule hill attend veterans treatment court graduation in the philadelphia courtroom of judge patrick dugan.\n\nafter graduating veterans treatment court a few years ago, he reunited with his wife and children. he is committed to giving back. he's now a member of the veterans treatment court team, coordinating volunteer veteran mentors to support veterans who share the same struggles he did.\n\nwhen i heard tim's story, i had trouble reconciling it with the happy, respected person i saw in court that day. i couldn't believe how close we'd come to losing him to the system, and how much better off we are that he got a second chance.\n\ntragically, somewhere between 8-10% of those incarcerated in us jails and prisons are veterans. while veterans are incarcerated at significantly lower rates than nonveterans, those that are incarcerated have higher rates of mental health issues than nonveterans. but while it costs taxpayers around $30,000 a year to incarcerate one person, treating them actually saves money. treatment courts have been found to save up to $13,000 for every individual they serve.\n\nwe owe veterans every opportunity to heal and to lead productive lives.\n\nfor too long, this country has equated justice with punishment. by upholding the enduring, absolute value of every human, treatment courts are helping to change our national perspective on what it means to serve justice. there are more than 350 of these veteran-specific treatment courts across the united states, but that number falls far short of reaching every veteran in need.\n\nas we mark the 10th anniversary of these life-saving programs, and we commit to reducing the pain and suffering caused by the opioid crisis, we must double down on programs proven to work. programs like veterans treatment courts.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\nthat's why my fellow west wing cast members and i continue

source: cnn lookback: a week of protests in iran\n\nin the past, women who allowed their hijab to slip could be admonished by the religious police, but these forces have been less prominent under rouhani's regime. since his reelection last year, enforcement of the law has been somewhat relaxed.\n\nauthorities also announced that women driving with improper head coverings would no longer be arrested and would instead receive a relatively small fine.\n\nwhile the easing of enforcement has emboldened younger women to become more defiant, recent incidents in which they have removed their hijabs in protest could still lead to prison sentences.\n\nalthough rouhani does align himself with protesters from time to time … his allegiance appears to be to the system. so he has to walk a tightrope, ansary said. rouhani won because he made so many pledges to help reform many of the gender discriminatory laws. women voted for him in droves and so did the youth, but he has done very little to bring about significant change for iranian civil society.\n\nsoheila jaloodarzadeh, a female member of iranian parliament, said on wednesday during an event on women's rights that the protests were the culmination of years of restrictions, the semiofficial ilna news agency reported.\n\nwhen we restrict women, and put them under unnecessary pressure, exactly this is the reason for rebellions, jaloodarzadeh reportedly said. this is the reason … the daughters of revolution street are putting their headscarves on a stick.\n\ncnn's euan mckirdy contributed to this report.

afraid you might be behind on saving for retirement? there's one simple way to get ahead of pretty much everyone else.\n\nabout 80% of americans surveyed by voya financial said they hadn't taken the time to review or revise their retirement plan within the past year.\n\nso simply taking a look at how your 401(k) or ira performed in 2016 will mean you're already doing more than most americans.\n\nyou want to look at it at least once a year, if not quarterly, said james nichols, senior vice president at voya.\n\ncalculator: are you behind on retirement saving?\n\nbut you don't necessarily need to make changes to your game plan. here are four things to ask yourself to make sure you're on track in the new year.\n\n1. how much did i spend last year?\n\nit's hard to know how much money you'll need in retirement if you don't know how much you spend each year to support your lifestyle. experts suggest looking at a few months from the past year.\n\nmost people are blown away by their spend number, said tim mcgrath, a cfp and founding partner at riverpoint wealth management.\n\nthat's partly because they don't take into account the one-time purchases, like a new couch or furnace, that don't occur each month.\n\nthere's always something that's not in the budget that throws everything for a loop, mcgrath said.\n\n2. can i increase my future contributions?\n\ndon't think of your savings as a leftover. put it in your budget along with your expenses.\n\nmany financial planners suggest saving 15% of your gross income.\n\nwhen you're saving for a longer-term financial goal like retirement, it's prudent to save at least 15% of your income, nichols said.\n\nrelated: how much should i have saved for retirement right now?\n\nif you're not hitting that target yet, think about increasing your contribution by 1% at the start of the new year or when you get a raise.\n\nin 2017, you can defer up to $18,000 of your salary to your 401(k) and contribute as much as $5,500 to your ira -- the same amount as last year. (once you're 50 or older, those caps increase to $24,000 in a 401(k) and $6,500 in an ira.)\n\n3. did i max out my ira last year? there's still time.\n\nnew year's day has come and gone, but there's still time to play catchup on last year's savings goal. if you weren't able to contribute to your ira in 2016 (or simply forgot), but have the financial means to do so now -- you're in luck.\n\nyou get an extra three months (or until you file your 2016 taxes) to contribute up to the cap for your traditional, roth or sep ira, said megan gorman, managing partner at chequers financial management.\n\nif you've already hit the limit in 2016, you can continue to contribute to your ira and it will count toward the 2017 tax year.\n\nyou don't, however, get an extra three months to contribute up to the $18,000 max for your 401(k). any money you contribute in the new year will automatically count towards your 2017 limit.\n\n4. are my investments balanced?\n\nwhen you first set up your retirement portfolio you, hopefully, set a diversified mix of stocks and bonds that is appropriate for your age. the closer you get to retirement, the less risk you'll want to take on.\n\nchances are, you had a good year. overall, the stock market ended with gains in 2016 and the average investor made just over 5%, according to openfolio.\n\nbut sometimes your balance can get out of whack if particular stocks did better than others over the past year.\n\nnichols says a good rule of thumb is to rebalance your portfolio if any of your buckets are off by more than 5%.\n\nif, for example, you're goal was to have 25% of your portfolio in international stocks and now they take up more than 30%, you might want to make a change. to get back to your original plan, you can either contribute less of your money to international stocks this year, or sell some and buy more of whatever bucket in your portfolio fell in value last year.\n\nwhat is your biggest personal finance hurdle in the new year? share your story with katie.lobosco@cnn.com and you could be featured in an upcoming cnnmoney article.

(cnn) —\n\nchina is getting closer to equipping its warships with electromagnetic railguns, state media reports – which, if true, means its fleet could soon boast some of the most advanced weapons technology on the planet.\n\nciting cctv, the state-run global times on thursday reported the underlying railgun technology – which utilizes electrical power rather than explosives to launch projectiles – was based on fully independent intellectual property, rather than copied from other countries.\n\nunconfirmed sightings of a chinese landing ship apparently equipped with a test railgun in an undisclosed location have circulated around the internet this week.\n\nmilitary expert carl schuster, former director of operations at the us pacific command's joint intelligence center, told cnn that if the reports were accurate, the weapon was likely to be a year or two away from being operational.\n\nthey'll say it's operational – what that mean the operational evaluation has started, (and they're) testing it under more realistic conditions, he said. typically you're looking at a year before being deployed.\n\nschuster said it was significant that china appeared to be transitioning from copying foreign weapon designs to developing their own technology.\n\nit also tells you (that china) is no longer 10-15 years behind (the us)… they are now approaching parity with the west in terms of weapons development, he added.\n\ntechnological sea change\n\nrailgun technology, which uses electromagnetic force to send projectiles up to 125 miles at 7.5 times the speed of sound, is cheaper and more accurate than traditional gunpowder-based methods.\n\nusing a massive electrical pulse rather than a chemical propellant, the railgun can launch projectiles much farther than the 13-nautical-mile range of the us navy's standard 5-inch naval gun, the us office of naval research says.\n\nphoto: u.s. navy an image from the us navy showing some of the railgun tech in development.\n\nrailgun projectiles also don't need explosive warheads – they do their damage with sheer speed.\n\n(railguns) give you more firepower, more range, (and they can be better) guided, as you control acceleration in the barrel, schuster added.\n\nchina's moab?\n\nthe claim that china is a step closer to having a combat-ready railgun comes on the heels of another global times report that a chinese arms company has tested a massive bomb which, according to a chinese military analyst quoted in the story, can easily and completely wipe out fortified ground targets such as reinforced buildings, bastions and defense shelters.\n\nthe device, developed by chinese arms giant china north industries group corporation, better known as norinco, is approximately 5 to 6 meters (17 to 20 feet) long, according to wei dongxu, the quoted analyst.\n\nwhile smaller, the chinese bomb is similar in capability to the us' gbu-43/b massive ordnance air blast bomb (moab), nicknamed the mother of all bombs.\n\nmoab, the us military's most powerful non-nuclear bomb, was first used operationally in 2017, when one was dropped on isis targets in afghanistan, according to us officials.
(cnn) hoping to give back to the frontline workers who have risked their lives throughout the pandemic, a college student has created a program that offers free tutoring to their children.\n\nbrett mozarsky, a senior at haverford college in pennsylvania, experienced firsthand the isolation that students could feel as all of his classes moved online for remote learning. he understood that without access to important academic and social resources at school, students could struggle especially if their parents were unavailable to help tutor them.\n\ndetermined to make a change, mozarsky began to develop free for the frontline tutors in march as covid-19 began to spread across the country. he wanted to give students a helping hand while offering the needed support that frontline workers may not have been able to offer their own children.\n\ni felt even more concerned for the children of frontline workers, who, like their peers, might have been struggling with remote learning, but were also further disadvantaged by the fact that their parents might not have as much time as they normally would to be at home and help their children with schoolwork, mozarsky told cnn.\n\nfrontline workers have made tremendous sacrifices to keep us safe and healthy throughout this pandemic. i only wanted to give back to these amazing individuals and their families in some way for all that they have done for us.\n\nread more
laconia, new hampshire (cnn) pete buttigieg isn't known for showing emotion. but on tuesday, minutes after the first tranche of delayed iowa caucuses results gave him a narrow lead, he choked up.\n\nthe former south bend, indiana, mayor was visibly emotional here in new hampshire as he reflected on what his success in iowa -- as the first top tier gay candidate from a major american political party -- could mean to lgbtq youth across the country.\n\nthis validates the idea that we can have a message, the same message, connect in urban and rural and suburban communities, that we can reach out to democrats, and to independents, and even to some future former republicans, ready to bring change to this country, buttigieg said.\n\nthen buttigieg's voice started to shake.\n\nthis validates for a kid somewhere in a community wondering if he belongs or she belongs or they belong in their own family, that if you believe in yourself and your country, there is a lot backing up the belief, he said.\n\nbuttigieg was joined at the end of his town hall by husband, chasten buttigieg. the two embraced on stage to cheers.\n\nbuttigieg, in an interview with cnn in new hampshire on tuesday, struck that same tone.\n\nit's extraordinary, he said of his slim lead. it also, i hope, means something to a lot of people wondering if they fit in, people who are different, people who don't know if they belong in their community, or in their family. this is a proof you can believe in yourself and in your country.\n\nbuttigieg, who came out in an op-ed in 2015, has reluctantly embraced his unlikely role as a symbol of lgbtq progress. while he speaks about it across the country, it is not central to his candidacy, nor is it something that regularly comes up at events.\n\nstill, buttigieg's identity and his campaign have been inextricably linked. earlier in his run, the mayor often fielded questions about being gay and running for president, and some of his most notable early campaign moments focused on the historic nature of his candidacy.\n\nthe former mayor told an audience in april that, if you had shown me exactly what it was that made me gay, i would have cut it out with a knife.\n\nif you could have offered me a pill that could make me straight, he added, i would have swallowed it before you could give me a swig of water.\n\nbuttigieg also wrote in his pre-campaign memoir that he worried that his coming out would define him beyond what he had accomplished in his young life.\n\ni had strongly supported the causes from the beginning, but did not want to be defined by them, he wrote of lgbtq rights.\n\nand while his identity doesn't come up in every event, some of buttigieg's most well received lines have been about being gay and his marriage to chasten, whom he wed in 2018.\n\nsitting down to christmas dinner at the side of my husband, whose marriage to me, our family -- not its well-being, but its existence -- comes by the grace of single vote on the united states supreme court, buttigieg said in december 2018, just a month before he started exploring a presidential run.\n\nand as the iowa race came to a close, buttigieg often heralded the fact that same sex marriage was legalized in iowa in 2009.\n\ni was also not here, but watching, when iowa took a step that filled me with a lot of hope, buttigieg said. it was a step that gave me permission to believe that one day, i could wear this wedding ring, that's on my finger.\n\nthe mayor has also used his identity as a way to answer a key question to voters: how will you handle attacks from donald trump?\n\nbuttigieg, in response, often touts that he grew up gay in indiana as a proof of his mettle on the campaign trail. and the line usually gets the audience to laugh.\n\nbut this moment on tuesday is markedly different. democrats like annise parker, the head of the buttigieg-backing victory fund and the former mayor of houston, heralded the lead as a step forward.\n\npete's strong showing in iowa represents a revolution in american politics, upending traditional notions of electability and proving america is ready to elect its first openly gay president, parker, who was one of the first gay mayors of a major us city when she was elected in 2010, said. with defeating donald trump top of mind, iowa voters determined pete is the best candidate to do it, a powerful statement about our progress as a country as this primary season begins.
(cnn) — i'll just step out for a second, says aerial photographer timo lieber, before swinging out of the helicopter with his camera, just a few hundred meters over the glittering london cityscape.\n\ncnn is with the award-winning german-born and london-based photographer on one of his nighttime shoots over the uk capital, as part of his astonishing photo series lights of london.\n\ni love london and it feels like home now, he says. it is actually a quite chaotic place but it looks sensational when you are up there in the air.\n\n'fly with the right guys'\n\ngerman-born photographer takes incredible aerial photographs of the uk capital by hanging out of a helicopter just a few hundred meters above the city\n\nlieber's technique involves strapping himself into a helicopter with the seats ripped out, then hanging out of the aircraft to take his photos. the shoots over densely peopled areas require special permission, but he knows the right people.\n\nyou can basically do what you want if you fly with the right guys, he says.\n\nlieber's methods may be high adrenaline but the resulting images are serene and eerily beautiful.\n\nthe thing about aerial photography is that you are so far moved from the subject you are actually shooting, [it] allows you to play with compositions, explains lieber. you can play with colors, with textures, with geometry, so that actually keeps things very, very simple.\n\ninspired by our environment and the interaction between humans and nature, he travels around the globe to search for impressive images, from remote deserts to the arctic circle.\n\nuncommon perspective\n\nthe way i started shooting was just shooting abstract landscapes, he says. in series such as earth patterns and earth etchings, very often you wouldn't know what it is that i am shooting.\n\nnow he's turned to attention to big city life and his adopted home town. the main reason i went up there was to just really document the change that london is going through. one skyscraper is going up after the other. the aerial view is a very uncommon perspective you can take, he adds.\n\nit just shows something that looks totally unreal from above and just different [...] you can use it to tell a story.
(cnn) it is officially, finally 2021. but while everyone on earth has had enough of the year that was, americans need to gird themselves for a bit more 2020, at least to start, as a large portion of republican lawmakers put their names next to president donald trump's effort to overturn the election.\n\nthe president has brought his drama show back to washington early , perhaps realizing his time in the white house is down to days and counting. he's also hoping to pressure republican lawmakers to back his wild and inaccurate claims of fraud when the electoral votes that seal his exit are counted in what's normally an antiquated ceremony.\n\nhe will also travel to georgia for his last political rally as president, when he encourages voters there to show up for the all-important january 5 runoff and protect republicans' senate majority. there are, as of this writing, two developing complications for trump. he's spent months attacking the electoral system as fraudulent, particularly in georgia , where he lost. and one of the republican candidates, sen. david perdue, will have to quarantine after coming into contact with someone who tested positive for covid-19.\n\nthere will be a show january 6. cnn's jake tapper reported thursday that as many as 140 house republicans could vote to throw out electoral votes from swing states. that's a strong majority of the republicans in the house trying to overturn the election and swear fealty to the president.\n\nit's an easier vote in the house, where objections to the election are destined to fall against the larger number of democrats in that chamber.\n\nsenators who bit their tongues during his presidency will have a chance to find their independence.\n\nthere will be calls for sanity. nebraska sen. ben sasse criticized those who would object to the electoral votes of pennsylvania, and perhaps other states, when they're counted january 6.\n\ni have been urging my colleagues also to reject this dangerous ploy, sasse wrote in a six-part facebook post , after sen. josh hawley, a missouri republican, said he would be the senator who forced votes on the objections.\n\nit'll be an aggravating vote for those senate republicans running for reelection in 2022, when the party is defending more senate seats than democrats.\n\nthere will be a split in the gop. a vote for the objections trump wants is a vote for conspiracy theory over fact and against the democratic will of the country.\n\na vote against the objections is to accept the decision of the people but defy the grassroots of the gop and fail a fealty test to trump, likely inviting a primary challenge in the near future.\n\nfew senate republicans want to make this choice, which is why party elders had tried to shield themselves from it. but now that hawley has decided to object, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has made it clear to lawmakers he's giving them room to vote their conscience, according to a source familiar with a thursday conference call on which mcconnell asked hawley -- who was not in attendance -- to explain his rationale.\n\nstill, mcconnell went on to tell his colleagues that even with a career as long as his, the vote would mark one of the most significant, perhaps the most significant, he'd ever cast -- and that it would mark the same for each senator on the call, two people familiar with the call told cnn.\n\nbut this intraparty split will carry over to other questions. as trump weighs in, unbound by any sort of official responsibility, his sway over the party will be tested.\n\npresident trump's tweets in favor of $2,000 stimulus checks got several gop senators to endorse the idea, although mcconnell effectively killed it\n\nwhen former president trump tweets in favor of something, will republicans pay attention?\n\nthere will be a reckoning over the president's twitter account. even after he's left office, the president will have access to his twitter account. it's been his preferred mode of communication while in office. the problem for the soon-to-be former president is that he may not be given the same deference by social media companies out of office as he's been given as leader of the free world.\n\ntwitter and facebook have taken to marking as suspect the posts in which he spreads outright falsehoods about his election loss, but it may soon become difficult for those companies to justify allowing him to spread them at all.\n\naccounts have been suspended for less than what trump does on a daily basis and the social media companies will come under immediate pressure to censure trump, perhaps by suspending his account.\n\nthe effects of such a move, were it to occur, would be interesting not only to see if his power to influence is clipped without his platform, but also to hasten gop scrutiny of section 230, a provision of telecom law that separates the companies from the content users publish on their sites.\n\nthere will be a split among democrats. it's much easier to be united in pursuit of power than it is to stay united in power. trump, to his credit, was able to effectively marshal republicans, often through fear and bullying, during his time in office. as president, it's unlikely biden will use those same tactics. and he'll have to contend with progressives on the left who want more attention to big problems like climate change and inequality that require systemic change the moderates in his party have less interest in pursuing. a year from now, it will be much easier for republicans to focus on biden's policies -- and he's likely to be a relatively moderate president -- in a way to aggravate and turn off progressives. vermont sen. bernie sanders won't quietly let biden take the moderate route. neither will massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, new york rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez or the congressional black caucus.\n\nthe proof of these divides is already evident in the scrutiny biden has faced from progressives in the selection of his cabinet.\n\nhis ability to navigate the demands of the groups that rallied behind his campaign, and navigate around republican obstruction, will determine whether he can get anything done in the white house.\n\nthere will be a majority in the senate. we just don't know yet which party will have it. that depends on what happens in georgia's twin us senate runoffs tuesday. if the two republican incumbents -- sens. david perdue and kelly loeffler -- win, republicans will have 51 votes and control access to the senate floor. given mcconnell's expertise in obstruction and interest in the 2022 midterms, a 51-seat majority could be biden's biggest presidential headache. if the democratic challengers -- jon ossoff and raphael warnock -- win, the resulting 50-50 tie won't give democrats much wiggle room to pass legislation, but it will give them the ability to get measures on the senate floor with vice president-elect kamala harris able to break ties as president of the senate.\n\nthere will be so much more covid. the beginning of biden's presidency will likely be judged more for what he does to kickstart the use of covid vaccines than for any large policy proposals. the country is at war with the disease and, as he prepares to take office, thousands of americans are dying each day. he's promised to move heaven and earth to get vaccines out to americans, something more easily said than done as he navigates public skepticism of vaccines.\n\nthere will be something new. think back to the beginning of 2020, when covid was not yet known to be in the country, and the overriding political story was the historic impeachment of trump for pressuring foreign governments to help him taint biden.\n\none year later, those words seem like something from a different era. covid rages, impeachment feels like a footnote to history and, rather than suffer trump's sabotage, biden will soon be president.\n\nthe coming year is sure to include its own twists, and our collective view of this strange and tumultuous period will change as it's stretched through time and perspective.
