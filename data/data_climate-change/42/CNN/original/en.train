EpiPen maker Mylan got a rare scolding from shareholders who are fuming over a $98 million pay package for its former CEO.\n\nA majority of Mylan shareholders on Thursday rejected the drug company's 2016 plan for paying its executives. Critics have blasted the plan as outrageous given the controversy over EpiPen price hikes.\n\nIt's highly unusual for investors to vote down say-on-pay proposals. The Mylan vote signals deep dissension over the $98 million in compensation awarded to former CEO Robert Coury, who is now the drug maker's executive chairman. Mylan CEO Heather Bresch was also awarded $13.8 million in total compensation and a larger equity award in 2016.\n\nThe shareholder vote was nonbinding. Mylan said its board of directors and compensation committee will carefully consider these results as it speaks to investors and designs its compensation programs going forward.\n\nThe company declined to tell CNNMoney whether the vote will trigger an adjustment to the 2016 pay awards that shareholders disapproved of.\n\nThe thumbs-down vote was a rare and resounding rebuke, said Eleanor Bloxham, the CEO of the The Value Alliance, which advises boards on corporate governance.\n\nBloxham said that just 2% or 3% of say-on-pay proposals fail to receive a majority of shareholder support. One high-profile rejection occurred in 2012 when Citigroup (C) shareholders rejected a $15 million raise for then-CEO Vikram Pandit.\n\nEven though Mylan isn't required to change its compensation plans, Bloxham strongly urged it to do so anyway.\n\nYou can legally go through a yellow light, but is that the best way to drive? No. That's exactly what got Mylan in the position it's in today, Bloxham said.\n\nRelated: EpiPen maker faces revolt over exec's $98M pay package\n\nMylan raised eyebrows earlier this year by awarding Coury $98 million despite the bitter public criticism the company got for jacking up the price on a two-pack of EpiPens by 400% over seven years. Mylan's stock also plunged 29% last year.\n\nMylan has defended Coury's compensation, saying most of it was earned during his 15-year tenure as a senior exec when he engineered the company's strong financial performance.\n\nA coalition of pension funds launched a campaign to oust Mylan's directors, citing the compensation practices and a failure to provide adequate oversight in the EpiPen scandal. That campaign was backed by Institutional Shareholder Services, an advisory firm that recommended investors vote against all Mylan directors.\n\nDespite the opposition, Mylan said the board of directors was re-elected. Mylan did not release vote totals yet so it's not clear what level of support directors received.\n\nIt's possible Mylan's directors received less than a majority of the votes cast. That's because the company's bylaws require two-thirds of the votes cast at a meeting to unseat a director.\n\nIt's simply untenable for directors who received substantial opposition to remain in the boardroom. Doing so would further erode confidence in this company, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer said in a statement.\n\nStringer and New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli led the campaign against Mylan's board, citing public relations debacles and costly oversight failures.
Hong Kong (CNN) The Chinese province at the center of the novel coronavirus outbreak reported a record spike in deaths Thursday, bringing the total number to more than 1,300 people globally, as experts warned the epidemic could create havoc in less prepared countries.\n\nHealth authorities in Hubei announced an additional 242 deaths and 14,840 cases of the virus, known officially as Covid-19, as of Thursday morning, the largest single-day rise since the epidemic began and almost 10 times the number of cases confirmed the previous day.\n\nThe government explained the spike as due to a change in how cases are tabulated -- the total will now include clinically diagnosed cases after rising numbers of residents complained about the difficulty in getting tested and treated for the virus.\n\nClinically diagnosed cases are those patients who demonstrate all the symptoms of Covid-19 but have been unable to be scientifically tested, or died before they were tested. The hope is that more people will be able to receive treatment by allowing doctors to diagnose them with the virus.\n\nAlmost 34,000 patients have been hospitalized across Hubei, the central Chinese province of which Wuhan is capital, including 1,400 or so in a critical condition. So far, 3,441 patients have recovered and been discharged.\n\nGlobally, the virus has infected more than 60,000 people, with the vast majority of cases in mainland China. On Thursday, China said it has confirmed 59,804 cases on the mainland, an increase of 15,152 cases from the previous day.\n\nThe death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in the country now stands at 1,367, according to China's National Health Commission.\n\nOnly two deaths have occurred outside of mainland China.\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) officials described China's decision to broaden their definition of what constitutes a confirmed case as a necessary measure.\n\nWhen the situation is evolving, you change your definition just to make sure you can monitor the disease accurately, and this is what they have done recently -- change the case definition to incorporate more cases that were not in the initial case definition, but also integrate cases that are both asymptomatic or with little symptom, Dr. Sylvie Briand, director of WHO's Infectious Hazards Management Department, said during a press conference Wednesday.\n\nHowever, the major increase in the number of deaths and cases of the coronavirus appears to dash hopes that the outbreak was leveling off. It comes as additional cases were confirmed on the quarantined cruise ship docked in the Japanese city of Yokohama, and in the US, where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned the country can and should be prepared for this new virus to gain a foothold.\n\nIn the UK too, a new case was confirmed Wednesday in the capital London, with health officials warning that more were likely to follow.\n\nWHO officials had previously expressed some optimism at the apparently stabilizing outbreak in China, but even then they cautioned that the virus could still spread elsewhere.\n\nThis outbreak could still go in any direction, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday.\n\nWe have to invest in preparedness, Tedros said, adding that richer countries should help invest in countries with a weaker health system. He warned the virus could create havoc if it reaches a country whose health system is not capable of handling such an epidemic.\n\nCase number confusion\n\nThe massive increase in the number of cases exposes confusion over just how to diagnose the virus globally, not least in central China, where residents with symptoms had expressed frustration that they were not able to get treatment due to a delay in diagnosis.\n\nThose delays could be significant, with some reports of patients waiting up to a week for their results, as the testing kits were sent from Hubei to a lab in Beijing. While there have been efforts to speed up the process, scientific testing of samples is difficult and time consuming, and allowing doctors to diagnose patients will enable far more people to receive treatment, including in several purpose-built hospitals dedicated to treating the virus in Wuhan.\n\nDelays in testing are not confined to China. In the US, the CDC currently requires that all potential samples are shipped to its central laboratories for full testing.\n\nIn its guidance for hospitals , the CDC also warns that in the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected. However, it adds that if a person is showing symptoms but tests negative for Covid-19, it is likely that the virus is not the cause of their illness.\n\nSpeaking at a US Senate hearing on Wednesday, Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, said that testing was not been done aggressively enough and should be expanded to cover more symptoms.\n\nI think that we should be leaning in very aggressively to broaden diagnostic screening right now, particularly in communities where there was a lot of immigration, where these outbreaks could emerge, to identify them early enough that they'll be small enough that we can intervene to prevent more epidemic spread in this country, he said.\n\nGottlieb pointed to Singapore, which has now identified around 50 cases, to make a point about the US, which receives similar numbers of travelers from China every year.\n\nOn a statistical basis, there's no reason to believe that if Singapore got implants of this virus, we didn't. You would expect them to be identified earlier in Singapore as a densely populated island, he said. But it does suggest, at least to me, that we probably have some community spread right now that we just haven't identified yet.\n\nHe also questioned the quality of data coming out of China -- something many outside observers have been doing, and the radical shift in how cases are diagnosed will likely not help.\n\nI don't trust the reporting in China, and I also believe that the China numbers reflect the most severe cases, so we're getting a skewed view of the case fatality rate and how severe this is, Gottlieb said.\n\nCounting milder or asymptomatic cases could make the case fatality rate drop significantly, he added, but even a case fatality rate of .2 or .5 could be catastrophic if this is highly contagious and spreads around the world.\n\nSpeaking at the same hearing, Asha George, executive director of the Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense, said that China may be limited in its testing and reporting resources, versus simply a lack of desire on the part of the Chinese government to report.\n\nIn public health schools, George said students are taught to assume they don't have complete data and account for cases they don't yet know about.\n\nWe're often taught to multiply by seven or eight times what you've been told. For every one case you see, there are seven or eight out there that you don't, she explained. So that means actually we'd be looking at hundreds of thousands of cases. I think that's the scale at which we should be planning.\n\nJUST WATCHED Passenger on cruise ship denied port of entry: We are not a plague ship Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Passenger on cruise ship denied port of entry: We are not a plague ship 04:38\n\nCruise ship misery\n\nOutside of China, the largest single outbreak remains on a cruise ship in the Japanese port of Yokohama, south of Tokyo.\n\nJapanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said an additional 44 virus cases had been confirmed on board the\n\nDiamond Princess as of Thursday, bringing the total number on board to 219.\n\nKato did not give a breakdown by nationality of the new cases, nor of passengers versus crew. CNN's latest tally indicates that at least 24 Americans have tested positive for the virus aboard the ship.\n\nThe Health Minister also said that people who had tested negative for the virus and are over 80 years old, or have a non-virus medical condition requiring attention, will be allowed to leave the ship and move to a government medical facility, if they wish. He did not give a timeline for that process. Already on Tuesday, an unknown number of passengers with non-virus medical conditions were allowed to disembark.\n\nFrustration is growing, however, among the thousands passengers and crew on board, who have been unable to leave the ship for a week now.\n\nSpeaking to CNN, one crew member said she fears the crew are at greater risk of being exposed to the outbreak because they are not being quarantined in the same way as the passengers and are having to continue working to take care of the guests.\n\nSonali Thakkar, 24, from Mumbai, said she and her colleague -- who she shares a cabin with -- became ill with a headache, cough and a fever two days ago. Her supervisor told her to stop working and she is currently staying in her cabin in isolation.\n\nI'm not eating very well and have been having fevers, she told CNN in a Skype call Wednesday. We all are really scared and tense.\n\nThakkar fears that the virus may be spreading around the crew members. At least five have already tested positive for the virus.\n\nThere was more positive news for another cruise ship, which has been struggling to find a port to dock at for several days after countries turned it away due to fears over a potential coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe MS Westerdam had been in a holding pattern at sea after it was denied entry by Taiwan, the Philippines and Japan despite the ship having no confirmed cases on board. It is due to arrive in Cambodia Thursday morning, after authorities there approved it to dock there.\n\nTedros, the WHO director, thanks Cambodia for welcoming the ship.\n\nThis is an example of the international solidarity we have consistently been calling for, the WHO director-general said, adding that outbreaks can bring out the best and worst in people and that stigmatizing individuals or entire nations does nothing but harm the response.
Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n\nPresident Trump cast his ire at weak Republicans less than an hour before Congress begins the formal process of certifying the election for Joe Biden.\n\nHe told the crowd of supporters he would be using the term weak Republicans going forward.\n\nThere's so many weak Republicans and we have great ones, Jim Jordan. These guys they're out there, the House guys are fighting, but it's incredible. Many of the Republicans, I helped them get in, I helped them get elected. I helped Mitch get elected. I helped, I could name 24 of them, let's say, I won't bore you with it. And then all of a sudden you have something like this and it's like, oh, gee, maybe I'll talk to the President sometime later, Trump said.\n\nNow it's amazing: the weak Republicans, the pathetic Republicans, and that's what happens, he said.\n\nThe Republican party, Trump said, is constantly fighting with their hands tied behind their back… and we're going to have to fight much harder, and Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us, and if he doesn't that will be a sad day for our country.\n\nTrump went on to thank the warriors who will contest the election results today.\n\nRemember: While some GOP lawmakers are expected to object to some states' electoral results, those objections will not change the results of the election. Every Democrat and some Republicans will reject the challenges in both chambers, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nAdditionally, Despite Trump's allegations about the 2020 election, there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud, and there is no evidence that electors from the electoral college were fraudulently chosen, as all states have certified their elections.\n\nTrump also suggested he could join the protesters walking from the Ellipse to Capitol Hill. He named the dozen Senators who will object — Senators who have stepped up, we want to thank them, he said.\n\nWe're gonna walk down to the Capitol. And we're gonna cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women. And we're probably not going to be cheering, so much for some of them, because you'll never take back our country with weakness, you have to show strength and you have to be strong, Trump said.
One down, one to go.\n\nAfter 23 straight drawings with no grand prize winner, one winning ticket was sold for the $450 million Mega Millions jackpot in Friday night's drawing, according to the Mega Millions website.\n\nThe winning numbers were 28, 30, 39, 59, 70 and the Mega Millions ball was 10.\n\nThe winning ticket was sold at a 7-Eleven in Port Richey, Florida, according to the website.\n\nOf course, the winner will only get the full $450 million if he or she accepts the prize via 29 annual payments. If the winner takes a lump-sum payout, as the vast majority of winners do, the cash payout will equal about $281 million, less taxes.\n\nEight other lotto players in six states won big money. Players in California, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Virginia, Oklahoma and Texas won $1 million by matching 5 numbers. Two other players -- one in Oklahoma and one in Texas -- won $3 million because they matched 5 numbers and purchased a megaplier that increased their winnings.\n\nRelated: Who is buying Powerball and Mega Millions tickets?\n\nThe next Mega Millions drawing will be on Tuesday for a $40 million jackpot.\n\nIf you're not one of the lucky winners, fear not. There's a chance to land an even bigger payday with the $570 million Powerball jackpot. The next drawing for that game will be Saturday at 11 p.m. ET.\n\nPowerball and Mega Millions are the largest lottery games in the country, but their jackpots don't usually grow to such staggering heights at the same time.\n\nBut it could become a more common phenomenon. The rules for both games were recently tweaked -- Powerball in 2015 and Mega Millions in October 2017 -- to give the games longer odds.\n\nRelated: Why billions of dollars in lottery prizes go unclaimed\n\nSmaller chances of snagging the jackpots means the prize pools have a chance to grow bigger before a winning ticket is sold. Meanwhile, the games can attract more players by brandishing their eye-popping prizes.\n\nPowerball grabbed headlines a couple years ago when its grand prize grew to nearly $1.6 billion. It marked the largest lottery prize in history. Three winning ticket holders eventually claimed the prize in a January 2016 drawing.\n\nAnd thanks to the October rule change, Mega Millions now has slighter worse odds than Powerball.\n\nSpecifically, the chances of holding a Mega Millions ticket with the winning numbers is about 1 in 302.6 million, while the odds of winning Powerball's jackpot stand at 1 in 292.2 million.
(CNN) — The 2017 hurricane season was not kind to the Caribbean, when Hurricanes Irma and Maria barreled across numerous islands, inflicting major damage on places that include Barbuda, Dominica and Puerto Rico.\n\nHowever, other islands escaped unscathed or weren't hit as hard.\n\nBut in a good sign of recovery for the whole region, a spate of hotels have opened up along with hotels that have been able to make repairs and reopen.\n\nHere are 14 of the best new hotels and resorts that have opened in destinations around the Caribbean in 2018:\n\n1. Park Hyatt St. Kitts, St. Kitts & Nevis\n\nThis splashy five-star resort isn't just the first Park Hyatt on St. Kitts, but the first Park Hyatt in the Caribbean.\n\nLuckily, the fall hurricane season spared tiny St. Kitts, allowing the 126-room property to open in a remote section of the undeveloped island.\n\nOf interest is a replica sugar mill where guests can take fitness, yoga and meditation classes, but the real highlight just may be the 37,000-square-foot Miraval Life in Balance Spa, from none other than the renowned Miraval brand.\n\nThose wishing to venture off-site have their pick of outdoor activities, including volcano hiking, but the Park Hyatt can also arrange trips to the UNESCO Brimstone Hill Fortress or provide an island historian for a truly local experience.\n\nPark Hyatt St. Kitts , Banana Bay, South East Peninsula, Parish of St. George, St. Kitts; +1 869 468 1234\n\n2. Baha Mar, Bahamas\n\nThe SLS Baha Mar brings a new level of glam to the Bahamas. Courtesy SLS Baha Mar\n\nTrue, the Bahamas are technically in the Atlantic, not the Caribbean, but we'd be remiss not to include this massive $4 billion dollar undertaking that's rolling out in three stages.\n\nOnce the dust settles this spring, guests can expect three hotels adding more than 2,000 rooms, an 18-hole Jack Nicklaus golf course, the Caribbean's largest casino, the first flagship ESPA spa in the region, more than 30 high-end shopping options, and enough restaurants and nightlife to rival a small city.\n\nThe first phase debuted last spring with the sprawling Grand Hyatt. This hotel alone encompasses 1,800 rooms, the aforementioned spa, casino and golf course, plus six pools, five restaurants and nine bars and lounges.\n\nThe second phase unveiled the trendy, higher-end SLS this past November, where scenesters have their pick of a rooftop lounge, nightclub and VIP pool - with invite-only parties, of course.\n\nRelated content 100 best beaches around the world\n\nGood luck getting reservations at Katsuya (modern sushi) and Fi'lia, Italian comfort food from James Beard Award winner Michael Schwartz.\n\nThe final phase is slated for this spring, adding Rosewood, the highest-end option, to the mix.\n\nIts 185 rooms and five villas will sport Bahamian décor, while on-site dining will also skew local, from a farm-to-table restaurant to a lounge for afternoon tea.\n\nPlus with a spa, fitness center, salon and barber shop, two pools and a private beach, guests will have little need to access the rest of Baha Mar - but that would be a shame.\n\nBaha Mar , Baha Mar Boulevard, Nassau, Bahamas; +1 242 788 8000\n\n3. The Other Side, Bahamas\n\nThe Other Side in the Bahamas offers the chance to stay in upscale beach shacks. Courtesy The Other Side\n\nOn the completely opposite end of the Bahamian spectrum is The Other Side, a solar-powered collection of not-inexpensive tents and shacks on quiet Eleuthera Island.\n\nWhile not a hotel in the strictest sense, the accommodations are far more luxurious than the average hotel room, with three beachfront sleeping tents that are more like cottages, each furnished with hardwood floors, four-poster beds, two couches and modern décor; meanwhile, the shacks take it to the next level with decks and dual sinks.\n\nAir conditioning and WiFi are other indicators that you won't be roughing it.\n\nRelated content Kayaking in the Bahamas is a great way to explore the islands\n\nAs for other amenities, these are separated into four different tent structures encouraging communal dining, drinking and socializing.\n\nEven though The Other Side is all about decompressing with activities such as poolside yoga, guests needing a change can take a short boat ride to Harbour Island.\n\n4. Jewel Grande Montego Bay Resort & Spa, Jamaica\n\nNo one would blame you for never leaving the Jewel Grande Montego Bay's pools. Courtesy Jewel Grande\n\nJamaica has experienced a boom of of new hotel openings this past year, but Jewel Grande in Montego Bay stands apart for its all-inclusive, all butler-service rooms - the first of its kind on the island - and all just 15 minutes from Sangster International Airport.\n\nVying for guests' attention are 11 bars and restaurants, serving everything from local Jamaican to Asian-fusion, plus two pools and a 30,000-square-foot spa with 14 treatment rooms.\n\nThe bi-evel spa even houses a Himalayan salt room, juice bar and fitness studio for yoga, pilates, barre and reggaelates - like it sounds, a blend of pilates and reggae music.\n\nFor something different, book a tour to visit the 18th-century Great House at Rose Hall, considered to be the most haunted spot (well, that you can visit) on the island.\n\n5. Serafina Beach Hotel, Puerto Rico\n\nSince tourists have been torn about whether or not they should visit Puerto Rico during the island's recovery, Puerto Rico Tourism has recently declared the island officially open for business.\n\nAnd in perfect timing, the boutique Serafina Beach Hotel, the first from NYC's Serafina Restaurant Group, is open for business.\n\nCombining the best of city and ocean, the beachfront Serafina is found in San Juan's trendy Condado section, complete with a modern-bordering-on-hipster vibe.\n\nWith an emphasis on design, guests can anticipate rooms that are minimal yet inviting, with warm woods and pops of seafoam green complementing the stereotypically blue water beyond each room's picture window.\n\nThis design scheme continues throughout the hotel, from the espresso bar by day, cocktail bar by night to the beachfront infinity pool. And of course no happening hotel would be complete without offering yoga classes and loaner bikes.\n\nSerafina Beach Hotel , 1045 Avenida Doctor Ashford, San Juan, Puerto Rico; hello@serafinabeachhotel.com\n\n6. Gran Hotel Manzana Kempinski La Habana, Cuba\n\nHotel stock hasn't been able to keep pace with demand in Havana, which makes the addition of the Gran Hotel Manzana Kempinski all the more exciting.\n\nWhy? Because it's supposedly the first five-star hotel to open in Cuba since the Revolution.\n\nThe Gran Hotel is also notable since it occupies what used to be Cuba's first shopping mall, a striking building from the turn of the 20th century. Inside, guests will find rooms decked out in understated luxury with colorful accents, while suites command enviable city views.\n\nThere's also a European-inspired spa with eight treatment rooms, an infinity rooftop pool overlooking Old Havana, and six restaurants and bars, including a tobacco lounge. El Floridita, one of Hemingway's old haunts, is just across the way.\n\n7. Turks Cay Resort and Marina, Turks and Caicos\n\nThe incredibly luxurious Turks Cay Resort and Marina will be the latest project from Arik Kislin, co-owner of Hotel Gansevoort in NYC, and due to open next year in Grace Bay.\n\nTo be expected for this level of luxury, there will be a movie theater, three pools, a full spa with a hydrotherapy section and waterfall pool, plus a cigar bar.\n\nAnd as it's in Grace Bay, an underdeveloped section of the island, guests will have access to one of the most beautiful stretches of beach in the Caribbean.\n\nTurks Cay Resort and Marina , Turks and Caicos, 375 Grace Bay Road Providenciales, Turks And Caicos Islands 10001\n\n8. Hodges Bay Resort and Spa, Antigua\n\nHodges Bay Resort and Spa brings a popular Barbaian brand to Antigua. Courtesy Hodges Bay Resort and Spa\n\nElegant Hotels Group, known for its collection of high-end hotels on Barbados, will be unveiling its first foray into Antigua in the summer of 2018.\n\nGuests can expect the same level of luxury at the boutique Hodges Bay, an eco-friendly entity on the northern coast that will incorporate green walls and fluid indoor/outdoor spaces.\n\nIts 79 modern lodging options will encompass suites (including rooftop ones with water views and private hot tubs), plus oceanfront villas and houses that include butler service.\n\nThose who don't want to lift a finger can also spring for laundry and grocery shopping services, while the pampering continues with pool and beach butlers at the heated infinity pool and prime stretch of white beach.\n\nRounding out the offerings will be three restaurants and six bars (a rooftop bar among them), and a holistic-oriented spa and cutting-edge fitness center.\n\n9. Quintessence Boutique Resort, Anguilla\n\nThis addition is a positive mile marker for Anguilla, which is still recovering from Hurricane Irma.\n\nThe Quintessence Boutique Resort feels like staying in a private mansion, complete with round-the-clock butler service, a five-star restaurant serving locally sourced food, an expertly stocked wine cellar, yoga pavilion and tennis courts.\n\nOf course there's a spa, offering customized massages and facials, which guests can also opt for in spacious suites or villas.\n\nThese are designed not to leave anyway, thanks to four-poster beds with jaw-droppingly expensive Swedish Hastens' mattresses and marble bathrooms with Roman soaking tubs.\n\nBut it's worth emerging for Long Bay Beach, a perfect example of a white sand beach that stretches long and wide - and rarely frequented by anyone beyond the hotel.\n\n10. The Loren at Pink Beach, Bermuda\n\nThe Loren is on a pink beach...and has a bright blue pool. Courtesy The Loren\n\nLike the Bahamas, Bermuda is also situated in the Atlantic, but its proximity to Caribbean islands merits a mention of The Loren at Pink Beach. especially since it's Bermuda's first new hotel in a decade.\n\nThe sleek boutique property on the southern coast is a worthy addition to the traditional lodging landscape, thanks to its clean, modern lines and décor.\n\nAs the Loren is parked right on the beach (which really is pink), it takes full advantage with floor-to-ceiling windows that maximize the turquoise water views.\n\nThe drama continues inside, where a floating spiral staircase makes a great first impression; artwork from developer Stephen King's personal collection, found throughout the hotel, continues this impression, and doesn't stop there.\n\nThe all-suite rooms contain private outdoor space, marble baths with giant soaking tubs and earthy colors and textures.\n\nThe two restaurants focus on locally sourced menus, while NYC chef Tim Sullivan of Great Performances oversees the more formal Marée.\n\nThe Loren at Pink Beach, 116 South Road, Tuckers Town Smiths HS01, Bermuda; +1 844 384 3103\n\n11. Pink Sands Club, Canouan, St. Vincent and The Grenadines\n\nMandarin Oriental just assumed management of the Pink Sands Club, a little more than a year old, with the renaming coming this spring.\n\nIf you've never heard of Canouan (pronounced ka-no-wan), part of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, it's probably because it's all of five-miles long and geared toward the 1 percent (or honeymooners and anyone looking to splurge).\n\nMaintaining the highest luxury standards, each of Pink Sands' 26 suites contain Rivolta linens, plus his-and-her walk-in closets. In-room tablets allow guests to bypass phones in order to make spa reservations, which can arrange for delivering treatments in palapa-style suites.\n\nRelated content The world's most beautiful island hotels\n\nThe resort added contemporary patio villas in December, which were designed by Italian architects and contain an infinity pool and hot tub.

The $100 million all-suite property is all about wellness, from comprehensive spa treatments to its four pools.\n\nAnd even its entry-level suites are conducive to relaxing, what with king-size beds, comfy couches and a neutral color palette.\n\nThe Shore Club also took its offerings to the next level by adding three new villas this January, each offering a whopping 8,800 square feet with six bedrooms, butler service, heated pool and unparalleled beachfront location.\n\nThe Shore Club , Shore Club Beach, Grace Bay, Turks & Caicos; +1 888 808 9488\n\n14. Bahama House, Bahamas\n\nThose in the know are beelining to laid-back hotspot Harbour Island for Bahama House, a carefully renovated 19th-century colonial decked out in Bahamian style.\n\nBut what sets this apart from other hotels is that it's the latest offering from Eleven Experience, an adventure travel company that specializes in customizing local experiences.\n\nFor example, Bahama House can arrange bonefishing, deep-sea fishing, jet skiing or horseback riding on the beach, although it's understandable if Harbour Island escapees simply want to while away the hours on the beach.\n\nOf course there are plenty of reasons to hang out at Bahama House as well, namely 11 rooms, some with four-poster, king-size beds; two cottages; proper tiki and rum bars; and a freshwater pool with underwater speakers.\n\nUnlike other boutique properties, the nightly rate includes prearrival planning, customized itineraries, a gourmet breakfast spread, private concierge service and, get this - a full day of professional photography, guaranteed to inspire Insta-envy.
Washington (CNN) Republican Sen. Josh Hawley threw a political grenade into Washington last week when he announced his intentions to object when Congress counts the Electoral College votes on Wednesday -- a move that pits the youngest senator against Senate GOP leadership as well as some rank-and-file members who will now have to cast a highly consequential vote as a result of his decision.\n\nHawley, 41, who was elected to represent Missouri in 2018 and is widely believed to have higher political ambitions, became the first senator to announce plans to object to the election results -- a significant development since both a House member and a senator are required to mount an objection when Congress counts the electoral votes.\n\nThough his objection won't change the outcome of the election and will only delay the inevitable affirmation of President-elect Joe Biden's victory over President Donald Trump, his commitment to Trump's baseless crusade to challenge the election represents perhaps his most significant political maneuvering since coming to the Senate two years ago.\n\nHe was one of just seven GOP senators who voted against overriding Trump's veto of a defense policy bill last week. He was also the rare GOP senator to initially join with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in calling for higher stimulus check payments to Americans -- a caused vocally championed by Trump, but scorned by GOP leadership, who killed Democratic efforts to bring legislation for $2,000 checks to the floor before the clock ran out on the 116th Congress.\n\nOn the election issue, though, Hawley is ensuring that one of the first votes his GOP colleagues will take in the 117th Congress will be one that follows them for their political careers. They'll have to choose between siding with Trump and his base or with the popular will of the voters, which could come back to haunt them in future elections no matter how they vote.\n\nAlready, Hawley's decision has provoked the ire of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , who pressed the Missouri Republican to explain his rationale on a Senate GOP conference call last week, though the junior senator wasn't dialed in. And by Sunday, a number of Republican senators had publicly opposed it, including several moderate Republicans and Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican in Senate GOP leadership.\n\nBut none of the pushback seems to have changed Hawley's mind: on Sunday he was still reviewing how many states he might object to and whether he will object to more than just Pennsylvania, according to a source familiar with his thinking.\n\nA play for 2024?\n\nAsked by CNN in November if a 2024 presidential run was in the cards, Hawley said flatly: It's not.\n\nBut his early commitment to object to Biden's Electoral College win represents a clear bet from Hawley that the President will continue to hold considerable influence over the Republican electorate in the coming years.\n\nTrump, even after he leaves office, will retain his Twitter account -- and with it, the potential to become a GOP kingmaker.\n\nAnd Hawley's political ambitions were already tied to Trump before the 2020 election. In 2018, when he defeated Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, he ran his Senate campaign as a self-proclaimed champion of the President's agenda who could help deliver conservative Supreme Court picks.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was among the Republicans who in 2017 pushed Hawley, a former Supreme Court clerk, to leave his post as Missouri attorney general, to which he had just been elected the year before, to run for Senate.\n\nBut while Hawley's efforts to challenge the 2020 presidential election results are sure to cement him in Trump's good graces for the time-being, he's helped unleash a public rift in the Republican party that also risks alienating him from congressional allies and harming any future presidential ambitions.\n\nGOP lawmakers have openly criticized their colleagues in recent days, as a divide emerges in the GOP over whether to follow Hawley or stand against what even Trump supporters have acknowledged is a futile effort.\n\nI'm concerned about the division in America, that's the biggest issue, but obviously this is not healthy for the Republican Party either, said Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who has been critical of Trump's false election claims. What's good for America is the main question here, but this is bad for the country and bad for the party.\n\nRepublican Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican , has also pushed back. She sent a 21-page memo to Republicans Sunday outlining why she believes objecting to the Electoral College count is unconstitutional and an exceptionally dangerous precedent.\n\nHawley, though, has only leaned further into his stance, tweeting Saturday: It's time to STAND UP.\n\nSo true, Trump tweeted in return. Thanks Josh!\n\nAnd on Sunday, Hawley sent out a fundraising email saying he will not bow down to career politicians in Washington and asking for Americans to join him and donate.\n\nMissouri attorney general\n\nBefore entering the national political arena, Hawley was Missouri's attorney general from 2017 to 2019, a role that served as a spring board for his larger ambitions even as it brought some controversy.\n\nHawley touts on his Senate website that he used his role as attorney general to fight the Washington overreach threatening farms and family businesses.\n\nHe had garnered wide-spread attention in 2018 when he accused then-Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican, of obtaining a charity donor list without permission . If proven, these acts could amount to the unauthorized taking and use of property -- in this case electronic property. Under Missouri law, this is known as computer tampering and given the value of the list in question, it is a felony, Hawley said at the time.\n\nGreitens ultimately resigned as governor -- something Hawley called the right thing to do at the time.\n\nIn another high-profile case, Hawley sued the owners and operators of a duck boat that sank on a lake near Branson, Missouri, and killed 17 people, saying they had been aware of safety hazards but their own profits were their priority. A National Transportation Safety Board probe ultimately found a systemic problem with the company as a whole.\n\nBut his tenure as attorney general also brought scrutiny. He faced fierce criticism for a December 2017 speech in which he blamed the sexual revolution for human trafficking. The sexual revolution has led to exploitation of women on a scale that we would never have imagined, he said in a speech to Christian pastors at an event hosted by the Missouri Renewal Project.\n\nYou know what I'm talking about, the 1960s, 1970s, it became commonplace in our culture among our cultural elites, Hollywood, and the media to talk about -- to denigrate the biblical truth about husband and wife, man and woman, Hawley said.\n\nHe argued that there's a human trafficking crisis because our culture has completely lost its way.\n\nWe must also deliver a message to our culture that the false gospel of 'anything goes' ends in this road of slavery, Hawley added.\n\nA spokeswoman for Hawley's campaign stood by the candidate's remarks when asked for comment at the time, adding that he had aggressively cracked down on sex trafficking since he took office as attorney general.\n\nVocal tech critic\n\nHawley's tenure in Congress has been defined by his role as a vocal tech critic eager to impose consequences on Silicon Valley over its dominance in the global economy.\n\nHe's railed against Section 230, a law that shields internet companies from being liable for what is posted on their websites by them or third parties, which is a grievance Trump shares. The President delivered on his promise to veto the National Defense Authorization Act because it did not repeal Section 230, and in a bipartisan rebuke, the Senate overrode that veto last week -- the first successful override of Trump's presidency.\n\nBut Hawley joined with six other GOP senators in voting to let Trump's veto of the defense bill stand.\n\nIn October, Hawley sent letters to Facebook and Twitter characterizing some of the companies' content moderation decisions as an illegal campaign contribution benefiting Biden. And in November, he targeted Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg with a misleading line of questioning during a Senate Judiciary Committee session.\n\nHawley repeatedly asked Zuckerberg if Facebook coordinates with YouTube and Twitter for censorship and to control information, citing information he had obtained from a whistleblower.\n\nIt is well-known that social media companies do communicate with each other on issues related to foreign meddling, terrorism and other topics. But Hawley tried to deceptively characterize the practice of Facebook communicating with its peers as nefarious and implied that the coordination was a major revelation\n\nDuring his first year in the Senate, Hawley even introduced a bill aimed at fighting social media addiction.\n\nBig tech has embraced a business model of addiction. Too much of the 'innovation' in this space is designed not to create better products, but to capture more attention by using psychological tricks that make it difficult to look away, Hawley said in a news release at the time.\n\nThis legislation will put an end to that and encourage true innovation by tech companies.
The ACLU is using tech to help fuel a conversation about policing.\n\nLast week, the ACLU of Texas launched a new app, ACLU Blue, which allows users to record police interactions and share them with the public.\n\nACLU Blue is similar to Mobile Justice, an ACLU app that's been available in several states for a few years. But that app serves one specific purpose: To offer legal advice to people who think they've been the victims of police misconduct.\n\nWhen you film and upload a video using the Mobile Justice app, your footage goes only to ACLU lawyers. But when you film and upload a video using the ACLU Blue app, it passes through a review process and is posted to the ACLU Blue YouTube page -- where it can be viewed by the public.\n\nThat sets ACLU Blue apart from other apps designed to capture negative interactions with police.\n\nDione Friends, the director of communications for the ACLU of Texas, said she hopes the app will provide a holistic view of of policing in Texas. That can also mean showcasing positive interactions.\n\nRelated: When citizens film police: Does anything change?\n\nWhen folks are doing it right, there's a lot of value in elevating that and saying, 'This is what model policing looks like,' she said, adding that helps make it more clear when something goes wrong.\n\nFriends said Texans wanted their own version of the Mobile Justice app -- but it just wasn't feasible.\n\nThe hardest thing for us is that Texas is just so big, she said. I didn't want to build something that would put a really big burden on our legal team.\n\nA crowdsourcing model offers a solution to that problem. Trained members of the community can help review videos, removing some of the logistical burden from ACLU staff. Plus, Friends said that tweaking the purpose of the app -- from submitting videos to a private audience to sharing videos with the public -- makes for a more continuous conversation, one that doesn't rely on hashtag campaigns around police interactions that ended in tragedy.\n\nToday, we launch the #ACLUBlue app to share law enforcement interactions with all Texans. Download today, for free. https://t.co/mKdHuw1vL4 pic.twitter.com/QRJkvxVTdm — ACLU of Texas (@ACLUTx) March 10, 2017\n\nWhile the app is available for download nationally, it's designed to be used just in Texas.\n\nACLU Blue offers information specific to Texas, like what to do when you're protesting or if you're stopped by police and what rights you have at the Texas-Mexico border.\n\nFriends says that a national app is in the works. There's been a real appetite.\n\nVideo is very powerful, she added. It tells a story in a way that you can't really refute.
(CNN) What do you need for a meaningful life? Even as 2020 strained communities around the world, it offered some object lessons in living well.\n\nIn the widespread nostalgia for pre-pandemic gatherings and rituals, we saw just how much we depend on other people. When medical and other frontline workers risked their own health to support entire communities, the world watched the everyday impact of lives dedicated to service.\n\nThere are so many things that we are going to learn from 2020, said Emiliana R. Simon-Thomas, science director of the University of California, Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center . We've really had a coming to terms with how important our collective experiences are to health and well-being.\n\nAnd even as they, like the rest of us, coped with an ongoing pandemic, researchers studying the science of well-being uncovered key insights into what makes life meaningful. The findings include the benefits of empathy, gratitude and cooperation, with ideas for increasing happiness in your own life — or even in your country.\n\nSimon-Thomas joined a team from the GGSC in December to select the 10 research findings from 2020 that shed light on the good life, and offer a positive road map for weathering the months and years to come. Here's what the team found.\n\n1. Choose empathy for a kinder, more compassionate year\n\nScientists already know that empathy is both a personality trait and a learned behavior. That's great, because it means that you can increase your empathy no matter your disposition. In turn, that can help forge stronger, more supportive relationships.\n\nBeing empathetic is about more than skill building, though. Your motivation to be empathetic matters, too, according to two studies published this year, one by Harvard University researchers and another from the University of Toronto.\n\nWearing a mask in public helps protect the community from the spread of the coronavirus. A man wears a mask as he visits Times Square in New York December 10.\n\nParticipants in the Harvard University study wrote letters describing the importance of empathy. Researchers speculated that it might boost the participants' motivation to be empathetic, and the strategy worked: A few months later, those same participants demonstrated more empathetic behavior.\n\nDo it: Try the study on yourself. Write down the benefits of empathy in a journal entry, detailing why you think it's a valuable trait. It's a solid way to recharge your empathy after a difficult year.\n\n2. Promote social justice to forge a happier society\n\nIt's a strong correlation. Social justice was second only to social capital — that's how researchers refer to our complex networks of relationships — when it came to predicting each country's happiness.\n\nWhy? One of the study's authors, Isaac Prilleltensky, dean of education and human development at the Unviersity of Miami, has argued that a society's commitment to social justice shows individual citizens that they are valued by their broader community. That, in turn, leads to greater happiness.\n\nDo it: Want a happier community? Advocate for poverty reduction, education, health equity, labor market access and intergenerational justice where you live. Those are the metrics used for the EU Social Justice Index that researchers linked to each country's life satisfaction.\n\nREAD MORE: People of color face significant barriers to mental health services\n\n3. Pick up the phone and call\n\nResearchers studying the science of well-being agree that human connection is key. But in a pandemic, what really works?\n\nA couple celebrates Thanksgiving with friends by having dinner together over a Zoom video call November 22 in New York.\n\nYour voice, it turns out. Phone calls and video calls create stronger social bonds than email or text, found researcher Amit Kumar, an assistant professor of marketing at University of Texas at Austin's McCombs School of Business, in a recent study published by the Journal of Experimental Psychology.\n\nWorried that calling will be awkward? You're not the only one to think so.\n\nMany study participants overestimated the awkwardness of voice calls, while underestimating the benefits. That may be one reason some avoid calling altogether, a misunderstanding with real consequences for well-being.\n\nDo it: Instead of tapping out a text or email, choose a video or voice call instead.\n\n4. Reap the benefits of cooperation\n\nAre kids naturally cooperative? Children showed more self-control when working toward a collective goal than an individual one, according to a 2020 study published by the journal Psychological Science.\n\nFor the study, hundreds of small children tested their will by trying not to eat a cookie. If they could wait it out for long enough, they'd get a second cookie as a reward.\n\nHere's the twist: In some versions of the test, the kids worked in teams. Together, they did better, earning more cookies for all.\n\nDo it: This study targets kids, but adults can benefit from cooperation, too. If you have a 2021 goal or resolution, consider asking a friend to join you; as a team, you might find even greater success.\n\n5. Variety might really be the spice of life\n\nThere is more than one way to live well. Typically, researchers focus on two important metrics for evaluating the good life. One is pleasure; the other is all about deeper meaning.\n\nIn a 2020 paper , however, Shigehiro Oishi, a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia, proposed a new dimension for understanding a life well lived: psychological richness. That term underscores the value of variety, interest and novelty.\n\nPicking up a new hobby, like bread making, can be enriching psychologically.\n\nA life of psychological richness is full of diverse experiences and discovery, offering challenges that stimulate your mind. It might not always be easy — but it will be interesting.\n\nDo it: Seek out experiences likely to shift your perspective. Try taking up a new hobby, for example, or exposing yourself to a foreign culture.\n\n6. Kindness and gratitude create a ripple effect\n\nSaying thank you can make the world a better place. How? It's what researchers call the witnessing effect, where seeing a behavior can change the actions of onlookers.\n\nAfter watching expressions of gratitude, participants in one study were more likely to be helpful, open and friendly. Kindness can create a similar outcome, found another study\n\nDo it: If you need some motivation to be kind — or to say thank you more — remember that the benefits don't stop with you. You have the power to change your community's behavior, too.\n\n7. Live like an extrovert for a happiness boost\n\nResearch shows that extroverts have it pretty good. The personality trait, which tends to go along with highly social behavior, is correlated with increased happiness.\n\nBut that doesn't mean the benefits of extroversion are off-limits for introverts. Just acting like an extrovert for a week correlated with increased well-being for participants in a study published by neuropsychologist Seth Margolis, an assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University.\n\nDo it: Stage your own experiment. Even if you're a lifelong introvert, spend one week channeling extroverted behavior by seeking out (pandemic-safe) social situations and increasing interaction with others.\n\n8. Emphasize altruism to help mitigate the pandemic\n\nHow can you convince people to wear a mask, practice social distancing and take other measures to reduce the spread of Covid-19? It's not public shaming\n\nIn fact, people are more likely to comply with messages emphasizing the importance of caring for others, found Jillian Jordan, assistant professor of business administration at Harvard Univeristy. That finding echoes another study from the University of Zurich, which argued that a large majority of people are very reluctant to put others at risk for their personal benefit.\n\nThat's great news as the world continues to cope with the ongoing pandemic.\n\nDo it: If someone in your life isn't doing their part to reduce the spread of Covid-19, don't attempt to shame them into changing their ways. Try to appeal to their altruism.\n\n9. Create a more equal world by examining your beliefs\n\nWhat's the root of inequality? How you answer the question might influence your behavior.\n\nVolunteers load cars with turkeys and other food assistance for laid off Walt Disney World cast members and others at a food distribution event December 12 in Orlando, Florida.\n\nIf you believe that widespread poverty is the result of life circumstances — rather than laziness or personality — you're more likely to support egalitarian policies, found one 2020 study\n\nNot only that, both beliefs and behavior can change. The same researchers went on to show that inviting study participants to reflect on the root causes of poverty made them more likely to donate money to a campaign supporting a higher minimum wage.\n\nDo it: Take a pause next time you find yourself judging someone facing difficult circumstances. You might be making some incorrect assumptions about the underlying reasons for the situation they're facing.\n\n10. Surround yourself with diversity and watch stereotypes fade\n\nNothings banishes stereotypes like real-world experience, found a 2020 study that compared regions' ethnic diversity with the prevalence of stereotypes. The authors call it a diversity paradox.\n\nPedestrians walk through an outdoor market area in Cape Town, South Africa, August 19.\n\nIt turns out that when we cross racial, cultural and ethnic lines more often, we notice how similar we are to those around us, instead of focusing on the small differences.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nDo it: You could move to an ethnically diverse place — the study authors used South Africa and Hawaii as prime examples.\n\nShort of that? Seek out situations where you'll rub shoulders with people who are different from you, with a focus on reducing your own tendency to use stereotypes.
Editor's Note: CNN political commentator Robby Mook ran the 2015-16 presidential campaign for Hillary Clinton and is now a senior fellow at Harvard University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nElection security has come under scrutiny over the last year – and deservedly so. The 2016 election opened our eyes to how new technologies we rushed to purchase after the butterfly ballots and hanging chads of the 2000 election created new vulnerabilities hard to imagine at the time.\n\nPHOTO: CNN Robby Mook\n\nWe have known how bad this problem is for over a year, so the logical question is: What have we done about it?\n\nSadly, not as much as we could have. But the reasons are more complicated than you might think.\n\nSecretaries of state and state and local election administrators have been scrutinized for hardware, software, and vendor choices. This scrutiny is healthy, but often fails to address the big picture: Yes, our election equipment and procedures are in need of an upgrade, but so are the policies that shape those choices in the first place.\n\nThe reality is that, even when officials want to do the right thing, red tape, contorted lines of authority and a lack of resources and inaction from Congress and state legislatures often hold them back. Our laws, procedures and financial commitment to elections need fixing – and that won't happen unless we pressure our lawmakers to do it.\n\nMany people don't realize that election system is not monolithic. It is not run like the Transportation Security Administration, a national bureaucracy with a unified leadership structure, budget and security protocols. Quite the opposite – there are around 7,000 election jurisdictions nationwide. Some states run their elections centrally, some delegate authority to counties or localities.\n\nEverything from budgets, equipment, human resources and policy are set differently and at different levels of government. Even the titular heads of elections vary by state, ranging from an elected secretary of state to administrators or commissions selected by governors or legislators. The system's diversity can make it more resistant to attack, but it also means one-size-fits-all solutions aren't workable.\n\nMoreover, election officials at every level are confined within the restraints of law, budget and bureaucratic architecture as much as any other part of government. Even if an election official decides her state needs new machines with a paper audit trail, she can't necessarily go out and buy them – she may need the legislature to appropriate millions of dollars and go through a procurement process.\n\nSimilarly, if she feels that her state needs new software, she may be locked into a contract her predecessor put in place years ago. The same applies to vendor security. Many contracts were put in place without strict provisions about reporting security incidents, or allowing third party audits. Cybersecurity simply wasn't top of mind even a few years ago.\n\nThen there's the question of who controls cybersecurity in the first place. Some election officials are able to hire their own cybersecurity staff, others have to work through a central cybersecurity office run by the governor. You get the idea; there are many hurdles that prevent quick fixes.\n\nThere are other complications. The integrity of our election system is ultimately a question of perception, not reality. The Russians don't actually need to manipulate vote tallies to achieve their desired outcome of distrust and chaos. They need only create the perception of interference. Even if we could completely guard against cyberintrusions – which is impossible – nation states could use social media to spread falsified documents and propaganda, or steal emails of election officials, to make people believe that an election was rigged.\n\nGiven this reality, we can't just secure databases and machines, we have to secure our civic ecosystem against the kind of foreign-born lies and distractions that we saw documented in Friday's indictment of Russians by special counsel Robert Mueller. This requires collaboration between our national security and intelligence services, law enforcement, social media platforms and our election officials.\n\nCongress must act to align our intelligence services so they will be best equipped to detect and prevent information operations. Social media platforms should not wait for rules or regulations to fully disclose the content that is spread on their platforms and force users to declare who they are. It would also be beneficial if they'd mandate that only humans can traffic information, not botnets.\n\nOur election system is deeply vulnerable and in dire need of an upgrade. We don't need more evidence of that.\n\nWe need to start posing the right questions to policymakers. Do election administrators have the funding they need to make necessary improvements to our election systems and the tools to hold vendors accountable for security? Do they have access to the intelligence they need to anticipate incoming threats? And are the state's IT and procurement systems sufficiently modern to account for a dynamic threat like cybersecurity?\n\nNone of these challenges should be excuses for negligence, but they explain why change has been painfully slow. We must focus our attention and advocacy on the people who can really change all of this: our legislators, especially our state legislators and governors, who have the power to remove financial, bureaucratic, and policy hurdles that slow reform. Congress has a unique ability to bring financial and intelligence resources to bear.\n\nThere is good legislation ready for a vote. At the federal level, a bipartisan group of senators have introduced a very sound bill that would provide states with an infusion of money, badly needed intelligence on cyberthreats, and federal support to get election technology up to date and keep it current. Yet another bipartisan bill has been introduced to better utilize national security tools to reduce foreign manipulation of elections.\n\nWe should all support these bills. They're not just common sense, they're solutions that have been staring us in the face for years. Members of the House and Senate should be pressured to bring them to a vote before the election recess.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAlthough congressional action is critical, state legislatures are even more important. After all, they fundamentally write our election rules. They could appropriate funds and untangle bureaucracy, so election administrators could get to work immediately making needed changes. We must hold their feet to the fire, too.\n\nWe will never know exactly what effect foreign propaganda had on the 2016 election. As for hacking, it seems nation states were never able to manipulate vote totals or quite literally hack the election. But unless we act now, we may not be so sure next time.
This is the transcript of the debate between Democratic presidential candidates Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on February 21, 2008 at the University of Texas in Austin.\n\nSens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton face off in a high-stakes debate, Thursday night. more photos »\n\nCNN's CAMPBELL BROWN: And the candidates have taken their seats. We are ready to get started. On behalf of CNN, Univision and the candidates, we want to thank our hosts, the University of Texas and the LBJ School and Library.\n\nAnd now I want to give you an idea of what to expect over the next 90 minutes or so. We want to have a real conversation between these two candidates on the issues important to Texas and the entire nation, so we won't have any hard and fast rules for them to follow. We simply ask the candidates to keep their answers to a reasonable length and to stay on point.\n\nAnd we have given the candidates the opportunity to make opening statements. The order was determined by a draw. Senator Obama won the draw and elected to go second.\n\nSo please go ahead, Senator Clinton.\n\nSEN. HILLARY CLINTON: Well, thank you.\n\nAnd I am just delighted to be back here in Austin. You know, nearly 36 years ago I came to Austin for my very first political job, and that was registering voters in south Texas. And I had the great privilege of living for a while in Austin and in San Antonio, and meeting people and making friends that have stayed with me for a lifetime.\n\nAnd I found that we had a lot in common, a lot of shared values, a belief that hard work is important, that self-reliance and individual responsibility count for a lot.\n\nCLINTON: And among the people whom I got to know, who became not only friends, but heroes, were Barbara Jordan, who taught me a lot about courage, and today...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n...would actually be her birthday. I remember all the time about how she got up every single morning, facing almost insurmountable odds, to do what she did.\n\nAnd another was my great friend Ann Richards, who taught me so much...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... about determination. Ann was a great champion for the people of Texas. She also reminded us that every so often it is good to have a laugh about what it is we're engaged in.\n\nAnd as I think back on those years and the work that I've done ever since, you know, for me politics is about making real differences in people's lives. I am very, very proud that over these years I have been able to make a difference in the lives of people in Texas, Ohio and elsewhere.\n\nCLINTON: You know, 350,000 children in Texas get health care every month because I helped to start the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd 21,000 National Guard and Reserve members get access to health care because I went across the party line and joined up with a Republican senator to make that happen.\n\nSo there's a lot that we've already done. But there's so much more to do.\n\nI want to take on the tough issues that face us now. I want to stop the health insurance companies from discriminating against people because they're sick. You know, it's unconstitutional to discriminate on the basis of race or gender or ethnic origin or religion, but it's OK to discriminate against sick people.\n\nAnd we're going to end that, because it's time we said no more.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd I want to continue the work that I've done in the Senate to take care of our veterans.\n\nCLINTON: It was shocking and shameful, what happened, that we discovered about a year ago at Walter Reed. We can do so much better, to take care of the people who've taken care of us.\n\nAnd there is a lot of work ahead. I offer a lifetime of experience and proven results. And I know that, if we work together, we can take on the special interests, transfer $55 billion of all those giveaways and subsidies that President Bush has given them, back to the middle class, to create jobs and provide health care and make college affordable.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd I ask you -- I ask you to join in my campaign. It's now up to the people of Texas, Ohio, and the other states ahead.\n\nSo, if you'll be part of this campaign, which is your really your campaign, about your futures, your families, your jobs and your health care, we'll continue to make a difference for America.\n\nThank you all very much.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: Senator Clinton, thank you.\n\nBROWN: Senator Obama?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSEN. BARACK OBAMA: First of all, thank you so much to the University of Texas for hosting us, and it's a great honor to share the stage once again with Senator Clinton. I've said before that we've been friends before this campaign started; we'll be friends afterwards, unified to bring about changes in this country.\n\nYou know, we are at a defining moment in our history. Our nation is at war, and our economy is increasingly in shambles. And the families of Texas and all across America are feeling the brunt of that failing economy.\n\nThis week, I met a couple in San Antonio, who -- as a consequence of entering into a predatory loan -- are on the brink of foreclosure and are actually seeing them having to cut back on their medical expenses, because their mortgage doubled in two weeks.\n\nOBAMA: I've met a young woman who gets three hours of sleep a night because she has to work the night shift even as she's going to school full time, and still can't afford to provide the health care for her sister who's ill.\n\nIn Youngstown, Ohio, talked to workers who have seen their plants shipped overseas as a consequence of bad trade deals like NAFTA, literally seeing equipment unbolted from the floors of factories and shipped to China, resulting in devastating job losses and communities completely falling apart.\n\nAnd all across America I'm meeting not just veterans, but also the parents of those who have fallen.\n\nOne mother in Green Bay gave me this bracelet in memory of a 20- year-old son who had been killed in a roadside bomb, as a consequence of a war that I believe should have never been authorized and should have never been waged and has cost us billions of dollars that could have been invested here in the United States in roads and bridges and infrastructure and making sure that young people can go to college and that those who need health care actually get it.\n\nOBAMA: Now, Senator Clinton...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... Senator Clinton and I have been talking about these issues for the last 13 months. We both offer detailed proposals to try to deal with them. Some of them are the same. Some we have differences of opinion.\n\nBut I think we both recognize that these problems have to be dealt with and that we have seen an administration over the last seven years that has failed to address them and -- in many ways -- has made them worse.\n\nBut understand that what is lacking right now is not good ideas.\n\nOBAMA: The problem we have is that Washington has become a place where good ideas go to die. They go to die because the lobbyists...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThey go to die because lobbyists and special interests have a strangle-hold on the agenda in Washington. They go to die in Washington because too many politicians are interested in scoring political points rather than bridging differences in order to get things done.\n\nAnd so the central premise of this campaign is that we can bring this country together, that we can push against the special interests that have come to dominate the agenda in Washington, that we can be straight with the American people about how we're going to solve these problems and enlist them in taking back their government.\n\nYou know, Senator Clinton mentioned Barbara Jordan, somebody who was an inspiration to me and so many people throughout the country. And she said that what the American people want is very simple: They want an America that is as good as its promise.\n\nOBAMA: I'm running for president because I want to help America be as good as its promise.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: All right, Senator Obama, thank you, and let's begin with questions.\n\nJorge Ramos?\n\nUNIVISION's JORGE RAMOS: Thank you very much (SPEAKING IN SPANISH).\n\nThank you so much for being with us, and let me start with a little news. After nearly half a century in office, Fidel Castro resigned as the head of the Cuban government. Ninety miles off the coast of the United States, we might have a new opportunity.\n\nThe question for you, Senator Clinton: Would you be willing to sit down with Raul Castro, or whoever leads the Cuban dictatorship when you take office at least just once, to get a measure of the man?\n\nCLINTON: Well, Jorge, I hope we have an opportunity. The people of Cuba deserve to have a democracy. And this gives the Cuban government, under Raul Castro, a chance to change direction from the one that was set for 50 years by his brother.\n\nI'm going to be looking for some of those changes: releasing political prisoner, ending some of the oppressive practices on the press, opening up the economy.\n\nOf course the United States stands ready. And, as president, I would be ready to reach out and work with a new Cuban government, once it demonstrated that it truly was going to change that direction.\n\nI want to bring the region together, our European allies who have influence with Cuba, to try to push for some of those changes, and to make it very clear that, if Cuba moves toward democracy and freedom for its people, the United States will welcome that.\n\nCLINTON: And as president, I would look for opportunities to try to make that happen and to create the momentum that might eventually lead to a presidential visit.\n\nBut there has to be evidence that indeed the changes are real; that they are taking place; and that the Cuban people will finally be given an opportunity to have their future determined by themselves.\n\nRAMOS: Very simply, would you meet with him or not, with Raul Castro?\n\nCLINTON: I would not meet with him until there was evidence that change was happening, because I think it's important that they demonstrate clearly that they are committed to change the direction. Then I think, you know, something like diplomatic encounters and negotiations over specifics could take place.\n\nBut we've had this conversation before, Senator Obama and myself, and I believe that we should have full diplomatic engagement where appropriate. But a presidential visit should not be offered and given without some evidence that it will demonstrate the kind of progress that is in our interest, and in this case, in the interests of the Cuban people.\n\nBROWN: Senator Obama, just to follow up, you had said in a previous CNN debate that you would meet with the leaders of Cuban, Iran, North Korea, among others, so presumably you would be willing to meet with the new leader of Cuba.\n\nOBAMA: That's correct. Now, keep in mind that the starting point for our policy in Cuba should be the liberty of the Cuban people. And I think we recognize that that liberty has not existed throughout the Castro regime. And we now have an opportunity to potentially change the relationship between the United States and Cuba after over half a century.\n\nI would meet without preconditions, although Senator Clinton is right that there has to be preparation. It is very important for us to make sure that there was an agenda, and on that agenda was human rights, releasing of political prisoners, opening up the press. And that preparation might take some time.\n\nBut I do think that it's important for the United States not just to talk to its friends, but also to talk to its enemies. In fact, that's where diplomacy makes the biggest difference.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOBAMA: One other thing that I've said, as a show of good faith that we're interested in pursuing potentially a new relationship, what I've called for is a loosening of the restrictions on remittances from family members to the people of Cuba, as well as travel restrictions for family members who want to visit their family members in Cuba.\n\nAnd I think that initiating that change in policy as a start and then suggesting that an agenda get set up is something that could be useful, but I would not normalize relations until we started seeing some of the progress that Senator Clinton was talking about.\n\nBROWN: But that's different from your position back in 2003. You called U.S. policy toward Cuba a miserable failure, and you supported normalizing relations.\n\nBROWN: So you've backtracked now...\n\nOBAMA: I support the eventual normalization. And it's absolutely true that I think our policy has been a failure. I mean, the fact is, is that during my entire lifetime, and Senator Clinton's entire lifetime, you essentially have seen a Cuba that has been isolated, but has not made progress when it comes to the issues of political rights and personal freedoms that are so important to the people of Cuba.\n\nSo I think that we have to shift policy. I think our goal has to be ultimately normalization. But that's going to happen in steps. And the first step, as I said, is changing our rules with respect to remittances and with respect to travel.\n\nAnd then I think it is important for us to have the direct contact, not just in Cuba, but I think this principle applies generally. I recall what John F. Kennedy once said, that we should never negotiate out of fear, but we should never fear to negotiate. And this moment, this opportunity when Fidel Castro has finally stepped down, I think, is one that we should try to take advantage of.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: Senator Clinton, do you want a quick response?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I agree, absolutely, that we should be willing to have diplomatic negotiations and processes with anyone. I've been a strong advocate of opening up such a diplomatic process with Iran, for a number of years.\n\nBecause I think we should look for ways that we can possibly move countries that are adversarial to us, you know, toward the world community. It's in our interests. It's in the interests of the people in countries that, frankly, are oppressed, like Cuba, like Iran.\n\nBut there has been this difference between us over when and whether the president should offer a meeting, without preconditions, with those with whom we do not have diplomatic relations. And it should be part of a process, but I don't think it should be offered in the beginning. Because I think that undermines the capacity for us to actually take the measure of somebody like Raul Castro or Ahmadinejad and others.\n\nCLINTON: And, as President Kennedy said, he wouldn't be afraid to negotiate, but he would expect there to be a lot of preparatory work done, to find out exactly what we would get out of it.\n\nAnd therefore, I do think we should be eliminating the policy of the Bush administration, which has been very narrowly defined, and frankly against our interests, because we have failed to reach out to countries, we have alienated our friends, and we have emboldened our enemies.\n\nSo I would get back to very vigorous diplomacy, and I would use bipartisan diplomacy. I would ask emissaries from both political parties to represent me and our country, because I want to send a very clear message to the rest of the world that the era of unilateralism, preemption and arrogance of the Bush administration is over and we're going to...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: Very briefly and then we're going to move on.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOBAMA: I think, as I said before, preparation is actually absolutely critical in any meeting. And I think it is absolutely true that either of us would step back from some of the Bush unilateralism that's caused so much damage.\n\nBut I do think it is important precisely because the Bush administration has done so much damage to American foreign relations that the president take a more active role in diplomacy than might have been true 20 or 30 years ago.\n\nBecause the problem is, if we think that meeting with the president is a privilege that has to be earned, I think that reinforces the sense that we stand above the rest of the world at this point in time. And I think that it's important for us in undoing the damage that has been done over the last seven years, for the president to be willing to take that extra step.\n\nOBAMA: That is the kind of step that I would like to take as president of the United States.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: A question now on the economy.\n\nJohn King?\n\nCNN's JOHN KING: Campbell, Senators, good evening, first.\n\nI want to bring the conversation back home. You know from your travels -- you don't need to look at the polls or anything else -- that the economy is by far now the dominant issue that voters want to hear about from the candidates.\n\nFor some, that is a question about: What should we do about an economy that is at the edge or perhaps in the early stages of a recession? For some, it is more focused. Maybe it is: Will you raise the minimum wage? Maybe it's about trade deals that they think leave them on the raw end, as you mentioned in your opening statement, Senator Obama.\n\nBut when we ask Democrats, How are these two candidates different?, they even think they don't know.\n\nSenator Obama, beginning with you, tell us as specifically as you can, how would a President Obama be different than a President Clinton in managing the nation's economy?\n\nOBAMA: Well, first of all, let me emphasize the point that you just made, which is: You don't need an economist or the Federal Reserve to tell the American people that the economy's in trouble, because they've been experiencing it for years now.\n\nEverywhere you go, you meet people who are working harder for less, wages and incomes have flatlined, people are seeing escalating costs of everything from health care to gas at the pump.\n\nAnd so people have been struggling for a long time. In some communities, they have been struggling for decades now. So this has to be a priority of the next president.\n\nNow, what I've said is that we have to restore a sense of fairness and balance to our economy, and that means a couple of things.\n\nNumber one, with our tax code: We've got to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas and invest those tax breaks in companies that are investing here in the United States of America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe have to end the Bush tax cuts to the wealthy...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... and to provide tax breaks to middle-class Americans and working Americans who need them.\n\nOBAMA: So I've said that if you are making $75,000 a year or less, I want to give an offset to your payroll tax that will mean $1,000 extra in the pockets of ordinary Americans. Senior citizens making less than $50,000, you shouldn't have to pay income tax on your Social Security.\n\nWe pay for these by closing tax loopholes and tax havens that are being manipulated.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOn our trade deals, I think it is absolutely critical that we engaged in trade, but it has to be viewed not just through the lens of Wall Street, but also Main Street, which means we've got strong labor standards and strong environmental standards and safety standards, so we don't have toys being shipped in the United States with lead paint on them.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSo these are all issues that I've talked about repeatedly, and I think there are also opportunities in our economy around creating a green economy. We send $1 billion to foreign countries every day because of our addiction to foreign oil.\n\nOBAMA: And for us to move rapidly to cap greenhouse gases, generate billions of dollars that we can reinvest in solar and wind and biodiesel -- that can put people back to work. So...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nNow, I don't want to take too much time. And I'm sure we'll be spend more time discussing this.\n\nSenator Clinton and I, I think, both agree on many of these issues. And I think it's a credit to the Democratic Party as a whole that the other candidates who were involved earlier on agreed with us on many of these issues.\n\nI think that there is a real, solid agenda for moving change forward in the next presidency.\n\nThe question people are going to have to ask is: How do we get it done?\n\nAnd it is my strong belief that the changes are only going to come about if we're able to form a working coalition for change. Because people who were benefiting from the current tax code are going to resist. The special interests and lobbyists are going to resist.\n\nAnd I think it has to be a priority for whoever the next president is to be able to overcome the dominance of the special interests in Washington, to bring about the kinds of economic changes that I'm talking about.\n\nOBAMA: And that's an area where Senator Clinton and I may have a slight difference. But I'm happy to let her speak first and then can pick up on anything that's been left out.\n\nKING: Let's give Senator Clinton that opportunity then.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAs you have campaigned, Senator, on this issue and others, but specifically on this issue, you have said, I am ready on day one to take charge of the economy.\n\nThe clear implication, since you have one opponent at the moment, is that you're ready; he's not.\n\nWhat would you do differently on day one than a President Obama would when it comes to managing the nation's economy?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I would agree with a lot that Senator Obama just said, because it is the Democratic agenda.\n\nCLINTON: We are going to rid the tax code of these loopholes and giveaways.\n\nWe're going to stop giving a penny of your money to anybody who ships a job out of Texas, Ohio or anywhere else to another country.\n\nWe're certainly going to begin to get the tax code to reflect what the needs of middle class families are so we can rebuild a strong and prosperous middle class.\n\nYou know, the wealthy and the well-connected have had a president the last seven years, and I think it's time that the rest of America had a president to work for you every single day.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe will also have a different approach toward trade.\n\nWe're going to start having trade agreements that not only have strong environmental and labor standards, but I want to have a trade time-out. We're going to look and see what's working and what's not working, and I'd like to have a trade prosecutor to actually enforce the trade agreements that we have before we enter into any others.\n\nWe're also going to put much tougher standards in place so that people cannot import toys with lead paint, contaminated pet food, contaminated drugs into our market. We're going to have much more vigorous enforcement of safety standards.\n\nCLINTON: Now, in addition, there are steps I would take immediately. One is on this foreclosure crisis. I have been saying for nearly a year we had to crack down on the abusive practices of the lenders. But we also need a moratorium on home foreclosures.\n\nEverywhere I go, I meet people who either have been or about to lose their home. 85,000 homes in foreclosure in Texas; 90,000 in Ohio. I've met the families: the hairdresser, the single mom who's going to lose her home, the postal worker who got really hoodwinked into an agreement that wasn't fair to him.\n\nSo I would put a moratorium for 90 days, to give us time to work out a way for people to stay in their homes, and I would freeze interest rates for five years. Because these adjustable-rate mortgages, if they keep going up, millions of Americans are going to be homeless. And vacant homes will be across the neighborhoods of Texas and America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: Now, in addition, there are three ways we need to jump start the economy.\n\nClean green jobs; I've been promoting this. I wanted it to be part of the stimulus package. I thought a $5 billion investment in clean green jobs would put hundreds of thousands of Americans to work helping to create our future.\n\nWe also need to invest in our infrastructure. We don't have enough roads to take care of the congestion, we have crumbling bridges and tunnels. We need to rebuild America, and that will also put people to work.\n\nAnd, finally, we need to end George Bush's war on science, which has been waged against scientists and researchers...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: Thank you, Senator. And we've got a lot of ground to cover...\n\nCLINTON: This is about how we fund the future. We've got to get back to being the innovation nation. Think of everything that goes on at this great university to create the new economy...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: All right. Senator Clinton, thank you very much.\n\nBROWN: And, as I was saying, we've got a lot to get through. So I do want to shift gears and go on to another topic especially important here in Texas, which is immigration.\n\nAnd, Jorge, you have a question.\n\nRAMOS: (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Federal raids by immigration enforcement officials on homes and businesses have generated a great deal of fear and anxiety in the Hispanic community and have divided the family of some of the 3 million U.S.-born children who have at least one undocumented parent.\n\nWould you consider stopping these raids once you take office until comprehensive immigration reform can be passed?\n\nCLINTON: I would consider that, except in egregious situations where it would be appropriate to take the actions you're referring to.\n\nBut when we see what's been happening, with literally babies being left with no one to take care of them, children coming home from school, no responsible adult left, that is not the America that I know.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: That is against American values. And it is...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd it is a stark admission of failure by the federal government. We need comprehensive immigration reform. I have been for this. I signed onto the first comprehensive bill back in 2004. I've been advocating for it: tougher, more secure borders, of course, but let's do it the right way, cracking down on employers, especially once we get to comprehensive immigration reform, who exploit undocumented workers and drive down wages for everyone else.\n\nI'd like to see more federal help for communities like Austin and others like Laredo, where I was this morning, that absorb the health care, education, and law enforcement costs.\n\nAnd I personally, as president, would work with our neighbors to the south, to help them create more jobs for their own people.\n\nFinally, we need a path to legalization, to bring the immigrants out of the shadows, give them the conditions that we expect them to meet, paying a fine for coming here illegally, trying to pay back taxes, over time, and learning English.\n\nIf they had a committed a crime in our country or the country they came from, then they should be deported. But for everyone else, there must be a path to legalization. I would introduce that in the first 100 days of my presidency.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: Senator Obama, is your position the same as Hillary Clinton's?\n\nOBAMA: There are a couple of things I would add. Comprehensive immigration reform is something that I have worked on extensively.\n\nTwo years ago, we were able to get a bill out of the Senate. I was one of the group of senators that helped to move it through, but it died in the House this year. Because it was used as a political football instead of a way of solving a problem, nothing happened.\n\nAnd so there are a couple of things that I would just add to what Senator Clinton said.\n\nNumber one, it is absolutely critical that we tone down the rhetoric when it comes to the immigration debate, because there has been an undertone that has been ugly.\n\nOftentimes, it has been directed at the Hispanic community. We have seen hate crimes skyrocket in the wake of the immigration debate as it has been conducted in Washington, and that is unacceptable.\n\nWe are a nation of laws and we are a nation of immigrants, and we can reconcile those two things. So we need comprehensive reform...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... we need comprehensive reform, and that means stronger border security. It means that we are cracking down on employers that are taking advantage of undocumented workers because they can't complain if they're not paid a minimum wage.\n\nOBAMA: They can't complain if they're not getting overtime. Worker safety laws are not being observed.\n\nWe have to crack down on those employers, although we also have to make sure that we do it in a way that doesn't lead to people with Spanish surnames being discriminated against, so there's got to be a safeguard there.\n\nWe have to require that undocumented workers, who are provided a pathway to citizenship, not only learn English, pay back taxes and pay a significant fine, but also that they're going to the back of the line, so that they are not getting citizenship before those who have applied legally, which raises two last points.\n\nNumber one, it is important that we fix the legal immigration system, because right now we've got a backlog that means years for people to apply legally.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd what's worse is, we keep on increasing the fees, so that if you've got a hard working immigrant family, they've got to hire a lawyer; they've got to pay thousands of dollars in fees. They just can't afford it. And it's discriminatory against people who have good character, we should want in this country, but don't have the money. So we've got to fix that.\n\nOBAMA: So we've got to fix that.\n\nThe second thing is, we have to improve our relationship with Mexico and work with the Mexican government so that their economy is producing jobs on that side of the border.\n\nAnd the problem that we have...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThe problem that we have is that we have had an administration that came in promising all sorts of leadership on creating a U.S.- Mexican relationship. And, frankly, President Bush dropped the ball. He has been so obsessed with Iraq that we have not seen the kinds of outreach and cooperative work that would ensure that the Mexican economy is working not just for the very wealthy in Mexico, but for all people. And that's as policy that I'm going to change when I'm president of the United States.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: All right, Senator Obama.\n\nWe're going to stay with this topic. I want to have John King ask another question.\n\nGo ahead, John.\n\nKING: I want to stay on the issue, but move to a controversial item that was not held up when the immigration debate collapsed in Washington, and that is the border fence.\n\nKING: To many Americans, it is a simple question of sovereignty and security. America should be able to keep people out that it doesn't want in.\n\nBut, as you know in this state, especially if you go to the south of here, along the border, and in other border states, to many people it's a much more personal question. It could be a question of their livelihood. It could be a question of cross-border trade. It might be an issue to a rancher of property rights. It might be a simple question of whether someone can take a walk or a short drive to see their family members.\n\nSenator, back in 2006, you voted for the construction of that fence. As you know, progress has been slow.\n\nAs president of the United States, would you commit tonight that you would finish the fence and speed up the construction, or do you think it's time for a president of the United States to raise his or her hand and say, You know what? Wait a minute. Let's think about this again. Do we really want to do this?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think both Senator Obama and I voted for that as part of the immigration debate.\n\nCLINTON: And having been along the border for the last week or so -- in fact, last night I was at the University of Texas at Brownsville -- and this is how absurd this has become under the Bush administration. Because, you know, there is a smart way to protect our borders, and there is a dumb way to protect our borders.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd what I learned last night when I was there with Congressman Ortiz is that the University of Texas at Brownsville would have part of its campus cut off.\n\nThis is the kind of absurdity that we're getting from this administration. I know it because I've been fighting with them about the northern border. Their imposition of passports and other kinds of burdens are separating people from families, interfering with business and commerce, the movement of goods and people.\n\nSo what I've said is that I would say, wait a minute, we need to review this. There may be places where a physical barrier is appropriate.\n\nI think when both of us voted for this, we were voting for the possibility that where it was appropriate and made sense, it would be considered. But as with so much, the Bush administration has gone off the deep end, and they are unfortunately coming up with a plan that I think is counterproductive.\n\nCLINTON: So I would have a review. I would listen to the people who live along the border, who understand...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... what it is we need to be doing to protect our country.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: Let me go on, again -- John?\n\nKING: Does that mean that you think your vote was wrong, or the implementation of it was wrong?\n\nBecause, as you know, when they first built the fence in the San Diego area, it only went so far. And what it did was it sopped the people coming straight up the path of where that was built, and they simply moved. And California's problem became Arizona's problem.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCLINTON: But, you know, John, there is -- there's a lot we've learned about technology and smart fencing. You know, there is technology that can be used instead of a physical barrier.\n\nCLINTON: It requires us having enough personnel along the border so that people can be supervising a certain limited amount of space and will be able to be responsive in the event of people attempting to cross illegally.\n\nI think that the way that the Bush administration is going about this, filing eminent domain actions against landowners and municipalities, makes no sense.\n\nSo what I have said is, yes, there are places when after a careful review, again listening to the people who live along the border, there may be limited places where it would work. But let's deploy more technology and personnel, instead of the physical barrier.\n\nI frankly think that will work better and it will give us an opportunity to secure our borders without interfering with family relations, business relations, recreation and so much else that makes living along the border, you know, wonderful.\n\nBROWN: All right.\n\nCLINTON: And the people who live there need to have a president who understands it, will listen to them and be responsive.\n\nBROWN: All right, Senator Clinton.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSenator Obama, go ahead please.\n\nOBAMA: Well, this is an area where Senator Clinton and I almost entirely agree. I think that the key is to consult with local communities, whether it's on the commercial interests or the environmental stakes of creating any kind of barrier.\n\nAnd the Bush administration is not real good at listening. That's not what they do well.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nAnd so I will reverse that policy. As Senator Clinton indicated, there may be areas where it makes sense to have some fencing. But for the most part, having border patrolled, surveillance, deploying effective technology, that's going to be the better approach.\n\nThe one thing I do have to say, though, about this issue is, it is very important for us, I think, to deal with this problem in terms of thousands of -- hundreds of thousands of people coming over the borders on a regular basis if we want to also provide opportunity for the 12 million undocumented workers who are here.\n\nOBAMA: Senator Clinton and I have both campaigned in places like Iowa and Ohio and my home state of Illinois, and I think that the American people want fairness, want justice. I think they recognize that the idea that you're going to deport 12 million people is ridiculous, that we're not going to be devoting all our law enforcement resources...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... to sending people back.\n\nBut what they do also want is some order to the process. And so, we're not going to be able to do these things in isolation. We're not going to be able to deal with the 12 million people who are living in the shadows and give them a way of getting out of the shadows if we don't also deal with the problem of this constant influx of undocumented workers.\n\nAnd that's why I think comprehensive reform is so important. That's the kind of leadership that I've shown in the past; that's the kind of leadership that I'll show in the future.\n\nOne last point I want to make on the immigration issue because we may be moving to different topics: Something that we can do immediately that I think is very important is to pass the Dream Act, which allows children who through no fault of their own are here but have essentially grown up as Americans, allow them the opportunity for higher education.\n\nOBAMA: I do not want two classes of citizens in this country.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI want everybody to prosper. That's going to be a top priority.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: OK, we've got one last question on immigration.\n\nJorge, go ahead.\n\nRAMOS: (SPEAKING SPANISH) Right now, there are more than 30 million people in this country who speak Spanish.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMany of them are right here. By the year 2050, there will be 120 million Hispanics in the United States. Now, is there any downside, Senator Clinton, to the United States becoming (SPEAKING SPANISH) becoming a bilingual nation? Is there a limit?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think it's important for as many Americans as possible to do what I have never been able to do, and that is learn another language and try to be bilingual because that connects us to the rest of the world.\n\nI think it is important, though, that English remain our common unifying language because that brings our country together in a way that we have seen generations of immigrants coming to our shores be able to be part of the American experience and pursue the American dream.\n\nYou know, I have been adamantly against the efforts by some to make English the official language. That I do not believe is appropriate, and I have voted against it and spoken against it.\n\nCLINTON: I represent New York. We have 170 languages in New York City alone. And I do not think that we should be, in any way, discriminating against people who do not speak English, who use facilities like hospitals or have to go to court to enforce their rights.\n\nBut I do think that English does remain an important part of the American experience. So I encourage people to become bilingual. But I also want to see English remain the common, unifying language of our country.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRAMOS: Senator Obama, is there any down side to the United States becoming a bilingual nation?\n\nOBAMA: Well, I think it is important that everyone learns English and that we have that process of binding ourselves together as a country. I think that's very important.\n\nI also think that every student should be learning a second language, because...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... you know, so, when you start getting into a debate about bilingual education, for example, now, I want to make sure that children who are coming out of Spanish-speaking households had the opportunity to learn and are not falling behind.\n\nOBAMA: If bilingual education helps them do that, I want to give them the opportunity.\n\nBut I also want to make sure that English-speaking children are getting foreign languages because this world is becoming more interdependent and part of the process of America's continued leadership in the world is going to be our capacity to communicate across boundaries, across borders, and that's something frankly where we've fallen behind.\n\nOne of the failures of No Child Left Behind, a law that I think a lot of local and state officials have been troubled by, is that it is so narrowly focused on standardized tests that it has pushed out a lot of important learning that needs to take place.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd foreign languages is one of those areas that I think has been neglected. I want to put more resources into it.\n\nBROWN: All right.\n\nWe're going to take a quick break. We've got to go to a commercial. We'll be back with a lot more. There is also a debate we should mention raging online right now. Go to our Web site, CNNpolitics.com, and join in. The debate here at the University of Texas in Austin continues right after this.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nBROWN: And we are back. We're here in Austin, Texas, the capital city. Welcome back to the Texas Democratic debate at the University of Texas, Austin.\n\nThe first question now goes to John King.\n\nKING: Senator, as I'm sitting here, we're about 45 minutes into the discussion tonight, and I'm having what I like to call one of those parallel universe moments.\n\nI've been watching each of you give speeches in arenas not unlike this one individually. And the tone is often quite different than the very polite, substantive discourse we've had tonight.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd so, I want to ask you about that. There are times when each of you seems to call into question the other one's credibility or truthfulness.\n\nAnd, Senator Clinton, I want to talk specifically about some words you've spoken here in the state of Texas over the past couple of days.\n\nYou've said, quote, My opponent gives speeches; I offer solutions.\n\nYou said the choice for Democrats in this campaign is, quote, talk versus action.\n\nNow, in a campaign that some of us are old enough to remember, maybe not many of the students here, this would be called the Where's the beef? question.\n\nBut, since we're in Texas, I'd like to borrow a phrase that they often use here and you've used yourself in the context of President Bush. Are you saying that your opponent is all hat and no cattle, and can you say that after the last 45 minutes?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I have said that about President Bush, and I think our next president needs to be a lot less hat and a lot more cattle.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nYou know, I think you can tell from the first 45 minutes, you know, Senator Obama and I have a lot in common. We both care passionately about our country. We are devoted to public service. We care deeply about the future, and we have run a very vigorous and contested primary campaign, which has been by most standards, I think, very positive and extremely civil.\n\nCLINTON: But there are differences between us. And I think, in our efforts to draw those contrasts and comparisons, we obviously try to let voters know how we see the world differently.\n\nAnd I do offer solutions. That's what I believe in and what I have done. And it's what I offer to voters because it's part of my life, over the last 35 years, working to get kids health care, working to expand legal services for the poor, working to register voters, working to make a difference. Because I think that this country has given me so much.\n\nAnd there are differences between our records and our accomplishments. I have to confess, I was somewhat amused, the other night, when, on one of the TV shows, one of Senator Obama's supporters couldn't.\n\nSo I know that there are comparisons and contrasts to be drawn between us. And it's important that voters get that information. So, yes, I do think that words are important and words matter, but actions speak louder than words. And I offer...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: Senator Obama, go ahead.\n\nBROWN: Senator Obama, do you want to respond?\n\nOBAMA: Well, I think actions do speak louder than words, which is why over the 20 years of my public service I have acted a lot to provide health care to people who didn't have it, to provide tax breaks to families that needed it, to reform a criminal justice system that had resulted in wrongful convictions, to open up our government and to pass the toughest ethics reform legislation since Watergate, to make sure that we create transparency...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... to make sure that we create transparency in our government so that we know where federal spending is going and it's not going to a bunch of boondoggles and earmarks that are wasting taxpayer money that could be spent on things like early childhood education.\n\nYou know, I think if you talk to those wounded warriors at Walter Reed who, prior to me getting to the Senate, were having to pay for their meals and have to pay for their phone calls to their family while they're recovering from amputations, I think they've said that I've engaged not just in talk, but in action.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOBAMA: Now, I think that Senator Clinton has a fine record and I don't want to denigrate that record. I do think there is a fundamental difference between us in terms of how change comes about. Senator Clinton of late has said: Let's get real. The implication is that the people who've been voting for me or involved in my campaign are somehow delusional.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nAnd that, you know, the 20 million people who've been paying attention to 19 debates and the editorial boards all across the country at newspapers who have given me endorsements, including every major newspaper here in the state of Texas.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOBAMA: You know, the thinking is that somehow, they're being duped, and eventually they're going to see the reality of things.\n\nWell, I think they perceive reality of what's going on in Washington very clearly. What they see is that if we don't bring the country together, stop the endless bickering, actually focus on solutions and reduce the special interests that have dominated Washington, then we will not get anything done. And the reason that this campaign has done so well...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThe reason that this campaign has done so well is because people understand that it is not just a matter of putting forward policy positions.\n\nOBAMA: Senator Clinton and I share a lot of policy positions. But if we can't inspire the American people to get involved in their government and if we can't inspire them to go beyond the racial divisions and the religious divisions and the regional divisions that have plagued our politics for so long, then we will continue to see the kind of gridlock and nonperformance in Washington that is resulting in families suffering in very real ways.\n\nI'm running for president to start doing something about that suffering, and so are the people who are behind my campaign.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: I think one of the points -- I think one of the points that John King was alluding to in talking about some of Senator Clinton's comments is there has been a lot of attention lately on some of your speeches, that they are very similar to some of the speeches by your friend and supporter Deval Patrick, the governor of Massachusetts, and Senator Clinton's campaign has made a big issue of this. To be blunt, they've accused you of plagiarism.\n\nOBAMA: Right.\n\nBROWN: How do you respond?\n\nOBAMA: Well, look, the -- first of all, it's not a lot of speeches. There are two lines in speeches that I've been giving over the last couple of weeks.\n\nI've been campaigning now for the last two years. Deval is a national co-chairman of my campaign, and suggested an argument that I share, that words are important. Words matter. And the implication that they don't I think diminishes how important it is to speak to the American people directly about making America as good as its promise. Barbara Jordan understood this as well as anybody.\n\nOBAMA: And the notion that I had plagiarized from somebody who was one of my national co-chairs...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... who gave me the line and suggested that I use it, I think, is silly, and...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... you know, this is where we start getting into silly season, in politics, and I think people start getting discouraged about it...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n... and they don't want...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWhat they want is, how are we going to create good jobs and good wages?\n\nHow are we going to provide health care to the American people?\n\nHow are we going to make sure that college is affordable?\n\nSo what I've been talking about, in this speeches -- and I've got to admit, some of them are pretty good.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWhat I've been talking about is not just hope and not just inspiration. It's a $4,000 tuition credit for every student, every year, in exchange for national service...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... so that college becomes more affordable.\n\nOBAMA: I've been talking about making sure that we change our tax code so that working families actually get relief. I have been talking about making sure that we bring an end to this war in Iraq so that we can start bringing our troops home and invest money here in the United States.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSo just to finish up, these are very specific, concrete, detailed proposals, many of them which I have been working on for years now. Senator Clinton has a fine record. So do I. I'm happy to have a debate on the issues, but what we shouldn't be spending time doing is tearing each other down. We should be spending time lifting the country up.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: Senator Clinton, is it the silly season?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think that if your candidacy is going to be about words, then they should be your own words. That's, I think, a very simple proposition.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd, you know, lifting whole passages from someone else's speeches is not change you can believe in, it's change you can Xerox. And I just don't think...\n\nOBAMA: Come on.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCLINTON: No, but, you know, but, Barack, it is.\n\nBecause, you know, if you look -- if you look -- if you look at the YouTube of these videos, it does raise questions.\n\nNow, there is no doubt that you are a passionate, eloquent speaker, and I applaud you for that. But when you look at what we face in this country, we do need to unite the country, but we have to unite it for a purpose around very specific goals.\n\nCLINTON: It is not enough to say, Let's come together. We know we're going to have to work hard to overcome the opposition of those who do not want the changes to get to universal health care.\n\nYou know, when I proposed a universal health care plan, as did Senator Edwards, we took a big risk, because we know it's politically controversial to say we're going to cover everyone.\n\nAnd you chose not to do that. You chose to put forth a health care plan that will leave out at least 15 million people. That's a big difference.\n\nWhen I said we should put a moratorium on home foreclosures, basically your response was, well, that wouldn't work.\n\nAnd, you know, in the last week, even President Bush has said we have to do something like that.\n\nI just believe that we've got to look hard at the difficult challenges we face, especially after George Bush leaves the White House.\n\nCLINTON: The world will breathe a sigh of relief once he is gone. We all know that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBut then we've got to do the hard work of not just bringing the country together, but overcoming a lot of the entrenched opposition to the very ideas that both of us believe in, and for some of us have been fighting for, for a very long time. You know, when I took on...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWhen I took on universal health care back in '93 and '94, it was against a firestorm of special interest opposition. I was more than happy to do that, because I believe passionately in getting quality affordable health care to every American.\n\nI don't want to leave anybody out. I see the results of leaving people out. I am tired of health insurance companies deciding who will live or die in America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: All right, Senator Clinton, thank you.\n\nSenator Obama, please respond.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOBAMA: Well, I think that Senator Clinton mentioned two specific issue areas where we've got some differences. I'm happy to debate those, which is what I think should be the focus of this campaign. We both want universal health care.\n\nWhen I released my plan a few months later, we were in a debate and Senator Clinton said we all want universal health care. Of course, I was down 20 points in the polls at the time, and so my plan was pretty good. It's not as good now, but my plan hasn't changed. The politics have changed a little bit.\n\nWe both -- 95 percent of our plans are similar. We both want to set up a system in which any person is going to be able to get coverage that is as good as we have as members of Congress. And we are going to subsidize those who can't afford it.\n\nOBAMA: We're going to make sure that we reduce costs by emphasizing prevention. And I want to make sure that we're applying technology to improve quality, cut bureaucracy.\n\nNow, I also want to make sure that we're reducing costs for those who already have health insurance. So we put in place a catastrophic reinsurance plan that would reduce costs by $2,500 per family per year.\n\nSo we've got a lot of similarities in our plan. We've got a philosophical difference, which we've debated repeatedly, and that is that Senator Clinton believes the only way to achieve universal health care is to force everybody to purchase it.\n\nAnd my belief is, the reason that people don't have it is not because they don't want it but because they can't afford it.\n\nAnd so I emphasize reducing costs.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd as has been noted by many observers, including Bill Clinton's former secretary of labor, my plan does more than anybody to reduce costs, and there is nobody out there who wants health insurance who can't have it.\n\nOBAMA: Now, there are legitimate arguments for why Senator Clinton and others have called for a mandate, and I'm happy to have that debate.\n\nBut the notion that I am leaving 15 million people out somehow implies that we are different in our goals of providing coverage to all Americans, and that is simply not true. We think that there's going to be a different way of getting there.\n\nOne last point I want to make on the health care front. I admire the fact that Senator Clinton tried to bring about health care reform back in 1993. She deserves credit for that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBut I said before, I think she did it in the wrong way, because it wasn't just the fact that the insurance companies, the drug companies were battling here, and no doubt they were. It was also that Senator Clinton and the administration went behind closed doors, excluded the participation even of Democratic members of Congress who had slightly different ideas than the ones that Senator Clinton had put forward.\n\nAnd, as a consequence, it was much more difficult to get Congress to cooperate.\n\nOBAMA: And I've said that I'm going to do things differently. I think we have to open up the process. Everybody has to have a seat at the table. And most importantly, the American people have to be involved and educated about how this change is going to be brought about.\n\nThe point is this, you know, we can have great plans, but if we don't change how the politics is working in Washington, then neither of our plans are going to happen, and we're going to be four years from now debating once again how we're going to bring universal health care to this country.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: All right, we've got some time constraints here, so we've got to take another real quick break. Stay with us. We've got a lot more ahead.\n\nYou can compare the candidates on the issues any time; just go to our Web site, Cnnpolitics.com. A lot more ahead here at the University of Texas. We'll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: An enthusiastic crowd here at the University of Texas.\n\nWelcome back to the Texas Democratic debate. Let's get right to it. Jorge Ramos with the next question.\n\nRAMOS: Senator Clinton, yesterday you said, and I'm quoting, One of us is ready to be commander in chief.\n\nAre you saying that Senator Obama is not ready and not qualified to be commander in chief?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I believe that I am ready and I am prepared. And I will leave that to the voters to decide.\n\nBut I want to get back to health care, because I didn't get a chance to respond after Senator Obama finished. No, let me finish, Jorge...\n\nRAMOS: But I would like to come back...\n\nCLINTON: This is a significant difference. You know, Senator Obama has said it's a philosophical difference. I think it's a substantive difference.\n\nHe has a mandate for parents to be sure to ensure their children. I agree with that. I just know that if we don't go and require everyone to have health insurance, the health insurance industry will still game the system. Everyone of us with insurance will pay the hidden tax of approximately $900 a year to make up for the lack of insurance.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd you know, in one of our earlier debates, John Edwards made a great point. It would be as though Social Security were voluntary. Medicare, one of the great accomplishments of President Johnson, was voluntary.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI do not believe that is going to work. So it's not just a philosophical difference.\n\nCLINTON: You look at what will work and what will not work. If you do not have a plan that starts out attempting to achieve universal health care, you will be nibbled to death, and we will be back here with more and more people uninsured and rising costs.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: All right. We appreciate that you want to make a point, Senator Obama. We have limited time, so I would like Jorge to move on to another subject or we're going to be out of time.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: Well, I understand. But I think that Senator Clinton made a...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nYou know, she's making a point, and I think I should have the opportunity to respond very briefly. And I'll try to make...\n\nBROWN: Very briefly, absolutely.\n\nOBAMA: Number one, understand that when Senator Clinton says a mandate, it's not a mandate on government to provide health insurance, it's a mandate on individuals to purchase it. And Senator Clinton is right; we have to find out what works.\n\nOBAMA: Now, Massachusetts has a mandate right now. They have exempted 20 percent of the uninsured because they have concluded that that 20 percent can't afford it.\n\nIn some cases, there are people who are paying fines and still can't afford it, so now they're worse off than they were. They don't have health insurance and they're paying a fine.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIn order for you to force people to get health insurance, you've got to have a very harsh penalty, and Senator Clinton has said that we won't go after their wages. Now, this is a substantive difference. But understand that both of us seek to get universal health care. I have a substantive difference with Senator Clinton on how to get there.\n\nBROWN: All right, Senator Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Wait a minute, no, this is too important. This is the number one issue that people talk to me about. You know, when a mother grabs my arm and says, I can't get the operation my son needs because I don't have health insurance, it is personal for me.\n\nCLINTON: And I just fundamentally disagree.\n\nYou know, Senator Obama's plan has a mandate on parents and a fine if parents do not...\n\nOBAMA: That's right.\n\nCLINTON: ... insure their children.\n\nOBAMA: That's right.\n\nCLINTON: Because he recognizes that unless we have some kind of restriction, we will not get there.\n\nOBAMA: There's a reason.\n\nCLINTON: He's also said that if people show up at a hospital sick, without health insurance, well, maybe at that point you can fine them.\n\nWe would not have a social compact with Social Security and Medicare if everyone did not have to participate. I want a universal health care plan.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOBAMA: Now, that's -- that mother -- that mother who is desperate to get health care for her child, will be able to get that health care under my plan. Point number one.\n\nPoint number two, the reason a mandate for children can be effective is we've got an ability to make affordable health care available to that child, right now.\n\nOBAMA: There are no excuses. If a parent is not providing health care for that child, it's because the parent's not being responsible, under my plan. And those children don't have a choice. But I think that adults are going to be able to see that they can afford it, under my plan; they will get it, under my plan.\n\nAnd it is true that, if it turns out that some are gaming the system, then we can impose, potentially, some penalties on them for gaming the system.\n\nBut the notion that, somehow, I am interested in leaving out 15 million people, without health insurance, is simply not true.\n\nBROWN: All right. Jorge...\n\nCLINTON: We disagree on that.\n\nBROWN: OK. Jorge -- let's let Jorge re-ask his question, because I don't think anyone remembers that one.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nRAMOS: Let me try again, and not in Spanish, OK?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nHere we go again. Because we also believe the war in Iraq is very important.\n\nAnd here's the question. Are you suggesting that Senator Obama is not ready; he doesn't have the experience to be commander in chief? That's a question of: What did you mean by that phrase?\n\nCLINTON: What I mean is that, you know, for more than 15 years, I've been honored to represent our country in more than 80 countries to negotiate on matters such as opening borders for refugees during the war in Kosovo, to stand up for women's rights as human rights around the world. I've served on the Senate...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI've served on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I have worked as one of the leaders in the Congress on behalf of Homeland Security in the very difficult challenges we face.\n\nYou know, just this week, it's a good example. We had elections in Pakistan, we had change in government in Cuba -- or at least the leadership. We've had the elections that, you know, should have happened that haven't happened and just changed the leader the way they do in Cuba. We've had Kosovo declaring independence, and we have had our embassy set on fire in Serbia.\n\nSo we have serious problems that pose a real question about presidential leadership, and also some great opportunities. You know, we now have opportunities perhaps with Cuba, I hope with President Musharraf, for him to do the right thing.\n\nCLINTON: I supported the independence of Kosovo because I think it is imperative that in the heart of Europe we continue to promote independence and democracy. And I would be moving very aggressively to hold the Serbian government responsible with their security forces to protect our embassy. Under international law, they should be doing that.\n\nSo when you think about everything that is going to happen, what we can predict and what we cannot predict, I believe that I am prepared and ready on day one to be commander in chief, to be the president, to turn our economy around, and to begin making a lot of these very difficult decisions that we will inherit from George Bush. And that is what I am putting forth to the voters.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: Senator Obama?\n\nOBAMA: I wouldn't be running if I didn't think I was prepared to be commander-in-chief.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMy number one job as president will be to keep the American people safe. I will do whatever is required to accomplish that. I will not hesitate to act against those that would do America harm.\n\nNow, that involves maintaining the strongest military on earth, which means that we are training our troops properly and equipping them properly, and putting them on proper rotations. And there are an awful lot of families here in Texas who have been burdened under two and three and four tours because of the poor planning of the current commander-in-chief, and that will end when I am president.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOBAMA: But it also means using our military wisely. And on what I believe was the single most important foreign policy decision of this generation, whether or not to go to war in Iraq, I believe I showed the judgment of a commander in chief. And I think that Senator Clinton was wrong in her judgments on that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nNow, that has consequences -- that has significant consequences, because it has diverted attention from Afghanistan where al Qaeda, that killed 3,000 Americans, are stronger now than at any time since 2001.\n\nYou know, I've heard from an Army captain who was the head of a rifle platoon -- supposed to have 39 men in a rifle platoon. Ended up being sent to Afghanistan with 24 because 15 of those soldiers had been sent to Iraq.\n\nOBAMA: And as a consequence, they didn't have enough ammunition, they didn't have enough humvees. They were actually capturing Taliban weapons, because it was easier to get Taliban weapons than it was for them to get properly equipped by our current commander in chief.\n\nNow, that's a consequence of bad judgment. And you know, the question is, on the critical issues that we face right now, who's going to show the judgment to lead? And I think that on every critical issue that we've seen in foreign policy over the last several years -- going into Iraq originally, I didn't just oppose it for the sake of opposing it.\n\nI said this is going to distract us from Afghanistan; this is going to fan the flames of anti-American sentiment; it's going to cost us billions of dollars and thousands of lives and overstretch our military. And I was right.\n\nOn the question of Pakistan, which Senator Clinton just raised -- we just had an election there. But I've said very clearly that we have put all our eggs in the Musharraf basket. That was a mistake. We should be going after al Qaeda and making sure that Pakistan is serious about hunting down terrorists, as well as expanding democracy. And I was right about that.\n\nOn the issues that have come up that a commander in chief is going to have to make decisions on, I have shown the judgment to lead. That is the leadership that I want to show when I'm president of the United States.\n\nOBAMA: On the issues that have come up, that a commander in chief is going to have to make decisions on, I have shown the judgment to lead. That is the leadership that I want to show when I'm president of the United States.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: All right. We're going to stay with this and stay on Iraq.\n\nJohn King?\n\nKING: I want to continue in this vein, and hone in on the very point you just made. Because one of you, unless this remarkable campaign here takes another wacky, unpredictable turn, is going to be running against a decorated war hero, who is going to say that you don't have the experience to be commander in chief.\n\nAnd you have both said, it's not about that type of experience; it's about judgment.\n\nYou both had to make a judgment, a short time ago, in your job in the United States Senate, about whether to support the surge. And as that was going on, Senator Clinton, you had the commanding general in Iraq before you. And you said, I think that the reports provide to us really require the willing suspension of disbelief -- your words to General Petraeus.\n\nKING: I want you to look at Iraq now and listen to those who say the security situation is better. Ideal, no, but better -- some say significantly, in recent days, even some steps toward a political reconciliation.\n\nIs Iraq today better off than it was six months or a year ago because of the surge?\n\nCLINTON: Well, John, I think you forget a very important premise of the surge. The rationale of the surge was to create the space and time for the Iraqi government to make the decisions that only it can make.\n\nNow, there is no doubt, given the skill and the commitment of our young men and women in uniform that putting more of them in will give us a tactical advantage and will provide security in some places, and that has occurred.\n\nCLINTON: But the fact is that the purpose of it has not been fulfilled. The Iraqi government has slowly inched toward making a few of the decisions in a less than complete way, but it hasn't taken advantage of the sacrifice and the losses of life and billions of dollars that have occurred since the surge began.\n\nThat is why I have said, upon taking office I would ask the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and my security advisers to give me a plan so that I could begin withdrawing our troops within 60 days.\n\nAnd I would begin that with...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... with a very clear message to the Iraqis that they no longer had a blank check, as they had been given by President Bush, that as we withdraw our troops, probably one to two brigades a month, they would have to step up and make these decisions.\n\nCLINTON: I believe that is in the best interest of our military, which has been stretched thin.\n\nLast night in Brownsville, you know, a woman grabbed my hand and said, Please, my husband's there for the third time. Bring him home.\n\nAnd I told her privately what I have said publicly many times -- I will bring him home because I do not think it is in the interest of America or of the Iraqis that we continue to be there. It is up to the Iraqis to decide the kind of future they will have.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: Senator Obama, in the same vein, you were also opposed to the surge from the beginning. Were you wrong?\n\nOBAMA: Well, I think it is indisputable that we've seen violence reduced in Iraq. And that's a credit to our brave men and women in uniform.\n\nIn fact, you know, the 1st Cavalry, out of Fort Hood, played an enormous role in pushing back al Qaeda out of Baghdad.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOBAMA: And, you know, we honor their service.\n\nBut this is a tactical victory imposed upon a huge strategic blunder.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nAnd I think that, when we're having a debate with John McCain, it is going to be much easier for the candidate who was opposed to the concept of invading Iraq in the first place to have a debate about the wisdom of that decision...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... than having to argue about the tactics subsequent to the decision.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBecause, ultimately, that's what's at stake. Understand, not only have we been diverted from Afghanistan. We've been diverted from focusing on Latin America.\n\nWe contribute -- our entire foreign aid to Latin America is $2.7 billion, approximately what we spend in Iraq in a week.\n\nOBAMA: And it is any surprise, then, that you've seen people like Hugo Chavez and countries like China move into the void, because we've been neglectful of that.\n\nIran is the single biggest strategic beneficiary of us having invaded Iraq, and that is something that I think John McCain has to come to terms with.\n\nSo that is a debate that I'm happy to have.\n\nOne last point I want to make on this, and that is, the incredible burden that has been placed on the American people, starting with military families, and the fact that we still are not doing right by our veterans, that we still don't honor their service, that there are still homeless veterans, that we still don't screen properly for post-traumatic stress disorder and make sure that they're getting mental services that they need, that we are still...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... having veterans in south Texas have to drive 250 miles to access a veterans hospital.\n\nOBAMA: That's unacceptable. But we talked about the economy earlier, the fact that we're spending $12 billion every month in Iraq means that we can't engage in the kind of infrastructure improvements that are going to make us more competitive. It means that we can't deliver on the kinds of health care reforms that both Senator Clinton and I are looking for.\n\nAnd that is also an argument that we have to have with John McCain because he has said that he is willing to have these troops over there for 100 years. The notion that we would sustain that kind of effort and neglect not only making us more secure here at home, more competitive here at home, allow our economy to sink. As John McCain says, he doesn't really understand the economy that well. It is clear from his embrace of George Bush's policies that he doesn't, and that's what I intend to change when I am president of the United States of America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: All right. We've got to take another quick break. We've got a lot more ahead. Stay with us. We'll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nBROWN: Welcome back to the Texas Democratic debate.\n\nStay with us after the debate. Anderson Cooper and the best political team on television will have lots of analysis.\n\nBut back to the debate.\n\nJohn King?\n\nKING: Thank you.\n\nBoth of you have been harshly critical of the Bush administration for its secrecy, what you consider overuse of secrecy and executive power.\n\nTonight, Senator Obama, you've talked about more transparency. You also at one point criticized earmarks.\n\nAnd yet, a recent report came out that identified you -- lower on the list in terms how much money senators seek and sneak into the budget for these pork barrel spending projects, but it still said you were responsible for $91 million in earmarks.\n\nAnd you have refused to say where the money went, what it's for. Why?\n\nOBAMA: No, that's not true. We've actually disclosed, John, all our earmarks. And so, you know, we'll be happy to provide you with that information, because I believe very strongly in transparency.\n\nOBAMA: As I indicated earlier, one of the things that I did last year was to pass a bill with Tom Coburn, very conservative Republican but a sincere fiscal conservative. And we got together and created what we call Google for Government. It's a searchable database, where every single dollar of federal spending is posted on the Internet, so that ordinary voters can take a look. And if they see a bridge to nowhere being built, they know where it's going and who sponsored it. And if they see a no-bid contract going to Halliburton, they can check that out, too.\n\nAnd you know, the idea is that we open up the process so that the American people can make judgments about whether or not government is doing what it's supposed to be doing with its taxpayer money. And I've been consistently in favor of more disclosure around earmarks.\n\nOBAMA: Now, keep in mind, a lot of these are worthy projects in our states. I have actively pursued projects that I think are important. But I want to make sure that they're not done in the dark of night, that they're not done in committee, that everybody stands up and says, this is the kind of spending that I think is important.\n\nI have consistently supported those efforts. I will push for those as president of the United States of America.\n\nKING: Senator Clinton, as you know, I think your number was about $342 million. You say they're worthy projects, as Senator Obama did, for your state and that's part of your job, to get money for worthy projects back in your state.\n\nSenator McCain, as you know, is proud of going around the country earmark.\n\nOn the specific issue of pork barrel spending, fiscal accountability by the government at a time when many Americans frankly think, whether it is the House or the Senate, that you all waste money on things that aren't important to them, don't affect their daily lives, does he have a better case to make to the American people that, I have done this my entire career; I will do it as president, on the issue of on the issue of wasteful pork barrel spending?\n\nCLINTON: Well, no, not at all. Because he supported the wasteful tax cuts of the Bush administration and the Iraq war, with the billions of dollars...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... that have been spent, and wants it to continue.\n\nYou know, when President Bush came into office, he inherited a balanced budget and a surplus. And it is gone. And we now are looking at a projected deficit of $400 billion, under the new Bush budget, and a $9 trillion debt.\n\nWe borrow money from the Chinese to buy oil from the Saudis. That is not a winning strategy for America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI will get us back to fiscal responsibility. And I will make it clear that the Bush tax cuts on the upper income, those making more than $250,000 a year, will be allowed to expire.\n\nCLINTON: Middle-class tax cuts and support for the middle class, to make college affordable, retirement security possible, health insurance affordable: Those will be my priorities.\n\nAnd I think it's important that we look at where the money has gone under President Bush -- no-bid contracts, cronyism, outsourcing the government in ways that haven't saved us money and have reduced accountability.\n\nSo the larger question is, who really is going to move us toward fiscal responsibility, and I believe that we can get back on the path we were on. It was working well. It was one of the reasons why the economy was booming.\n\nI've got that, you know, clearly in my economic blueprint, which is something that I've published the last few days, because it's part of what we have to do again. And I think that I will be very comfortable and effective in taking on Senator McCain over the fiscal irresponsibility of the Republican Party that he's been a part of.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: All right.\n\nAn issue relating to the current election.\n\nJorge?\n\nRAMOS: As we can see, this has been an extremely close nomination battle that will come down to superdelegates. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the highest ranking Democrat in government, said recently, and I'm quoting, It would be a problem -- and this is a question for you, Senator Clinton -- it would be a problem for the party if the verdict would be something different than the public has decided.\n\nDo you agree?\n\nCLINTON: Well, you know, these are the rules that are followed, and you know, I think that it will sort itself out. I'm not worried about that. We will have a nominee, and we will have a unified Democratic Party, and we will go on to victory in November.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: Senator Obama, go ahead. Do you have a response to Senator Clinton?\n\nOBAMA: Well, I think it is important, given how hard Senator Clinton and I have been working, that these primaries and caucuses count for something. And so my belief is that...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... the will of the voters, expressed in this long election process, is what ultimately will determine who our next nominee is going to be.\n\nOBAMA: But understand what I think is most important to the voters, and that is that we have a government that is listening to them again. They feel as if they've been shut out.\n\nYou know, when I meet mothers who are trying to figure out how to get health care for their kids, it's not just the desperation of that single mom. It's also that when they try to find some help, oftentimes they're hitting a brick wall.\n\nAnd they don't get a sense that the debates that are happening in Washington right now relate to them at all. And what they believe is that people are trying to get on TV and they're trying to score points and they're trying to win elections, and that they're not interested in knocking down the barriers that stand between the American people and their dreams.\n\nAnd I have no doubt that the Democratic Party at its best can summon a sense of common purpose again and higher purpose for the American people.\n\nOBAMA: And I think that the next nominee going into the November election is going to have a lot to talk about because the American people are tired of politics that is dominated by the powerful, by the connected. They want their government back, and that's what I intend to provide them when I'm nominated for president of the United States.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: We have time for just one final question, and we thought we would sort of end on a more philosophical question. You've both spent a lot of time talking about leadership, about who's ready and who has the right judgment to lead if elected president.\n\nA leader's judgment is most tested at times of crisis. I'm wondering if both of you will describe what was the moment that tested you the most, that moment of crisis.\n\nBROWN: Senator Obama?\n\nOBAMA: Well, you know, I wouldn't point to a single moment. But what I look at is the trajectory of my life because, you know, I was raised by a single mom. My father left when I was two, and I was raised by my mother and my grandparents.\n\nAnd, you know, there were rocky periods during my youth, when I made mistakes and was off course. And what was most important, in my life, was learning to take responsibility for my own actions, learning to take responsibility for not only my own actions but how I can bring people together to actually have an impact on the world.\n\nAnd so, working as a community organizer on the streets of Chicago, with ordinary people, bringing them together and organizing them to provide jobs and health care, economic security to people who didn't have it, then working as a civil rights attorney and rejecting the jobs on Wall Street to fight for those who were being discriminated against on the job -- that cumulative experience, I think, is the judgment that I now bring.\n\nOBAMA: It's the reason that I have the capacity to bring people together, and it's the reason why I am determined to make sure that the American people get a government that is worthy of their decency and their generosity.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: Senator Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think everybody here knows I've lived through some crises and some challenging moments in my life. And...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd I am grateful for the support and the prayers of countless Americans.\n\nBut people often ask me, How do you do it? You know, How do you keep going? And I just have to shake my head in wonderment, because with all of the challenges that I've had, they are nothing compared to what I see happening in the lives of Americans every single day. along with Senator McCain, as the only two elected officials, to speak at the opening at the Intrepid Center at Brooke Medical Center in San Antonio, a center designed to take care of and provide rehabilitation for our brave young men and women who have been injured in war.\n\nAnd I remember sitting up there and watching them come in. Those who could walk were walking. Those who had lost limbs were trying with great courage to get themselves in without the help of others. Some were in wheelchairs and some were on gurneys. And the speaker representing these wounded warriors had had most of his face disfigured by the results of fire from a roadside bomb.\n\nCLINTON: You know, the hits I've taken in life are nothing compared to what goes on every single day in the lives of people across our country.\n\nAnd I resolved at a very young age that I'd been blessed and that I was called by my faith and by my upbringing to do what I could to give others the same opportunities and blessings that I took for granted.\n\nThat's what gets me up in the morning. That's what motivates me in this campaign.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd, you know, no matter what happens in this contest -- and I am honored, I am honored to be here with Barack Obama. I am absolutely honored.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: Whatever happens, we're going to be fine. You know, we have strong support from our families and our friends. I just hope that we'll be able to say the same thing about the American people, and that's what this election should be about.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBROWN: All right, a standing ovation here in Austin, Texas. Our thanks to Senator Barack Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton. We appreciate your time tonight.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd to John and Jorge as well.\n\nWe also want to thank our debate partners, the University of Texas at Austin and the Texas Democratic Party, the LBJ Library as well, and the city of Austin.\n\nEND E-mail to a friend
Women are breaking the glass ceiling in Saudi finance.\n\nThree top jobs in banking and financial markets have been filled by women within the last week. One of Saudi Arabia's top banks, Samba Financial Group, appointed Rania Nashar as chief executive officer on Sunday.\n\nSaudi-owned Al Arabyia TV reported Monday that another bank, Arab National Bank, has appointed Latifa Al Sabhan as its chief financial officer. The bank did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe two banking picks follow an announcement last Thursday that the country's stock exchange would be lead by a women -- Sarah Al Suhaimi -- for the first time.\n\nHurt by low oil prices, Saudi Arabia last year set out an ambitious diversification plan for the economy in 2030. Part of that reform is to increase women's participation in the workforce to 30% from 22%.\n\nRelated: Saudi Arabia's giant oil IPO on track for 2018\n\nAl Suhaimi, now chairman of the stock exchange, is also the CEO of investment bank, NCB Capital. She has held that position for almost three years, managing assets of over $20 billion.\n\nThe Saudi stock exchange, or Tadawul, is the biggest in the Middle East. Its companies have a combined market capitalization of about $320 billion.\n\nNashar has 20 years experience at Samba and worked her way up through the bank's career development program, according to a statement from Samba.\n\nSome Saudi women have taken leading roles in family businesses but they have not been as prominent in the corporate world.\n\nObstacles remain\n\nWhile the Saudi executives promoted in the past few days will occupy influential positions, there are still serious obstacles to women working in the kingdom. They're not allowed to drive and need permission from a male guardian to travel abroad.\n\nSaudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who does not hold a government role but is a prominent global investor, wrote a blog post in December calling for the end to the driving ban.\n\nRelaxing the driving ban was not mentioned in the 2030 vision, but the kingdom's new leaders are keen to modernize the economy. That will require cultural reform.\n\nAnd there are signs of change underway. Just this weekend, the city of Jeddah hosted a three-day Comic Con festival for the first time.\n\nIt attracted many young men and women under one tent -- a significant shift in a country where gender segregation is imposed in many public spaces.
(CNN) Georgia may feel teleported to the center of the US political universe, but its emergence as a swing state has been a long time coming.\n\nThat doesn't make its political evolution any less remarkable. One of the five Southern states that voted for the segregationist George Wallace in 1968, it joins Virginia as one of two Southern states to oppose Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIt's not the folksy rhetoric of a White man pushing a connection to rural America -- Jimmy Carter, from Plains, Georgia, or Bill Clinton, from Hope, Arkansas, that won Georgia for President-elect Joe Biden.\n\nIt was a sophisticated turnout operation that awoke more than 150,000 more votes in the urban Atlanta region in 2020 compared to 2016 and, separately, rapidly growing suburbs fed up with Trump's brand of conservatism. It's a quickly growing population, and a diversifying one, that responded to those efforts. Atlanta is a capitol of Black American culture and the state has seen a massive influx of Latinos.\n\nThis year, no other US state has felt more important:\n\nBiden's razor-thin Georgia victory was decisive in his commanding electoral college win\n\nThe honesty of its GOP election officials countered Trump's specious allegations of voter fraud\n\nIts twin Senate runoffs will determine which party controls the US Senate, which has enormous implications for what Biden can accomplish (or not) during the first two years of his presidency.\n\nAfter nearly three decades supporting Republican presidential candidates -- the last Democrat Georgia supported was Bill Clinton in 1992 -- its vote for Biden seemed like a surprise, but it came after a remarkable grassroots campaign to get new voters to the polls and years of demographic shifts that have created a more diverse population.\n\nWhat kind of swing state will Georgia be?\n\nThe question for Georgia is whether Democratic gains signal a real shift or a mirage. After all, among swing states, there are those permanently in the category, like Florida and Ohio, there are those transitioning from reliably supporting one party to the other, like Virginia, and there are fluke states.\n\nBarack Obama turned two previously red southern states blue in 2008. But while Virginia has stayed in the Democratic column in each successive presidential election and now seems as reliably blue as any other US state, North Carolina veered back to Republicans, although it has remained at the top of Democrats' target list.\n\nThe outcome of the twin Senate runoffs in Georgia on January 5 will hold some indication and test the turnout operation Stacey Abrams undertook with her organization The New Georgia Project after she narrowly lost the 2018 governor's race there.\n\nGetting people who haven't been voting and engaging younger voters have long been the aim of Democrats who want to appeal to the wide range of minority voters. Actually making it happen is what helped them win in Georgia.\n\nWe have seen dramatic turnout among communities that typically are not at the top of mind for candidates. We have seen them be engaged, be encouraged and we have seen them turn out, Abrams told CNN on Election Day in November.\n\nPart of it might also come down to paying attention. Democrats focused national efforts on Georgia and won. They frustrated Texas Democrats when they didn't pay as much attention there with visits by national candidates, and lost.\n\nI talked to Andra Gillespie, a professor at Emory University and director of the James Weldon Johnson Institute for the Study of Race and Difference , to better understand the trends specifically in Georgia.\n\nWhen I spoke to her in June , by the way, it still seemed like a reach for Biden to win Georgia, even if the state was clearly in play, and probably will be for years to come.\n\nBut the most important thing I took from our conversation last week is that parties are constantly realigning. And today's Democrats and Republicans could be unrecognizable in the future.\n\nOur phone conversation, lightly edited for length and flow, is below:\n\nA decades-long shift to some form of purple\n\nWHAT MATTERS: What's going on in Georgia, broadly speaking, with a shift toward Democrats right now?\n\nGILLESPIE: What we have seen in the last decade is that in statewide elections in Georgia is that Democrats have been increasing their margins. They've been garnering more votes. They've been narrowing the gap between them and the Republican Party. So if they were going to continue on that trajectory, it was only a matter of time before Democrats were going to pass Republicans in terms of the vote.\n\nWinning the presidential election is only one data point, so I can't, I can't create a trend just yet with respect to that. What I suspect we're entering into is an era of increased competition where I'm expecting that we're going to continue to see very narrow margins between Democratic and Republican candidates in statewide elections, where Democrats win some elections and Republicans some elections.\n\nI don't think Georgia is blue by any stretch of the imagination, but it is moving towards some form of purple and I wouldn't be surprised if we stay there for, you know, the next decade or so.\n\nA new shift is changing the state\n\nWHAT MATTERS: How is the Georgia that Biden won different than the Georgia that Carter won, or before that, Wallace?\n\nGILLESPIE: What we saw in the '80s and '90s, in any race that didn't involve What we saw in the '80s and '90s, in any race that didn't involve Sam Nunn , was a shift of White voters away from the Democratic Party and toward the Republican Party.\n\nSouthern whites were a firm part of the New Deal coalition and that starts to change after the Civil Rights Movement. It didn't happen overnight. It took a long period of time. It culminated in the 2000s, at the beginning of the decade, with Sonny Perdue's gubernatorial victory and a change in party of the control in the state House of Representatives. And then it culminated by the 2010s at the end of the decade, when all of the statewide offices were won by Republican candidates.\n\nThat's a very different shift than what's happening now. We're not seeing a big shift in terms of White voters in the state of Georgia, even though Georgia has a nontrivial number of White Democratic voters. What we're seeing is a growth in the nonwhite population and in the nonwhite electorate that tends to lean Democratic in its voting behavior. That, coupled with a nontrivial number of White Democratic voters, is making the state more competitive.\n\nWe also have to credit the effort of both the Democratic Party and outside groups in reaching out to likely Democratic voters, getting them registered to vote and then getting them educated and mobilized so that they actually turn out to vote.\n\nDemocrats need a coalition\n\nGILLESPIE: What we've seen happen in the last 20 years in the state is, one: the size of the African American vote makes up 30% of registered voters in the state.\n\nGiven the fact that they are 90% Democratic in their voting behaviors, that means they make up the majority of Democratic voters in the state.\n\nBut you can't win with 90% of 30% of the population, so you need a nontrivial number of White voters. And unlike neighboring states, Georgia is in a position where Democrats can get 30% of White voters.\n\nGeorgia, unlike South Carolina or Alabama or Mississippi, has a very fast-growing Asian American and Hispanic population.\n\nWhile the Black electorate grew in the 2000s, the growth has been the most Asian American and Hispanic voters in the 2010s. They were 3% of all of registered voters in 2012, they were 6% of registered voters in this election cycle, and they also break Democratic. And if you get everybody to turn out to vote, you can put a winning electoral coalition together of African American, Asian American, Hispanic and liberal White voters.\n\nAtlanta brings new voters to the state\n\nWHAT MATTERS: Why are the White voters in Georgia potentially more liberal than they are in neighboring southern states?\n\nGILLESPIE: In part because of Atlanta being a financial hub, a tech hub, a hub for the arts. Atlanta is attracting well educated professional types of voters who are more Democratic in their orientation. Whether you're coming to work for the major universities, whether you're coming to work in tech or one of the Fortune 500 companies, whether you have come to Georgia to work in the arts and entertainment industry here, in Atlanta. These are voters who are perceived as being more Democratic in their orientation. They also may not be from the region. And they bring different values with them into the state.\n\nThe parties will change in the future\n\nWHAT MATTERS: This is a state that voted for George Wallace 52 years ago. What's it going to look like in 50 years?\n\nGILLESPIE: I have no idea what it is going to look like politically in 50 years. That's a lot of time. And with one breakthrough election, I can't extrapolate very far into the future. So I want to hesitate in over reading the data that I have right now.\n\nSuffice to say that when my colleagues and I talk about changing demographics in the state, I want to be very clear that we're not making a 'demographics are destiny' type of argument.\n\nIn particular, Georgia is more Democratic now because it's got growing populations of color who are predisposed to be Democratic in orientation.\n\nThis is not to say that 20 or 40 or 50 years from now that these populations are still going to be Democratic in orientation. A lot can change.\n\nLet's say America can get a handle on its racism problem. You'll probably see people making fewer political decisions based on the racial identity.\n\nThe parties can also change their attitudes. We've seen that happen. A hundred years ago, who would have thought that the Democratic Party, the party of segregation, that would be the party of Civil Rights today? But that happened because the party changed its policies on these issues.\n\nOr who would have thought that the party of Lincoln would be the party of Donald Trump?\n\nThe parties as we know them today could be different. They may not exist anymore, so I can't speculate that far into the future. And I think it's also important to understand that voting behavior and party identification are dynamic and that they are subject to change, depending on what political changes happen, what decisions our society makes in terms of what issues they want to advocate for.
(CNN) —\n\nMichigan Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis addressed the court in Lansing before former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University doctor Larry Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison.\n\nHere's what Povilaitis told Judge Rosemarie Aquilina shortly before the sentence was delivered on Wednesday:\n\nThe breadth and ripple of this defendant's abuse and destruction is nearly infinite. It centers in the Lansing and Michigan State University communities and it spans the state of Michigan and reaches club and elite training gyms, collegiate athletics and even the United States and international Olympic communities. And it's not even limited to gymnastics as athletes from over a dozen different sports have reported abuse. His practiced and perfected abuse spanned over 25 years and included countless victims, beginning before he was even a doctor, one who traveled the world seeking gold. But we know his access to children and young women and his abuse did not end until an investigative news report and one brave woman came public to stop him.\n\nThe basic facts of his assaults have been recounted by the charged victims in this case as well as numerous victims who gave their impact statements. The facts that the defendant admitted to your honor, under oath, that he penetrated these young girls' vaginas and anuses with his bare hands, not for any medical purpose, but for his own sexual pleasure. He had erections as he performed these so-called treatments. He asked 11 year olds to tell him if they were on their periods so he could be sure they were ripe for his abuse. Children that were prepubescent, often unaware of their bodies. Children whose parents sat feet away, near children. But the assaults he perpetrated on these trusting young girls was not limited to the hours and hours and hours of sexual penetration.\n\nThe defendant is a twisted, beloved, renowned doctor who used his prestige to gain the trust of these girls, to exploit them, leaving many of them emotionally shattered, used by a man that they not only trusted but also loved. He supposedly practiced osteopathic manipulative medicine but in truth, he was simply a master manipulator. He manipulated victims and parents. He manipulated his community through the press and social media early in this case. And he tried to manipulate the police department in his interviews. He tried to manipulate prior investigators. He even tried to manipulate your honor and this court through his pathetic letter. All while knowing the truth, that he did the things he was accused of doing. And in competitive gymnastics, he found the perfect place for this master manipulation.\n\nIn gymnastics, young girls do what they are told. They hide their pain, they hide their injuries. These young girls bared all of it. Their bodies were constantly on display and under scrutiny. It takes some kind of sick perversion to not only assault a child but to do so with her parent in the room. To do so while a lineup of eager young gymnasts waited to see the gymnastics god, Larry Nassar. It's a sick perversion when a defendant's close family, friends were upstairs in his own home while he abused young Kyle Stephens, just 6 years old when it began.\n\nHis own wife and children sat upstairs for years while he gave his basement treatments. To unnecessarily and without warning penetrate an unsuspecting minor for your own selfish sexual gains while her parent sat just feet away, unknowing, had to be part of the rush or the thrill for this defendant. The thrill that he might just get caught.\n\nBut he was a master. He had developed a built-in defense. No coach should be in a shower with a boy. No priest has an excuse for any type of sexual touching. But Nassar perfected a built-in excuse and defense. He was a doctor and a good one. So the world thought. And this makes up the other half of his scheme. The trust he could garner from being not only a doctor, a respected professional but an Olympic doctor, one who treated these young girls, these young victims' heroes. He adorned his office with pictures of Olympians he treated, with the far-off places his supposed expertise took him. He brought back tokens for his precious victims, regalia from competitions around the world. In doing so, he made each of his victims feel special. As Kassie Powell said, the defendant hid behind Olympic rings and Spartan green and white.\n\nFor many of these girls, Nassar was not just a doctor but a confidant, a role model, sometimes the only affirming male influence in their lives. The level of Nassar's predation reaches even higher because he often knew the victim's parents, some of whom were fellow doctors, others who unwittingly sent patients to him. He even knew some of the parents were police officers. He was so well practiced in his abuse and continually empowering himself that he believed he would get away with it despite any parents' profession. He believed he was untouchable. This defendant not only robbed these children of their innocence, he robbed many of them of their good health. He performed no healing, only hurt. With so many heartbreaking stories of unnecessary treatments, misdiagnoses, inaccurate medical treatment, which we know has resulted in lasting permanent damage. Many of these survivors wonder whether their now lifelong injuries could have been treated had he not wanted the continued access to their young bodies. He wasn't a world-renowned doctor. As one of our experts so eloquently put it in preparing this case for trial, he was performing hocus pocus medicine.\n\nOver the last 16 months, as I have prepared this case and lived this case and thrown my heart and soul into this case, I have often wondered: did he really think he was going to get away with this? Abusing so many for so many years over two decades. So many sports. No patient, no child was safe. And yet, he also abused some of our most prominent national heroes. Maybe he did think he could beat the odds and you know what, for years he did. What that did, that beating of the odds to Kyle Stephens, to Jessica Thomashow, to Madeline Jones, Kaylee Lorincz and Bailey Lorencen, to victims D, and G and I, to Rachael Denhollander. History gave him guidance for the future, every previous time there had been an allegation, nothing happened. His lies worked.\n\nThis court heard from several women, some decades later, who were initially determined to be confused or to be liars. He was believed over these children. Larissa Boyce, Tiffany Thomas, Brianne Randall and Amanda Thomashow. Sometimes four, 14 and 20 years have passed since those brave women told someone. You saw and heard firsthand. To know your truth, to be called a liar, by not only your abuser but to also not be believed by other trusting adults. What does that do to a person? Adults who were supposed to protect you and could have made it stop and could have prevented others from the same fate. What does that do to a child? We saw first hand what it does. And with each time he got away, he was empowered to continue and perfect and abuse even more.\n\nIt should not take finding a collection of 37,000 vile and disgusting images to believe these women and girls. It shouldn't take investigative journalists to expose predators. It should not take one brave woman put in the unenviable position and choice to go public with her name and be the only public person for months. But thank God we had these journalists. And that they exposed this truth and that they continued to cover this story. Thank God Rachael Denhollander made the first contact with the reporter and decided to allow them to publish her name. How many times have we heard that without those stories and Rachael, victims would not have reported, they would not be here to speak this week, to expose what truly happened all of these years behind those doors and under that towel.\n\nWe have all learned a few lessons from this case and these past seven days of powerful testimony. As I reflect back, an entire semester of a college class in sexual abuse – grooming behaviors and why victims delay and predatory behavior has played out this past week and a half. But as we look back on this case in the last seven days, I'm struck by a number of observations. What does it say about our society that victims of sexual abuse have to hide their pain for years when they did nothing wrong? What does it say about our society when victims do come forward and they are automatically met with skepticism and doubt, treated as liars until proven true? What do we take away from this?\n\nThese have been important narratives to hear and witness and listen to. They will be the words that burn down cultural stereotypes and cultural myths. And I have a few takeaways and lessons I hope anyone watching these past seven days has learned and will take away with them. The first is that we must start by believing. Other adults must start by believing when children and young people report abuse, regardless of who the perpetrator is. No matter his education, his position, the respect he commands, or the awards and adoration he has received. Research shows that false allegations are slim, that most perpetrators are serial offenders and that how a victim, especially a child, is treated when they disclose, if they are believed and supported and not blamed, can affect their well-being for years and can support better outcomes within the criminal justice system and protect other victims.\n\nYet, even after the first day and the conclusion of the first week, it was brought to my attention by many involved in this case that there are still people in this very community and elsewhere, I would imagine, who are saying that these women were all in it for the money or the attention. Are you kidding me? After 150 heart-wrenching, raw, graphic, visceral impact statements, how can anyone … believe that? Even to this day, even as this historic sentencing hearing is broadcast around the globe, there are still likely people who doubt. Perhaps those 2,000 folks who voted for this defendant as school board member. Perhaps the many petition writers we're aware of – who included doctors and trainers and athletes and lawyers – who spared nothing to come to the defense of this defendant over 16 months ago. And continued to defend him for months even after he had been charged with Kyle Stephens' abuse. I hope and pray that they are watching, that they are listening and that they have learned their lesson.\n\nThe second lesson I take away and hope others do, is that anyone can be a perpetrator, anyone can be a serial sexual abuser. This defendant stole, cheated and lied. He stole these victims' innocence. He lied about his behavior and he cheated parents and the community and the world of the trust they held in doctors, prominent physicians and prominent community members. Experts teach on this issue. Russell Strand teaches on offender dynamics and behavior. Strand talks about how abusers have three personas. The first is the public one for all to see. The second is the uninhabited persona, what you only let others close to you see. We all have those two personas, but the third is the hidden and secret one. It's hidden in the mind and the eyes and beliefs of the perpetrator. And that persona is often hidden well. Serial child molesters hide among us. We know that this defendant had a good persona, a good public persona at least. He was the good guy, the goofy guy and Olympic doctor, the medical school professor, the gymnastics god. He was a religious and pious man, a father, a husband, a friend, a school board candidate, a man of honor and passion. So kind and giving and always approachable. He never charged for his services and he saw patients basically anywhere.\n\nBut we know, without a doubt after the seven days, what we on this team have known for 16 months: that Nassar's third hidden persona, just as Strand discusses, that he is possibly the most prolific serial child sexual abuser in history. A selfish child molester who spared no one. Nassar hid behind that outer facade that is different and faked and not real but that people believed were real. People came to his defense. They believed that they were the man that he wanted them to see and not the monster hiding beneath.\n\nAs a society, our response cannot be that he couldn't do this. Or that I knew his character, I knew he wasn't capable of this kind of crime. It's because no one wants to see it. The only person who sees this side are his victims. Then the perpetrator goes back, shows only what he wants the world to see. This is how he got away with this for so long and got people to believe him over the many, many, many victims who reported. Anyone can be an abuser. The third takeaway from this week is that delayed disclosure of child sexual abuse is not unique. In fact, it's quite the norm. Kids don't report sexual abuse right away, either because the abuser is a trusted adult, especially when it's a doctor, especially when they are so young and have no sexual experience to understand what is wrong.\n\nThe fourth takeaway is that predators groom their victims and families. This is so confusing to so many women. He was so nice, he gave them presents and trinkets and desserts. He broke rules for them, especially when you contrast his behavior and relationship to the harsh and cruel and abusive coaches that these girls were exposed to. He was only doing that to gain their trust, to confuse them and get what he wanted. The (fifth) takeaway, is we must teach our girls and boys to speak up. Kids are told to be respectful of adults. Girls and boys don't speak up. It is easier to put up with discomfort than cause waves. And when they are brave, nothing happens. We teach our girls and daughters to be too nice, to just ignore and put up with uncomfortable situations, to stay silent when they should be allowed to be heard. We need to teach them to continue to speak up until someone listens and helps.\n\nThe sixth takeaway from this week and a half is that police and prosecutors must take on hard cases regardless of who the offender is. They cannot shy away from tough cases because of who the offender is or his position in the community. They cannot victim-blame or wait until they have the perfect case. They cannot wait until they have dozens of victims who have come forward. Police and prosecutors must also start by believing, be victim centered and offender focused in their work.\n\nThe final takeaway is that we as a society need investigative journalists more than ever. What finally started this reckoning and ended this decadeslong cycle of abuse was investigative reporting. Without that first Indianapolis Star story in August of 2016, without the story where Rachael came forward publicly shortly thereafter, he would still be practicing medicine, treating athletes and abusing kids. Let that sink in for a minute. Right now, he would be at his office … not far from this courtroom and the Michigan State University campus abusing children, had it not been for the investigative reporters and Rachael who brought this case. We know federal law enforcement did not stop him nor did trainers or coaches or deans or medical supervisors. Victim disclosures to adults didn't stop him. Reporters began the story and excellent victim-centered, offender-focused police and prosecutors grabbed the baton and brought us here today.\n\nI'm proud of the work of the Michigan State University Police Department and our team at the attorney general's office. There is no more supportive police chief in this country than Chief Jim Dunlap. And our victims and the public are incredibly lucky to have their case investigated by arguably the best sex crimes detective in the country and her team. Detective Lt. Andrea Munford is not only a smart, dedicated and hard-working investigator, but she is also empathetic and compassionate. Our victims are also lucky to have the full and unwavering support of Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, who from day one of taking on this case has supported this prosecution fully. Our team is so proud of these young women for speaking. So many have shared their story and name and face and they should feel no shame because they did nothing wrong. He did.\n\nIt's worth remembering once again that it was one woman who came public first, and when she did, she was ridiculed. Folks rallied behind him. They tried to discredit her. They signed petitions in support of him. They believed him over her because of who he was purported to be. People continued to support him in this very community and believe him after we charged Kyle Stephens' case, after he faced multiple counts of criminal sexual conduct first against a minor. They chose to believe his lies over the words of a young woman who had nothing to gain by coming forward. Nothing. Some of his support wavered after he was charged with possessing tens of thousands of images of child pornography.\n\nYet, still there were people in power who had ideas he was framed and the images were planted, who were telling other victims this as they knew their truth. At the same time that these folks were supporting him and putting out those false narratives, these women and countless more you haven't met and who may be watching and reading, knew their truth. They knew he had abused them and they watched him continue to lie about committing that abuse. It has not been an easy process for these victims, especially Rachael, all alone publicly for many, many months. To be accused of being a pied piper of sorts in court, in the press, to be accused of somehow planting this idea of victimhood in other women's minds, the gripping testimony these past two weeks have shown how absurd those arguments are.\n\nYou have seen first hand the effects this abuse has had on these women. That is tangible, physical evidence that this happened, that these women were abused, not bandwagon jumpers, not money grabbers. Women and girls who were abused. For victims to realize years and decades later that they were, in fact, abused, sometimes hundreds of times when they really thought they were receiving legitimate treatment, it shifts their equilibrium. It shatters their sense of the world, their sense of safety, their conception of trust. It has caused them to question what they believe and know, and that has lasting consequences. Unlike any other crime that comes before you Judge Aquilina, sexual abuse and assault so deeply affects and alters victims' lives. It seeps and oozes and permeates into every pore and crevice of a victim's life. It can alter their life's trajectory. We've seen that time and time again this week when we've heard mention of depression and anxiety and panic attacks, suicidal thoughts, self-medication, self-harm, question of self-worth, and even when we heard from Donna Markham some seven days ago about the suicide of (her daughter) Chelsey.\n\nNassar sentenced these little girls and other little girls to lives in prison by fear and doubt. The courage it takes to overcome so many little obstacles to try and right your world and just live normal daily life, again, is immeasurable. They had to overcome these obstacles on a daily basis for the rest of their lives. His sexual abuse turned their world upside down and inside out, but this process of support and this courtroom and the community helps bring healing. Your honor, I wholeheartedly want to thank you and your staff for graciously allowing each victim to be heard. When we fashioned a sentence agreement allowing for the reported victims to speak, which at that point, was in the neighborhood of 120 victims, survivors, we wanted all to feel involved in this process and to have their voice heard.\n\nWhat we have witnessed here in this courtroom exceeded even my wildest dream. What we have witnessed here is unprecedented but hopefully not the last time that victims will be heard in this manner. The compassion and empathy that you have shown these women, the support and encouraging words you have given each one, coupled with what I know is the belief that they and their stories matter, will be remembered by all long after this case is over. Over 150 women had courage to walk into this courtroom, most to be publicly identified and outed to the world as a Nassar victim for the first time.\n\nYet, they have the grace and the courage to speak their truth and become survivors. To each survivor, thank you. Thank you for coming forward, for trusting us, for doing what is so hard and difficult, especially when you reported to the police, especially to those involved in our charging cases and especially to those who have had to testify in court. On behalf of the entire Attorney General and Michigan State University Police Department team, we believe you and always have. We thank you. We are proud to stand up for and with you, and you are our heroes.\n\nWe have seen the worst of humanity and the best in these past few days. The pain and destruction caused by evil, selfish takers like this defendant, but we have also seen how one voice can start a movement. How reckoning can deliver justice. How a community can support and empower and start healing. During these last seven days on our screen, you have seen countless young, innocent faces. That was on purpose. Every day at this podium that I stand, you saw strong, brave, fierce survivors come here. But that's not who Larry Nassar saw. He was attracted and abused to those young girls in those pictures. But your honor, what you did not see are the sweet, young, innocent faces of girls who have been spared a similar fate because these brave women all spoke up, and more importantly, never gave up. There is no doubt he would have continued to abuse unabated for the rest of his life. I tell these survivors to be proud of what you have accomplished because you are survivors. You have referenced the army of survivors that this proceeding and his abuse has created. This past weekend at women's marches around the country, signs with Kyle Stephens' quote, someone that the world did not even know was affiliated with this case some five days before, those quotes were raised on signs. Little girls don't stay little forever. They turn into strong women who have come back to destroy your world. You heard from Jennifer Rood-Bedford, and she concluded by saying, Stand for truth, resolve for change, be committed.\n\nAt this particular moment in history, this sentencing hearing will be viewed as a turning point in how our community, our state, our nation, our culture looks at sexual abuse. This courtroom … was where the shame that many survivors felt was exorcised from them and put where it belongs, right on him. When each survivor came forward and shared their name, told their truth, supported each other, that shift grew. The world has witnessed what happens when victims are treated with respect, dignity, empathy, compassion and are truly supported by police, prosecutors and the criminal justice system and courts. What is obvious is that a strong group of determined women can, in fact, change the world and will. The fact that women led the investigation, the prosecution team, and that three female judges now sentenced defendant Nassar is poetic justice.\n\nAs I reflect on the last seven days of the sentencing hearing, it became clear that each day more women and girls were empowered. It was evidenced by our growing number (of) people that were reaching out to us to come to speak their truth. These women and girls have transformed themselves before our very eyes from victim to survivor to champion for justice and advocates for change.\n\nIn all of this, the world outside will carry on. But I want to recenter you and this court and all involved back on the reason we're here. The sentencing of defendant Larry Nassar for his admitted conduct against numerous young girls. He sexually assaulted them. He did so under the guise of medical treatment, and he did so for his own sexual purpose and gratification. He carried out his plot through a decadeslong process he honed and perfected, creating perfect conditions for his predatory behavior. Until these brave women brought it all down. Sentencing, your honor, must protect, punish and deter. Through your sentence, I ask you to do all three. I ask you to bring victims the justice they so deserve.\n\nWe ask you to sentence the defendant to a minimum of 40 years to at least 125 years in prison on a sentence you see fit. Thank you.

(CNN) —\n\nFormer President Barack Obama bid farewell to members of his staff Friday at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland before departing with his family for a vacation in California:\n\nMichelle and I, we really have been milking this goodbye thing. So it behooves me to be very brief. You know, I have said before, and I will say again, that when we started on this journey, we did so with an abiding faith in the American people and their ability, our ability, to join together and change the country in ways that would make life better for our kids and our grandkids.\n\nThat change didn't happen from the top down, but it happened from the bottom up. It was met sometimes with skepticism and doubt. Some folks didn't think we could pull it off. There were those that felt that the institutions of power and privilege in this country were too deeply entrenched. And yet, all of you came together in small towns and big cities, a whole bunch of you really young, and you decided to believe and you knocked on doors and you made phone calls and you talked to your parents who didn't know how to pronounce Barack Obama. And you got to know each other.\n\nAnd you went into communities that maybe you had never even thought about visiting and met people that on the surface seemed completely different than you – didn't look like you or talk like you or watch the same TV programs as you. And yet, once you started talking to them, it turned out that you had something in common. And it grew and it built. And people took notice. And throughout, it was infused with a sense of hope.\n\nPHOTO: pool The Obamas depart Friday from Joint Base Andrews for California.\n\nAs I said in 2004, it wasn't blind optimism that drove you to do all of this work. It wasn't naiveté. It wasn't willful ignorance to all the challenges that America faces. It was hope in the face of difficulty. Hope in the face of uncertainty. You proved the power of hope. And throughout this process, Michelle and I, we just have been your frontmen and women. We have been the face, sometimes the voice, out front on the TV screen or in front of the microphone, but this has never been about us. It has always been about you. And all the amazing things that happened over these last 10 years are really just a testament to you.\n\nIn the same way that when we talk about our amazing military and our men and women in uniform, the military is not a thing. It's a group of committed patriots willing to sacrifice everything on our behalf. It works only because of the people in it. As cool as the hardware is, and we have cool hardware, as cool as the machines and weapons and satellites are, ultimately it comes down to remarkable people. Some of them a lot closer to Malia's age than mine or Michelle's.\n\nWell, the same is true for our democracy. Our democracy is not the buildings, not the monuments. It's you being willing to work to make things better and being willing to listen to each other and argue with each other and come together and knock on doors and make phone calls and treat people with respect. And that doesn't end. This is just … this is just a little pit stop. This is not a period, this is a comma in the continuing story of building America. So, to all of you that have put your heart and soul, not just into the campaign but into making schools better, making sure our veterans got the care they needed, making sure that we left behind a planet that is safe and secure for our kids, making sure that hardworking people have a ladder of opportunity and can support families. For all of you, who have just done amazing remarkable work, most of it unheralded, most if without fanfare, most of it without you getting any word of thanks, we could not be prouder of you.\n\nI could not be prouder of you. This has been the privilege of my life and, I know I speak for Michelle as well. And we look forward to continuing this journey with all of you, and I can't wait to see what you do next, and I promise I'll be right there with you. God bless you. Thank you everybody. Yes we did! Yes we can! God bless America!

And that will change everything.\n\nTrump has sought to look on the bright side of divided control of government to date – insisting that maybe he will be able to make deals with the new Democratic majority in the House. It really could be a beautiful bipartisan situation, he said at a press conference the day after the 2018 election.\n\nBut the early returns are not promising. The federal government has been shut down for the past 12 days – and there's little reason to believe that will change at any point soon. Trump has dug in on his demand for $5 billion to fund construction of his border wall. Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, are equally dead-set on providing zero dollars for Trump's wall.\n\nAnd this is only the beginning. Starting today, Democrats in the House will make Trump's life a living hell. Efforts are already underway to bring a number of his Cabinet officials before Congress, to extricate his tax returns from his grip and to more deeply probe his business dealings both before and during his presidency.\n\nTrump, a political neophyte prior to the 2016 race, has never had to deal with this sort of opposition before. Sure, Democrats have never been willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. But he never really needed Democrats to do much of anything, either. The Republican majorities in the House and Senate ensured Trump got his tax cuts and two Supreme Court picks. There was no real political penalty for his total unwillingness and inability to work with Democrats.\n\nThose days are now over. Democrats can now do Trump real political damage using the official means of their House majority. While they may not be able to, say, force his tax returns into public view (the jury remains out on that), they can make sure the issue is front and center and create major distractions for a White House that has already shown it can distract itself very well, thank you very much.\n\nTrump claims to understand this, likely with his self-professed titanic intellect. To me, that's like when people who are about to have a baby say they are totally ready for it. As evidence, they point to their nursery being all set up, the Diaper Genie being up and running, and so on and so forth. Then the baby comes – and they realize, like every parent that has gone before them, that no amount of planning or bracing could fully prepare them for their new reality.\n\nThat's Trump and the new Democratic House majority.\n\nThe Point: Look out: It's going to be a mess.
(CNN) Desperate, deluded and dangerous, President Donald Trump drove America deeper into a political abyss on Monday night in his zeal to steal an election he lost and to destroy faith in the democracy that fairly ejected him from office.\n\nThe President spewed lies, conspiracy theories and nonsensically false claims of vote fraud before an angry crowd in Georgia on a trip scheduled to help two Republicans in toss up run-offs Tuesday set to seal the Senate balance of power.\n\nBut as usual, and as it has been for the last four years, including during the fast-worsening pandemic that he ignored, the outgoing President's primary concern was himself.\n\nBy the way, there is no way we lost Georgia, that was a rigged election, Trump said in the first, inaccurate words out of his mouth after disembarking from his Marine One helicopter, before broadening his disinformation to the November 3 election as a whole.\n\nWhen you win in a landslide and they steal it and it's rigged, it is not acceptable, Trump said in an embittered screed, rooted in false claims that he prevailed in an election President-elect Joe Biden won 306-232 in the Electoral College.\n\nThough he often wove GOP Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue into his remarks -- and warned of the dangers of a Democratic monopoly of power in Washington if they lost -- the President's appearance was essentially a wild, on-stage prime-time TV version of Saturday's call in which he leaned on Georgia state officials to conjure votes out of thin air in order to discredit Biden's already certified Peach State victory -- a flagrant and possibly unlawful abuse of power.\n\nThe President's rants on Monday night contrasted sharply with the stunning point-by-point denunciation of his case by a top GOP election official who used facts and evidence to dismiss false claims of electoral corruption.\n\nThis is all easily, provably false. Yet the President persists, Gabriel Sterling, the voting systems implementation manager for the Georgia secretary of state's office, said in a calm, reasoned news conference on Monday.\n\nTrump created a nightmarish picture of a ranting, demagogic commander-in-chief, wallowing in fantasies of the political fringe -- a frightening prospect since he retains the awesome powers of the presidency for another 15 days.\n\nBut he failed to explain how exactly he planned to overturn the constitutional process that will make Biden president, an omission that will bolster the impression he's doing everything he can to tear down America's faith in democracy in a final act of revenge.\n\nCapitol Hill Republicans chose Trump over democracy\n\nTrump and Republican acolytes who are trying to thwart the certification of the election by Congress on Wednesday are essentially trying to pull a massive con trick on the American people. After scores of Republican-appointed judges, the US Supreme Court and GOP state officials summarily rejected his false claims of fraud, they are arguing that their constitutional larceny is justified because millions of Trump voters believe their lies about a stolen election.\n\nThe logical extension of Trump's case and comments, since he has not offered credible evidence of a rigged election, is that when Republicans lose, it must be because Democrats cheated -- whatever the truth of the situation.\n\nThere are some in the party who still stand for truth. In an extraordinary act, Sterling -- a state government official who was unknown on the national stage before November -- went on national TV to contradict the President.\n\nThe reason I'm having to stand here today is because there are people in positions of authority and respect who have said their votes didn't count, and it's not true, he said.\n\nSterling is an example of the many courageous and principled Republican officials who stood firm in defense of America's democratic system and who, unlike Trump, didn't prioritize their own political goals or personal vanity over preserving faith in that system.\n\nHis integrity -- and willingness to stand up to a powerful President threatening vengeance against party members who cross him -- contrasts with the expediency of Trump's Republican allies on Capitol Hill.\n\nMore than a dozen Republican senators and scores of GOP House members have said they are planning to raise objections to the election during the normally pro forma joint session of Congress on Wednesday to count the votes of the Electoral College.\n\nLoeffler, hours before appearing with Trump at the election-eve rally, who is desperate to win favor with Trump's base, said she would join their number.\n\nTrump's wild call stirs concern in Washington\n\nThe shock waves of tapes of Trump's call on Saturday with Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger did convince some Washington Republicans to reinforce their warnings that the President was doing deep damage to the republic.\n\nHis actions have effectively split the party in two between factions who support democracy and the Constitution, and those who are willing to trash core American principles out of loyalty to a lawless President.\n\nPennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, who is shielded from Trump's wrath by previously deciding not to run for reelection, called his call with Raffensperger a new low in this whole futile and sorry episode and condemned the relentless pressure, disinformation, and attacks from Trump.\n\nThe No. 3 House Republican, Rep. Liz Cheney -- who is breaking with her leadership colleagues -- told CNN the call was deeply troubling. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, however, said in the friendly confines of Fox News that Trump was simply concerned about the integrity of elections.\n\nThe Republican insurrection will fail because Democrats control the House and there is not a majority in the Senate to reject the election results. But the entire stunt will deeply damage the legitimacy of Biden's new presidency in the eyes of Trump voters at a moment of deep national crisis.\n\nDuring his speech Monday, Trump publicly leaned on Vice President Mike Pence to come through when he presides over the certification of Biden's victory, although his role is purely ceremonial and he does not have power to change the election result.\n\nAlarm at the President's behavior and the lasting damage it will wreak on Capitol Hill prompted a group of 170 CEOs on Monday to warn that the election was over and that a peaceful transfer of power was vital.\n\nWashington, meanwhile, is bracing for the arrival of thousands of Trump supporters ahead of mass rallies meant to intimidate the lawmakers who will gather for the formal certification of the election.\n\nThe President is now expected to address one of the rallies himself, a factor that will likely further hike concern over rising tensions that have prompted city authorities to call in the National Guard.\n\nWashington, DC, police on Monday arrested Henry Enrique Tarrio and charged him for allegedly burning a Black Lives Matter banner taken from a Black church last month during a previous Stop the Steal rally.\n\nA nervous night for Georgia Republicans\n\nRepublican strategists viewed Trump's arrival in Georgia in the eve of what looks like two neck-and-neck races with dread, wondering whether he would stick to the script.\n\nThe fear was that the President's assaults on the integrity of the election process would simply convince his supporters -- who the GOP needs to show up in large numbers on Tuesday -- that the election was already rigged.\n\nIf you're a Georgia voter, if you want your values reflected by your election officials, I strongly beg and encourage you, go vote tomorrow. Do not let anybody discourage you. Do not self-suppress your own vote. Do not make a self-fulfilling prophecy out of doing this. Don't let anybody steal your vote that way, Sterling said.\n\nOn the other hand, the President, who enjoys an almost mystical connection with his base voters, has a strong record of lifting Republican candidates in one-off elections.\n\nHe offered a strong endorsement of both Loeffler and Perdue and frequently lambasted their opponents.\n\nIf Republicans win one of the two seats on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will retain a narrow majority in the chamber and have the ability to serve as a roadblock to Biden's ambitious agenda.\n\nBut if Democrats welcome Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock to the Senate, Vice President Kamala Harris will be able to cast the deciding vote on tied bills once she takes office alongside the new President on January 20.\n\nBiden made his own visit to Georgia on Monday in a bid to build on strong early vote numbers among Democrats in the Senate run-offs.\n\nBy electing Jon and the Reverend, you'll be voting to get the states the resources they need to get the vaccines distributed, Biden said. It's a shame what's happening now. It's a literal shame.\n\nThe President-elect argued that only two new Democratic senators would ensure new stimulus checks for Americans, join in reviving the economy hammered by Covid-19's rampage and forge unity.\n\nTrump did little to offer assurances that Tuesday's election would be fair.\n\nThat was left to Sterling, the top state election official.\n\nEverybody's vote is going to count. Everybody's vote did count.
(CNN) Poll of the week: My average of Georgia polls shows the two Senate runoffs on Tuesday are within the margin of error and way too close to call.\n\nIn the race for the full six-year term, Democrat Jon Ossoff is at 49% to Republican Sen. David Perdue's 48%.\n\nIn the special Senate election, Democrat Raphael Warnock is at 50% to Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler's 48%.\n\nWhat's the point: The math is simple for Senate Democrats. If Democrats win both runoffs in Georgia, they get 50 seats overall and a majority on January 20 with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris breaking a 50-50 tie. If Republicans win either seat, they will hold the Senate majority.\n\nRight now, Democrats may very well defy historical trends and win both races to achieve a Senate majority. If Democrats do it, they'll probably be able to thank Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nIndeed, this election isn't just about Georgia and the Senate majority. It's about Trump's legacy. If Republicans lose in Georgia, Trump will be to blame. Republicans in purple states will have to think long and hard about being attached to Trump in the future, even after he has left office.\n\nThe Republicans should win. The Republican candidates got more votes in both the full term Senate and special Senate races this past November.\n\nAdditionally, Georgia Republicans have improved in seven of eight statewide runoffs compared to their first round performance since 1992.\n\nThose two factors in combination should have made life difficult for Ossoff and Warnock. Instead, Perdue and Loeffler are fighting for their political lives.\n\nIt's hard not to assign Perdue and Loeffler's troubles at least partially to Trump. He was the weak link for Republicans running statewide in Georgia this past year. He lost by 0.2 points and his margin was more than a point worse than the Republican candidates in both Senate races.\n\nMore bluntly, Trump is the only Republican to lose a statewide race in Georgia in more than a decade\n\nIn theory, Perdue and Loeffler do not want this race to become about Trump. Trump, however, has helped to accomplish the opposite of that.\n\nHe has very much stayed in the news in Georgia. He has attacked Georgia's November election as fraudulent without any proof and gone after the Republican governor and secretary of state. He elevated the issue of $2,000 stimulus checks and has allowed Ossoff and Warnock to point out that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made it hard for such a stimulus to pass through the Senate. (The stimulus is popular .)\n\nTrump is reminding the few but very important split ticket voters in Georgia that Perdue and Loeffler are part of Trump's Republican Party.\n\nIn doing so, he may be helping to change the dynamic of what normally occurs in runoffs in the Peach State.\n\nWe haven't been seeing Republicans picking up ground ahead of the runoff like they normally do. As the averages show, it seems that the Republicans may actually be losing ground.\n\nRepublicans are probably hoping that the polls are underestimating them in Georgia like they did in November nationally. And it may turn out to be the case that the polls are underestimating Republicans. Even if they are by just a touch, it would be enough for Republicans to win.\n\nOn the other hand, the turnout we're seeing to this point in Georgia has nothing to do with the polls.\n\nTraditionally, you should be seeing a massive decline in turnout for a Georgia runoff.\n\nAs it turns out, the turnout level for these runoffs (over 3 million voters) has already exceeded that of any statewide Georgia runoff by about a million voters. Keep in mind, this has occurred with voting on the day of the election still to occur.\n\nWe're likely going to see turnout at least match if not be higher than the last regularly scheduled midterm election and potentially be closer to 2020 general election presidential year turnout when all the votes are counted.\n\nNow, it would be one thing if Trump's antics were driving Republicans to the polls. After all, high turnout doesn't come close to guaranteeing a Democratic victory.\n\nBut so far, the turnout swing seems to be favoring Democrats. Black voters have consistently been making up 3 to 4 points more of voters through the early voting period than they did at the equivalent points in the general election.\n\nMeanwhile, turnout in the more White rural areas of the state has been lagging. A lot of these White rural voters are fans of Trump, and it could be that him attacking Georgia Republicans makes them less likely to want to turn out and vote.\n\nThis has left the Republican Senate candidates in a catch-22 in the state. They now need Trump to come to the state to help turn out his voters in the final days in order to make up for the poor early voting numbers in the state. This comes as Perdue is quarantining because he came into close contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nTrump may be able to boost turnout and help Republicans stagger over the finish line.\n\nOf course, Trump's visits may end up reminding anti-Trump Republicans why they didn't like Trump in the first place.\n\nIf Republicans hold onto even one of their Senate seats in Georgia, Trump perhaps isn't as toxic to Republicans as some might assume. No doubt, you'd hear Trump trumpet a Republican win in Georgia for months to come.
House cafeterias change names for 'french' fries and 'french' toast\n\nMove reflects anger over France's stance on Iraq\n\nBy Sean Loughlin\n\nCNN Washington Bureau\n\n\n\nReps. Walter Jones, left, and Bob Ney announce the name changes on House menus at a Tuesday news conference. RELATED Restaurant serves 'freedom fries'\n\nWASHINGTON (CNN) -- The cafeteria menus in the three House office buildings changed the name of french fries to freedom fries, in a culinary rebuke of France stemming from anger over the country's refusal to support the U.S. position on Iraq.\n\nDitto for french toast, which will be known as freedom toast.\n\nThe name changes were spearheaded by two Republican lawmakers who held a news conference Tuesday to make the name changes official on the menus.\n\nAcross the country, some private restaurants have done the same.\n\nThis action today is a small, but symbolic effort to show the strong displeasure of many on Capitol Hill with the actions of our so-called ally, France, said Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, the chairman of the Committee on House Administration.\n\nNey, whose committee has authority over the House cafeterias, directed the change, after colleague Walter Jones, R-North Carolina, circulated a letter suggesting such a move. Jones said he was following the example of a local restaurant owner in his North Carolina district.\n\nI represent a district with multiple military bases that have deployed thousands of troops, Jones said in a statement. As I've watched these men and women wave good-bye to their loved ones, I am reminded of the deep love they have for the freedom of this nation and their desire to fight for the freedom of those who are oppressed overseas. Watching France's self -serving politics of passive aggression in this effort has discouraged me more than I can say.\n\nThe name change was criticized by one young man in a House cafeteria.\n\nThat's completely ludicrous to me, he said.\n\nFrance has pressed the United Nations to give weapons inspectors more time in Iraq, saying the U.S. and British-led move to war is premature.\n\nIts stance has angered some U.S. lawmakers.\n\nRep. Jim Saxton, R-New Jersey, has introduced legislation in the House that would block any French company from receiving U.S. government aid or financing in any reconstruction of Iraq. Another measure discourages American tourists, businesses and the government from participating in the 2003 Paris Air show.\n\nBut House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said he didn't think Congress needed to take any formal steps to signal its disapproval of France.\n\nI don't think we have to retaliate against France, he said. They have isolated themselves. They have resigned from any responsibility for the war on terror.\n\nAsked why he was focusing on France when other nations, including Germany and Russia, oppose the U.S. position on Iraq, Jones said it was because France had taken the lead in challenging the United States.\n\nOfficials with the French Embassy in Washington could not be reached for comment Tuesday afternoon.\n\n-- CNN Congressional Correspondent Jonathan Karl contributed to this report.

(GREG BAKER/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nIf this is the cup I must take, I will drink with no regret.\n\nBenny Tai was defiant and emotional as he faced the court. Outside, he and his fellow defendants raised their fists and supporters displayed yellow umbrellas, the symbol of Hong Kong's beleaguered pro-democracy movement.\n\nThat movement is looking shakier than ever, as Tai and others begin the new year facing possible jail time – up to seven years in prison – for their roles in inspiring the 2014 Umbrella Movement, when tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the semi-autonomous Chinese city demanding elections free of Beijing's interference.\n\nSeveral thousand people – including former Umbrella leaders – took part in a traditional New Year's march Tuesday, warning of shrinking freedoms and issuing a call for greater democracy. They were joined by a small group of pro-independence demonstrators, some of whom said they faced harassment and intimidation ahead of the gathering.\n\nOn Wednesday, a spokesman for the Hong Kong government reiterated its zero tolerance on 'Hong Kong independence'.\n\nPolice and organizers estimated the crowd to be roughly half that of last year's march, which will be a concern for the pro-democracy camp as they face a difficult 2019. The prosecution of Tai and his co-defendants could pale in comparison to what some fear will happen if the Hong Kong government, under pressure from China, moves to pass a hugely controversial anti-sedition law.\n\nCritics say this could criminalize swathes of opposition figures, ranging from pro-democracy activists and separatists to religious minorities and media figures critical of Beijing.\n\nPHOTO: ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Baptist minister Chu Yiu-ming, 74, law professor Benny Tai, 54, and sociology professor Chan Kin-man, 59, shout slogans with supporters before entering the West Kowloon Magistrates Court in Hong Kong on November 19, 2018.\n\nTai, a mild-mannered Hong Kong University professor with a round clean-shaven face and thin-rimmed glasses, was a marginal political figure when, in January 2013, he proposed a civil disobedience campaign to pressure the government to introduce universal political suffrage — a long overdue promise of Hong Kong's de facto constitution known as the Basic Law.\n\nUnlikely icon\n\nJoined by fellow professor Chan Kin-man and Reverend Chu Yiu-ming, Tai launched Occupy Central with Love and Peace later that year, with a protest date set for October 2014.\n\nWe shall be like preachers communicating enthusiastically with different communities to convey universal values such as democracy, universal and equal suffrage, justice and righteousness, he said at the time, adding he hoped Hong Kongers will be willing to pay the price.\n\nHong Kongers were willing, and then some. In late September 2014, a student boycott movement led by Joshua Wong's Scholarism and the Hong Kong Federation of Students (HKFS) attempted to occupy Civic Square, a traditional protest venue outside Hong Kong's legislature. After police used pepper spray and later tear gas on the mostly teenaged protesters, thousands of outraged Hong Kongers took to the streets.\n\nThe demonstration spiraled from there, with pro-democracy protesters occupying main roads in parts of the city for months, shutting down traffic and defying police and counter-protesters' attempts to remove them.\n\nPolice were finally able to clear the last protesters in December 2014, after 79 days.\n\nPHOTO: Paula Bronstein/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images 2014's Umbrella Movement was a pivotal moment for Hong Kong's democracy movement.\n\nPyrrhic victories\n\nIf the Umbrella Movement was a high point for Hong Kong's democrats, it's been largely downhill from there.\n\nEven apparent opposition successes, such as those in September 2016 legislative elections, have turned out to be pyrrhic victories. Multiple lawmakers elected that year have since been turfed out of office on dubious legal grounds.\n\nWong, along with HKFS leaders Nathan Law and Alex Chow, was briefly jailed in 2017, and continues to face the threat of further prison time. Other activists have also faced court hearings, as analysts warned of a deliberate slow drip of prosecutions designed to sap the pro-democracy movement.\n\nRestrictions on political speech have grown, with the pro-independence Hong Kong National Party led by Andy Chan officially banned under public security laws, the first time these had been used against a political organization.\n\nIn the wake of that ban, Victor Mallet, a Financial Times journalist from Britain who had hosted a speech featuring Chan, had his application for a visa renewal rejected — a move which many saw as a blow against press freedom.\n\nPHOTO: ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Activists hold flags which read Hong Kong Independence and Hong Kong Is Not China during a gathering outside the government headquarters to mark the fourth anniversary of mass pro-democracy rallies, known as the Umbrella Movement, in Hong Kong on September 28, 2018.\n\nPolitical litmus tests are increasingly becoming the norm. The latest victim was Eddie Chu, who was recently barred from standing in a local poll because an election official ruled that he had defended independence as an option to Hong Kongers, even though he himself disavowed separatism. Bizarrely, Chu currently sits in the city's top legislature – raising questions over whether he can retain that position if deemed unsuitable to run for a more junior one, or if he will become the latest pro-democracy lawmaker ejected from office.\n\nThese repeated setbacks have had an impact on the broader opposition movement, and protest fatigue is also a factor in a city which has become famous for them. Numbers at anti-government demonstrations have fallen and many in the pro-democracy camp are seemingly at a loss on the way ahead in the face of an increasingly aggressive establishment.\n\nIn November, the opposition camp flunked a major test when its candidate failed by a wide margin to hang on to the legislative seat of Lau Siu-lai, who had herself been expelled in 2017. As a result pro-democracy lawmakers were unable to regain veto power in the city's legislature, a development which could clear the way for the government to introduce its controversial anti-sedition legislation.\n\nPHOTO: ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Protestors take part in a National Day pro-democracy rally in Hong Kong on October 1, 2018.\n\nWorrying future\n\nArticle 23 of the Basic Law instructs the local government to enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the Central People's Government … and to prohibit political organizations or bodies of the Region from establishing ties with foreign political organizations or bodies.\n\nAn attempt to implement such a law in 2003 drew half a million people onto the streets, demanding the resignation of Hong Kong's first Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa. He stepped down less than two years later. The protest is often pointed to as an example of the greater political freedoms which Hong Kongers enjoy compared to mainland Chinese.\n\nPHOTO: PETER PARKS/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Trams sit stranded as hundreds of thousands of people block the streets in a huge protest march against a controversial anti-subversion law known as Article 23 in Hong Kong in 2003.\n\nSince then, Article 23 has loomed over Hong Kong politics, either a bogeyman or a panacea depending on one's ideological bent. While the immediate effects of an anti-sedition law are likely overstated by its opponents (the police are probably not going to start rounding up pro-democracy legislators), it could have a major psychological and chilling effect in curbing a famously truculent body politic.\n\nSelf-censorship, while difficult to measure, is also seen as an increasing problem. As the cost of dissent has risen in Hong Kong, there are signs of a growing wariness among some sectors of society.\n\nIn November, two events featuring Chinese dissidents were called off amid apparent fears of repercussions from Beijing. One eventually went ahead after strong public pressure on the event venue to change course.\n\nPHOTO: ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Article 23 of Hong Kong's Basic Law, an anti-sedition clause, has long loomed over the city's politics.\n\nChu, the lawmaker barred in December from standing in a local poll, accused the government of moving the goalposts to intimidate people against speaking out, lest their comments be used against them one day.\n\nThe political logic … comes from the Cultural Revolution, where everyone had to be thought police, he added.\n\nIn his closing statement to the court in December, Tai said the Occupy movement was ultimately intended to pursue justice and he had no regrets about standing up for Hong Kong's future.\n\nThe purpose of civil disobedience is not to obstruct the public, but to arouse public concern to the injustice in society and to win sympathy from the public, he said.\n\nI am not afraid or ashamed of going to prison. If we were to be guilty, we will be guilty for daring to share hope at this difficult time in Hong Kong.\n\nThe court will hand down its verdict on April 9, 2019.
COMPLETE COVERAGE | FRONT LINES | AMERICA AT HOME | INTERACTIVES »\n\nPakistan's Musharraf: Bin Laden probably dead ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's president says he thinks Osama bin Laden is most likely dead because the suspected terrorist has been unable to get treatment for his kidney disease. I think now, frankly, he is dead for the reason he is a ... kidney patient, Gen. Pervez Musharraf said on Friday in an interview with CNN. Musharraf said Pakistan knew bin Laden took two dialysis machines into Afghanistan. One was specifically for his own personal use, he said. I don't know if he has been getting all that treatment in Afghanistan now. And the photographs that have been shown of him on television show him extremely weak. ... I would give the first priority that he is dead and the second priority that he is alive somewhere in Afghanistan. U.S. officials skeptical VIDEO\n\n\n\nPart 1 | 2 | 3\n\n(QuickTime, Real or Windows Media) Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf gives an exclusive interview with CNN's Tom Mintier In Washington, a senior Bush administration official said Musharraf reached reasonable conclusion but warned it is only a guess. He is using very reasonable deductive reasoning, (but) we don't know (bin Laden) is dead, said the official, who requested anonymity. We don't have remains or evidence of his death. So it is a decent and reasonable conclusion -- a good guess but it is a guess. The official said U.S. intelligence is that bin Laden needs dialysis every three days and it is fairly obvious that that could be an issue when you are running from place to place, and facing the idea of needing to generate electricity in a mountain hideout. Other U.S. officials contradicted the reports of bin Laden's health problems, saying there is no evidence the suspected terrorist mastermind has ever suffered kidney failure or required kidney dialysis. The officials called such suggestions a recurrent rumor. Gen. Tommy Franks, the commander of U.S. forces in central and southwest Asia, said Friday that he had not seen any intelligence confirming or denying Musharraf's statements on bin Laden's condition. The United States has said that bin Laden is the prime suspect in the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon that killed about 3,000 people. Hunt for bin Laden The United States launched its campaign in Afghanistan after the country's ruling Taliban refused to turn over bin Laden. Earlier this week U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said he believed bin Laden and Taliban spiritual leader Mullah Mohammed Omar were inside Afghanistan but we are looking at some other places as well from time to time. Rumsfeld noted there were dozens of conflicting intelligence reports each day and said most of them were wrong. Most of the reports are based on sightings by local Afghans that cannot be verified. There are reports that bin Laden and his convoys have been sighted recently by a Predator unmanned aerial vehicle. A senior Defense Department source said the lack of credible information about the two was so severe that many officials believe the U.S. would catch bin Laden or Omar only through pure luck, or an intelligence break -- essentially one of their associates turning them in. Top CIA analysts who track bin Laden and Omar have been asked for their best assessment on the two men's whereabouts. That has led to a variety of thoughts, placing bin Laden in Afghanistan, in Pakistan or Iran, on the open ocean onboard a ship, or headed north through Tajikistan or Uzbekistan -- if he is still alive. The videotape seen worldwide several weeks ago of bin Laden talking about the September 11 attacks was made in Kandahar. He then apparently disappeared -- possibly going north to Tora Bora. Franks said there was evidence bin Laden was in Tora Bora but he gave no indication of when that might have been. In October, intelligence officials thought they had bin Laden pinned down to a 10-square-mile area in the eastern central mountains of Afghanistan. Two senior military officers told CNN it would not have been hard for bin Laden to change location several times because vast areas of Afghanistan are virtually unseen by the U.S. military, and he would have been even harder to spot if he moved without his telltale large security contingent. Even before the war, bin Laden moved around frequently, making it difficult for the United States to determine his location and launch an attack against him.

It is an unexpected flashback to a different age, a contest to savor.\n\nThough both great champions have been defiant against Father Time, and neither has mentioned retirement, the siblings are in the final chapters of their remarkable careers.\n\nSaturday's final could be their last together at this stage of a grand slam and, as Serena herself has admitted, it is an extraordinary tale.\n\nThis is something that I couldn't write a better ending, the 35-year-old said of the match in which she could finally win an Open-Era record 23rd grand slams.\n\nThis is a great opportunity for us to start our new beginning.\n\nPHOTO: Getty Images/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images With a combined age of 71, the all-Williams clash will be the oldest grand slam final in the Open Era.\n\n'It's a win-win situation'\n\nVictory would place Serena in history's gap between Steffi Graf (22 major titles) and Margaret Court (24) and return her to the world's No. 1 ranking.\n\nAt the other side of the net, however, will be older sister Venus, a seven-time grand slam champion and a 36-year-old whose later career has been hampered by an incurable auto-immune disorder.\n\nIn 2011 she was diagnosed with Sjogren's Syndrome, which causes fatigue and joint pain. It is a major reason for her recent absence from grand slam finals, with her last being in 2009 at Wimbledon.\n\nSerena has predicted Saturday's match, their ninth grand slam final battle but first for almost eight years, will be uncomfortable, but the six-time Melbourne champion is relaxed whatever the outcome.\n\nAfter everything that Venus has been through with her illness and stuff, I just can't help but feel like it's a win-win situation for me, she explained.\n\nI was there for the whole time. We lived together. I know what she went through.\n\nIt's the one time that I really genuinely feel like no matter what happens, I can't lose, she can't lose. It's going to be a great situation.\n\nPHOTO: Sean Garnsworthy/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images Serena Williams won her first Australian Open title by beating sister Venus in the final in 2003.\n\n'I can compete against the odds'\n\nThe sisters – owners of 29 major singles titles between them, plus 14 together in doubles – have been the dominant forces in women's tennis for almost two decades and, in this tournament, have been as commanding as they once were in the early part of this century.\n\nSerena has returned to form after an extended break at the end of last year.\n\nShe has not dropped a set in Melbourne and, having dominated her rivalry with Venus – Serena holds a 16-11 record and has won six of their past seven grand slam finals – the world No. 2 is favorite to triumph for a seventh time Down Under.\n\nWho will triumph? Have your say on our Facebook page\n\nWhen I'm playing on the court with her, I think I'm playing the best competitor in the game, said Venus, who lost to Serena in her only other Australian Open final in 2003.\n\nI don't think I'm chump change, either. I can compete against any odds. No matter what, I get out there and I compete.\n\nVisit cnn.com/tennis for more news and videos\n\nI know that it won't be easy.

BMW has turned Seattle into a testbed for how car companies can stay relevant in changing times.\n\nThe German carmaker is experimenting with a range of mobility services to try to connect with people uninterested in buying a car.\n\nBMW isn't the first automaker to embrace trends like ride-sharing and mobility apps. Competitors such as Daimler (DDAIF) and GM (GM) operate car-sharing services. But BMW's tests in Seattle are unique in how the automaker is managing a fleet of 700 sedans and SUVs.\n\nReachNow, a mobility venture that BMW launched a year ago, is experimenting with a hybrid model of ridesharing and carsharing. Sometimes a professional driver uses a fleet vehicle to give rides, much like Uber or Lyft do. The next day, that car might be parked on the street for customers to reserve and drive, a model akin to Car2go, GM's Maven and Zipcar.\n\nReachNow CEO Steve Banfield said this flexibility better serves customers.\n\nYou'll want more drivers driving people around on New Year's Eve, and you'll want more cars on the road to take trips with on July 4th, just because the nature of those holidays, Banfield told CNN Tech.\n\nBMW's ridesharing service, called ReachNow Ride, is starting small. The pilot tests are on an invite basis with about 4,500 members, who have registered on the app. ReachNow has roughly 100 professional drivers, who work for a third-party company that BMW has a contract with.\n\nRelated: Your car's data may soon be more valuable than the car itself\n\nBanfield told CNN Tech that he expected the number of riders included in the pilot test to triple in the coming weeks. But ReachNow won't try to scale to the size of the biggest players in ridesharing.\n\nReachNow has positioned itself as a premium ride service. The cars include chocolates and bottles of water. A passenger can set the car's temperature to exactly 68 degree -- or whatever they desire -- before even stepping foot inside it.\n\nIn one Seattle office building, BMW has parked three ReachNow vehicles that are only available to people working in the building. Customers must return the vehicles to the building.\n\nEarlier this month, ReachNow and the city government installed 20 electric vehicle charging stations in Seattle. Now 10% of ReachNow's fleet is electric, but Banfield expects electric vehicles to become more prevalent.\n\nBMW is expanding ReachNow in Seattle as automakers brace of disruption. This week, Ford replaced its CEO, citing a time of unprecedented change. Electric, connected and automated vehicles are expected to transform mobility in the coming years. Car companies don't want to be left behind.\n\nRelated: Why Ford fired its CEO\n\nPart of BMW's Seattle experiment is exploring long-term car rentals. Its fleet of 700 vehicles can be rented for up to five days, or longer upon request. Rentals start at $80 a day in Seattle and Portland, Oregon, and $110 in Brooklyn. (ReachNow launched in Portland and Brooklyn in the fall of 2016.)\n\nBanfield pointed to the simplicity ReachNow offers, such as not having to deal with upselling or needing to return a vehicle with a full tank of gas. Customers don't need to trek to an airport to pick up the car. There's no debate over whether to pay for insurance, because it's already included.\n\nDown the road, Banfield said it isn't out of the question for ReachNow to test scooters in a city. While the future of transportation is up in the air, one's thing for sure -- automakers will be experimenting.
(CNN) —\n\nActor Robert Wagner remains a person of interest in the death of Natalie Wood but has thus far declined to speak with investigators since they reopened the case in 2011, according to authorities.\n\nLt. John Corina, of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's homicide bureau, said in a press conference Monday that the details Wagner has offered up on the fateful night really don't add up to what we've found.\n\nHe's a person of interest because he's the last person with her before she went in the water, said Corina. This is a suspicious death investigation. We want to know what happened from the time of the argument to when she got into the water.\n\nCNN's calls to a representative for Wagner were not immediately returned.\n\nCorina added that Wagner is not obligated by law to speak with investigators, but said we're closer to understanding what happened, I think.\n\nLast week, authorities said they were investigating the Rebel Without a Cause star's death as suspicious after new witnesses came forward.\n\nWood drowned in November 1981 while boating off Catalina Island in Southern California with husband Robert Wagner and friend Christopher Walken. She was 43 at the time.\n\nIn his 2009 book, Wagner wrote that during his trip with Wood and Walken, he became jealous and argued with both of them.\n\nLater, Wagner, unable to find his wife, searched the boat along with the captain and noticed the dinghy was missing. Wagner assumed his wife had gone ashore, he wrote.\n\nThe dinghy was found about a mile from the yacht and a mile from where Wood's drowned body was found.\n\nIn 2012, the Los Angeles County coroner's office changed the cause of death from accidental drowning to drowning and other undetermined factors. Officials later cited the presence of bruises on Wood's body as the reason for the change.\n\nCorina said they are making a public appeal for more witnesses to come forward with any information.\n\nA career and life cut short\n\nWood started acting as a child, co-starring in the 1947 classic Christmas film Miracle on 34th Street. She was one of Hollywood's most respected actresses, appearing in iconic films like West Side Story and Rebel Without a Cause and Splendor in the Grass.\n\nIn a 2009, The Daily Mail published an excerpt of Wagner's biography, Pieces Of My Heart: A Life, in which he recalled Wood's memory of the two actors first meeting in the hallway of a studio where they both were filming.\n\nWood was 10 years old and Wagner was 18.\n\nShe always told me we didn't speak but that I smiled, he wrote. Later, Natalie told her mother she would marry me. She did – twice.\n\nThe pair began dating when Wood was 18 and married in 1957.\n\nThey divorced in 1962 and Wood later married British producer Richard Gregson and gave birth to a daughter, Natasha, in 1970.\n\nShe and Gregson split the following year, she reunited with Wagner in 1972 and they remarried.\n\nWood gave birth to their daughter Courtney in 1974.\n\nIn 2016, Wagner opened up to People about his bond with Natasha (who was raised with his daughter) and how difficult life had been after the death of Wood.\n\nYou just take it moment by moment and hope that it gets better and more light comes into her life. As an adult and as a man, I could not climb into (Natasha's) head. All you can do is truly love and care for them.
Andrew Yang suggested tonight that Democrats are too focused on the impeachment of President Donald Trump, and that it is at the party's peril.\n\nWe have to stop being obsessed over impeachment, which unfortunately strikes many Americans like a ball game where you know what the score is going to be, and start actually digging in and solving the problems that got Donald Trump elected in the first place, Yang said, just a day after House Democrats impeached the President.\n\nThe businessman argued that the more Democrats act like Donald Trump is the cause of all our problems, the more Americans lose trust that we can actually see what's going on in our communities and solve those problems.\n\nThis stance puts Yang at odds with some of his opponents, some of whom have said they not only support impeachment, but – in the case of US senators – suggested they would vote in favor of removing the President from office.\n\nWatch here:

They helped Moscow-friendly politicians get elected and hold onto power for nearly a decade.\n\nManafort and Kilimnik stayed in touch after their Ukrainian clients were ousted in 2014. They met twice in the United States during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to their own public statements. News reports have detailed their phone calls and emails in 2016, including one exchange where Manafort tried to use Kilimnik to reach a prominent Russian oligarch.\n\nBut Tuesday's filing revealed they had a third meeting, this time in the Spanish capital of Madrid. One redacted portion quoted Mueller's team: After being told that Mr. Kilimnik had traveled to Madrid on the same day that Mr. Manafort was in Madrid, Mr. Manafort 'acknowledged' that he and Mr. Kilimnik met while they were both in Madrid. A spokesman for Manafort sought to clarify the filing in a statement Tuesday night, saying that the third meeting happened in early 2017, after the election.\n\nThe growing list of Manafort-Kilimnik contacts could be relevant to the collusion question because, according to previous court filings from Mueller, the FBI has assessed that Kilimnik has ties to a Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016.\n\nMany of their contacts happened while the Russian government was aggressively meddling in the US election. Court filings said Kilimnik was affiliated with the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency that was responsible for hacking Democratic targets and orchestrating the WikiLeaks releases.\n\nCNN reported in February 2017 that Manafort was among a handful of senior Trump advisers who were in constant communication with suspected Russian operatives during the campaign. At the time, Manafort told CNN in a statement, that is 100% not true, at least as far as me.\n\nSharing campaign polls\n\nBeyond the fact that Manafort was in regular touch with Kilimnik, the unredacted court filings shed new light on the content of some of their conversations. For the first time, the public learned that Manafort shared polling data about the 2016 campaign with his Russian friend.\n\nIssues and communications related to Ukrainian political events simply were not at the forefront of Mr. Manafort's mind during the period at issue and it is not surprising at all that Mr. Manafort was unable to recall specific details prior to having his recollection refreshed, Manafort's lawyers wrote. The same is true with regard to the Government's allegation that Mr. Manafort lied about sharing polling data with Mr. Kilimnik related to the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThere aren't any additional details – all this tells us is that Mueller believes that Manafort fed polling data to Kilimnik, possibly even polls commissioned by the Trump campaign.\n\nPolling data is a key part of any modern political operation – presidential campaigns and outside groups like super PACs spend millions of dollars on polls. These numbers can drive decisions on messaging, where to campaign and advertising, both on television and in the digital space.\n\nTrump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale ran Trump's data team in 2016. They've publicly touted about how they used data to target voters.\n\nIt's possible Manafort innocuously gave the polls to Kilimnik because he is a political junkie and wanted to dig into the crosstabs. But there's also a possibility that Kilimnik, with his active ties to Russian intelligence, funneled the information to Russian agents to influence the election.\n\nThe primary suspect would be the troll farm in St. Petersburg that essentially acted as a pro-Trump super PAC and pumped out political propaganda to millions of Americans on social media during the 2016 race. These messages can be targeted to specific demographics based on polling data. There aren't any publicly known ties between Kilimnik and the troll farm.\n\nUkraine peace plan\n\nTuesday's filing also unintentionally disclosed that Manafort and Kilimnik discussed a Ukraine peace plan.\n\nAfter being shown documents, Mr. Manafort 'conceded' that he discussed or may have discussed a Ukraine peace plan with Mr. Kilimnik on more than one occasion, the filing said. The document was filed by Manafort's team, but this line appears to quote a past Mueller filing.\n\nThe filing revealed no details about what the Ukraine plan would entail. After Manafort's clients were ousted in 2014, Russian forced annexed Crimea and Kremlin-backed proxies invaded eastern Ukraine. Western nations condemned the moves and have applied economic sanctions against Moscow ever since. The diplomatic and military crisis is ongoing.\n\nThe news that Manafort was in talks with Kilimnik about a Ukraine peace plan is interesting, because it's not the first time the Ukraine conflict became an issue inside Trump's orbit.\n\nDuring the 2016 Republican National Convention, Trump campaign officials intervened to change language in the GOP platform about the Ukraine conflict. Their actions blocked a provision that called on the US to arm the Ukrainian government to fight the Russian proxies.\n\nAt the time, Manafort denied that the Trump campaign was involved. He also said he was not personally involved in any effort to change the platform and learned of it from news reports.\n\nThe Ukraine issue came up again shortly before Trump's inauguration.\n\nAn informal Ukraine peace plan was hatched at a January 2017 meeting between Trump's longtime attorney and fixer Michael Cohen, former Trump business partner Felix Sater and Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Artemenko. The proposal was seen by some as friendly to Moscow.\n\nCohen confirmed to CNN that the meeting took place but denied discussing Ukraine. In comments to other news organizations, Cohen acknowledged the so-called peace plan and said he delivered the proposal to the office of then-national security adviser Michael Flynn. The White House denied that anyone ever received any documents from Cohen about Ukraine.\n\nIt is not clear if this proposal was related in any way to the plan that Manafort discussed with Kilimnik. There aren't any publicly known ties between Artemenko and Kilimnik, though Kilimnik is an insider in Ukrainian political circles and has relationships with many lawmakers there. Artemenko has cooperated with Mueller and testified before the grand jury last summer.\n\nCNN's Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.
John P. Moore is a professor of microbiology and immunology involved in vaccine research at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) The rollout of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines in the US is not proceeding smoothly, which is not surprising given the logistical challenges of administering a novel vaccine that requires two doses. There are similar problems in the UK, where the Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccines are now authorized, the latter gaining authorization just last week.\n\nAccordingly, the British government, without public discussion and in an opaque manner, is varying the protocols for vaccine administration. The second dose of both vaccines can now be given up to 12 weeks after the first dose. And it even is permitting that different vaccines can be used for the first and second doses in some situations. Both of these protocol changes have little or no support in clinical trial data.\n\nThe goal of these, frankly, large-scale human experiments is to increase the number of people given their first dose and thereby partially protected. Similar proposals about delaying the second dose have been discussed in the US, though on Monday, top officials from the US Food and Drug Administration said in a statement that the FDA does not support changing the vaccine administration protocol initially set forth, based on a lack of evidence that the vaccine would still be sufficiently effective with an altered administration plan. Pfizer, for its part, has said that the trial data do not support that the first dose alone is effective beyond 21 days after injection.\n\nIn the US, whatever public confidence has been gained in Covid-19 vaccines is largely rooted in the thorough and transparent evaluation process that allows anyone to attend FDA and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel meetings, inspect the data and raise questions.\n\nHence scientists and physicians can understand what is being evaluated and are able to recommend the vaccines to friends, family and the wider public. The authorization procedures in the UK are far less transparent. So when significant deviations from the recommended use of the approved vaccines are applied, how can the public trust the right decisions were made? How can knowledgeable independent healthcare professionals endorse those decisions when they are not privy to the process?\n\nMaking matters all the more concerning, the UK clinical trials of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine were confusing and problematic. It's difficult to understand the basis of various conclusions drawn in the UK about the efficacy of this particular vaccine under various dosing conditions. Perhaps for that reason, the FDA is presumably waiting for an American efficacy trial to be completed before deciding on the approval of this vaccine.\n\nThe Pfizer vaccine data, on the other hand, is very solid, but it appears to be badly misinterpreted in the UK. The FDA briefing document specifically states in its efficacy summary of the vaccine that the available data cannot support a conclusion on the efficacy of a single dose of the vaccine. However, UK authorities say the plan to delay a second dose of the vaccines is based in part on efficacy data, citing calculations that estimate a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine to have a 90% short term efficacy, and a single dose of the Oxford vaccine to have a 70% short term efficacy.\n\nThis conclusion seems, at best, highly dubious. The Pfizer data set does not tell us for how long any benefit of a single dose might persist. Antibodies to the Covid-19 vaccines diminish over time. It is not known when this decay might compromise efficacy, but it seems questionable, based on the data laid out in the FDA briefing document, to believe that antibody levels will be protective for up to 12 weeks.\n\nBeyond the greater risks to individuals, there could be wider consequences to a prolonged dosing interval. Would confidence in the vaccine be reduced by multiple reports of vaccine failures among at-risk individuals? Would some recipients of a single dose feel protected and increase their behavioral risk? Weak antibody responses in large populations of inadequately immunized people could drive the emergence of vaccine-resistant or otherwise problematic virus variants with very serious consequences.\n\nNonetheless, the UK is persisting with policies that the FDA has now clearly stated will not be applied in the US. I agree with the FDA's judgment. Perhaps the UK could consider instead other ways to conserve vaccine supplies that may be safer than the delayed second dose option. It is worth exploring whether giving two half-doses of the Pfizer vaccine would provide sufficiently strong antibody levels, which is suggested by some of Moderna's and Pfizer's clinical trial data. The FDA has noted its concern over this dosage change, too, in the absence of convincing evidence that it would be effective, but it may, at least, be a safer resource-saving measure than delaying a second vaccine dose if the UK is determined to double its vaccinated population in the short term.\n\nAlso, for people who have recovered from Covid-19 a single vaccine dose may indeed be sufficient to boost their antibodies to high levels. The dose-saving could be considerable, as over 2.6 million Britons have been infected. Even these suggestions carry risks and perhaps should be further studied and applied only for younger people.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAny deviation from FDA-approved protocols should not be taken lightly. But if changes are deemed necessary, the UK should seek the least-bad ones, and only after a full and transparent discussion of what is involved. That is the American model, but unfortunately one that is not being followed in the UK.
Washington (CNN) The fallout from Wednesday's congressional session to count the 2020 electoral votes will echo for years to come. The state of the presidential electoral process. The state of the country. The state of a political party. The state of a Congress potentially moving into a new era of Democratic control .\n\nThe significance shouldn't be minimized. When the actions of President Donald Trump are factored in, there is no precedent for this moment. Have there been objections in past years? Yes. Have there been objections of this nature, given the pressure from the clearly defeated leader of the country? Nope.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nLet's make this abundantly clear: this process ends with the certification of Joe Biden as the 46th President of the United States. Everything in between now and the final elector tally being read off is noise. Boisterous. Unruly. Likely unseemly. At times barely tethered to reality. But it's not actionable or tangible in terms of having an actual effect. That being said, however long it takes -- and it will not be a short day -- this ends the same way: Biden is inaugurated on January 20.\n\nWhat doesn't end is battle inside the Republican Party that has flooded into the open the last several days. What doesn't end is how the country moves on from this moment -- if it does at all.\n\nWhat to watch\n\nThis one is pretty simple: the members of the 117th Congress. Part of the day they'll be together in joint session. Part of the day they'll separate to their own chambers to handle expected objections. There will be debate and there will be votes. But this is mostly a day of watching the respective floors.\n\nInside the GOP objection effort\n\nThe ad hoc nature of this entire endeavor began with a few House Republicans making noises that they planned to challenge the results of this election. It was a long-shot effort. It still is.\n\nThey were the usual Trump allies: Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on Judiciary, plus Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama and Andy Biggs of Arizona. But even those members are still in the dark about how far some senators are going to be willing to go Wednesday.\n\nIf it seems like this entire movement is untethered to one leader, that's because it is. Members are having their own conversations with Trump. They are having one-off meetings with one another. But this isn't a centrally organized effort. You have Sens. Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz. You have the top Republican in the House, Kevin McCarthy, in an entirely different position than that of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nA GOP source familiar with the plans tells CNN that while there have been phone calls and one-on-one conversations, senators are making their own choices about objections. The House is learning about some of their plans second-hand. And while House members are lined up and prepared to challenge six states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- they recognize that those efforts only go somewhere if a senator is willing to sign on.\n\nWhat Wednesday looks like\n\nThe beginning of the day will be ceremonial. The sergeant at arms will announce the Senate and Vice President Mike Pence will enter the chamber. He will take his seat as the presiding officer, call the joint session to order and we will be off to the races. At this point, Pence will instruct the four tellers -- Sens. Roy Blunt of Missouri and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Reps. Rodney Davis of Illinois and Zoe Lofgren of California -- to take their place at the desk where Pence will begin to hand the state elector certificates to tellers one by one.\n\nFirst will be Alabama, then Alaska, then Arizona.\n\nAt this point, we expect that a GOP member will raise an objection to the electoral results from Arizona. Pence will ask if there is an objection in writing that has been signed by a senator. Cruz has made it clear he will sign on.\n\nOnce that is presented, Pence will ask each chamber to go and deliberate separately. Then the real fight begins.\n\nThe debate\n\nThe law outlines that the House and Senate will have up to two hours to debate, but how that time is divided and who will speak has not fully been flushed out.\n\nIn the Senate, McConnell has been working toward an agreement that would allow for an hour of debate for those supporting the objection and another hour for those who are opposed to it. But in order to pass it, McConnell would need unanimous consent. We expect that some Democrats are going to want to speak out against Cruz's challenge. But the more interesting moment will come when Republican senators stand up in opposition.\n\nEach member can only speak for up to five minutes, but all eyes are going to be on the Republican members opposed to overturning the results and whether they actually speak up knowing Trump will be watching closely. So far, we know that at least one Republican senator -- Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania -- plans to speak out at least against the objection to the Pennsylvania results.\n\nBut he's retiring. Keep your eyes out for Sens. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Tom Cotton of Arkansas. In the House, the debate could be more unruly. We know House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will be presiding. She will call on members to speak, and again, each member will only have up to five minutes.\n\nThe vote\n\nThis is expected to go much more quickly in the Senate than it will in the House. The House will have to vote in groups as they have throughout the pandemic. That could stretch to hours per vote. The expectation is that the Senate will have to wait each time for the House to finish its business before the joint session can resume.\n\nThe other objections\n\nWe still don't know exactly how many objections could come Wednesday. We expect Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who CNN has projected just lost her runoff race to the Rev. Raphael Warnock , to object to Georgia. We know that Hawley will object to Pennsylvania.\n\nThat leaves Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin still potentially on the table. Senators have been less inclined to go down the route of the latter three, even as their House colleagues have pressed them repeatedly to do just that.\n\nThe calculation becomes how much pain the senators want to actually inflict, because, again, we all know how this ends: Biden will be the next President. No Republican in the House or Senate is under any illusions that is the reality. This circus is for an audience of one. And the question of how many objections there will be is partly a question of when will Trump be satisfied that Republicans fought for him on the floor.\n\nThe role of the vice president\n\nLet's be abundantly clear here: it is largely as traffic cop (as guided by the parliamentarians), ceremonial in nature as the person who announces tallies. Even the guiding resolution passed by the Senate to lay out the rules of the joint session make clear that's his role.\n\nThe President can say whatever he wants about whatever he thinks Pence's role is in this scenario. None of what he's saying is accurate. Pence, as CNN's Ted Barrett reported, huddled with the parliamentarians for several hours earlier this week. And he's Mike Pence, so it's fair to say he's fully prepared -- and fully aware -- of what his role is here.\n\nHow long will it take\n\nThis is largely a calculation of how many objections there are, how long it takes to vote and, of course, whether or not leadership breaks at any point to come back Thursday. Right now, the expectation is Democratic and Republican leaders want to go straight through the night if they have to. Making this too easy and giving members a break only emboldens Trump loyalists to object to more states, get more airtime and delay the inevitable. Still, don't expect members to be on the floor the entire time. They have hideaways and offices they can retreat to. They've been encouraged to stay away because of the pandemic until it's time to vote or speak.\n\nEstimates are just that: estimates. But aides have been allotting roughly four hours per objection.\n\nKeep an eye on (but don't pay too much attention to):\n\nThere will be the actual objections -- valid ones, with precedent -- immediately triggering action between the two chambers.\n\nAnd then, people involved say, there will likely be ... other stuff. Think along the lines of the many theories being pitched to Trump by his lawyers -- theories without any legal basis whatsoever. Theories like:\n\nThe call for competing slates of electors. No competing slates have been delivered to Congress, because no competing slates have been submitted by the proper state authorities. This is outside the bounds of the session and will be rejected.\n\nThe unilateral authority of the chair to reject specific slates. A member may pop up and attempt to cite Thomas Jefferson or Richard Nixon in arguing Pence has unilateral authority to make decisions on electors. He does not. Period. And this examples aren't even remotely close to apples-to-apples precedent. (Jefferson's related to a technical glitch, not a change in outcome. Nixon's related to competing slates of electors in which he opened the question to Congress to object but didn't make the decision on his own.)\n\nRepeated efforts to adjourn the proceedings in order to secure a 10-day investigation (as called for by the Cruz group). It's statutorily prohibited.\n\nThe Republican Party\n\nThere's no direct comparison to where the party is right now, but the closest parallel you can draw is back in 2013 when then-freshman-Sen. Cruz led his party to shut down the government. The base was with Cruz. The leadership was not. And the saga that unfolded left the party splintered for years -- it was a moment that left Republican rank-and-file members who hadn't stood with Cruz forced to explain to their voters how shutting down the government wasn't going to end Obamacare. It wasn't possible, but it didn't mean that some members didn't face the ire of the electorate.\n\nGOP aides say that the base is furious right now at anyone who isn't standing with Trump. The only hope most members have is that the large number of Republicans who are going to rebuke this effort in the Senate will only amount to a temporary blip and not a long-lasting stain on party unity.\n\nThe numbers\n\nAs it currently stands, 24 Republican senators have said they will certify Biden's election. Thirteen say they will object. Aides tell us the former number will grow much larger over the course of the day. To be clear here: the momentum has swung hard against the objectors inside the conference. And not just on ideological lines.\n\nMcConnell\n\nQuietly, and without much fanfare, McConnell has made a series of moves in the last several weeks to steer his conference (and, by extension, his party) away from Trump. Keep an eye on his remarks on Wednesday -- he'll be the first one up, and given his clear objections to the decision by members of his conference to object to several states, what he says will be extremely notable.
Story highlights An Ontario mom with cystic fibrosis struggled for years with a lung infection When she went into septic shock, doctors tried an experimental procedure She now has two new lungs, and her prognosis is good\n\n(CNN) —\n\nGiven the choice between his wife possibly dying in her bed or on an operating table, Chris Benoit chose an experimental, first-of-its-kind surgical procedure. The surgeons would remove not just one but both of Melissa Benoit's lungs.\n\nThe Burlington, Ontario, woman was was so sick, she could not speak for herself.\n\nI was unconscious at this point and had been for some time, Melissa Benoit said. So (my family) made the decision based on my previous wishes – just knowing who I am.\n\nChris Benoit remembers the moment of decision in April. He, Melissa's mom, dad and uncle all spoke at once. It didn't take very long for us to insist that Melissa would want to go right to the end and fight with experimental surgery, he said.\n\nIn fact, Melissa Benoit, then 32, had been suffering for years. A cystic fibrosis patient, she had been struggling with an on-again, off-again infection that had ravaged her lungs over the course of three years. An inherited disorder, cystic fibrosis affects the cells that produce mucus, sweat and digestive juices, and causes damage to the lungs, gastrointestinal system and other organs of the body.\n\nShe'd been taking antibiotics intravenously, but then she came down with the flu, which triggered coughing fits so terrible, she fractured her ribs.\n\nIn mid-March, she landed in St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto.\n\nThey thought they'd just do a quick switcheroo with antibiotics, she said. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. The last day I remember was Easter Sunday 2016, where I was waiting for an ICU bed.\n\nWhile she was unconscious, the infection could not be controlled, so in early April, she was transferred – sedated and on a ventilator – to Toronto General Hospital's Surgical Intensive Care Unit.\n\nShe was suffering from severe bacterial infection involving her lungs, and the bacteria was very drug-resistant, so despite being on antibiotics, it was not very well-controlled, said Dr. Atul Humar, director of the transplant program at Toronto General Hospital and president of the Canadian Society of Transplantation. Humar was not directly involved in Benoit's care.\n\nDrowning in the blood and pus that filled her lungs, she had been gasping for breath – grasping for life – for days. It was clear Benoit needed a lung transplant, but a conventional ventilator was not enough to help her breathe until donor lungs became available.\n\nTo help her breathe and to gain more time, physicians placed her on Extra-Corporeal Lung Support, a temporary life-support medical device often used to help bridge patients waiting for a transplant.\n\nAmanda Spriel, a perfusionist at Toronto General who was involved in the procedure, explained that this machine functions as the lungs normally do. It drains blood from the body, oxygenates it and removes the carbon dioxide, and then pumps the cleaned blood back into the patient.\n\nFor other patients waiting for a lung donor, this machine is enough to help them survive. In Benoit's case, her condition only worsened.\n\nThe infection took over her lungs, spilled into her bloodstream and caused septic shock, she said, adding that it meant they couldn't do a lung transplant. You cannot transplant someone who is in septic shock.\n\nShe would die if nothing was done.\n\nConferring with her family, a radical decision was made, said Dr. Shaf Keshavjee, surgeon-in-chief at University Health Network. Because her lungs were so infected, we took both lungs out … and that had never been done before.\n\nHistoric and historical\n\nThough radical, the idea makes scientific sense, Humar said. We know that when you have infections anywhere in the body, if you can remove the source of the infection, it's often a good way to treat the infection.\n\nThese days, because excellent antibiotics can deal with most infections, doctors no longer resort to this practice, he explained: Certainly, in historical times, surgery was used for treatment of severe infections.\n\nDespite the experimental nature of this surgery, Toronto General was certainly the perfect place to try it. The world's first successful single lung transplant and the world's first successful double lung transplant had both been performed there in 1983, Humar said. He explained that the hospital had a big investment in transplantation and a very large multidisciplinary team of talented people.\n\nIn fact, the surgical team had been discussing the possibility of such a procedure for several years before Benoit landed in their ward. They'd seen how patients with cystic fibrosis sometimes developed lung infections and septic shock while waiting for a donor lung.\n\nIn Benoit's case, once her lung infection became resistant to all medications, it was clear this hypothetical surgery would be her only chance.\n\nPHOTO: Courtesy UHN Toronto After rehab, Melissa Benoit is living a more normal life, her surgeon says.\n\nA team of 13, led by Keshavjee, entered the operating room and removed her lungs in a nine-hour procedure.\n\nEngorged with pus and mucus, her lungs had become as hard as footballs, Keshavjee said.\n\nOnce they'd removed her lungs, the surgical team put a Novalung in on the right side of her heart to work with the Extra-Corporeal Lung Support machine in replacing respiratory function, Keshavjee said. Novalung is a lung support system that oxygenates the blood and is typically used to support patients with failing lungs before they've been removed.\n\nObviously, it was a very difficult and a very challenging decision, because there were a lot of unknowns as to whether it would even be technically possible, but theoretically and physiologically, it made sense that it should work, he said. We were happy that we could pull it off – the first step of getting her stabilized on the devices and the second step of getting her to and through a lung transplant, which is not a small operation.\n\nA 'night and day' change\n\nI was … brought back up to the ICU with an empty chest cavity, except for my heart, Benoit said. Yet, within hours of the radical surgery, she began to improve. No longer needing blood pressure medication, most of her organs showed signs of repair.\n\nThe sepsis got better, she said, and she was put back on the lung transplant wait list.\n\nI waited six days before receiving my perfect pair of donor lungs, said Benoit, who describes her new lungs as night and day compared with her original lungs.\n\nI've never had the experience of breathing before, she said. I was always feeling like I was breathing through a straw.\n\nCystic fibrosis will not recur in her transplanted lungs, according to her doctors, who say this is significant since many people with the disease die from infected lungs. However, she still has the genetics of cystic fibrosis, which can affect other systems in her body, including the digestive system.\n\nShe has a very good prognosis, Keshavjee said. The lungs are working well, she's gone through rehabilitation, and now she's walking around and living a more normal life and taking her daughter to school.\n\nWhen you measure success of something this dramatic, I think it's important to show that it is a success. Prolonging somebody's life for 20 days isn't really a meaningful thing in the long run, but really getting them back to where they're being a mom and really doing things, that's the more important part.\n\nAs far as Humar is concerned, the surgery is nothing less than a remarkable achievement … and the world's first.\n\nSurgery, but also rehabilitation, was an achievement for Benoit, who could not lift her arms, her head or even a finger after being immobile in a hospital bed for so many days. She is thankful that her physiotherapists – who brought her back so she is able to walk again – did not give up on her.\n\nOddly, Benoit's worst moment came after she went home: She saw a video clip of her husband and her daughter, Olivia, 2, in the ICU. In order to do a transplant, doctors needed Benoit to give a sign that she was still alive.\n\nThey needed to show that there was somebody in there, she said.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nAnd my daughter … was sitting on the edge of my bed yelling, 'Mummy, wake up!' Repeatedly, over and over again, and my husband's there telling her, 'You tell Mummy – wake up Mummy!' And I think that was the hardest part of the entire process – knowing that that had to take place, Benoit said through tears.\n\nIn that moment, she showed she was alive by sticking out her tongue, a little movement that enabled her doctors to go forth with the radical plan.\n\nBenoit has more medical procedures ahead, and no specific plans for the future. She's just happy to have one. Things are starting to get back to normal, and it hasn't been normal, in a very long time so it's nice, she said.\n\nHer husband also feels thankful for her renewed health, and is urging people to become organ donors. In Canada, people can sign up online, while residents of the United States can check each state's donor procedures here.\n\nShe's here with us today, and it's just a fantastic day, Chris Benoit said at a news conference Wednesday. I urge you … go on the (organ) donor's site and register or update your consent.
New York (CNN Business) Business leaders, investors and economists are sounding the alarm about the state of democracy in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe fear is that President Donald Trump's efforts to sow doubt about the political system will harm the fragile recovery by causing social unrest, amplifying political division and paralyzing Washington when it needs to focus on rebuilding the economy from the worst pandemic in a century.\n\nLonger term, the attacks on democracy could backfire by eroding confidence in the rule of law and cherished institutions that have made the United States the world's strongest economy.\n\nI'm very worried, said David Kotok, chief investment officer of Cumberland Advisors. If there's no trusted and stable democracy, the whole business-economic-market enterprise falls apart.\n\nIn other words, corruption is bad for business.\n\nBusiness groups are nervous enough to issue a series of statements this week about what is normally a ceremonial event: Wednesday's counting of electoral votes by a joint session of Congress. More than 170 prominent business leaders signed a letter urging Congress to accept the Electoral College results.\n\nBusiness leaders and investors are concerned -- on both sides of the aisle -- about how far the fringes will go. Michael Cembalest, chairman of market and investment strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management\n\nBoth the US Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable slammed efforts to change the election outcome and urged Congress to stick to counting the electoral votes.\n\nWith our country in the midst of a pandemic, the Business Roundtable said in a statement , business leaders recognize that ongoing division and distrust in our political system threatens the economic recovery and job creation our country desperately needs.\n\n'Political theatrics are a distraction'\n\nJason Furman, a former economic adviser to President Obama, pointed out that economic prosperity requires stability.\n\nBusiness leaders are right to argue that anything that undermines America's confidence in the smooth functioning of democracy also undermines the bedrock upon which America's economic success rests, Furman, now an economics professor at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, told CNN Business in an email.\n\nFurman said that President-elect Joe Biden and Congress should be squarely focused on ending the pandemic and restoring the economy.\n\nPolitical theatrics are a distraction that can only hurt in the short run while raising even more concerns over the longer run, Furman said.\n\nOf course, this is hardly the first time of elevated political tensions in US history. And the economy was able to rebound from volatile periods in the past, including the civil unrest of the 1960s and the Watergate scandal of the 1970s.\n\nTensions amplified by social media\n\nThe Nixon era seems like a polite game of chess by two English gentlemen by comparison to today, Michael Cembalest, chairman of market and investment strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNN Business.\n\nInstead of focusing on earnings and GDP, Cembalest has been devoting ample space in his research reports to guiding nervous clients through the weeds of Constitutional and election law.\n\nBusiness leaders and investors are concerned -- on both sides of the aisle -- about how far the fringes will go, Cembalest said.\n\nThere are almost two parallel worlds: The social media world and the actual judiciary, said Cembalest.\n\nThousands of Trump supporters are expected to protest in Washington during Wednesday's joint session of Congress. Business leaders are urging restraint.\n\nSmall businesses, local communities and our nation pay a steep price when demonstrations turn violent and destructive, so it is critical that these gatherings be peaceful, Thomas Donohue, CEO of the US Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement Monday.\n\nThe rule of law is being stress-tested\n\nCorporate America and Wall Street have been on high-alert for evidence of a breakdown in the nation's respect for the rule of law. That's because academic research shows that countries that have a track record for strong adherence to the rule of law tend to prosper more. It's a crucial difference between emerging markets and developed ones. And it makes sense: Investors are reluctant to plow money into countries ruled by corruption.\n\nWhen you risk the rule of law, you jeopardize the ability of society to flourish, said Kotok, the Cumberland Advisors executive. That is what is at stake right now in the bizarre unfolding of this election.\n\nTrust in the court system resolving disputes leads to confidence among investors and CEOs. And vice versa. In fact, there's a clear connection between the rule of law and higher market valuations\n\nA very unorthodox outcome here could rattle the market's confidence, said Cembalest, adding that he set a high threshold beyond the objections being raised by some US Senators to the election.\n\nThe JPMorgan executive is cautiously optimistic that the country will get through January without doing lasting damage to the rule of law or the economy at large. But Cembalest expressed concern about scenarios floated in recent weeks by some Trump allies about invoking martial law or launching military tribunals to overturn the election.\n\nThere's certainly a line that if you cross, there's no looking back, he said, such as any involvement by the military and any coordinated efforts to change the outcome through...illegal means.\n\nThe fact that these unthinkable scenarios are even being discussed by business leaders and Wall Street executives is telling.\n\nThe post-Trump world\n\nThe hope is that after a peaceful transfer of power, the incoming Biden administration will be able to work with Republican leaders to rebuild the economy. That would be a signal that Washington is avoiding political paralysis in the aftermath of the election.\n\nIf Biden and (Senate Majority Leader Mitch) McConnell dial temperatures down and compromise on large infrastructure bill, then the country moves on, Cembalest said.\n\nKristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco, said she's not very concerned about the economic impact of the attacks on democracy.\n\nThis could very well be a fleeting period in American history that has little impact on the future, she said.\n\nHooper predicted that the political fights this year and next will focus on how to fund the economic recovery -- not whether Biden is the legitimate president.\n\nWe'll be relieved to have those kinds of debates because it will suggest a return to normalcy, Hooper said.\n\nSo, that's where we are. After four years of chaos, investors are yearning to return to the Tea Party-era spending debates that look quaint by today's standards.
(CNN) -- Nick Charles, who started off as a taxi driver and later became the first sports anchor at CNN, died Saturday after battling bladder cancer since 2009. He was 64.\n\nCharles died peacefully, looking out at the spectacular land that drew him to Santa Fe, New Mexico, his wife, Cory, said.\n\nCharles began at CNN on the network's first day, June 1, 1980, and covered nearly every sporting event over the years.\n\nHe was paired with Fred Hickman for most of the next two decades on Sports Tonight, a show that beat ESPN in ratings when the upstarts were battling for viewers. To this day, he and Hickman remain one of the longest-lasting anchor duos in television.\n\nTopps, the trading-card company, put Charles' million-dollar smile on a bubble gum card, a rarity for a television personality. People magazine once dubbed him one of the most handsome men in America.\n\nNick was your friend from the moment you met him -- and he stayed your friend forever, said Rick Davis, one of Charles' producers at CNN in the 1980s. All of us who had the very good fortune to have been his friend have so much to remember about how he touched our lives in his own special way, said Davis, who is CNN's executive vice president of News Standards and Practices.\n\nAt his home in Santa Fe recently, Charles pointed to his signature mop of curly black hair as he scrolled through photographs of his on-air days. Look at that thing, he said with a laugh. It's my Billy Ray Cyrus mullet.\n\nFacing death, Charles embraced life\n\nWhile the world knew Charles for his sportscaster days, it was his battle with cancer that inspired tens of thousands of people. In a recent CNN.com article, he talked openly about the dying process and preparing his family for when he was gone. He made birthday video diaries for his 5-year-old daughter, Giovanna, in the years to come.\n\nThis is a gift from God where I need to build these memories for her, so that I'm not a blur, he said. I feel that when I go, that I'm going to prepare a place for my daughter and my wife. I'm going to be in their heart and soul. I tell them that every day.\n\nGupta: The friend I can't fix\n\nHis message, he said, is to never give up on life.\n\nIt's an imperfect world, but, boy, it's still beautiful.\n\nWhat is life? he said. It's 20 percent what happens to you and 80 percent how you react to it.\n\nFind that little kernel every day that brings you pleasure and joy -- and fasten onto that. That's what's going to make life worth living. Always look for the best.\n\nWhen you're contemplating your mortality and your life, he said, those are the things I reflect on.\n\nThe son of a taxi driver who was mostly absent from his life, Nicholas Charles Nickeas grew up poor in inner-city Chicago. In grade school, during the frigid winters when his dad didn't pay the heat bills, Charles would curl up in bed with his mother and brother to stay warm.\n\nHe struggled in high school. He had no mentors. He was too busy working late-night jobs at produce docks in desolate Chicago neighborhoods. Once, his boss pointed to mounds of rat feces, threw lye all over the floor and handed the 17-year-old Charles a pair of gloves, rubber boots and a hoe.\n\nHe scrubbed away, but thought to himself: I'll never be trapped again in life. Never. Never.\n\nThat was a watershed, life-changing moment for me. It really drove me to the point where I had focus in my life.\n\nHe eventually went to Columbia College Chicago, where he studied communications and journalism.\n\nHe drove a taxi to help pay for college. Even in the driver's seat, he was practicing for his broadcast career.\n\nI wasn't nosey, but just curious about people's life. I'd ask, 'How'd you get to this country? What was the spark that motivated you in life?' ... I don't know what it was, but people would open up.\n\nCharles was still driving taxis in the fall of 1970 when he auditioned for his first television job, at WICS in Springfield, Illinois.\n\nTwo days later, he got the job. He took a pay cut to enter the television business: $130 a week as a sports anchor, compared with $200 driving a taxi.\n\nHe was told by his news director that his Greek name was too ethnic and to change it to something more vanilla.\n\nNick Nickeas, sounds like you got a stutter, too, the news director added.\n\nAt the age of 24, Nick Charles was born. He covered sports for WICS, before the job rolled into just about anything, from farm reports to fluff. A wolf once urinated on his leg: The mother wolf was a little mad. We got a little too close to her cubs.\n\nFrom Springfield, he worked at local stations in Baltimore and Washington before joining CNN.\n\nAnd it's at CNN where he shined.\n\nIn his prime, he and Hickman had chemistry, charisma and dynamism -- a duo of boundless energy. The two were revolutionary for their time, a white and black man sitting side-by-side live every night in studios from the once-segregated South.\n\nWe just clicked from the very beginning, Hickman said in an interview before Charles' death. In television, you always have personality conflicts. Nick and I never had one. Nick and I have always had a tremendous relationship.\n\nHickman's favorite memory with his long-time friend came in the 1980s when they arrived in Los Angeles for the Cable Ace Awards. Stretch limousines and other luxurious cars were parked everywhere. We pulled up in a red Ford Tempo, Hickman said with a laugh.\n\nHis favorite line ever uttered by Charles came after Mike Tyson demolished an opponent: Tyson tore his meat house down.\n\nI still don't know what it means, Hickman said, but I love it.\n\nCharles covered everything from the Olympics to the Super Bowl to the Kentucky Derby. But boxing was his passion.\n\nHe covered some of the most classic boxing matches -- when Tyson bit Evander Holyfield's ear, when Roberto Duran quit and told Sugar Ray Leonard, No mas.\n\nSeeing an undefeated Tyson get knocked out by Buster Douglas in Tokyo in 1990 was epic.\n\nThat night was magical, Charles said. It speaks to the uncertainty, that anybody's cloak of invincibility can be ripped away.\n\nCharles would cry when he talked about the strength of boxers, because when he looked at the ring, he saw young men like him from the inner city who had to rely on themselves to reach success.\n\nYou have to walk down that alley way to the ring, he said. You're going to get hit. You have to take pain to get it. You have to fight through fear.\n\nThere's just such an empathy I have for these guys. They want it so badly.\n\nTyson on Saturday sent a message on Twitter: Mourning the loss of a true warrior. My friend & brother, Nick Charles.\n\nIn an interview in March, Charles had said he hoped to make it to one more Easter, to see his dream home completed in May, to see his daughter play the piano, to reach his 65th birthday on June 30. He made three of those four goals.\n\nIf I don't make it, he said, there's no need for any pity parties.\n\nPeople won't remember who you are or what you said, he said. It's really about: Are you going to be remembered as a good person?\n\nThat's victory to me. That's success.\n\nCharles is survived by his wife, Cory, of 13 years and their daughter, Giovanna. He has three children from two previous marriages: Jason, 39; Melissa, 36; and Katie, 24.\n\nHis passing is a loss to CNN, to the sports world and to the fans and friends everywhere who were with him to the end of his extraordinary life, said Jim Walton, Charles' field producer in his early days and current president of CNN Worldwide.\n\nNick Charles and his family formed the Embrace Life project to help stop child trafficking and abuse, increase access to education and allow children to embrace life. Working with the humanitarian organization World Vision and the TEACH NOW: Preventing Child Labor in the Philippines project, the family welcomes support here: www.worldvision.org/EmbraceLife.
Story highlights Thinking age-positive can improve mental and physical health The World Health Organization warns that ageism could be more widespread than sexism and racism\n\n(CNN) —\n\nWe've long been told to respect our elders. But now there is scientific evidence that respect can potentially save lives among the elderly and keep them both physically and mentally healthy.\n\nAn analysis by the global journalism network Orb Media found that countries with high levels of respect for the elderly recorded better health among older populations and lower poverty levels for over-60s.\n\nAs we enter a new phase of history – with 2.1 billion people predicted to live beyond 60 by 2050 – global attitudes toward older people have not kept up.\n\nIn a 2016 World Health Organization survey across 57 countries, 60% of respondents reported that older people are not respected.\n\nA more recent report by the Royal Society for Public Health in the UK gauged the feelings of 2,000 British citizens and found some other bleak trends. Almost half – 47% – believed that people over 65 struggled to learn new skills. A quarter of 18- to 24-year-olds and 15% of the total respondents agreed that it is normal to be unhappy and depressed when you are old.\n\nBecca Levy, professor of public health and psychology at Yale School of Public Health, believes that negative attitudes are due to the growing medicalization of older adults and the growing anti-aging industry that promotes and actually profits from a fear of aging.\n\nBut in the UK alone, older people made net contributions to the economy of nearly 40 billion pounds (US $52.64 billion) during 2011, according to a 2011 analysis.\n\nThe dangers of stereotypes\n\nNegative stereotypes can be dangerous to older people in a number of ways, including shortening their lives.\n\nLevy analyzed interviews with 660 people from Oxford, Ohio, that were conducted over more than two decades and matched these with mortality information. Her team found that those with a positive attitude toward aging lived on average 7.5 years longer than those who viewed it as something bad.\n\nWe were very surprised at this difference, said Levy, who believes that people with positive mindsets were able to live longer because positive attitudes can influence psychological, behavioral and physiological mechanisms in the body.\n\nPositive thinking can better behavior by leading people to engage in healthier lifestyles such as exercise. A person's positivity can also improve their psychology, making them better at coping with stress – a contributor to memory loss and brain shrinkage.\n\nAccording to one of Levy's studies, in Ireland over the span of 30 years, mental conditions such as depression and anxiety were more common among people with negative ideas about aging.\n\nDr. Luigi Ferrucci, geriatrician and director of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging, was skeptical at first when the idea of a link between someone's health and their feelings about age was suggested.\n\nThe Baltimore team's study, which started in 1958, also asked participants about their thoughts on aging, and expecting to find no connection between the two. But they soon discovered that people with a positive attitude toward aging had less cardiovascular disease, they produced less cortisol – a stress hormone – over time, and autopsy findings showed less frequent dementia.\n\nUsing very, very objective measures, we found that they were much better compared to those that had a negative attitude, Ferrucci said.\n\nBut he cautioned that, while the evidence is really strong, whether we can we generalize this [finding] to the general population is not completely understood.\n\nWhere are people most negative?\n\nHigh income countries are the highly industrialized countries and industrialization tends to devalue older people, explained Erdman Palmore, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University, in an email, adding that traditional rural societies tend to have higher respect because older people can keep working longer and are more valuable to the economy.\n\nRetirement policies make older people seem less valuable to society and a country's economy, he said.\n\nJapan, South Korea and Argentina are the three lowest-ranking countries when it comes to respect for the elderly, according to World Values Survey carried out between 2010 and 2014, despite their large elderly populations. These respect estimates – recorded in 2014 – paint a changing picture of perceptions.\n\nIn Japan, for example, middle-age men, who were traditionally valued, are now seen as having lost their honor and value in society.\n\nThe UK report found that most beliefs around age are formed by the age of 6. Once prejudice has been learned it is often very hard to unlearn, the report's lead author, Toby Green, wrote in an email.\n\nFor many people the stereotypes they absorb then persist into later life – at which point they begin to apply them to themselves. This means that negative age stereotypes are embedded among groups of all ages, he said.\n\nPHOTO: TORU YAMANAKA/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Elderly people walk in the street at Kouganji Temple in Tokyo.\n\nWhere did the stereotypes come from?\n\nRewinding the clock 200 years, researchers found a shift in attitudes toward the elderly in 1880.\n\nIn one study, they analyzed synonyms for the word 'elderly' in a database of 400 million words included in a range or print sources from the past two centuries and found that from 1810 to 1879, the concept of getting older was viewed positively in the United States.\n\nThen, from 1880 onward – the midst of industrialization – people started seeing aging as something bad. The researchers suggest the rising number of people over the age of 65 was associated with the increase in negative beliefs around age.\n\nStill, there remain many countries where the elderly are viewed as a valuable part of the population and deserving of respect.\n\nGeorgia, Uzbekistan and Qatar scored top places in the world value survey when asked about whether people aged over 70 are likely to be seen with respect.\n\nPositive mindsets about age have very real impacts on the elderly.\n\nA 2018 study found that the chances of dementia can be lowered by 49.8% if a positive outlook is maintained. Older people with happy thoughts have also been proven to recover faster from cardiovascular events, according to Levy's work.\n\nThe need for integration\n\nIn 2016, WHO acknowledged the need for ageism to be globally addressed and highlighted that ageism is most likely more widespread than sexism and racism.\n\nGreen believes that one of the solutions to reducing ageism is integrating generations.\n\nHis report for the Royal Society of Public health found that 64% of Brits didn't have a friend who is at least 30 years older than they are.\n\nIntegration is really important – there's so much evidence on the health and wellbeing benefits of this, he said.\n\nStarting with young children and encouraging workplace diversity to tackle ageism are other strategies Green recommends. Making this progress in workplace settings would do a great deal of good for wider cultural change.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nFerrucci believes that we need to see our life as a trajectory. Every single period is important.\n\nPeople should prepare for aging and make changes to their lives now to expand the years spent in good health, he said. Physical exercise and nutrition were the most important factors in longevity.\n\nOur aging population is the strongest, most important change that will occur in the world over the next 20 years, he added. When aging comes, it's not so bad if you have been planning for it.
(CNN) The US Food and Drug Administration has made clear that it does not plan to make any changes to Covid-19 vaccine dosing schedules in the United States -- but if any changes were made, the vaccine manufacturer would have to specifically ask the agency to adjust authorization.\n\nCNN confirmed with the FDA on Wednesday that if a manufacturer requests a change to its emergency use authorization, the manufacturer would need to submit data to the FDA supporting the requested change.\n\nIf any changes are proposed to the Covid-19 vaccine dosing schedules in the future -- it likely would not be the FDA making the proposals, said David Benkeser, a biostatistician at Emory University whose research includes work on preventive vaccines.\n\nIf it moves, it won't be FDA that moves it. They're bound by legal operations that dictate how drugs are approved in the country, and so it's not surprising to hear them say that their strong preference is to stick with what we know works, Benkeser said, adding that any changes most likely would be submitted to the FDA for consideration and then the agency would review data supporting such changes.\n\nThey're going to want to see correlate data, Benkeser said. And if we can establish and validate a correlate, I think they'll be happy to consider alternative dosing schedules, as well as new vaccines down the line next year.
(CNN) The House on Wednesday formally presented two articles of impeachment to the Senate after voting to approve the seven managers to prosecute the case against President Donald Trump, a long-awaited move that marks the beginning of the third Senate impeachment trial of a US President in history.\n\nThe House managers walked the articles across the Capitol just after 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday. The articles were received by the Senate, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the House managers would formally present the articles at noon ET Thursday.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the House would cross a threshold in history, at a signing ceremony for the impeachment articles, by delivering articles of impeachment against the President of the United States for abuse of power and obstruction of the House.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Pelosi appointed managers who include both key players from the House's impeachment inquiry as well as a couple of surprise picks: Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of California, Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York, Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Zoe Lofgren of California, Val Demings of Florida, Jason Crow of Colorado and Sylvia Garcia of Texas. Schiff, who led the House's Ukraine investigation, will serve as lead impeachment manager.\n\nThe Senate is expected to formally receive the articles on Thursday morning before swearing in both Chief Justice John Roberts and US senators who will serve as the jury for Trump's trial.\n\nThe House passed its resolution shortly after the managers were revealed earlier Wednesday. The resolution formally appointed the managers, allocated funding for the trial and sent the articles of impeachment to the Senate, where senators will decide whether the President should be removed from office. The vote was approved mostly along party lines 228-193.\n\nAs you can see from these descriptions, the emphasis is on litigators, Pelosi said in explaining how she chose the managers. The emphasis is on comfort level in the courtroom. The emphasis is on making the strongest possible case to protect and defend our Constitution to seek the truth for the American people.\n\nWednesday's vote will kick off the ceremonial beginning of the Senate impeachment trial.\n\nOn Thursday, House managers are again expected to physically walk the articles to the Senate and read them aloud, according to a Republican leadership aide. The senators and Chief Justice John Roberts, who will preside over the trial, will also be sworn in, and the President will be officially summoned and given a time to respond to the charges.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the substance of the trial is likely to get underway on Tuesday, January 21.\n\nPelosi's announcement of the managers came four weeks after the House voted to impeach the President on two charges: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Following the approval of articles of impeachment, Pelosi took the unprecedented step to withhold sending the articles to the Republican-held Senate, saying she wanted to know more about the Senate trial parameters, creating uncertainty over the timeline for a trial and how it would unfold.\n\nPelosi and Schiff argued the delay has been effective in bringing new evidence to light.\n\nThis time has given us the ability to show the American people the necessity of a fair trial to expose the degree to which McConnell is working hand in hand with the subject of impeachment, the President to essentially turn what should be a trial into a sham, Schiff said. And that time has been I think very effective in not only bringing new evidence to light and the evidence was already overwhelming but also forcing senators to go on record.\n\nBut it's not clear whether Senate Republicans will be interested in the new developments. Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who is a key moderate and up for reelection this year, questioned why the House was only now releasing the information.\n\nI wonder why the House did not put that into the record and it's only now being revealed, Collins said. Told that Parnas just turned over the documents to the committee, she added, Well doesn't that suggest that the House did an incomplete job then?\n\nThe Intelligence panel sought records from Parnas in September, but he first refused to comply with a subpoena and then had to request a judge to agree for him to provide the materials to Congress.\n\nThe White House continued to attack the Pelosi and the House over impeachment, and the President's legal team will soon be going toe-to-toe with the managers that Pelosi has appointed. The White House has yet to make a final decision about whether Republican House members will be part of the President's impeachment team, according to multiple sources.\n\nThe Speaker lied when she claimed this was urgent and vital to national security because when the articles passed, she held them for an entire month in an egregious effort to garner political support, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement. She failed and the naming of these managers does not change a single thing.\n\nWhile Pelosi's press conference was in progress, Trump weighed in on Twitter: Here we go again, another Con Job by the Do Nothing Democrats. All of this work was supposed to be done by the House, not the Senate!\n\nThe way the Senate trial will ultimately unfold will depend on the full parameters for the trial, which have not been released yet. McConnell has said he's planning to follow the model of the 1999 impeachment trial of then-President Bill Clinton and decide on whether to include witnesses after opening arguments are made — and he has the votes to set the ground rules for the impeachment trial without Democrats' support.\n\nThe House managers are expected have a chance to argue their case before the full Senate, and after that, the President's lawyers will have an opportunity to present the defense. The opportunity to serve as an impeachment manager will offer a high-profile turn in the spotlight for the lawmakers who have been chosen and a chance to elevate their standing in Congress and with liberal voters.\n\nPelosi has said she wanted a team of mangers that reflected the diversity of the Democratic caucus across racial, gender and geographic lines. Most but not all of the managers had legal backgrounds before coming to Congress. And the House team includes a mix of veterans like Lofgren — a staffer during President Richard Nixon's impeachment inquiry and a lawmaker for during President Bill Clinton's impeachment — as well as two freshmen Democrats.\n\nI'm very proud of the managers that we have, Pelosi said Wednesday. I believe that they bring to this case in the United States Senate great patriotism, great respect for the constitution of the United States, great comfort level in a courtroom, great commitment, again, to the Constitution.\n\nSome moderate Democrats wanted Pelosi to consider Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, the only conservative member of the House to support impeachment, as a manager. Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota told CNN he was disappointed Amash wasn't picked to join the prosecution.\n\nAs an attorney, former Republican, and the only independent member of the House of Representatives, he has articulated the constitutional rationale for impeachment as well as anyone in Congress, and his absence is a missed opportunity for a bipartisan management team, Phillips said.\n\nConviction in the Senate would require a two-thirds vote, a high threshold that is not expected to be reached given that many Republican senators have been vocal in saying that they believe the President's actions do not rise to the level of impeachment.\n\nBut regardless of the outcome, the Senate trial will be a historic and momentous event.\n\nThe performance of the House managers will shape how a trial plays out and could be a way for those who are chosen to secure their place in history as part of the impeachment proceedings.\n\nDuring the Clinton Senate impeachment trial, the managers took several days to present their arguments, followed by several days during which the Clinton legal team outlined their defense. That was followed by questions submitted in writing by senators directed to either the managers or the then-President's defense team.\n\nThere are no restrictions on the number of House impeachment managers the speaker can name to serve in the role.\n\nIn the Clinton trial, 13 House Republicans were chosen as impeachment managers.\n\nThree are still serving in Congress to this day: Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio, Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who was a representative of the state's third congressional district at the time of the Clinton impeachment.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump rescinded restrictions on the US military's ability to use landmines, weapons that have been banned by more than 160 countries due to their history of killing and wounding civilians, the White House said Friday.\n\nThe President has canceled the Obama administration's policy to prohibit United States military forces from employing anti-personnel landmines outside of the Korean Peninsula, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.\n\nThe Department of Defense has determined that restrictions imposed on American forces by the Obama Administration's policy could place them at a severe disadvantage during a conflict against our adversaries. The President is unwilling to accept this risk to our troops, she added.\n\nCNN reported Thursday that the move was expected and came about following a lengthy Pentagon review.\n\nThe policy represents a major reversal from the approach of the Obama administration which in 2014 committed the US to largely adhering to the 1997 Ottawa Convention, the international agreement which banned the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel landmines. The Obama policy committed to replacing landmines in the US stockpile after they expire and directed the destruction of stockpiles not required for the defense of South Korea.\n\nAnti-landmine campaigners were quick to criticize the new policy after news of the change broke.\n\nMr. Trump's policy rollback is a step toward the past, like many of his other decisions, and sends exactly the wrong message to those working to rid the world of the scourge of landmines, Jody Williams, who received the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize together with the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, said in a statement Thursday.\n\nSecretary of Defense Mark Esper defended the new policy prior to it being formally announced.\n\nI think landmines are -- are an important tool that our forces need to have available to them in order to ensure mission success, and in order to reduce risk to forces. That said, in everything we do, we also want to make sure that these instruments, in this case landmines, also take into account both the safety of employment, and the safety to civilians and others after a conflict, Esper told reporters at the Pentagon Friday.\n\nThe new Department of Defense landmine policy will permit the operational use of landmines only if they have a 30-day self-destruction or self-deactivation feature, a design feature seen as helping to prevent civilian casualties.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Friday Victorino Mercado, who is performing the duties of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans, and Capabilities, acknowledged that landmines were an emotional issue but stressed that the US would only use landmines with these safety features, noting that China and Russia maintain a stockpile of thousands of persistent landmines that are seen as much more likely to kill or maim civilians.\n\nThe new Pentagon policy gives the authority to use landmines in combat to the commanders of the US military's combatant commands, usually a four-star general or admiral, such as the commanders of US Africa Command and US Central Command which oversee operations on the African continent and the Middle East respectively.\n\nDefense officials argue that landmines can play an important role in defending US forces from both enemy armored vehicles and ground forces, helping to ensure US forces are not outflanked or overrun during an attack and can help influence the enemy's direction of movement in a manner to give US troops the advantage.\n\nOne of the drivers of the change in policy is greater concern about the prospect of a major conflict with a great power adversary like Russia or China where denying conventional enemy forces access to critical terrain would be seen as a more urgent need than it has been in recent years where the US has focused on counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations. Moscow and Beijing are not parties to the Ottawa treaty.\n\nMercado said that the growing challenge of Russia and China meant that the strategic environment has changed since the Obama administration instituted its policy in 2014.\n\nRussian troops occupied Crimea and intervened in eastern Ukraine in 2014 sparking new concerns about the threat posed by Moscow to NATO's eastern flank where the US has relatively few military forces.\n\nYou can take a situation where in the early stages we could be extremely outnumbered and by adding this capability and to be able to shape that battle space, that's an enormous equalizer and that could allow more (US) forces to flow in, Mercado said.\n\nWe can create areas for the enemy to avoid, Mercado said, later adding that just the threat of potential landmines having been emplaced could affect an adversary's calculus without the US having to actually lay any mines.\n\nHe said he does not envision landmines being used in current military operations in places like Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan, saying, I don't see that right now.

It is a major reason for her recent absence from grand slam finals, with her last being in 2009 at Wimbledon.\n\nSerena has predicted Saturday's match, their ninth grand slam final battle but first for almost eight years, will be uncomfortable, but the six-time Melbourne champion is relaxed whatever the outcome.\n\nAfter everything that Venus has been through with her illness and stuff, I just can't help but feel like it's a win-win situation for me, she explained.\n\nI was there for the whole time. We lived together. I know what she went through.\n\nIt's the one time that I really genuinely feel like no matter what happens, I can't lose, she can't lose.

London (CNN) The United Kingdom became the first nation to inoculate people with the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine outside of trials on Monday, with the country's health secretary hailing the day as a real pivotal moment.\n\nDoses of the vaccine, approved by UK regulators on December 30, will initially be delivered at a small number of hospitals for the first few days for surveillance purposes, before the bulk of doses arrives at medical practices later in the week, said England's National Health Service (NHS).\n\nThe Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is easier to transport and to store than the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine -- which was approved for use in the UK last month and has to be stored at -70 degrees Celsius -- making it easier to deliver outside of hospital settings.\n\nTens of thousands of current and former NHS workers are being trained as vaccinators to support the what the health service has described as the biggest immunization program in its history.\n\nBrian William Pinker, 82, was the first person to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine on Monday morning.\n\nRead More
No one at United Airlines has lost their job after a passenger was dragged of an aircraft last week.\n\nIt was a system failure, said CEO Oscar Munoz in response to a reporter's question on Tuesday. There was never a consideration for firing an employee or anyone around it.\n\nI'm sure there was a lot of conjecture about me personally, Munoz said when asked if any executives had left the company. The buck stops here. But he said he had spoken with the United Continental board and received its backing.\n\nThe initial response to the incident by United Continental (UAL) made a bad situation worse. Munoz's early statements described the passenger, who was forced from his seat to make room for a crew member, as being re-accommodated and suggested he had been disruptive and belligerent.\n\nRelated: United CEO walking tightrope to fix an airline\n\nMunoz and other top United executives again apologized for the incident, and vowed to improve customer service.\n\nThe incident has been a humbling learning experience for all of us here at United, he said.\n\nThe airline had already said it would change policies to never have law enforcement called to remove a passenger unless they were a threat to safety. It has also said it will now require that crew members taking flights to be booked at least an hour before the flight.\n\nIn the wake of the incident, Munoz said he has reached out to members of the Chinese consulate in Chicago. The passenger who was dragged off, Dr. David Dao, is a Vietnamese-American. The incident got widespread attention on social media in China, which is a key market for United.\n\nRelated: United acknowledges fiasco, posts 69% drop in profits\n\nUnited has been talking with corporate customers and so far has seen no sign it is losing business, according to United President Scott Kirby.\n\nThere has been a concern from corporate accounts which has been totally appropriate, Kirby said. They want us to fix this. They want us to do the right thing. But they believe in us and believe that we will get this fixed.\n\nHe said it was too soon to say if the leisure travelers were staying away from United in the wake of the incident.
Jose Luis Magana/AP\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters that there is no way he'd trade Hunter Biden for the GOP witness in order to get John Bolton to testify for the Democrats. He said that is not on the table.\n\nI think that is off the table. That trade is not on the table, he said.\n\nAsked whether he thought House manager Jerry Nadler's comments early Wednesday morning were appropriate, Schumer said he thought Chief Justice John Roberts dealt with the issue, and he talked generally about the arguments made. He wouldn't comment further on Nadler specifically.\n\nI've said all I'm going to say,  he told reporters when pressed again on Nadler.\n\nSchumer also applauded his GOP colleagues who fought to change the resolution so each side would have three days instead of two to make the case. Schumer said it was 100% evidence that Republicans could eventually be moved to support more witnesses and documents.\n\nSome background: Roberts scolded both the Democratic House managers and the President's defense team early Wednesday morning after a contentious exchange on the Senate floor.\n\nRoberts had just listened to the impeachment managers and Trump's legal team rip into each other after Nadler made the case for issuing a subpoena for former national security adviser John Bolton's testimony.\n\nDuring that argument, Nadler accused Republican senators of voting for a coverup by killing amendments for documents and testimony of additional witnesses.\n\nThat led to White House counsel Pat Cipollone firing back during his own remarks: The only one who should be embarrassed, Mr. Nadler, is you. For the way you addressed this body. This is the United States Senate. You're not in charge here.
After winning New Hampshire in 2016 with a margin of more than 20 points over Hillary Clinton, Sanders was expected to do well as the senator from a neighboring state. But the race tightened as results came in Tuesday night, once again producing a surprisingly close race between Sanders and Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana.\n\nAll of the candidates quickly turned their attention to upcoming states like Nevada, South Carolina and more diverse states that will vote on Super Tuesday like California and Texas. But Sanders took a moment to savor his win, which marked an extraordinary comeback for a candidate who was all but written off by many pundits after he suffered a heart attack in early October.\n\nNew Hampshire, which is famous for breathing new life into struggling candidacies, also delivered a rush of momentum to Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar , who placed third after a strong debate performance Friday night that fueled a late surge in her support. Both Klobuchar and Buttigieg appear to have been buoyed by the large number of independent voters in the state -- who are permitted to vote in either party's primary.\n\nThe Granite State became another stumbling block for both Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden , who made the telling decision to abruptly abandon his election night party in favor of heading to South Carolina.\n\nSanders holds the hand of his spouse Jane O'Meara Sanders as he takes the stage during a primary night event on February 11, 2020 in Manchester, New Hampshire.\n\nBut it was Sanders who won the night. After his upstart bid against Clinton in 2016, he has built a far more formidable operation this cycle while focusing on broadening his appeal to build a coalition of young voters, working class voters and voters of color. No other candidate has matched his grassroots fundraising advantage, which has allowed the campaign to build robust turnout operations in the early stated, helping him in a deeply unsettled Democratic field.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the Vermont senator proclaimed his victory as the beginning of the end for Donald Trump. Though he congratulated his Democratic rivals, he implicitly took a swipe at Buttigieg and other candidates who are raising money for their campaigns through big-dollar donations. He argued that his campaign was centered on taking on billionaires and candidates funded by billionaires.\n\nThe reason I believe we are going to win, is that we have an unprecedented grassroots movement, from coast to coast, of millions of people, Sanders told a raucous crowd at his election night party. The reason that we are going to win is that we are putting together an unprecedented, multi-generational, multiracial political movement. This is a movement from coast to coast, which is demanding that we finally have an economy, and a government that works for all of us -- not wealthy campaign contributors.\n\nButtigieg, who was came out ahead in the still-contested Iowa caucuses last week, once again outpaced expectations and tied with Sanders in the delegate count, according to CNN estimates. In his own election night speech, Buttigieg pointed to his strength across disparate parts of New Hampshire, and to his appeal among independents and more conservative voters.\n\nThanks to you, a campaign that some said shouldn't be here at all, has shown that we are here to stay, Buttigieg told supporters in New Hampshire Tuesday night. So many of you turned out -- diehard Democrats, independents unwilling to stay on the sidelines, and even some newly former Republicans ready to vote for a politics defined by how many we call in, instead of by who we push out.\n\nHe expressed his respect for Sanders, noting that he admired the Vermont senator even as a high school student, but he continued to describe Sanders' approach to politics as divisive.\n\nIn this election season we have been told by some that you must either be for revolution, or you are for the status quo. But where does that leave the rest of us? Most Americans don't see where they fit in that polarized vision, and we can't defeat the most divisive President in modern American history by tearing down anybody who doesn't agree with us 100% of the time, Buttigieg said.\n\nSanders led in New Hampshire on Tuesday night among liberals, voters under 45 years old and whites without a college degree, three of his core constituencies, according to exit polls. Voters who wanted a candidate who can bring change to the country, as well as those looking for someone who cares about people like them, also favored him. Four in 10 voters under 45 cast their ballots for Sanders, more than double his nearest opponent; and he drew the support of nearly half of voters under 30 years old.\n\nWith 95% of precincts reporting, Sanders led with 26%. Buttigieg was in second with 24.4% and Klobuchar in third with 19.7%. It was a steep drop-off to fourth place for Warren, who had 9.3%, and Biden in fifth, with 8.4%. Warren and Biden will not win any delegates in Tuesday's race, according to a CNN Decision Desk analysis. CNN is projecting President Donald Trump will easily win the state's Republican primary, as expected.\n\nIn the all-important delegate count, CNN is estimating Sanders and Buttigieg both earned nine delegates on Tuesday, while Klobuchar won six. There are 24 delegates at stake.\n\nKlobuchar surprises with strong showing\n\nAs results came in, Klobuchar touted her happy, scrappy campaign and told her supporters in New Hampshire that their effort had beaten the odds every step of the way. She said that the election would prove that the heart of America is bigger than the heart of this guy in the White House.\n\nTonight is about grit, and my story, like so many of yours, is one of resilience, Klobuchar said. I announced my candidacy in the middle of a Minnesota blizzard. And there were a lot of people that predicted I wouldn't even get through that speech, but not the people of my state, and not the people of New Hampshire. Except, then they predicted that we wouldn't make it through the summer. We did. Then they predicted we wouldn't make it to the debates and Man, were we at the debate in New Hampshire.\n\nWe've been strong and we've never quit, the Minnesota senator continued. I think that sounds pretty good for a president. Across the months, and months, and miles of this race, we redefined the word grit.\n\nKlobuchar takes the stage with spouse John Bessler during a primary night event at the Grappone Conference Center on February 11, 2020 in Concord, New Hampshire.\n\nShe alluded to unique hurdles that the female candidates have faced -- the fact that a large portion of voters still worry that a female nominee would face a more difficult climb against Trump than a male candidate. The exit polls in New Hampshire Tuesday night bore out that concern among voters. Thirty percent of voters polled said they believe it would be harder for a woman to beat Trump, while 11% said it would be easier. Fifty-eight percent said there would be no difference.\n\nKlobuchar said people have told her, just as they have told Warren, that they didn't think a woman could be elected.\n\nIn my case, it was elected to the US Senate; no woman had ever done it before, Klobuchar said. But I came back. I defied expectations and I won. ... And tonight in New Hampshire, as everyone had counted us out, even a week ago -- thank you, pundits -- I came back, and we delivered.\n\nTough night for Warren and Biden\n\nBefore the votes were even tallied, Warren's campaign manager pointed in a memo to her ability to organize in all 57 states and territories and argued that no one candidate has yet shown the ability to consolidate support.\n\nWhen the Massachusetts senator took the stage early in Manchester, New Hampshire, she congratulated Sanders and cast herself as the unity candidate, noting that Biden, Buttigieg and Sanders have all targeted one another over the past week.\n\nThese harsh tactics might work if you're willing to burn down the rest of the party in order to be the last man standing, Warren said. But if we're going to beat Donald Trump in November, we are going to need huge turnout within our party, and to get that turnout, we will need a nominee that the broadest coalition of our party feels they can get behind. We can't afford to fall into factions. We can't afford to squander our collective power. We will win when we come together.\n\nAs Biden and Warren sought to recalibrate their campaigns, businessman Andrew Yang and Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet both dropped out of the race after results began coming in.\n\nBiden accompanied by his wife Jill speaks to supporters on televised message from South Carolina at his New Hampshire primary night rally in Nashua, New Hampshire\n\nBiden, who finished fourth in Iowa, dismissed predictions of his demise during a visit to a polling location in New Hampshire on Tuesday morning. But he was already in South Carolina by the time the New Hampshire results rolled in. He hopes to draw attention to his lead in the Palmetto State, casting it as a chance to prove that his strong support among African American voters could carry him to the Democratic nomination.\n\nWe just heard from the first two of 50 states, Biden told supporters in South Carolina. Where I come from that's the opening bell, not the closing bell. The fight to end Donald Trump's presidency is just beginning.\n\nIn a nod to the lack of minority support for two of his key rivals, Buttigieg and Klobuchar, Biden emphasized that African American voters have historically played an outsized role in selecting the nominee of the Democratic Party.\n\nWe need to hear from Nevada, South Carolina and Super Tuesday states and beyond. Look we're moving into an especially important phase (of the race), because up until now, we haven't heard from the most committed constituency in the Democratic Party -- the African American community -- and the fastest growing segment of society -- the Latino community, Biden continued. Ninety-nine point nine percent -- that's the percentage of African American voters who have not yet had a chance to vote in America.\n\nBut Biden's biggest problem now is that he has built his entire campaign on the premise that he is the most electable candidate against Trump. His fourth place finish in Iowa and fifth place finish in New Hampshire eviscerated that argument.\n\nSix in 10 Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire said they were more focused on finding a candidate who could beat Trump, than finding one who agreed with them on the issues.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments throughout the New Hampshire primary.
Washington (CNN) At the weekly Republican lunch on Tuesday, just before the historic impeachment trial of President Donald Trump began, multiple senators had concerns to share with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nThe previous night, McConnell had introduced his resolution laying out the rules for how the trial would unfold. Under McConnell's plan, opening statements would be condensed into just two calendar days, drawing outrage from Democrats who argued McConnell was rushing the trial and trying to push the debate into the middle of the night when most Americans would be asleep.\n\nIt turns out that it wasn't just Democrats who were unhappy with McConnell. At the lunch multiple Republicans argued for a change to the rules, according to sources familiar with the lunch who spoke to CNN.\n\nWhile moderate Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Rob Portman of Ohio led the charge, they were joined by a number of more conservative members of the GOP conference who pressed McConnell, a person familiar told CNN.\n\nIn all about 15 senators argued in favor of changing McConnell's resolution, a Republican aide told CNN. That included some of the President's staunchest allies such as Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds and Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, according to the Senate aide.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Cotton's office denied that he argued in favor of changing the resolution. On Wednesday, Cotton's office qualified its denial to say that Cotton had spoken up at the lunch. While he expressed support for McConnell's initial resolution, Cotton told his fellow Republicans that if they were in favor of changing it, they should back a GOP-supported amendment to the language, according to Cotton spokeswoman Caroline Tabler.\n\nAt the lunch, members were worried that by rushing things, they could inadvertently give traction to Democratic complaints of an unfair trial, and put vulnerable Republicans up for reelection at a further disadvantage. As the lunch went on, it became clear that the overwhelming majority of the conference supported changing McConnell's resolution, according to the aide.\n\nTheir complaints were heard.\n\nMinutes before Tuesday's session kicked off, a Senate staffer quietly struck through a few sections of the typed resolution with a pen, writing in the alterations by hand.\n\nThe 11th-hour amendment, which extends the allotted time for opening arguments from two to three days and relaxes the evidence submission rules, was widely seen as a concession to moderate Republican senators, and a small win for Democrats.\n\nIt was also a procedural defeat for the White House, which had pushed McConnell for the shorter time frame, according to a person familiar.\n\nWhile some viewed the rule change as the rare instance in which McConnell misread his conference, others saw something more strategic in the move -- one where Republicans could be viewed as pushing back on a White House bent on confining the terms of the impeachment trial.\n\nSen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, thought McConnell just miscalculated Republican senators' willingness to stay in the Senate until very late at night. That is exactly what I think happened, Coons said.\n\nWhatever the reason, the incident underscores how little room McConnell has to maneuver. While he can pass the resolution with a simple majority, he has just a three-seat advantage and cannot risk defections.\n\nEarlier in the day, Portman had hinted a change might be coming. As he left McConnell's office about an hour before the start of the trial, Portman told CNN he wanted the time for opening arguments to be extended.\n\nI hope that can be worked out, Portman said. I'm told it's being worked on.\n\nIt was clear even as early as last week that the White House might not get its way. Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, suggested to reporters last Friday a longer period was possible.\n\nI'll be interested to see whether or not that gets elongated over a few days, Tillis had said.\n\nDuring a break in the trial Tuesday afternoon, other Republican senators praised the amended resolution. We aren't trying to hide testimony in the wee hours of the morning, Sen. Ron Johnson told CNN.\n\nAs a visual, it seems fairer to spread the 24 hours, said Wicker.\n\nDespite the changes, it's hardly altered the Democratic opposition to McConnell's resolution. Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy told CNN that he did not view the changes as significant, saying there were still key breaks with President Bill Clinton's trial.\n\nI think the fact is that Mitch keeps telling you folks in the press that we're doing it just like Clinton. Of course, he's not, Leahy said. And I hope somebody will call him on it.\n\nJUST WATCHED Schumer calls on 4 GOP members to 'resist McConnell's cover-up' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Schumer calls on 4 GOP members to 'resist McConnell's cover-up' 02:26\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had sharply criticized McConnell's resolution from the Senate floor, saying it would result in a rushed trial with little evidence, in the dark of night.\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, Schumer seemed at least slightly appeased. I'm very glad they moved to three days instead of two so we won't be hearing arguments at two in the morning, Schumer told reporters during a brief break in the session.\n\nThe real test, Schumer said, will come when they vote for witnesses and documents once the trial gets past opening arguments.\n\nThis story has been updated to include comment from Sen. Chris Coons and from Sen. Tom Cotton's office.\n\nOn Wednesday, this story was updated a second time to include further comment from Cotton's office.
Bill Baptist/Getty Images\n\nThe NBA All-Star Game is not exactly known for its hard-nosed defense and max effort, but the league is reportedly taking a step to improve the competitiveness of this year's version on Feb. 18 in Los Angeles.\n\nAccording to Chris Haynes of ESPN, the players on the winning side will receive $100,000. He noted winners previously received $50,000 compared to $25,000 for the losers, but the difference between a win and a loss is now $75,000.\n\nThe change apparently had the desired effect considering some of the player quotes Haynes included in his report.\n\nThat'll certainly make it more interesting, Boston Celtics guard Kyrie Irving said. That's a huge difference.\n\nGolden State Warriors guard Klay Thompson echoed that sentiment, saying, I think it will help, for sure. That's a lot of money.\n\nTeammate Stephen Curry agreed: That's significant. For some players, they just want to see [the game] being worth their time.\n\nCurry was directly involved in the most prominent change to this year's event. As the top vote-getter in the Western Conference, he had the opportunity to pick the teams alongside LeBron James—the top vote-getter in the Eastern Conference.\n\nVideo Play Button Videos you might like\n\nRather than pit the two conferences against each other as in years past, the two squads James and Curry drafted will face each other a la a playground battle with team captains.\n\nCurry will have some familiar faces with Thompson and Draymond Green on his side, but James took Warriors forward Kevin Durant with the first pick. What, we gonna keep this a mystery? Durant said when confirming James took him No. 1, per Anthony Slater of The Athletic.\n\nAccording to Rosalyn Gold-Onwude of NBA on TNT, Curry countered by taking Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo with his first selection.\n\nThere are plenty of intriguing storylines in the All-Star Game with Durant and James playing alongside each other, Durant pairing with Russell Westbrook again, the other Warriors finding a way to thrive together on an All-Star court and fresh faces such as Joel Embiid and Karl-Anthony Towns adding some new flavor to the game.\n\nThere will likely still be the stretches of lackadaisical defense leading to rim-rattling dunks and wide-open threes, but the additional financial prize waiting at the end figures to play a role when the All-Stars clamp down on defense in the closing minutes.
(CNN) Barack and Michelle Obama's production company now has an Oscar-shaped feather in its hat.\n\nAmerican Factory, a film backed by the Obama's Higher Ground Productions, on Sunday took home the award for best documentary feature.\n\nThe film, about a culture clash at a Dayton, Ohio manufacturing plant, was the first project produced by the duo's new production outfit and marks a running start for the company.\n\nThe film hails from filmmakers Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar. It was released through Netflix as part of a lucrative deal Higher Ground has with the streaming service.\n\nWorking people have it harder and harder these days, and we believe that things will get better when workers of the world unite, Reichert said in her acceptance speech.\n\nRead More
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama showed Thursday night that they have more common ground than differences when it comes to making national service a priority in their presidential administrations.\n\nThe presidential canidates put aside partisan politics as the nation remembers the terrorist attacks.\n\nThe candidates took the stage separately in a forum sponsored by TIME at Columbia University in New York.\n\nA coin toss determined who took questions first from moderators TIME Managing Editor Rick Stengel and PBS's Judy Woodruff.\n\nAsked why it seems the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, are fading in the minds of many Americans, McCain said:\n\nWe needed at that time [September 11, 2001] to take advantage of the unity in the United States of America.\n\nMcCain criticized the Bush administration for not taking advantage of that sense of unity and instead imploring the American public to live their lives as usual and go shopping.\n\nI would have called them to serve, said McCain.\n\n\n\nThe GOP candidate said he suspects people feel uninspired by leaders in Washington and that Americans want change in federal government.\n\nThey understand the challenges that we have in this world. They see the Russian invasion of the little country called Georgia. They see the problems in Afghanistan growing larger. They see a whole lot of things happening in the world that's going to require us to serve, and that opportunity has to be provided to them. Watch McCain talk about service »\n\nMcCain praised the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps, saying they and similar organizations don't receive sufficient recognition from Washington. But McCain was careful to say government should limit its involvement. Asked about compensation for service McCain said:\n\nI'd be glad to reward [volunteers] them as much as possible. But you want to be careful that the reason is not the reward of financial or other reasons, but the reward is the satisfaction of serving a cause greater than yourself. ... Finding new ways to serve. That's what this next few years should be all about.\n\nMcCain also fielded a question about his running mate Gov. Sarah Palin's dismissive comments about Sen. Barack Obama's community service in Illinois.\n\nLook, Gov. Palin was responding to the criticism of her inexperience and her job as a mayor in a small town. That's what she was responding to. Of course I respect community organizers. Of course I respect people who serve their community. And Sen. Obama's record there is outstanding.\n\nMcCain also said that politics is tough business, and that Obama set the tone of the whole campaign when he refused to take part in town hall meetings with McCain across America.\n\nObama said his views don't necessarily differ from McCain's on national service.\n\nHe said creating opportunities for national service would be a priority for his administration as well.\n\nPart of what makes America work is the fact that we believe in individual responsibility and self-reliance, but we also believe in mutual responsibility, in neighborliness, in a sense that we are committed to something larger than ourselves.\n\nObama cited a plan to provide college tuition aid in return for student community service.\n\nOne of my central platforms in this campaign is we're going to provide a $4,000 tuition credit every student, every year, but in exchange for giving something back. And so, young people of modest means, who are interested in going to college, this gives them an opportunity to serve and at the same time, pay for their college education. I think there are a lot of creative ways where we can provide opportunities than exist right now.\n\nObama also said he wants to attract more young people into civil service careers.\n\nThe fact is that we have to have government. When a hurricane strikes, as it did with Katrina, we have to have a FEMA that works, which by the way, means that we should be encouraging young people, the best and the brightest, to get involved as civil servants, to pursue careers of public service so we've got people who are trained in federal emergency management who are able to take on the job. Watch Obama talk about service »\n\nNow, that does not crowd out the Red Cross. That doesn't crowd out the thousands of church groups that went down there. What it means is that each area has a role to play.\n\nThe forum is part of a two-day summit meant to promote national service. Nearly 500 leaders from business, foundations, universities and politics are meeting to celebrate the power and potential of citizen service and lay out a plan to address America's greatest social challenges through expanded opportunities for volunteer and national service, according to the organizers' Web site.\n\nEach presidential candidate has served his nation in different ways. McCain was a Navy officer for over two decades and often encourages Americans to serve a cause greater than oneself.\n\nObama served as a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago after he graduated from college. In a speech in December, the Illinois Democrat said he would ask Americans to serve if he becomes president. This will be the cause of my presidency, he said.\n\nToday's joint appearance came amid recent sniping between the campaigns.\n\nMcCain's campaign recently attacked Obama for lipstick remarks made during a campaign stop in Virginia on Tuesday.\n\nJohn McCain says he's about change too, and so I guess his whole angle is, 'Watch out George Bush -- except for economic policy, health care policy, tax policy, education policy, foreign policy and Karl Rove-style politics -- we're really going to shake things up in Washington,'  he said.\n\nThat's not change. That's just calling ... the same thing something different. You know you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. You know you can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change, it's still going to stink after eight years. We've had enough of the same old thing. Watch how tensions are rising on the trail »\n\nThe crowd erupted in applause when Obama delivered the line. McCain's campaign said Obama's remarks were offensive and a slap at vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, despite the fact that the Arizona senator himself used the phrase last year to describe a policy proposal of Hillary Clinton's.\n\nObama shot back Wednesday and accused the McCain campaign of engaging in lies and swift boat politics.\n\nI don't care what they say about me. But I love this country too much to let them take over another election with lies and phony outrage and swift boat politics, he said in Norfolk, Virginia. Enough is enough. Watch Obama deliver his harsh words »\n\nThe phrase swift boat comes from the 2004 presidential election, when the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth launched an attack ad campaign against Democratic candidate John Kerry that was said by some to be false.\n\nBut the two presidential candidates agreed to put aside partisan politics on Thursday. They appeared together in New York to lay a wreath at ground zero, where the World Trade Center towers collapsed after two airliners hijacked by al Qaeda operatives plowed into them on September 11, 2001.\n\nThe two met with families of victims as well as state and local officials.\n\nEarlier in the day, McCain attended a ceremony in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, to remember those who lost their lives when United Airlines Flight 93 crashed in a field there on September 11, 2001. Many believe that the hijackers intended to crash Flight 93 into the U.S. Capitol in Washington.\n\nHundreds, if not thousands, of people at work in that building, when that fateful moment occurred, could have been destroyed along with a beautiful symbol of our freedom, McCain said. They -- and possibly I -- owe our lives to the passengers who summoned the courage and love necessary to deprive our depraved and hateful enemies their terrible triumph.\n\nI've had the great honor and privilege to witness great courage and sacrifice for America's sake, he said.\n\nThe Obama campaign released a statement earlier Thursday for its candidate in which he said, We will never forget those who died.\n\nOn 9/11, Americans across our great country came together to stand with the families of the victims, to donate blood, to give to charity, and to say a prayer for our country, Obama said. Let us renew that spirit of service and that sense of common purpose.\n\nMeanwhile, a CNN poll out Thursday suggests that voters view McCain as the better presidential candidate to handle terrorism but do not consider terrorism their primary concern in voting.\n\nNearly two-thirds of those surveyed, 62 percent, believe that the Republican presidential nominee would be the better candidate to handle the issue of terrorism, compared with 34 percent who believe that his Democratic rival, Obama, would be better on the issue.\n\nThe poll's margin of error is plus-or-minus 3 percentage points.\n\nOpinion Research Corp. conducted telephone interviews with 1,022 adults from September 5-7 for the poll.\n\nTime's Michael Duffy contributed to this report.\n\nAll About Barack Obama • John McCain • Terrorism • September 11 Attacks
Washington (CNN) Pete Buttigieg's campaign sent a letter to the Nevada State Democratic Party on Sunday, alleging that there are material irregularities pertaining to the process of integrating early votes into the in-person precinct caucus results and asking the party to take three concrete steps to address the purported issues.\n\nThe letter asked the state party to release early vote and in-person vote totals by precinct​, correct any outstanding second alignment errors identified by presidential campaigns, including ours and explain anomalies in the data.\n\nThe allegations make Buttigieg's campaign the first to question the Nevada results, which -- with 50% of precincts reporting -- found Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders with a significant lead, former Vice President Joe Biden at 19% and Buttigieg at 15%. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren trailed Buttigieg at 10%.\n\nThe claims from the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, follow the chaos surrounding the Iowa caucuses weeks earlier. That chaos delayed reporting results from the first-in-the-nation state and undercut the legitimacy of the caucus process. Nevada's process did not experience the same disorder that impacted the Iowa caucuses, but the results have taken hours to report, with thousands still left unreported nearly 24 hours after the caucuses began.\n\nMolly Forgey, communications director for the Nevada State Democratic Party, responded to the letter in a statement to CNN on Sunday.\n\nRead More
(CNN) LeBron James and the NBA community have expressed their disappointment after prosecutors decided not to charge any police officer in connection with the shooting of Jacob Blake.\n\nJames, who has consistently used his platform to call for the end of police brutality, said the prosecutor's decision was a blow to the heart and to the gut.\n\nNot only to that community, but to us and to every Black person that has been a part of this process and seeing these outcomes for so long, he told reporters after the LA Lakers' win over the Memphis Grizzlies in Tennessee on Tuesday.\n\nKenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley announced Tuesday that no Kenosha law enforcement officer in this case will be charged with any criminal offense based on the facts and laws.\n\nRusten Sheskey, a White officer, shot Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, seven times in the back while responding to a domestic incident on August 23, 2020. Blake survived the shooting but was left paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nRead More
(CNN) The Rev. Raphael Warnock is the latest HBCU grad breaking barriers and standing up to shape the nation.\n\nStudents and alumni from historically Black colleges and universities around the country are celebrating Warnock winning his US Senate race in Georgia, hoping it will change the misconceptions around the institutions' quality of education and graduates' social mobility.\n\nWarnock, a Morehouse College alum, has regularly credited his education as he was the first in his family to graduate college.\n\nI went to Morehouse College on a 'full faith' scholarship. I didn't know how I would pay for it but I graduated college, earned a Ph.D. degree, he said in a campaign ad.\n\nYears after attending the Rev. Martin Luther King's alma mater, Warnock would be selected to become the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist -- King's church in Atlanta.\n\nWarnock is just one of many notable politicians and activists who became trailblazers, years after attending HBCUs.\n\nRaphael Warnock with his parents, Jonathan and Verlene Warnock. Both of his parents were Pentecostal pastors.\n\nVice President-elect Kamala Harris is a Howard University alumna and Cori Bush, who became the first Black woman to represent Missouri in Congress in November, is a Harris-Stowe State University alumna.\n\nWhen you attend an HBCU, there's nothing you can't do, Harris tweeted last year.\n\nFormer Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams attended Spelman College in Atlanta and Keisha Lance Bottoms, the Atlanta mayor and a surrogate for the Biden-Harris campaign, went to Florida A&M University.\n\nThis is an exciting time, this is monumental, said Patrick Delisser, a 32-year-old urgent care doctor in Atlanta and a Morehouse College graduate. HBCUs put us in positions that people aren't aware of. And Warnock shows people what we can achieve.\n\nThere's more than 100 HBCUs across the country, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics . Most of them were formed after the Civil War to provide educational opportunities for newly freed slaves.\n\nWhile they represent about 3% of the higher education institutions, at least 17% of bachelor's degrees by African Americans are earned at HBCUs, according to the United Negro College Fund, a Washington-based national group that awards college scholarships and supports HBCUs.\n\nIt should not be a surprise that HBCUs students and alumni, such as Harris and Abrams, are at the forefront of politics and social justice, said Robert Stephens, founder of the HBCU collective, an advocacy group aiming to increase support of Black higher education institutions.\n\nHBCUs have educated generations of African American leaders and professionals, i ncluding King and Thurgood Marshall, the civil rights lawyer who became the first African-American to hold a seat on the Supreme Court. Many students at Spelman and Morehouse were also involved in the civil rights movement.\n\nThe spirit of we're going to be great, we're going to succeed, we're going to be successful flows through HBCUs as well as this sense of belonging to a greater purpose, Stephens said last year.\n\nBut the impact of HBCUs goes beyond politics. For Marilyn Griffin, a high school teacher in Detroit, Michigan, attending an HBCU helped shape the person and educator she is now.\n\nI found a really big part of myself there, including self awareness and confidence that I didn't get growing up, said Griffin, 39, a graduate of Florida A&M University.\n\nGriffin says her interest in African American history grew while attending college and, ultimately, she decided to pursue a career in education. Now, she constantly encourages all of her students to learn about their heritage and culture.\n\nEvery kid deserves to know where they come from no matter where they come from, she said.\n\nHBCUs have produced notable alumni over the years while struggling for funding and facing stigma about not being able to prepare students for the real world.\n\nStephens, a Winston-Salem State University alumnus, said he disagrees with people who believe HBCUs don't have a rigorous education.\n\nWhen I think about my experience at an HBCU, it was one where I was nourished, Stephens said. I was free to be a Black man in America and that has been probably one of the most uplifting things I've ever experienced.\n\nHBCUs award about 20% of African American STEM bachelor's degrees, according to the United Negro College Fund. They have also fueled social and economic mobility for Black Americans.\n\nA report released in 2018 by the Rutgers Center for Minority Serving Institutions indicates that economic mobility is better for HBCU students than for students who attend other schools.\n\nHBCUs enroll far more low-income students and nearly 70% of their students attain at least middle class incomes, the report states.\n\nSchool administrators could be tapping Harris to help cultivate close ties to the Biden administration as HBCUs across the US have less financial security than predominantly White institutions.\n\nWithin both public and private sectors, HBCU endowments lag behind PWIs by at least 70%, according to a recent report by the American Council on Education.\n\nEarlier this year, an outpouring of financial pledges and philanthropic gifts made their way to HBCUs following the George Floyd protests amid renewed calls for racial justice but many HBCUs continue facing financial pressure.\n\nDuring their campaign, President-elect Joe Biden and Harris pledged to rectify the funding disparities faced by HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions by investing over $70 billion.\n\nAs Biden and Harris prepare to take office, Robinson, the Winston-Salem State University chancellor offered some advise.\n\nContinue to think about us. Continue to have conversations with us and continue to listen to what our needs are, as we move forward, Robinson told WXII.
(CNN) President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed an initial trade deal with senior Chinese leaders that includes pledges from Beijing to more than double its purchases from American farmers in the first year.\n\nThe 86-page agreement comes after nearly two years of fraught negotiations and a punishing trade war between the world's two largest economies that hit US soybean producers especially hard\n\nAmericantaxpayers have spent about $28 billion bailing out farmers , including payments to trade groups and purchases from food banks.\n\nThe pause in the trade war gives Trump something concrete to offer farmers , a crucial element of his Midwestern firewall, heading into the 2020 election.\n\nTogether we are righting the wrongs of the past and delivering a future of economic justice and security, Trump said from the East Room of the White House just as lawmakers at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue were preparing to vote on two articles of impeachment.\n\nMost people thought this could never happen, he said.\n\nTrump said he'd visit China in the not too distant future to reciprocate a visit to Washington from China's top trade negotiator.\n\nIn a letter, China's President Xi Jinping told Trump that the agreement was a sign their two countries could resolve differences through dialogue.\n\nThe letter, which China's vice premier and top negotiator, Liu He, read aloud in the East Room during the signing event, struck an optimistic tone about the future of Washington-Beijing ties.\n\nThe deal, Xi wrote, was good for China, the US and the whole world.\n\nSaying he would remain in close touch with Trump, Xi said he hoped the US would treat Chinese companies fairly.\n\nUnder the agreement, China has promised to buy an additional $12.5 billion in US agricultural products in year one, and then $19.5 billion in year two. Those commitments come atop roughly $24 billion in farm purchases that China made in 2017, before the trade war started.\n\nIn exchange, the United States agreed to reduce tariffs on $120 billion in Chinese products from 15% to 7.5%.\n\nThose changes are set to take effect within 30 days of the pact's signing along with the broader deal. However, while China has agreed to purchase more US products, it has not made any specific commitments to reduce tariffs imposed on the US.\n\nFarm Bureau President Zippy Duvall called the agreement an important step.\n\nChina was once the largest market for U.S. agricultural products but has dropped to fifth largest since retaliatory tariffs were introduced. This agreement will help turn around two years of declining agricultural exports, he said in statement.\n\nAmbassador Robert Lighthizer, the President's top trade negotiator, described the deal as a massively good first step, describing China's purchases as helping to create access for American companies.\n\nAre we in an ideal spot? No, Lighthizer told reporters at the White House before the signing. Is this a massively good first step? Yes.\n\nto buy more US farm products are part of a broader by 2021. The two sides estimate that those purchases will continue beyond the two-year deal into 2022 through 2025. The pledges by Chinato buy more US farm products are part of a broader $200 billion package that includes manufactured goods and energy exportsby 2021. The two sides estimate that those purchases will continue beyond the two-year deal into 2022 through 2025.\n\nAmong the products China has promised to buy more of: soybeans, wheat, cotton and pork. A senior administration official told reporters that the US would be actively monitoring data sources from both countries to ensure that China is fulfilling its promise.\n\nThe initial deal provides better protection to American companies that have long complained of thefts of their intellectual property and trade secrets.\n\nIt also potentially removes a major barrier that required the sale of their technology for access, loosens up requirements for banks wanting to operate there and imposes anti-counterfeiting measures that, if broken, would lead to penalties.\n\nPledges in the deal go further than what China has agreed to in the past, but the agreement doesn't require the government to change any laws or regulations.\n\nNobody really understood the deal until today when we released it, so it's a much bigger deal than people thought, said Trump, who spent more than 30 minutes thanking Cabinet members, members of Congress and executives from some of the nation's biggest companies, including General Electric and Citibank.\n\nThe President said the next round of negotiations -- which are expected to address tougher issues such as Chinese subsidies to domestic companies and state-owned enterprises -- will start soon.\n\nTariffs, he said, would stay on as leverage against China and come off only when the administration completes the next phase of the deal.\n\nWe have pretty strong cards, said Trump.\n\nThe two countries also reaffirmed commitments not to devalue their currency for competitive advantage that they have pledged with the Group of 20. A senior administration official said that the provision, like most of the pact, would be enforceable.\n\nBusiness leaders urged the Trump administration to move forward with the next round of talks as soon as possible.\n\nWe hope this deal will usher in a new era of trust between both countries and pave the way for Phase 2 negotiations to begin in a timely manner, said US Chamber of Commerce CEO Thomas Donohue.\n\nThis story has been updated with more reaction and more details from the agreement.
Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPete Buttigieg hit Bernie Sanders on Tuesday for not supporting ending the filibuster, a Senate rule that if ended would allow bills to be passed with only a simple majority.\n\nButtigieg has used nearly every answer on the debate stage to target Sanders, the race's front-runner and a candidate who the former mayor has said could have an insurmountable lead in early March.\n\nI want to come back to the question of the filibuster because this is not some long-ago bad vote that Bernie Sanders took, this is a current bad position that Bernie Sanders holds, Buttigieg said.\n\nThen he delivered a direct line: How are we going to deliver a revolution if you won't even support a rule change?\n\nSanders has said he supports filibuster reform, but does not support getting rid of the rule.\n\nWe are in the state where Strom Thurmond used the filibuster to block civil rights legislation repeatedly, Buttigieg said, referring to a late United States senator and segregationist from South Carolina. No less a Senate traditional figure than Harry Reid has called for it to go. It has got to go, because otherwise Washington will not deliver.
(CNN) A growing number of Republicans are balking at efforts to reject the Electoral College votes and join President Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the results of the November election ahead of Wednesday's joint session, where conservatives are expecting votes on objections to at least three states won by President-elect Joe Biden .\n\nMultiple Senate Republicans announced Tuesday they would vote to certify the results of the November election, breaking with their GOP colleagues and Trump, who has accused Republicans of being part of the surrender caucus for not supporting his effort to overturn the will of the voters against him. And House Republicans held a lengthy internal debate Tuesday about the merits of trying to overturn the election results, something that's split top House Republican leaders. Several Republicans dismissed Trump's claims Tuesday that Vice President Mike Pence could intervene to overturn the election on the floor.\n\nBipartisan opposition will be clear at the onset of Wednesday's debate, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell expected to kick off the floor fight after he's privately voiced serious reservations and concerns about the conservative effort to overturn the election results at Trump's behest, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe GOP leader's comments will occur after Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz objects to Arizona's Electoral College results during the joint session of Congress on Wednesday, a move that will force the first of multiple expected -- and futile -- votes in the House and the Senate to overturn the results.\n\nWe're doing three but we are hoping for six, said Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, who is leading the charge on the House. He added they are still having lots of conversations with senators.\n\nThe objections on Wednesday during the formal count of electoral votes from all 50 states and the District of Columbia will not change the results of the election. Every Democrat and some Republicans will reject the challenges in both chambers, including McConnell.\n\nBut the ranks of Republicans who are rejecting the objections underscores the deep uneasiness many have with Trump's efforts to overturn the election results and his embrace of baseless conspiracy theories that the election was stolen from him.\n\nSens. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Tim Scott of South Carolina all said on Tuesday they would vote against the GOP objections to the results, while Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas published an op-ed explaining why he also was siding against the objectors, after Trump called him out in a tweet.\n\nTo challenge a state's certification, given how specific the Constitution is, would be a violation of my oath of office — that is not something I am willing to do and is not something Oklahomans would want me to do, Inhofe said in a statement.\n\nThe objections will extend the normally ceremonial process of counting Electoral College votes into Wednesday evening and possibly beyond. For each state where a House member and senator object, the two chambers will separately recess and debate the matter for up to two hours, followed by a vote on whether to accept or reject the objection.\n\nThe exact number of objections that will be raised is still unclear. Cruz and a group of GOP senators held a conference call Monday night with several House members to map out a strategy, though no final decisions were made, according to a source involved in the call. And House Republicans held a lengthy internal debate Tuesday about the merits of trying to overturn the election results.\n\nThe states' Electoral College votes are counted in alphabetical order, so Cruz's objection to Arizona is likely to be the first debated.\n\nCruz and nearly a dozen Senate Republicans said this past weekend they planned to object to the Electoral College results unless a commission was appointed to investigate voter fraud. A person familiar with Cruz's plans argued the objection was not as much about Cruz questioning the election results as it was a reaction to the fact that he has not received the commission to study election results that he and his group of 10 other senators requested.\n\nThe objections have sparked a public split in the Republican conference, with those siding with McConnell arguing the effort has no chance of succeeding and is dangerous for democracy. Some of Trump's allies on the other side are vowing to primary those Republicans who vote against him on Wednesday.\n\nTrump has focused on Wednesday's congressional session to try to overturn the November election after courts across the country rejected his campaign's lawsuits challenging the results, and state legislatures in battleground states declined to try to appoint electors that went against the will of the voters in their states.\n\nTrump has also pushed Vice President Mike Pence, falsely claiming on Twitter on Tuesday that Pence could has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors.\n\nThere is no evidence of widespread voter fraud, and there is no evidence that electors from the electoral college were fraudulently chosen, as all states have certified their elections. Pence's role on Wednesday in certifying the results of the election is largely ceremonial.\n\nThere's no indication Pence plans to do so. But even if the vice president tried to take an unprecedented and legally dubious action to reject the will of voters and select a different slate of electors, such a move would almost certainly be rejected by both chambers of Congress. The chambers could respond by voting to appeal the ruling of the chair , according to Alan Frumin, a former Senate parliamentarian.\n\nIn a sign that Pence is preparing for his role overseeing the quadrennial session to count the ballots, he was spotted in his office off the Senate floor Sunday meeting with aides and Elizabeth MacDonough, the current Senate parliamentarian.\n\nSeveral influential House Republicans dismissed Trump's notion that Pence could reject states' electors.\n\nI don't know how Pence will be able to do anything, said Rep. Rodney Davis, the top Republican on the House Administration Committee, who will play a key role Wednesday as a teller to read and tally the votes. He's just the presiding officer.\n\nHouse GOP debates objections internally\n\nIn the House, Republicans engaged in a debate for more than an hour Tuesday morning over whether to mount an objection on the House floor to overturn the election results, according to multiple members.\n\nThe top three leaders -- Kevin McCarthy, Steve Scalise and Liz Cheney -- stayed out of the debate and let the conference argue over their differences.\n\nThe debate was kicked off by Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy, who argued that the results should not be overturned and that doing so would exceed Congress' authority. But Louisiana Republican Rep. Mike Johnson argued the opposite side.\n\nPeople felt for strong constitutional reasons on both sides of the issue, said Rep. Tom Cole, a Republican from Oklahoma and top Republican on the Rules Committee. The leaders really wanted to let the members talk. It was actually a therapeutic exercise for the conference.\n\nCole added: I think members are still struggling.\n\nAfterward, Scalise suggested to CNN he was sympathetic to the concerns of the objectors.\n\nWe had a really good discussion about it earlier today, Scalise said when asked if he was supportive. Clearly members expressed views on both sides but there have been very valid questions raised for months now about states that went around their own constitutions and their legislatures. And the US Constitution makes it very clear it's the legislatures who set the rules for choosing electors, and in a number of states that didn't happen. And that's been brought out. And I think there's a lot of discussion.\n\nWhile Republicans have raised concerns about voting rules that were put in place in response to the Covid-19 pandemic in states like Pennsylvania, those issues were litigated before the election, and the courts have rejected efforts to disenfranchise voters after the election.\n\nOn the Democratic side, lawmakers from the various states that could see objections huddled in their delegations to discuss how to rebut the GOP allegations, and they plan to speak in defense of their states' elections when objections are mounted.\n\nLet me say our main message is that the Constitution is clear. The results of the election are clear. The conclusion of courts of the land is clear, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters Tuesday. And I expect, without a doubt, that the report of the Electoral College and the 306 electoral votes that Mr. Biden got will be confirmed at the end of this process.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.

(GREG BAKER/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nChange is coming to men's restrooms in New York – and it's going to be a big help to fathers all over the state.\n\nA new law requires all new or renovated buildings in New York that have bathrooms used by the public to make changing tables available to both men and women.\n\nThe rule, which passed in April 2018 but didn't go into effect until the new year, applies to restaurants, stores and movie theaters as well as state facilities such as parks and offices of the Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nAt least one changing table must be available to both genders on each floor of a building that is accessed by the public, according to the law. The legislation also states that building managers should post clear signs showing the location of the nearest available changing table.\n\nThere was no previous state law that required changing tables in bathrooms used by the public, according to a statement from the office of Gov. Andrew Cuomo when the legislation passed.\n\nParents and caregivers of young children often struggle to find a safe, sanitary place to change their child's diaper, the statement said. In addition, when changing tables are available, they are disproportionately available in only women's restrooms.\n\nState Sen. Brad Hoylman, who wrote the legislation, said in a statement, It's not just moms who change diapers. Dads need to step up and do their part of the dirty work, too.\n\nHoylman is one of the fathers who took to social media to document the difficulty men face when changing their children's diapers.\n\nGay dads like my husband & me may never have to change diapers on a bathroom floor👇🏻👇🏻again! @NYGovCuomo budget mirrors my legislation (S574) requiring new buildings to have baby changing tables in public restrooms for both women & men. #pottyparity pic.twitter.com/blQPy34OOw — Brad Hoylman (@bradhoylman) January 23, 2018\n\nHoylman, who is gay, also said in the statement the new law is a step in recognizing new parental norms, including a new generation of gay dads like me who no longer should have to change their babies on the bathroom floor because there's no changing station in the men's restroom.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, fathers are much more involved in child care than they were 50 years ago. Data analysis of American Time Use Survey from 2016 shows fathers reported spending about eight hours a week on child care – triple the time they reported in 1965.\n\nLast year, a Florida father went viral after sharing photos of himself squatting on the restroom floor of a steakhouse while changing his son's diaper.\n\nWhat's the deal with not having changing tables in men's bathroom as if we don't exist!!, Donte Palmer wrote on Instagram. He used the hashtag #SquatForChange, which has become a social media campaign raising awareness about the lack of changing tables in men's restrooms.\n\nIn 2016, President Barack Obama signed a Bathrooms Accessible in Every Situation Act, or the BABIES Act, which requires diaper-changing tables in all restrooms in public federal buildings, such as courthouses and post offices.\n\nAccording to the BABIES Act, if a bathroom doesn't have a changing table, hallway signs must direct parents to the nearest facilities.\n\nCNN's Isabelle Chapman contributed in this report.

Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984 Walter Mondale throws down gauntlet in run against Reagan My fellow Democrats, my fellow Americans: I accept your nomination. Behind us now is the most wide open race in political history. It was noisy - but our voices were heard. It was long - but our stamina was tested. It was hot - but the heat was passion, and not anger. It was a roller coaster - but it made me a better candidate, and it will make me a stronger president of the United States. I do not envy the drowsy harmony of the Republican Party. They squelch debate; we welcome it. They deny differences; we bridge them. The are uniform; we are united. They are a portrait of privilege; we are a mirror of America. Just look at us at here tonight: Black and white, Asian and Hispanic, Native and immigrant, young and old, urban and rural, male and female - from yuppie to lunchpail, from sea to shining sea. We're all here tonight in this convention speaking for America. And when we in this hall speak for America, it is America speaking. When we speak of family, the voice is Mario Cuomo's. When we speak of change, the words are Gary Hart's. When we speak of hope, the fire is Jesse Jackson's. When we speak of caring, the spirit is Ted Kennedy's. When we speak of patriotism, the strength is John Glenn's. When we speak of the future, the message is Geraldine Ferraro. And now we leave San Francisco - together. Future of America And over the next hundred days, in every word we say, and every life we touch, we will be fighting for the future of America. Joan and I are parents of three wonderful children who will live much of their lives in the twenty-first century. This election is a referendum on their future - and on ours. So tonight I'd like to speak to the young people of America - and to their parents and to their grandparents. I'm Walter Mondale. You may have heard of me - but you may not really know me. I grew up in the farm towns of southern Minnesota. My dad was a preacher, and my mom was a music teacher. We never had a dime. But we were rich in the values that were important; and I've carried those values with me ever since. They taught me to work hard; to stand on my own; to play by the rules; to tell the truth; to obey the law; to care for others; to love our country; to cherish our faith. My story isn't unique. In the last few weeks, I've deepened my admiration for someone who shares those same values. Her immigrant father loved our country. Her widowed mother sacrificed for her family. And her own career is an American classic: Doing your work. Earning your way. Paying your dues. Rising on merit. My presidency will be about those values. My vice president will be Geraldine Ferraro. Tonight, we open a new door to the future. Mr. Reagan calls it tokenism. We call it America. Ever since I graduated from Elmore High, I've been a Democrat. I was attorney general of my state; then a U.S. senator. Then, an honest, caring man - Jimmy Carter - picked me as his running mate and in 1976 I was elected vice president. And in 1980, Ronald Reagan beat the pants off us. So tonight, I want to say something to those of you across our country who voted for Mr. Reagan - Republicans, Independents, and yes, some Democrats: I heard you. And our party heard you. After we lost we didn't tell the American people that they were wrong. Instead, we began asking you what our mistakes had been. And for four years, I listened to all of the people of our country. I traveled everywhere. It seemed like I had visited every acre of America. It wasn't easy. I remember late one night, as I headed from a speech in one city to a hotel a thousand miles away, someone said to me, Fritz, I saw you on TV. Are those bags under your eyes natural? And I said, No, I got them the old-fashioned way. I earned them. To the thousands of Americans who welcomed me into your homes and into your businesses, your churches and synagogues: I thank you. You confirmed my belief in our country's values. And you helped me learn and grow. New Realism So, tonight we come to you with a new realism: Ready for the future, and recapturing the best in our tradition. We know that America must have a strong defense, and a sober view of the Soviets. We know that government must be as well-managed as it is well-meaning. We know that a healthy, growing private economy is the key to the future. We know that Harry Truman spoke the truth when he said: A President . . . has to be able to say yes and no, but mostly no. Look at our platform. There are no defense cuts that weaken our security; no business taxes that weaken our economy; no laundry lists that raid our Treasury. We are wiser, stronger, and focused on the future. If Mr. Reagan wants to re-run the 1980 campaign: Fine. Let them fight over the past. We're fighting for the American future - and that's why we're going to win this campaign. One last word to those who voted for Mr. Reagan. I know what you were saying. But I also know what you were not saying. You did not vote for a $200 billion deficit. You did not vote for an arms race. You did not vote to turn the heavens into a battleground. You did not vote to savage Social Security and Medicare. You did not vote to destroy family farming. You did not vote to trash the civil rights laws. You did not vote to poison the environment. You did not vote to assault the poor, the sick, and the disabled. And you did not vote to pay fifty bucks for a fifty-cent light bulb. Four years ago, many of you voted for Mr. Reagan because he promised you'd be better off. And today, the rich are better off. But working Americans are worse off, and the middle class is standing on a trap door. Lincoln once said that ours is to be a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. What we have today is a government of the rich, by the rich, and for the rich. And we're going to make a change in November. Look at the record. Reagan Record First, there was Mr. Reagan's tax program. What happened was, he gave each of his rich friends enough tax relief to buy a Rolls Royce - and then he asked your family to pay for the hub caps. Then they looked the other way at the rip-offs, soaring utility bills, phone bills, medical bills. Then they crimped our future. They let us be routed in international competition, and now the help-wanted ads are full of listings for executives, and for dishwashers - but not much in between. Then they socked it to workers. They encouraged executives to vote themselves huge bonuses - while using King Kong tactics to make workers take Hong Kong wages. Mr. Reagan believes that the genius of America is in the boardrooms and exclusive country clubs. I believe that the greatness can be found in the men and women who built our nation; do its work; and defend our freedom. Truth About The Future If this administration has a plan for a better future, they're keeping it a secret. Here is the truth about the future: We are living on borrowed money and borrowed time. These deficits hike interest rates, clobber exports, stunt investment, kill jobs, undermine growth, cheat our kids, and shrink our future. Whoever is inaugurated in January, the American people will have to pay Mr. Reagan's bills. The budget will be squeezed. Taxes will go up. And anyone who says they won't is not telling the truth to the American people. I mean business. By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two-thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did. There's another difference. When he raises taxes, it won't be done fairly. He will sock it to average-income families again, and leave his rich friends alone. And I won't stand for it. And neither will you and neither will the American people. To the corporations and freeloaders who play the loopholes or pay no taxes, my message is: Your free ride is over. To the Congress, my message is: We must cut spending and pay as we go. If you don't hold the line, I will: That's what the veto is for. Now that's my plan to cut the deficit. Mr. Reagan is keeping his plan secret until after the election. That's not leadership; that's salesmanship. And I think the American people know the difference. I challenge tonight, I challenge Mr. Reagan to put his plan on the table next to mine - and then let's debate it on national television before the American people. Americans want the truth about the future - not after the election. When the American economy leads the world, the jobs are here, the prosperity is here for our children. But that's not what's happening today. This is the worst trade year in American history. Three million of our best jobs have gone overseas. Mr. Reagan has done nothing about it. They have no plan to get our competitive edge back. But we do. We will cut the deficits, reduce interest rates, make our exports affordable, and make America number one again in the world economy. We will launch a renaissance in education, in science, and learning. A mind is a terrible thing to waste. And this must be the best-educated, best-trained generation in American history. And I will lead our nation forward to the best system that this nation has ever seen. We must do it, we must do it. It is time for America to have a season of excellence. Parents must turn off that television; students must do their homework; teachers must teach; and America compete. We'll be number one if we follow those rules; let's get with it in America again. To big companies that send our jobs overseas, my message is: We need those jobs here at home. And our country won't help your business - unless your business helps our country. To countries that close their markets to us, my message is: We will not be pushed around any more. We will have a president who stands up for American workers and American businesses and American farmers in international trade. When I grew up, and people asked us to imagine the future we were full of dreams. But a few months ago, when I visited a grade school class in Texas and asked the children to imagine the future, they talked to me about nuclear war. As we've neared the election, this administration has begun to talk about a safer world. But there's a big difference: As president, I will work for peace from my first day in office - and not from my first day campaigning for re-election. As president, I will reassert American values. I'll press for human rights in Central America, and for the removal of all foreign forces from the region. And in my first hundred days, I will stop the illegal war in Nicaragua. We know the deep differences with the Soviets. And America condemns their repression of dissidents and Jews; their suppression of Solidarity; their invasion of Afghanistan; their meddling around the world. But the truth is that between us, we have the capacity to destroy the planet. Every president since the bomb went off understood that and talked with the Soviets and negotiated arms control. Why has this administration failed? Why haven't they tried? Why can't they understand the cry of Americans and human beings for sense and sanity in control of these God awful weapons? Why, why? Why can't we meet in summit conferences with the Soviet Union at least once a year? Why can't we reach agreements to save this earth? The truth is, we can. President Kennedy was right when he said: We must never negotiate out of fear. But we must never fear to negotiate. For the sake of civilization we must negotiate a mutual, verifiable nuclear freeze before those weapons destroy us all. A Second Mondale Term The second term of the Mondale-Ferraro Administration will begin in 1989. By the start of the next decade, I want to ask our children their dreams, and hear not one word about nuclear nightmares. By the start of the next decade, I want to walk into any classroom in America and hear some of the brightest students say, I want to be a teacher. By the start of the next decade, I want to walk into any public health clinic in America and hear the doctor say, We haven't seen a hungry child this year. By the start of the next decade, I want to walk into any store in America and pick up the best product, of the best quality, at the best price; and turn it over; and read, Made in the U.S.A. By the start of the next decade, I want to meet with the most successful business leaders anywhere in America, and see as many minorities and women in that room as I see here in this room tonight. By the start of the next decade, I want to point to the Supreme Court and say, Justice is in good hands. Before the start of the next decade, I want to go to my second Inaugural, and raise my right hand, and swear to preserve, protect, and defend a Constitution that includes the Equal Rights Amendment. My friends, America is a future each generation must enlarge; a door each generation must open; a promise each generation must keep. For the rest of my life, I want to talk to young people about their future. And whatever their race, whatever their religion, whatever their sex, I want to hear some of them say what I say - with joy and reverence - tonight: I want to be president of the United States. Thank you very much. (This is the Associated Press text of former Vice President Walter F.

That's not the right way,' Serena recalled of those early days in Compton.\n\nWe were definitely able to revolutionize a lot of things in the game.

It is a major reason for her recent absence from grand slam finals, with her last being in 2009 at Wimbledon.\n\nSerena has predicted Saturday's match, their ninth grand slam final battle but first for almost eight years, will be uncomfortable, but the six-time Melbourne champion is relaxed whatever the outcome.\n\nAfter everything that Venus has been through with her illness and stuff, I just can't help but feel like it's a win-win situation for me, she explained.\n\nI was there for the whole time. We lived together. I know what she went through.\n\nIt's the one time that I really genuinely feel like no matter what happens, I can't lose, she can't lose. It's going to be a great situation.\n\nPHOTO: Sean Garnsworthy/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images Serena Williams won her first Australian Open title by beating sister Venus in the final in 2003.\n\n'I can compete against the odds'\n\nThe sisters – owners of 29 major singles titles between them, plus 14 together in doubles – have been the dominant forces in women's tennis for almost two decades and, in this tournament, have been as commanding as they once were in the early part of this century.\n\nSerena has returned to form after an extended break at the end of last year.\n\nShe has not dropped a set in Melbourne and, having dominated her rivalry with Venus – Serena holds a 16-11 record and has won six of their past seven grand slam finals – the world No. 2 is favorite to triumph for a seventh time Down Under.\n\nWho will triumph? Have your say on our Facebook page\n\nWhen I'm playing on the court with her, I think I'm playing the best competitor in the game, said Venus, who lost to Serena in her only other Australian Open final in 2003.\n\nI don't think I'm chump change, either. I can compete against any odds. No matter what, I get out there and I compete.\n\nVisit cnn.com/tennis for more news and videos\n\nI know that it won't be easy.

(CNN) After a US patient contracted novel coronavirus and left medical authorities no clues as to where it came from, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has begun sending out new testing guidance to health care workers, the top CDC official said Thursday.\n\nA patient in California who has cornonavirus didn't travel anywhere known to have the virus, the CDC announced Wednesday night. And the patient wasn't exposed to anyone known to be infected.\n\nThe patient is in serious condition, Rep. John Garamendi, who represents the district in California where the patient is from, told CNN's OutFront with Erin Burnett.\n\nWhether this person can actually talk or not is of question. She's been intubated, and so may not be in a position to discuss it, he said.\n\nEarlier in the outbreak, CDC guidance to doctors in the United States was that a patient had to have a travel history to China or be a close contact of someone who had been there before being tested, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said.\n\nThe new patient who prompted the guidance change was transferred from another Northern California hospital last week.\n\nAccording to a letter from UC Davis Health, the patient did not fit the existing CDC criteria for Covid-19, a test was not immediately administered. After doctors persisted in their request for the test, on Sunday, CDC went ahead with testing.\n\nThat patient became the first US case of unknown origin, according to the CDC. It could be the first US case of community spread of the virus, when the source of the infection is unknown.\n\nAs soon as that case was recognized, we met and we revised our case definition for persons under investigation, Redfield said. Today, that has been posted (to the CDC website) along with a new health advisory that the recommendation should be when a clinician or individual suspects coronavirus, then we should be able to get a test for coronavirus.\n\nThe mysterious nature of this case is significant, said Dr. Dean Blumberg, an infectious disease specialist at UC Davis Medical Center.\n\nThat suggests that the virus is out there in the community, and that means pretty much that everybody's at risk, he told CNN affiliate KCRA . We don't know who might be carrying it. We don't know who we can get it from.\n\nAs for whoever passed the virus to the UC Davis patient, that other person probably exposed other people, Blumberg said.\n\nAnd you have to realize that this virus is so new, that none of us have any immunity to it. So, anybody who's exposed is at high risk of getting infected with this.\n\nHealth officials are now trying to trace those who may have been in contact with the UC Davis patient.\n\nWe currently have people in the field working in the community from the local, from the state and also from the CDC, said Dr. Sonia Angell, director of the California Department of Public Health.\n\nThey're contacting any individuals who might have been exposed, and they're isolating them.\n\nBut Angell emphasized the risk to the general public remains low.\n\nThe United States has 60 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said.\n\n42 are former passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the site of a recent outbreak and quarantine.\n\n3 are Americans recently repatriated from Wuhan, China, the center of the outbreak.\n\n1 patient at UC Davis Medical Center contracted the illness through unknown means.\n\nMost of the other 14 patients either had recently been to China or are a spouse of someone who recently returned from China.\n\n'Simply inadequate' number of test kits so far\n\nThere's been a strain on testing capabilities since novel coronavirus was first detected in the United States last month.\n\nIn the early weeks of the virus, the CDC was the only facility in the United States that could test for the virus.\n\nSince then, coronavirus test kits have been shipped to labs across the country, but some produced inconclusive results . The CDC said it would remake parts of the test kits.\n\nThe UC Davis patient was transferred from another California hospital February 19 with a suspected viral infection, the university hospital's letter said.\n\nUC Davis said it requested CDC testing for Covid-19, the formal name of the virus, because neither Sacramento County nor the California Department of Public Health were conducting testing.\n\nSince the patient did not fit the existing CDC criteria for Covid-19, a test was not immediately administered, the letter says. UC Davis Health does not control the testing process.\n\nThe patient is from Solano County, which declared a local emergency Thursday, allowing it to use funds for response efforts.\n\nMultiple health care personnel were exposed to the patient, Solano County Health and Social Services public health officer Dr. Bela Matyas said.\n\nSince the patient didn't meet the criteria for testing, the patient was not in airborne isolation initially, Matyas said.\n\nHospitals are trying to identify the people who were exposed to the patient to put them into appropriate categories -- whether they need to be under isolation or under quarantine, he added.\n\nSome of the patient's family members are in isolation, he said. The person has no connection to Travis Air Force Base, which is in the county and has seen several repatriation flights from China.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said at least 8,400 people have been monitored locally, but the number of test kits his state has received isn't enough.\n\nWe have just 200 kits, and that's for not just the traditional diagnostic, but also surveillance. It's simply inadequate, Newsom said Thursday. But no longer will that be the case. ... We have been assured of our capacity to significantly, exponentially increase the capacity to test.\n\nBy this weekend, 93 labs across the United States are expected to have testing capabilities, Azar said. And as many as 70 companies are vying to develop a bedside diagnostic test for hospital use.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration has authorized a two-step test that will allow labs other than the CDC to test for the virus, Azar said.\n\nPreviously, the process for testing involved three steps. The third step had been causing some inconclusive results, Azar said.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, the FDA authorized the use of those tests by using just the first and second step (to) provide a definitive diagnostic, Azar said. Forty labs are qualified to already be doing that.\n\nUS is testing treatment\n\nMeanwhile, a clinical trial is underway at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha to evaluate how effective an antiviral drug would be on people diagnosed with coronavirus, the National Institutes of Health said.\n\nThere have been at least 82,056 confirmed cases worldwide and at least 2,800 deaths -- the vast majority in China.\n\nThe drug being tested in the trial, remdesivir, was previously tested in humans for Ebola, but studies found it was ineffective in fighting that disease. It was also tested in MERS and SARS trials in animals.\n\nThere are also clinical trials of the drug going on in China, the NIH said, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases developed the American study to match those studies.\n\nThe first participant in the Omaha trial is an American who was evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.\n\nParticipants will receive 200 milligrams of remdesivir intravenously when they're enrolled and another 100 while they're hospitalized for up to 10 days in total. A placebo group will receive a solution that resembles remdesivir but contains only inactive ingredients, the NIH said.
(CNN) The final vote to acquit President Donald Trump in his impeachment trial may be delayed until next week, according to Republican and Democratic sources.\n\nAt this point, it seems unlikely that a final vote to acquit Trump will occur Friday night, but definitive details of the Senate trial's timing remain extremely fluid.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, is considering offering a resolution that would structure the final stages of the trial, which could include a final vote as late as Wednesday. This could change because a source familiar says the White House is pushing for a final vote Tuesday -- the same day as Trump's State of the Union address.\n\nAsked when the final vote would be, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Democrat in the chamber, said: Wednesday of next week. That's what McConnell is proposing.\n\nRead More
STR/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nJohn Bolton is now assessing his options with regards to his forthcoming book, a source with knowledge of discussions over the book say.\n\nBolton's book, The Room Where It Happened, was announced on Sunday night and listed with a March 17 release date.\n\nResponding to criticism of his public silence during the impeachment probe, the source says Bolton submitted to the White House out of an abundance of caution and tried to follow the process.\n\nHe was trying to do what he felt was the right thing and give the White House time to do a review, the source adds.\n\nBut that process has been breached, the source says, referring to the details in Sunday night's New York Times story. So he is assessing his options.\n\nWhat happens next: Bolton is trying to decide what he wants to do — whether to speak out in some form, through Twitter or some other medium. While there have been no discussions about a TV interview, the source says, it is not out of the question either. Bolton has repeatedly said that he will testify if subpoenaed.\n\nThe publisher, Simon & Schuster, needs time to finish the production of the book and print physical copies. The publisher is currently planning on the March 17 date. But the book could theoretically be released sometime before March 17, at least in digital form, if the parties involved wanted it out sooner.\n\nThe book currently ranks in the top 100 on Amazon's best selling books chart, and at around midday on Monday it was at No. 55.
(CNN) As President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take over from the outgoing Trump administration, the goal for the families of Americans unlawfully detained and held hostage abroad remains the same: to see their loved ones returned home.\n\nWhile some are holding out hope that progress could be made in the final three weeks of Donald Trump's presidency, the families are also now looking to the incoming administration to keep up the efforts to secure their relatives' freedom. The Biden team has pledged to work tirelessly to reunite the families.\n\nAccording to the Foley Foundation , there are at least 42 publicly known hostage or detainee cases in 11 countries, including Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Venezuela, Russia, and even apparent allies such as Saudi Arabia.\n\nFor the families of these individuals, each day brings more anguish and concern. Some have been separated for years, missing birthdays and holidays, the birth of grandchildren and other key milestones.\n\n'An empty chair'\n\nPresident-elect Biden, during the debates, you know, many times he mentioned about families that have empty chairs because they're missing loved ones, and we're missing our loved one, said Ibrahim Kamalmaz, the son of Majd Kamalmaz, a humanitarian worker who disappeared in Syria in 2017.\n\nWe have an empty chair for my father, and now we're coming up on four years of that empty chair. And hopefully, knowing that President-elect Biden cares about families, we hope that he will care about the families of the detainees and proactively and aggressively try to bring them home, he said.\n\nHis sister, Maryam Kamalmaz, told CNN that they still have hope that the Trump administration will be productive up until their last day, but we're hoping that the Biden administration will be able to pick up exactly where the Trump administration left off.\n\nMarc and Debra Tice, the parents of journalist Austin Tice, who went missing in Syria in 2012, told CNN that their request of the US government remains the same regardless of who is in charge.\n\nOur plea is simple: We ask the governments of the Syrian Arab Republic and the United States to make every possible diplomatic effort to bring Austin safely home, they said.\n\nSome of the efforts by the Trump administration to free Americans have been reported publicly. Two senior administration officials engaged in rare direct talks in Damascus as part of an effort to secure the release of Americans like Tice and Kamalmaz who are believed to be held by the Assad regime.\n\n'I know it's taking its toll on him'\n\nIn Russia, US Ambassador John Sullivan acknowledged to the BBC that there were discussions underway with the Russian government regarding US citizens there.\n\nI have no higher priority in what's left of the Trump administration than to advocate for Paul (Whelan) and to do all we possibly can to get him released, Sullivan said last week, but noted that we also need a willing interlocutor to engage in discussions of what would be remotely possible and acceptable, something that an American president could agree to.\n\nWhelan has been detained in Russia for more than two years, sentenced to 16 years in prison by a Moscow court in June of this year on espionage charges. Another American, Trevor Reed , has been held for more than 500 days in Russia. He was sentenced to nine years in July for for endangering life and health of Russian police officers in an altercation, per Russia's state-run news agency TASS.\n\nHis mother, Paula Reed, said that she's been told the ball is in Russia's court with regard to Trevor's release. In the meantime, she's worried about her son's wellbeing, telling CNN that she can already hear a change in his personality during their phone calls.\n\nHe's not the happy-go-lucky kind of guy, even though he always makes it a point to tell me that he's fine and not to worry about him, I can just, I know it's taking its toll on him, she said.\n\nElizabeth Whelan told CNN that she too is worried about her brother's continued imprisonment.\n\nWe want to give the Trump administration every opportunity to come up with something, to work something out with the Russian authorities before the end of President Trump's term, but that's approaching pretty quickly, she said, noting that the apparent lack of movement on the case is extremely worrying.\n\nEvery day that goes by is another day of Paul's life that he's spending in a Russian prison for no fault of his own, she said.\n\n'Extremely hard to resolve'\n\nPeter Bergen, a vice president at New America and CNN national security analyst, noted the complexity of some of the cases, like that of Tice, are extremely hard to resolve regardless of the administration because of other complicating factors like broader policy considerations. There are other foreign policy issues that may be bigger than the question of hostage releases, Bergen said.\n\nHowever, Bergen noted that there's kind of a long and honorable tradition in America, around issues about hostages and kind of counterterrorism in general, where there's a lot of agreement between the Republicans and the Democrats about what to do and who should do it.\n\nBergen also told CNN, the way that the government deals with the hostage families is markedly better than it was at the midpoint of the Obama administration, when President Barack Obama faced heavy criticism for the handling of the cases of journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and humanitarian workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig. All four were detained and murdered by ISIS in Syria, and their deaths led to a 2015 review of US hostage policy.\n\nDiane Foley, the mother of James Foley , and Sarah Moriarty, the daughter of Robert Levinson , a former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran more than a decade ago, called on the Biden administration to make the return of Americans taken hostage abroad a top priority, both in words and swift action in an opinion piece in The Hill last week.\n\nMr. Biden knows us. He and all of America felt the horror with us when journalist James Foley was kidnapped, brutally tortured and murdered by ISIS, and when Bob Levinson was taken hostage by the Iranian regime and imprisoned, with no contact with the outside world for 13 long years, they wrote.\n\nOur families know President-elect Biden's compassion from his time in Congress and as vice president, they continued. But we also believe he and the American public will agree that more could have been done to have brought Jim, Bob and too many others home alive. So much more work remains.\n\nThe two said it was essential to ensure continuity where possible, including a joint review with the outgoing administration of all active cases of Americans held hostage and wrongfully detained abroad in order to ensure that no momentum or information is lost.\n\nTheir piece laid out a series of requests, including the swift appointment of the special envoy for hostage affairs, the National Security Council's Senior Director for Counterterrorism, and the Director of the Hostage Recovery Fusion cell, and that any deals made with foreign entities put the recovery of Americans front and center, not as an afterthought.\n\nFoley Foundation executive director Margaux Ewen told CNN that they are slated to meet with incoming national security adviser Jake Sullivan next week.\n\n'We will work tirelessly'\n\nMany of the families who spoke to CNN expressed optimism about the continuity of the efforts to free their loved ones.\n\nGabriela Zambrano Hill's father and uncle are among the CITGO 6, the six US executives who have been jailed in Venezuela for more than three years.\n\nShe said she's been told that the biggest goal here is to maintain as much momentum as possible and keep it going throughout the transition and that that plan seems to be working and that there's promising signs that the new incoming team places as much value on my family's freedom as the current administration has.\n\nTransition spokesperson Ned Price told CNN that the Biden-Harris administration will have no higher priority than the safety and security of Americans — both at home and around the world.\n\nWe will work tirelessly to reunite Americans held unjustly against their will with their families and other loved ones, Price said.\n\nMany of the officials who work on the hostage and detainee cases are career government workers, but some -- like the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs (SPEHA) -- are political appointees.\n\nThe families who spoke to CNN praised the current special envoy, Roger Carstens, with some saying that they would like to see him stay on in the role after Biden takes office, at least in an interim capacity. A source close to Carstens indicated he would be willing to stay on.\n\nOur goal has and will always be to support the families of US hostages and wrongful detainees with every available resource and tool, Carstens said.
New York (CNN Business) Thousands of stocks trade on Wall Street every day. But let's be honest: Just a half dozen companies really, truly matter for many investors.\n\nFollowing the addition ofto the S&P 500 last month, Elon Musk's electric car giant joins a quintet of tech stocks that dominate the blue chip index.\n\n, Google ownerand Tesla are now collectively worth more than $8.1 trillion, accounting for nearly 25% of the total $33.3 trillion market value of all the companies in the S&P 500\n\nGiven the popularity of passively managed index funds -- more than 70 million shares of thechange hands daily on average -- this means many investors that buy an S&P 500 fund for diversification purposes are really getting a highly concentrated tech sector fund.\n\nThat could be a problem for investors who want to minimize risk, especially since Tesla is far from being a mature and stable company.\n\nTesla just completed its fifth quarter of profitability, sells significantly less cars than its auto maker peers, and continues to actively access capital markets to fund operations, said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist with Ally Invest, in a report just before Tesla joined the S&P 500 last month.\n\nThis along with the stock's volatile nature will have implications for the broad index near-term, she added.\n\nBroader market gains influenced by small number of stocks\n\nSure, the exposure to top tech firms didn't hurt investors last year. The overall S&P 500 finished 2020 up 16% -- thanks to the fact that the index is market-cap weighted.\n\nBut tech stocks could come under increased pressure following the Georgia Senate races\n\nThe Nasdaq fell Wednesday morning as investors worried that the incoming Joe Biden administration and emboldened Democrats in Congress will enact tougher regulations on big tech companies and potentially pursue further antitrust reviews.\n\nS&P 500 RSP The strength of the S&P's Big Six also hides the fact that the rest of the market isn't doing nearly as well. If you weighted all the companies in the S&P 500 equally last year, therose just 10%. That's still respectable of course but not nearly as good as 16%, obviously.\n\nThis is a concern. Tesla is exacerbating the overweighting of tech stocks. They have driven the gains for the market inordinately, said George Calhoun, professor of quantitative finance at the Stevens Institute of Technology, in an interview with CNN Business.\n\nLast year, 200 of the S&P 500 companies finished 2020 in the red. So it was a much tougher year for the overall market than the headline numbers would indicate.\n\nSome veteran market experts worry that the frothy levels for stocks that are leading the market are unsustainable. We've seen this movie before. It won't end well.\n\nThe long, long bull market since 2009 has finally matured into a fully-fledged epic bubble, said Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of investment firm GMO, in a report this week.\n\nFeaturing extreme overvaluation, explosive price increases, frenzied issuance, and hysterically speculative investor behavior, I believe this event will be recorded as one of the great bubbles of financial history, Grantham added, comparing it to the crashes of 1929 and 2000.\n\nGM GM Grantham pointed out that good companies don't necessarily make for smart investments. He even noted that he owns a Model 3 but still thinks Tesla's stock is an example of a mania and really crazy investor behavior and that it is drastically overvalued when compared to rivals like\n\nHistory repeating itself may not be a problem?\n\nStill, some strategists argue that investors shouldn't be worried by the fact that the market is being led by such a small group of stocks.\n\nThis isn't unprecedented. The concentration in one sector is higher but it's been this high in the past, said Ryan Giannotto, director of research at GraniteShares, referring to times when oil stocks, industrial firms and banks dominated the S&P 500.\n\nJUST WATCHED Why tech stocks are soaring after Election Day Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Why tech stocks are soaring after Election Day 01:57\n\nIt all depends on where the earnings growth is and what's expected to happen with the economy, he told CNN Business.\n\nGiannotto even argued that it's a bad move for investors to hold equally sized positions in a larger number of stocks because that means they'd be stuck with more dogs in their portfolio and wouldn't benefit as much from the big gains of the best performers.\n\nAn equal weighted strategy is risky. The problem is you are buying more of the companies that are getting left behind instead of minimizing the laggards, he said.\n\nThat said, many of these losers could eventually become the market's new leaders -- which is all the more reason for investors to have a diversified portfolio instead of making bold, concentrated bets.\n\nI'm not predicting a crash but you can certainly make the case that there needs to be a rotation away from tech and back more towards value stocks that have underperformed, said Stevens Institute of Technology's Calhoun.
The CEO of Australian airline Qantas says he'll continue to publicly support same-sex marriage after he was attacked with a pie over the issue.\n\nMy opinion on this has not changed, Alan Joyce said in a statement Wednesday. We'll continue to speak about important social issues including indigenous reconciliation, gender diversity and marriage equality, because it's the right thing to do.\n\nA man rubbed a pie in Joyce's face at a business event on Tuesday morning just as the CEO began delivering a speech.\n\nRelated: Airline CEO attacked with cream pie\n\nThe assailant, Tony Overheu, has since spoken to Australian media, saying he wanted to make a statement about Joyce's support for same-sex marriage.\n\nThere's some really crude stuff going on here, and Joyce has been very much leading the issue, Overheu told 7News.\n\nIn March, Joyce and other top Australian CEOs sent a letter urging the government to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nNo attempt at bullying us into suppressing our voice will work, Joyce told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nRelated: Gay marriage in Australia unlikely for years\n\nQantas (QABSY) and other big companies, including Airbnb and eBay (EBAY), are backing the Until we all belong campaign, which launched last month in an effort to increase pressure on the Australian government over same-sex marriage.\n\nA push to change the law last year got stuck in a political quagmire in the Australian parliament.
The latest Pokémon mobile game launched on Tuesday with little fanfare.\n\nDescribed as a strategy board game, Pokémon Duel lets you fight teams of six Pokémon characters with players around the world. And it has big shoes to fill -- last year, Niantic's Pokémon Go broke App Store download records.\n\nBut it's likely Pokémon Duel won't have the same impact as Pokémon Go. While the latest app will appeal to fans of the franchise, Pokémon Go showed how mobile gaming can make you interact with the real world, thanks to augmented reality technology. Businesses promoted themselves as Pokémon hotspots, and a study from Microsoft found users were taking 26% more steps than usual.\n\nRelated: Pokemon Go could add 2.83 million years to users' lives\n\nAugmented reality headsets like Microsoft's HoloLens promise to change the way we interact with people and spaces, but Pokémon Go's use of the technology showed its potential being seamlessly integrated into our lives.\n\nMeanwhile, Pokémon Duel is just a standard smartphone game that's available for free on iOS and Android.

The adverse consequences of the shutdown are wide and growing.\n\nThe closure of key government agencies comes as American business owners are struggling to deal with the fallout of President Donald Trump's trade wars, as well as increased market volatility and growing economic uncertainty.\n\nTrump has said the shutdown could last for months – or years – and while it most immediately affects government workers and federal contractors who aren't getting paid, it has created severe challenges for businesses that depend on government data, licensing or other functions.\n\nFarmers, for example, would normally be looking to a monthly report on the supply and demand of agricultural products around the world to help determine what to plant next season. But the next report won't come out as scheduled on January 11 if the US Department of Agriculture remains unfunded.\n\nBusinesses that rely on monthly export and import data missed an update Tuesday because the Commerce Department isn't fully operating either. And US businesses that import steel and aluminum and are seeking an exclusion from Trump's tariffs may have to wait longer to hear if their application has been approved, because those applications are also handled by the Commerce Department.\n\nThe shutdown also poses challenges for industries that need approval from the federal agencies temporarily shuttered. Pending company mergers, for example, are being slowed because the Securities and Exchange Commission isn't fully staffed.\n\nBreweries trying out new craft beers are stuck, too, because the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which must sign off on all new labels and packaging, has been shut down.\n\nThe list of nuisances goes on. The Internal Revenue Service isn't staffed to take questions from employers that must send out W-2s to workers by the end of January, or businesses who have questions about changes under the new tax law.\n\nEmployers will also have to wait until the shutdown is over to use the online E-Verify system to confirm whether applicants have a legal right to work in the United States. It doesn't prevent someone from starting to work, but prolongs the on-boarding process – and opens up the risk that companies may have to let go of employees who don't later pass the check, even if they've already started working.\n\nTrump's efforts to overhaul the global trading system has already strained some business owners and farmers. He's said that he wants foreign countries to change their practices and treat Americans fairly, but despite what the President has often suggested, it's not China that's paying for the tariffs but US importers. The duties have raised the price of goods ranging from foreign steel and aluminum to Chinese-made semiconductors and luggage for American companies.\n\nSome businesses, like Missouri-based Cap America, have had to start paying a 10% tariff on a majority of their inventory because it comes from China. The company made most of their baseball caps in-house (and was appropriately named) until 2001, but it became cheaper to buy them from China. Now, about 89% of the caps sold in the United States comes from China. Cap America then embroiders them here.\n\nIn December, the company had to set prices for 2019 without knowing if there would be a 10% or 25% tariff on their imports. Trump had threatened to raise the tariff rate to 25% on January 1, but put off the hike while he and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day truce that ends in March.\n\nPhil Page, chairman and CEO of Cap America, said he doesn't expect to know how his price increase will affect demand until the end of the first quarter.\n\nIt's the uncertainty that causes the most stress in this situation, he said.\n\nRetaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries have closed off some markets to American farmers. China stopped buying American soybeans for about six months, though purchases restarted in December. Mexico put tariffs on American pork and Canada imposed duties on beef.\n\nA new trade deal struck between the United States, Mexico and Canada to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement has offered some reassurance to farmers that markets to the North and South would remain open to trade.\n\nBut even though Trump and his counterparts signed the deal in December, it must still be approved by Congress where leaders from the Democratically controlled House have voiced concerns about its labor and environmental provisions.\n\nLawmakers are expected to wait for an economic impact study before taking a vote, but it's unlike that will come before mid-March. It's being done by the US International Trade Commission, which has suspended investigative activities during the shutdown. Plus, Trump has threatened to withdraw from the original deal in the meantime, which could invite more tariffs on US goods and risk an economic shock.\n\nDespite the new trade deal, the retaliatory tariffs will remain in place while Trump keeps duties on foreign steel and aluminum. Many businesses and farmers have urged the administration to lift those taxes.\n\nIn the interim, the US Department of Agriculture has offered some financial aid to farmers hurt by the tariffs – but it's not processing new applications during the shutdown. The agency said Tuesday that it would extend the application deadline by the number of days the government remains shut down, but won't pay out money until Congress votes to reopen.\n\nUncertainty is a problem, said Brian Duncan, who grows corn and soybeans and raises hogs in Illinois. We deal with enough uncertainty, the weather, the wind, snow, you name it. When you add more layers of uncertainty, it makes business more difficult.\n\nCNN's Vanessa Yurkevich contributed to this report.
Back in February, food and consumer goods conglomerate Kraft Heinz walked away from plans to buy rival Unilever for more than $140 billion.\n\nBut that deal may still have life.\n\nOne analyst thinks the ketchup king, which is backed by billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and private equity powerhouse 3G Capital Partners, may make another -- and possibly hostile -- bid for Unilever (UL) as soon as next month.\n\nSure, it would cost Kraft Heinz (KHC) some more pounds and euros to buy the Anglo-Dutch Unilever (UN), now that shares of both classes of Unilever stock are up more than 20% since mid-February. Some estimates say it would take as much as $200 billion.\n\nYet it still might be worth it for Kraft Heinz to take another crack, according to Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Pablo Zuanic.\n\nIn a report earlier this week, Zuanic suggested an unsolicited bid for Unilever by Kraft Heinz is now more than 75% likely.\n\nBut what about Buffett? The Oracle of Omaha has famously been reluctant to make hostile mergers and acquisitions bids. He's not a Wall Street barbarian and he prefers friendly deals.\n\nThat's true. However, Buffett's partner in the Kraft Heinz venture, 3G, may see things differently. Berkshire and 3G first teamed up to buy Heinz in 2013 and then followed that deal by merging Heinz with Kraft in 2015.\n\nZuanic believes 3G has likely been urging Buffett behind the scenes to remain patient and wait for the right opportunity to go after Unilever again.\n\nEven though his preference may be to not go after hostile deals, remember that Buffett also supposedly wasn't a fan of airlines or tech stocks and now owns United (UAL), American (AAL), Southwest (LUV) and Delta (DAL). And Apple (AAPL) is one of his top holdings. People can change.\n\nAnd that time could come as soon as next month because of the way British takeover laws work.\n\nRelated: Is Kraft Heinz going to go on another shopping spree?\n\nUnilever, which is co-headquartered in the U.K., is subject to the British law that says six months must pass before a company can try to make another offer for a firm it previously tried to acquire.\n\nKraft Heinz and Unilever jointly announced on February 19 that Kraft Heinz agreed to amicably withdraw its bid. So that means Kraft Heinz could theoretically come knocking again on August 19.\n\nZuanic wrote that he thinks it's telling that Kraft Heinz has not yet moved to buy another food company in the past five months -- a possible sign that it still has its sights set on Unilever.\n\nThe companies didn't exactly close the door on an eventual deal after Kraft Heinz withdrew its bid, saying Unilever and Kraft Heinz hold each other in high regard and that Kraft Heinz has the utmost respect for the culture, strategy and leadership of Unilever.\n\nSo does that mean Kraft Heinz will eventually make another bid? Stay tuned. A spokesman for Kraft Heinz said the company had no comment on the Unilever speculation. Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) was not immediately available for comment.
Background: Time For A New Approach? Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the first federal poverty assistance law in 1935, called the Aid to Dependent Children Act, a little-noticed add-on to the Social Security law designed to aid poor Depression-era widows and their children. The act established what for the next sixty years became the core of federal welfare -- open-ended payments from the federal government to single mothers with dependent children. As the Depression lifted, caseloads remained low during the post-war years. Then in 1962, at John F. Kennedy's urging, Congress raised welfare payments, and renamed the program Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). Under the new law, states were permitted to require beneficiaries to do community work and attend training programs. Kennedy articulated what has since been a central goal of federal welfare policy: to end poverty, not just alleviate it. Welfare should be a hand up, not a hand out, in Kennedy's words. It wasn't until Lyndon B. Johnson's War On Poverty, beginning in 1965, that welfare spending began to take off. Eligibility requirements were broadened and benefits increased for AFDC and a bevy of federal programs designed to lower the 14 percent poverty rate. But some 27 years and $6 trillion later, the official poverty rate had notched up to 15.2 percent. More ominously, perhaps, out-of-wedlock births jumped from 5 percent (2 percent of white children, 19 percent of black children) in 1965 to its current level of 32 percent (23 percent of white children, 68 percent of black children). Such numbers fueled arguments that welfare was actually exacerbating America's poverty problems. Citing the emergence of an entrenched urban underclass, welfare critics stepped up their arguments during the 1980s that government poverty assistance was destroying personal initiative and self-responsibility, and breeding a dependent class, virtually trapping generations of families in welfare. And, some analysts warned welfare spending was rising at unsustainable levels. The conservative Heritage Foundation predicted that, left unchecked, combined federal and state welfare spending from 1996-2000 would total $2.38 trillion. Enter Clinton, Stage ... Wherever Democrats had long argued that the poor lacked adequate employment and education opportunities. Candidate Bill Clinton in 1992, however, echoed Republican criticisms, decrying permanent dependence on welfare, and asserting, No one who can work should be able to stay on welfare forever. His own welfare plan, presented in June 1994, proposed limiting welfare recipients to two years of aid, while adding some $9.3 billion in new spending for community service jobs for those who couldn't find private sector work. But Republicans, taking control of Congress in 1994, were not interested in expanding Washington's role. They embraced a more watershed approach: putting state governments in charge of welfare policy, while imposing work requirements coupled with lifetime limits on cash benefits. And, Republicans proposed ending welfare for all immigrants, legal or illegal. That was a bitter remedy for most Democrats, including the president, who vetoed two bills containing GOP-written welfare provisions during 1995 and 1996. Still, the president insisted he wanted to sign welfare reform, challenging Republicans to send him a clean bill, free of other issues such as Medicaid reform. In July 1996, Republicans did just that. After meeting with aides and Cabinet members in frenzied sessions in late July, Clinton announced he would sign the bill despite misgivings about cuts to legal immigrants and savings from food stamps. All Americans, without regard to party, know that our welfare system is broken, that it teaches the wrong values, rewards the wrong choices, hurts those it was meant to help, Clinton said. We also know that no one wants to change the current system in a good way more than people who are trapped in it. back forward
(CNN) The gold medal for best 2021 diet went to the Mediterranean diet for the fourth year in a row, according to rankings announced Monday by U.S. News & World Report .\n\nTied for silver was the DASH diet , which stands for dietary approaches to stop hypertension, and the Flexitarian diet, which encourages being a vegetarian most of the time, but is flexible enough to allow a burger now and again.\n\nWhat do all of these diets have in common? They stress reducing or eliminating processed foods, and focus on meals full of fruits, vegetables, beans, lentils, whole grains, nuts and seeds.\n\nThe Dukin and keto diets, which stress eating high-protein or high-fat foods with minimal carbohydrates, came in last and next-to-last in the diet rankings. Those diets are typically rated poorly by experts because they are extremely restrictive, hard to follow, and eliminate entire food groups, which is not recommended by dietary guidelines.\n\nTo judge the diets, a panel of experts in heart disease and diabetes, nutrition, diet, food psychology and obesity reviewed research about the diets from medical journals, government reports and other resources.\n\nWe've convened a panel of 24 experts who live and breathe diet, weight loss and obesity, said Angela Haupt, managing editor of health at U.S. News & World Report.\n\nThey score each diet on a number of different measures: how easy it is to follow, how likely it is to lead to long-term weight loss, how healthful and safe it is, and how effective it is at preventing or managing chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease, she said.\n\nMore top honors for Mediterranean diet\n\nIn addition to capturing best diet, the analysis of 39 eating plans also gave the Mediterranean diet the top spot in the best plant-based diet category. The Flexitarian diet took second place, followed by the Nordic diet , which promotes eating locally sourced, low-glycemic foods.\n\nThe Mediterranean diet also tied with the DASH diet and the Ornish diet for top honors in best heart-healthy diet. The Ornish diet was created in 1977 by Dr. Dean Ornish, founder of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute in California. Ornish calls the diet the only scientifically proven program to reverse heart disease in a random clinical trial without drugs or surgery. Experts have said the diet is restrictive and hard to follow, however.\n\nThe Mediterranean diet also tied with the Flexitarian diet for first place in best diabetes diet; and with WW (Weight Watchers) for easiest diet to follow and DASH for best diet for healthy eating.\n\nThe diet features simple, plant-based cooking, with the majority of each meal focused on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and seeds, with a few nuts and a heavy emphasis on extra virgin olive oil. Say goodbye to refined sugar and flour except on rare occasions. Fats other than olive oil, such as butter, are consumed rarely, if at all.\n\nMeat can make a rare appearance, usually only to flavor a dish. Instead, meals may include eggs, dairy and poultry, but in much smaller portions than in the traditional Western diet. Fish, however, are a staple.\n\nIt's more than a diet, it's a lifestyle, said Atlanta registered dietitian Rahaf Al Bochi, who teaches the Mediterranean diet to her clients, in a prior CNN interview. It also encourages eating with friends and family, socializing over meals, mindfully eating your favorite foods, as well as mindful movement and exercise for a complete healthy lifestyle.\n\nBest overall diet for weight loss\n\nFor this category, the panel of experts looked at a diet's short-term and long-term weight loss success, weighing both equally. The popular WW (Weight Watchers) tied with the Flexitarian diet for top honors.\n\nResearch shows vegetarians tend to eat fewer calories, weigh less and have a lower body mass index (a measure of body fat) than their meat-eating peers, according to the analysis of the Flexitarian Diet. If you emphasize the plant-based component of this diet -- eating lots of fruits, veggies and whole grains -- you'll likely feel full on fewer calories than you're accustomed to.\n\nWeight Watchers, which also won first place in the best commercial diet category, has an important component needed in any successful diet: support. In addition to in-person meetings and optional one-on-one consultants, the plan offers an online community.\n\nPrograms like WW that offer emotional support and group meetings lead to higher compliance than a do-it-yourself dieting, the analysis said.\n\nNew diets evaluated\n\nFour new diets were added to the rankings this year, Haupt said: the Autoimmune Protocol diet (AIP), the Gut and Psychology Syndrome diet (GAPS), the modified keto diet and the Noom diet.\n\nAmong all these, Noom performed the best -- No. 12 overall, which is impressive for a newcomer, Haupt said.\n\nBased on a food-logging app, Noom wants you to log every meal, snack and exercise activity, as well as your daily weight. Noom encourages foods with low caloric density, which are high in water and low in calories by volume.\n\nSimilar to WW, Noom provides support groups where dieters can help each other with everything from how to curb distracted eating to how to make plain old water more fun, Haupt said.\n\nThe modified keto diet, also known as keto 2.0, is a bit less restrictive than its parent, the classic keto. For example, modified keto dieters consume about 82% of their daily calories from fat vs 90% in the traditional keto diet, 12% protein instead of 6% and 6% carbohydrates instead of 4%, according to the report.\n\nHowever, the new version was panned by the experts, coming in 35th, just slightly better than the traditional keto's ranking of 37 out of 39 diets.\n\nKeto 2.0 allows for slightly more wiggle room on what you eat, but experts said it is still way too restrictive, Haupt said.\n\nThe Autoimmune Protocol diet , also known as the Autoimmune Paleo diet, was developed to reduce inflammation and ease symptoms of autoimmune disorders. It requires people to eliminate foods for at least a month and monitor symptoms when the food is reintroduced. Experts called the diet restrictive, suggesting it needs more research to substantiate any benefits.\n\nThe Gut and Psychology Syndrome diet, or GAPS, is for people with an odd spectrum of conditions: severe digestive and immune system issues, learning disabilities and serious neurological conditions.\n\nGAPS was developed by Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride, who believes the food, drink and products people consume play a profound role in their brain function, according to the U.S. News & World report. Like the keto diet, GAPS comes in next to last in best diets.\n\nBest diet for quick weight loss\n\nThe quick weight loss category is for the person who needs to lose a few pounds for a special occasion, as the diets were evaluated for only a two-month period. It's not meant to be recommended as a long-term diet or lifestyle, according to U.S. News & World Report.\n\nHMR, or the Health Management Resources Program, took first place, with WW and the Atkins Diet tied in second place.\n\nThe HMR program is a weight loss and lifestyle-change program designed to reduce calories via meal replacements that include added fruits and vegetables. The starter kit is just shy of $200 and includes 70 servings of HMR shakes and entrees, support materials, weekly group coaching and free shipping.\n\nThe Atkins Diet, created in 1972 by cardiologist Dr. Robert Atkins, involves four phases of meal plans, starting with very few carbs and adding more as the diet progresses. However, low-carb dieters may eat too much fat, raising health concerns, the analysis found, ranking the diet at 33 out of 39.\n\nCNN contributor Lisa Drayer, a registered dietitian, is concerned with any type of diet that is too restrictive in food choices and worries about the role of ready-to-eat meals, shakes and snacks.\n\nThey're not necessarily teaching you how to eat healthfully on your own and how to make healthy choices, she told CNN in a prior interview, adding that she had seen this happen all too often in her own clients.\n\nThey were so severely restricted, and they didn't know how to incorporate other foods back into their diets in a reasonable way, Drayer said. So they not only regained their weight back, but they gained even more weight than where they started, which is really distressing.\n\nGetting started on the Mediterranean diet\n\nWant to make the Mediterranean diet one of your goals this year? Get started by cooking one meal each week based on beans, whole grains and vegetables, using herbs and spices to add punch. When one night a week is a breeze, add two, and build your non-meat meals from there.\n\nGrains that have changed little over the centuries, known as ancient grains, are also a key feature of the Mediterranean diet. Quinoa, amaranth, millet, farro, spelt, Kamut (a wheat grain said to be discovered in an Egyptian tomb) and teff (an Ethiopian grain about the size of a poppy seed) are some examples of ancient grains.\n\nWhen you do eat meat, have small amounts. For a main course, that means no more than 3 ounces of chicken or lean meat. Better yet: Use small pieces of chicken or slices of lean meat to flavor a veggie-based meal, such as a stir fry.\n\nAnd rethink dessert. Mediterranean cultures close out their meals with fruit that's in season.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIf you tire of eating raw fresh fruit, get creative. Poach pears in pomegranate juice with a bit of honey, then reduce the sauce and serve over Greek yogurt. Grill pineapple or other fruits and drizzle with honey. Make a sorbet out of fruit, including avocado (it's really a fruit). Stuff a fig or date with goat cheese and sprinkle on a few nuts. Create a brown rice apple crisp or even a whole-wheat fruit tart.
Too many Americans underestimate the value of their employer-sponsored retirement savings accounts, particularly if the employer is willing to match some, or all, employee contributions.\n\nWhile the majority of workers with 401(k) plans contribute more than enough to take full advantage of their employer's matching program, there are still about 20% of people who don't.\n\nSure, it doesn't seem like a ton of money to be missing out on now, but you might be surprised at how much of a difference it can make when you eventually retire.\n\nAbout 75% of companies offering 401(k) retirement plans offer some type of a matching program, generally based on an employee's contributions capped at a percentage of their salary.\n\nFor example, a 401(k) matching policy may be 50% of employee contributions, up to 6% of total compensation. In other words, if you earn $50,000 per year and contribute $3,000 to your 401(k) -- 6% of your salary -- your employer will contribute an additional $1,500 on your behalf.\n\nHowever, about one in five participants don't contribute enough to take full advantage of their employer match, according to several different surveys. Besides cashing out your 401(k) and spending the money, this is perhaps the worst retirement savings mistake you can make.\n\nWhy the employer match is so important\n\nHere's a simplified example that shows why this is so important. Let's say that you earn $100,000 per year and that your employer will match 50% of your contributions, up to 5% of your salary. So, you choose to contribute $5,000 into your 401(k) each year and your employer matches 50% of your contributions for a total of $7,500 flowing into your account annually. Over a 30-year period, your account could be expected to grow to approximately $708,000, assuming 7% annualized investment returns.\n\nOn the other hand, let's say that you choose to contribute just 3% of your salary, which is a common automatic contribution level set by many employers. Including the employer match, this means that just $4,500 will go into your account per year. Each year, you're missing out on $1,000 in employer contributions that you could have received for contributing the 5% matching limit. What's more, a move like this can really add up over time -- assuming the same 7% annualized returns, your account would only grow to about $425,000. That $283,000 difference could have a big impact on your financial security after retirement.\n\nFor this reason, the maximum contribution level your employer is willing to match should be the bare minimum you choose to put into your 401(k). Not doing so is literally turning down free money. Would you turn down a raise? Of course not. Not taking advantage of your employer match is just as silly.\n\nThis is an especially common mistake among younger people just starting out in their careers. Understandably, if you're starting your first job with an employer-sponsored retirement account, choosing to effectively reduce each of your paychecks to contribute to a retirement account may seem like a lot of money.\n\nPlus, many employers' 401(k) plans have automatic enrollment for new hires, often with a low contribution rate such as 2% or 3%. Many workers simply don't think to change it.\n\nRelated links:\n\n• Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy Alert\n\n• This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997\n\n• 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market\n\nHowever, it's important to think about your employer's matching contributions as what they really are -- a part of your compensation that you miss out on if you don't put enough into your retirement account.

They helped Moscow-friendly politicians get elected and hold onto power for nearly a decade.\n\nManafort and Kilimnik stayed in touch after their Ukrainian clients were ousted in 2014. They met twice in the United States during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to their own public statements. News reports have detailed their phone calls and emails in 2016, including one exchange where Manafort tried to use Kilimnik to reach a prominent Russian oligarch.\n\nBut Tuesday's filing revealed they had a third meeting, this time in the Spanish capital of Madrid. One redacted portion quoted Mueller's team: After being told that Mr. Kilimnik had traveled to Madrid on the same day that Mr. Manafort was in Madrid, Mr. Manafort 'acknowledged' that he and Mr. Kilimnik met while they were both in Madrid. A spokesman for Manafort sought to clarify the filing in a statement Tuesday night, saying that the third meeting happened in early 2017, after the election.\n\nThe growing list of Manafort-Kilimnik contacts could be relevant to the collusion question because, according to previous court filings from Mueller, the FBI has assessed that Kilimnik has ties to a Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016.\n\nMany of their contacts happened while the Russian government was aggressively meddling in the US election. Court filings said Kilimnik was affiliated with the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency that was responsible for hacking Democratic targets and orchestrating the WikiLeaks releases.\n\nCNN reported in February 2017 that Manafort was among a handful of senior Trump advisers who were in constant communication with suspected Russian operatives during the campaign. At the time, Manafort told CNN in a statement, that is 100% not true, at least as far as me.\n\nSharing campaign polls\n\nBeyond the fact that Manafort was in regular touch with Kilimnik, the unredacted court filings shed new light on the content of some of their conversations. For the first time, the public learned that Manafort shared polling data about the 2016 campaign with his Russian friend.\n\nIssues and communications related to Ukrainian political events simply were not at the forefront of Mr. Manafort's mind during the period at issue and it is not surprising at all that Mr. Manafort was unable to recall specific details prior to having his recollection refreshed, Manafort's lawyers wrote. The same is true with regard to the Government's allegation that Mr. Manafort lied about sharing polling data with Mr. Kilimnik related to the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThere aren't any additional details – all this tells us is that Mueller believes that Manafort fed polling data to Kilimnik, possibly even polls commissioned by the Trump campaign.\n\nPolling data is a key part of any modern political operation – presidential campaigns and outside groups like super PACs spend millions of dollars on polls. These numbers can drive decisions on messaging, where to campaign and advertising, both on television and in the digital space.\n\nTrump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale ran Trump's data team in 2016. They've publicly touted about how they used data to target voters.\n\nIt's possible Manafort innocuously gave the polls to Kilimnik because he is a political junkie and wanted to dig into the crosstabs. But there's also a possibility that Kilimnik, with his active ties to Russian intelligence, funneled the information to Russian agents to influence the election.\n\nThe primary suspect would be the troll farm in St. Petersburg that essentially acted as a pro-Trump super PAC and pumped out political propaganda to millions of Americans on social media during the 2016 race. These messages can be targeted to specific demographics based on polling data. There aren't any publicly known ties between Kilimnik and the troll farm.\n\nUkraine peace plan\n\nTuesday's filing also unintentionally disclosed that Manafort and Kilimnik discussed a Ukraine peace plan.\n\nAfter being shown documents, Mr. Manafort 'conceded' that he discussed or may have discussed a Ukraine peace plan with Mr. Kilimnik on more than one occasion, the filing said. The document was filed by Manafort's team, but this line appears to quote a past Mueller filing.\n\nThe filing revealed no details about what the Ukraine plan would entail. After Manafort's clients were ousted in 2014, Russian forced annexed Crimea and Kremlin-backed proxies invaded eastern Ukraine. Western nations condemned the moves and have applied economic sanctions against Moscow ever since. The diplomatic and military crisis is ongoing.\n\nThe news that Manafort was in talks with Kilimnik about a Ukraine peace plan is interesting, because it's not the first time the Ukraine conflict became an issue inside Trump's orbit.\n\nDuring the 2016 Republican National Convention, Trump campaign officials intervened to change language in the GOP platform about the Ukraine conflict. Their actions blocked a provision that called on the US to arm the Ukrainian government to fight the Russian proxies.\n\nAt the time, Manafort denied that the Trump campaign was involved. He also said he was not personally involved in any effort to change the platform and learned of it from news reports.\n\nThe Ukraine issue came up again shortly before Trump's inauguration.\n\nAn informal Ukraine peace plan was hatched at a January 2017 meeting between Trump's longtime attorney and fixer Michael Cohen, former Trump business partner Felix Sater and Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Artemenko.

Ginni Rometty is the chairman, president and CEO of IBM. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.\n\nThis week, IBM participates in CES, the annual technology exhibition where we interact with the latest innovations and ask, What's next?\n\nYet this question extends well beyond the technologies at CES each year. It's even more important to understand what's next for society. That includes building a workforce that is ' tomorrow ready .'\n\nI believe that 100% of jobs will change in the era of AI and that productivity gains resulting from these technologies will ultimately create more jobs than they replace. The priority right now is to help people around the world prepare for these jobs and benefit more from the prosperity that new technology creates.\n\nIf we don't do more now to equip workers with skills to fill more of those jobs, one study estimates that the United States could miss out on $162 billion in annual revenues from the tech sector alone. Ginni Rometty\n\nAfter all, the benefits of a booming US economy and low unemployment rate have not reached all Americans, and we face a skills gap that threatens long-term growth. At last report, released Tuesday, there were 6.9 million open jobs in the United States, yet over 6 million Americans are unemployed. If we don't do more now to equip workers with skills to fill more of those jobs, one study estimates that the United States could miss out on $162 billion in annual revenues from the tech sector alone.\n\nMany of today's most in-demand jobs require the right skills but not always a traditional bachelor's degree. We call these new-collar jobs , and they're well-paying careers in fast-growing fields. Apprenticeships are one proven way for both students and working professionals to build new-collar skills — not just in technology, but across industries. And with data showing that 91% of apprentices find work after completing their programs, it's a model that should be scaled up much faster than is happening today.\n\nRead More
(CNN) The US Justice Department has asked the White House for approval on a change to how it enforces a major federal law, which would undo some key civil rights protections for minority groups, The New York Times reported Tuesday.\n\nIf approved, the request to change how the department enforces Title VI of the Civil Rights Act -- which was submitted to the White House Office of Management and Budget last month -- would keep protections in place in intentional discrimination cases but not instances where a disparate impact was felt by minority groups, the Times reported.\n\nIn a draft proposal obtained by the newspaper, the department specifically said its current enforcement of Title VI included a vastly broader scope of conduct than the statute actually allows for.\n\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance. According to the newspaper, the request from the Justice Department would mark the first considerable change to how it defines discrimination in Title VI in decades.\n\nEven as a new attorney general under the Biden administration could delay the enactment of the change, the move is sure to draw fierce backlash from civil rights advocates who have long heralded disparate impact protections as a hallmark of Title VI.\n\nRead More

They helped Moscow-friendly politicians get elected and hold onto power for nearly a decade.\n\nManafort and Kilimnik stayed in touch after their Ukrainian clients were ousted in 2014. They met twice in the United States during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to their own public statements. News reports have detailed their phone calls and emails in 2016, including one exchange where Manafort tried to use Kilimnik to reach a prominent Russian oligarch.\n\nBut Tuesday's filing revealed they had a third meeting, this time in the Spanish capital of Madrid. One redacted portion quoted Mueller's team: After being told that Mr. Kilimnik had traveled to Madrid on the same day that Mr. Manafort was in Madrid, Mr. Manafort 'acknowledged' that he and Mr. Kilimnik met while they were both in Madrid. A spokesman for Manafort sought to clarify the filing in a statement Tuesday night, saying that the third meeting happened in early 2017, after the election.\n\nThe growing list of Manafort-Kilimnik contacts could be relevant to the collusion question because, according to previous court filings from Mueller, the FBI has assessed that Kilimnik has ties to a Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016.\n\nMany of their contacts happened while the Russian government was aggressively meddling in the US election. Court filings said Kilimnik was affiliated with the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency that was responsible for hacking Democratic targets and orchestrating the WikiLeaks releases.\n\nCNN reported in February 2017 that Manafort was among a handful of senior Trump advisers who were in constant communication with suspected Russian operatives during the campaign. At the time, Manafort told CNN in a statement, that is 100% not true, at least as far as me.\n\nSharing campaign polls\n\nBeyond the fact that Manafort was in regular touch with Kilimnik, the unredacted court filings shed new light on the content of some of their conversations. For the first time, the public learned that Manafort shared polling data about the 2016 campaign with his Russian friend.\n\nIssues and communications related to Ukrainian political events simply were not at the forefront of Mr. Manafort's mind during the period at issue and it is not surprising at all that Mr. Manafort was unable to recall specific details prior to having his recollection refreshed, Manafort's lawyers wrote. The same is true with regard to the Government's allegation that Mr. Manafort lied about sharing polling data with Mr. Kilimnik related to the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThere aren't any additional details – all this tells us is that Mueller believes that Manafort fed polling data to Kilimnik, possibly even polls commissioned by the Trump campaign.\n\nPolling data is a key part of any modern political operation – presidential campaigns and outside groups like super PACs spend millions of dollars on polls. These numbers can drive decisions on messaging, where to campaign and advertising, both on television and in the digital space.\n\nTrump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale ran Trump's data team in 2016. They've publicly touted about how they used data to target voters.\n\nIt's possible Manafort innocuously gave the polls to Kilimnik because he is a political junkie and wanted to dig into the crosstabs. But there's also a possibility that Kilimnik, with his active ties to Russian intelligence, funneled the information to Russian agents to influence the election.\n\nThe primary suspect would be the troll farm in St. Petersburg that essentially acted as a pro-Trump super PAC and pumped out political propaganda to millions of Americans on social media during the 2016 race. These messages can be targeted to specific demographics based on polling data. There aren't any publicly known ties between Kilimnik and the troll farm.\n\nUkraine peace plan\n\nTuesday's filing also unintentionally disclosed that Manafort and Kilimnik discussed a Ukraine peace plan.\n\nAfter being shown documents, Mr. Manafort 'conceded' that he discussed or may have discussed a Ukraine peace plan with Mr. Kilimnik on more than one occasion, the filing said. The document was filed by Manafort's team, but this line appears to quote a past Mueller filing.\n\nThe filing revealed no details about what the Ukraine plan would entail. After Manafort's clients were ousted in 2014, Russian forced annexed Crimea and Kremlin-backed proxies invaded eastern Ukraine. Western nations condemned the moves and have applied economic sanctions against Moscow ever since. The diplomatic and military crisis is ongoing.\n\nThe news that Manafort was in talks with Kilimnik about a Ukraine peace plan is interesting, because it's not the first time the Ukraine conflict became an issue inside Trump's orbit.\n\nDuring the 2016 Republican National Convention, Trump campaign officials intervened to change language in the GOP platform about the Ukraine conflict. Their actions blocked a provision that called on the US to arm the Ukrainian government to fight the Russian proxies.\n\nAt the time, Manafort denied that the Trump campaign was involved. He also said he was not personally involved in any effort to change the platform and learned of it from news reports.\n\nThe Ukraine issue came up again shortly before Trump's inauguration.\n\nAn informal Ukraine peace plan was hatched at a January 2017 meeting between Trump's longtime attorney and fixer Michael Cohen, former Trump business partner Felix Sater and Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Artemenko. The proposal was seen by some as friendly to Moscow.\n\nCohen confirmed to CNN that the meeting took place but denied discussing Ukraine. In comments to other news organizations, Cohen acknowledged the so-called peace plan and said he delivered the proposal to the office of then-national security adviser Michael Flynn. The White House denied that anyone ever received any documents from Cohen about Ukraine.\n\nIt is not clear if this proposal was related in any way to the plan that Manafort discussed with Kilimnik. There aren't any publicly known ties between Artemenko and Kilimnik, though Kilimnik is an insider in Ukrainian political circles and has relationships with many lawmakers there. Artemenko has cooperated with Mueller and testified before the grand jury last summer.\n\nCNN's Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.
B/R\n\nMINNEAPOLIS — Case Keenum is sitting in the corner of a quiet locker room. His teammates long ago disappeared into the frigid night to celebrate another victory with family and friends.\n\nThere is carryout lasagna in the warmer waiting for Keenum at home, and he texts his wife, Kimberly, to let her know he's running late. For now, he is pondering what he is doing here. How he's quarterbacking a team that oddsmakers say is favored to play in the Super Bowl.\n\nHow is he a Minnesota Viking?\n\nThey wanted me, he says. And then he smiles. It isn't just a conversational smile. It's a big, I'm really happy smile.\n\nAmong the categories Keenum leads the league in, it seems, is gratitude.\n\nThere haven't been many times in Keenum's football life when he could say those words.\n\nThey wanted me.\n\nVideo Play Button Videos you might like\n\nAt Wylie High School in Abilene, Texas, he started 42 games, threw for 48 touchdowns, ran for another 41 and led his team to the Texas Class 3A Division 1 championship. He went to four quarterback camps in the hopes of getting noticed, but the recruiters kept pointing at the other quarterbacks. He was a 2-star recruit, according to 247Sports, ranked 1,818th in the country.\n\nTexas-El Paso, Missouri, Baylor and North Texas came calling, but once they took a look at him in person, all said, No thanks. He received one scholarship offer, from Houston. There, in Kliff Kingsbury's spread offense, all he did was throw for more yards and touchdowns than any player in NCAA Division I history.\n\nBut no NFL team drafted him. Only one team—the Texans—even made him an offer.\n\nThe Texans cut him that fall and re-signed him to their practice squad, where he spent the whole 2012 season. It would be the first of three times he was cut. He also has been traded, for a seventh-round pick.\n\nLast season, the Rams had to play him because Jared Goff wasn't ready. But by November, it was time to start the first overall pick in the 2016 draft.\n\nMatt Dunham/Associated Press/Associated Press\n\nKeenum's contract expired in the offseason, and the Rams wished him well. When he became a free agent, the Bears and Bills expressed interest, but only one team wanted him.\n\nHe is so thankful the Vikings did.\n\nKeenum could win in the postseason or throw a jillion touchdown passes, but it wouldn't change what our eyes tell us about him. Playoff quarterbacks are supposed to be taller, broader of shoulders, squarer of jaw. So many of us have fallen to the temptation of looking at what he is not rather than what he is.\n\nKeenum has been called a game manager, even though he doesn't play like one. Why? He looks like one.\n\nIn reality, he plays more like a pirate, cutlass in mouth, swinging from a rope to board his enemy's ship.\n\nI believe in being smart with the football, not taking sacks and giving guys chances, Keenum says. But I let it rip. Attack, attack, attack. I like to let it rip, I do.\n\nKeenum, a shade over 6'0, looks like a short quarterback in the locker room, but not so much on the field. Vikings offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur has helped mitigate his lack of height by moving the pocket. He says Keenum is also good at finding throwing lanes when he is in the pocket.\n\nOne NFL scout said Keenum likes to get deep in his drop and then climb the pocket. It helps that he has the ability to react well with his feet.\n\nTo Vikings tight end Kyle Rudolph, Keenum is similar to a quarterback he played with in the 2012 Pro Bowl. Drew Brees is roughly the same height.\n\nJoe Robbins/Getty Images\n\nCase moves around in the pocket and extends plays and makes big plays down the field like Drew does, Rudolph says. He's not the tallest guy in the world, but there are a lot of guys who have had success in this league at that position at his height.\n\nHis appearance is both a blessing and a curse. It has made it difficult for him to find opportunity, but it also has enabled him to take advantage of this opportunity.\n\nI've had a chip on my shoulder for a long time, he says. It's driven me to work hard my whole career. I am who I am. I don't apologize about it. I don't worry about it.\n\nHe speaks of the pleasure he derives from proving people right for believing in him, as opposed to proving the doubters wrong.\n\nSteve Keenum, Case's dad, is a former football coach who now is an area director for the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. He cites a biblical story to describe how his son has been perceived.\n\nGod was going to choose a king, Steve says. He had Samuel look at all these guys. He saw the Schwarzenegger-type guys, all kinds. God said no to all of them. Finally, he came to this one small guy, David. They said, 'He can't be the one.' Well, they were looking at the wrong stuff. They were looking at the outside. And I think that's what's happened with Case.\n\nKeenum has this incongruous quality of inspiring faith in those he aligns with, and doubt in those he does not.\n\nThis year, his team believes in him, no matter what most of America thinks.\n\nIt's all right. He gets it.\n\nMy whole life, I've been the underdog, he says. I've been reminding myself a lot that I can do it, and I know this team has my back. ... There are a lot of people's opinions that don't matter.\n\nLast offseason, the Vikings were looking to replace Shaun Hill as the backup quarterback to Sam Bradford. They wanted a veteran who was in the sweet spot between young enough and cheap enough. There weren't many options.\n\nThey studied Keenum's performance with the Rams and focused on the positives. He won four games with a bad team. He had an outstanding performance against the Lions. His teammates made him a captain.\n\nVikings general manager Rick Spielman talked himself into making Keenum a one-year, $2 million offer.\n\nThrough offseason workouts and training camp, the Vikings weren't sure whether Keenum would beat out fellow backup Taylor Heinicke. As Keenum was throwing interceptions in camp, it became fair to wonder if he would be any different in his fifth pro offense than he was in his first four. Even after Keenum had a decent preseason, no one felt confident in his ability to win games if he had to play.\n\nThe more Keenum played, the more comfortable he seemed, and the more Shurmur learned how to use him.\n\nWhat we try to do is do what our players do well, Shurmur says. So we tailor things to his strengths. He can move around a little bit, get the ball out quickly, do some play-action stuff. He rewards us by making good decisions. If it's not there, he checks it down.\n\nHannah Foslien/Getty Images\n\nBy the time the regular season was over, Keenum had won 11 of 14 starts, had the second-best completion percentage in the league (67.6) and the seventh-highest passer rating (98.3).\n\nHe did it despite being considered an understudy. Vikings head coach Mike Zimmer said he didn't feel completely comfortable with Keenum until December, and there always seemed to be a possibility of Bradford or Teddy Bridgewater returning.\n\nIt's blinders, taking it one week at a time, Keenum says. There is no point in looking left or right or behind me. I'm going to look forward and do my job.\n\nThis is a right-place-at-the-right-time story. The Vikings were in the right place, right time to get Keenum, who didn't have any other real opportunities. The 29-year-old was in the right place, right time to become all he is destined to be.\n\nFrom the simple brilliance of Shurmur and the injuries that provided an opportunity to play to a gifted wide receiver group and the defense that would be any quarterback's best friend, the Vikings were perfect for Keenum.\n\nMaybe it's the team, the system, the player, Shurmur says. The stars all cross.\n\nSo much is potentially in front of Keenum in the weeks ahead. He can win playoff games and become the first quarterback in history to play in a Super Bowl on his home field. He can take the Vikings where Joe Kapp, Fran Tarkenton, Wade Wilson, Randall Cunningham, Daunte Culpepper and Brett Favre could not.\n\nKeenum is rich in ways that have nothing to do with money, but he can become rich in ways that have everything to do with money. He can convince the Vikings or some other team to offer him a contract that will allow him to plant roots and kiss worry goodbye for the rest of his life.\n\nIt's a heck of an opportunity. It really is, he says. I know it's such a good opportunity that I don't want to waste it. What's great is I don't have to be anybody else but myself.\n\nAt some points in his playing career, being himself wasn't good enough. That's different now.\n\nIn our current situation, there is no reason he can't continue to play at this high level, Shurmur says. I really feel he has the ability to make a play at the most crucial time. He's done that for us this year. ... He's just a really good player.\n\nThe Vikings were destroying the Bengals in the final minutes in Week 15. It was back-slap and big-smile time. It also was time for Bridgewater to take his first snap since he tore his knee to shreds nearly 16 months earlier.\n\nAs Bridgewater entered the game—a goosebumps moment—chants of Ted-dy, Ted-dy, reverberated through U.S. Bank Field.\n\nKeenum was leading the chants.\n\nIt was great, Bridgewater said afterward, via Lindsay Young of Vikings.com. It was better seeing Case leading the chant. Case is an awesome guy, and to see him standing behind me was just amazing.\n\nAdam Bettcher/Getty Images\n\nLike Bridgewater, Keenum is easy to cheer for. Despite being cut by disappointment many times, Keenum has an absence of scar tissue. He is relentlessly cheerful and optimistic. Grounded by Kimberly, his wife of nearly six years, he is comfortable in his own skin. His teammates speak of his humility, character and faith.\n\nHe's willing to shoulder the blame for things that are not his fault, Vikings guard Joe Berger says. That's the quality I admire most about him. The Carolina game, I got beat for a sack late in the game [by Kawann Short]. Case said he should have got the ball out faster. Clearly, it was the right guard's fault, not his fault.\n\nWhat is most important to Keenum likely isn't what is most important to the majority of quarterbacks. It isn't setting records, winning awards or having his name written on a stadium wall.\n\nAt the root of it, what I want is to be a great teammate, he says. I want guys in the locker room to remember the relationships I've had with them. That's important for me, more than any other external goal—to impact guys in the locker room.\n\nReceiver Adam Thielen, who had a breakout season catching passes from Keenum, calls his quarterback Casum, a combination of Case and Keenum. He and Keenum connected quickly, two guys who came into the NFL through the back door and look more like they belong in the stands than on the field.\n\nOver regular rounds of golf in the offseason, they became closer.\n\nWhen nobody is looking, he's the same Case as when everybody is looking at him, Thielen says. A lot of people can talk about their faith. When you live it every day and act on the word of God, it's pretty cool to see. He doesn't just talk; he acts upon it and leads by example. It helps me become a better person of faith.\n\nThrough extra time on the practice field and film room, Keenum and Thielen developed an unusual chemistry on the field as well. Keenum attributes their connection to nonverbal communication. They both say they often have a feel for what the other is thinking.\n\nIt isn't about psychic abilities—it's about a dedicated, unified effort.\n\nAfter the Vikings offense wraps up meetings on Wednesdays and Thursdays, Keenum often watches tape for another hour or two with his receivers. During practice, when the scout-team offense is working against the first-team defense, Keenum might take the receivers to the side to work on a specific route.\n\nI've never seen anyone prepare the way he does, Thielen says. He's always coming to us with things he sees on tape, or things he can do a little better job of. And talking about how we can attack defenses. I think he takes it to another level.\n\nWhen Thielen arrives at Winter Park around 6:30 most mornings and walks into the meeting room, he finds Keenum watching tape with a pad full of notes. Keenum has been there for an hour by that time.\n\nMan, Thielen thinks, I need to study harder.\n\nThe good teammate is making others better while trying to be the best he can be.\n\nHannah Foslien/Getty Images\n\nIn the second week of the season, the Vikings travelled to Pittsburgh. The hope was that Bradford, who had won NFC Offensive Player of the Week six days earlier, would be able to play against the Steelers despite a knee injury. But as he hobbled through pregame warmups, it became apparent that wasn't going to happen.\n\nOn Minnesota's first possession, Keenum sprinted out and took over the huddle like an army sergeant addressing a platoon.\n\nDon't worry about this, he said to 10 men with eyes wide through the din at Heinz Field. I've got it. Now, let's roll.\n\nAs it turned out, he didn't have it. He had 17 incompletions and threw for just 167 yards in a 26-9 loss.\n\nBut his confidence left an impression. Keenum has an abundance of it, perhaps more than he has a right to have.\n\nHe says his success this season has not surprised him.\n\nI think I can make every throw in the book, he says. Am I perfect? No. Is anybody?\n\nThielen says he has never seen Keenum get nervous.\n\nThe guys who play at a high level probably think they are better than they are, and that's all right, Thielen says. He definitely has that. He doesn't care what people think. He knows he can play at a high level.\n\nWhere does the confidence come from? His father points out Keenum has been good at almost everything he's ever done—so much so that his sisters, Lauren and Allison, were jealous when they were younger.\n\nIn high school, he was all-state in football and basketball. He played varsity baseball as a freshman, and in his first two at-bats, he hit balls off the outfield wall. His high school team did not have an established kicker at the start of his junior year, so Keenum begged for a chance to kick a field goal on the opening drive of the season. He nailed a 47-yarder.\n\nHe's an adept bow-hunter, he plays a mean game of pingpong, he's a heck of a gamer and he's a scratch golfer. In fact, his golf game sounds a lot like his quarterback game.\n\nHe puts the ball in the fairway, hits it long, and he's a really good putter, Thielen says. He doesn't make many mistakes.\n\nKeenum, though, says his confidence comes from someplace else.\n\nMy faith, he says. God has equipped me with exactly what I need, so it's important I do the best I can with what He has given me.\n\nPlaying the way he has is one way to give thanks.\n\nDan Pompei covers the NFL for Bleacher Report.

London (CNN Business) An attempt to exclude select UK political reporters from an official briefing has led some journalists to accuse the British government of resorting to tactics used by President Donald Trump to punish the media for critical coverage.\n\nSeveral publications were prevented from attending a briefing at the offices of Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday, prompting journalists from leading UK networks and newspapers to walk out, an act of solidarity that follows skirmishes between Johnson and the media on the campaign trail in December.\n\nThe increasingly strained relationship between journalists and the prime minister, and the response of his government, has drawn comparisons to the approach used by the Trump administration to penalize outlets and individual journalists for coverage it considers unfair.\n\nJohnson, a former journalist for The Telegraph , refused to participate in one of the major television debates of the general election campaign, ducked an encounter with one of the country's premier political interviewers and prevented a reporter from one left-leaning newspaper from traveling on the campaign bus. UK government ministers have also boycotted the BBC's flagship morning radio program following the election, reportedly because of how it covered the campaign.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, frequently dismisses critical coverage as fake news, refuses to grant interviews to media outlets he dislikes and seeks to restrict their access to government and campaign events. His administration has not held a press briefing in months.\n\nJust on Monday, the Trump campaign removed a Bloomberg reporter from an event and the White House excluded CNN anchors from a traditional briefing ahead of the State of the Union.\n\nAccess denied\n\nTensions flared in London this week when a select group of reporters was invited to a briefing in Downing Street about the United Kingdom's future relationship with the European Union, a subject of vital importance following the country's legal exit on Friday.\n\nSeveral journalists from other outlets, who say they had previously been invited to such briefings, also showed up. They were granted entry into the government offices but told they were not able to attend the briefing, according to several accounts from reporters who were denied access.\n\nReporters from the Financial times, The Sun, The Telegraph, the BBC, Sky News, the Daily Mail and the Guardian were among those invited in, while their colleagues from The Mirror, The I, The Evening Standard, HuffPost and other publications were shut out.\n\nIn a rare moment of solidarity for the British press, all of the reporters chose to walk out of the briefing in protest. I can safely say that in 22 years of being a political journalist, I've never experienced a day like today, tweeted HuffPost UK's political editor Paul Waugh.\n\nIt's common for select groups of political journalists to receive briefings. But reporters said that Monday's briefing was to be delivered by senior civil servants, permanent government employees who are meant to remain impartial when it comes to politics.\n\nAdam Boulton, a political anchor at Sky News, congratulated his colleagues in a Twitter post for standing firm against Number 10's Baby Trumpism.\n\nThe UK government did not respond to a request for comment from CNN Business. But Downing Street communications director Lee Cain told The Independent, We are welcome to brief whoever we want, whenever we want.\n\nThe move to restrict access to the briefing came after Johnson's team moved the location for daily government briefings from parliament to Downing Street. The Telegraph's chief political correspondent Christopher Hope, who led the group of journalists who cover parliament at the time of the change, warned colleagues then that it would allow the current or any future administration to refuse access to journalists it may not approve of, which would be damaging to the freedom of the Press.\n\nMichelle Stanistreet, general secretary of the National Union of Journalists, said in a statement that the government's actions on Monday represent another very dangerous step and that ministers are now regularly refusing to be accountable for their actions by boycotting certain programmes and journalists.\n\nJohnson's government must stop this paranoia and engage with all the press, not just their favorites, she added.\n\nSome observers argued that Johnson's tactics don't quite rise to the level of Trump. Instead, they reflect a traditional battle between the media and the government.\n\nCharlie Beckett, a media professor at the London School of Economics, said the UK government is acting in a Trumpian manner, in that there are elements of this anti media playbook and an element of trying to provoke a reaction in its behavior.\n\nI think it's interesting and does reflect the tension and the fact that this is a new administration that is like all the others, desperately trying to get the upper hand in the eternal struggle between the [press] and Downing Street, he said.\n\nSome journalists said they were most surprised by the show of solidarity by a group of reporters who compete aggressively for scoops.\n\nWhat's interesting is that publications that used to be happily complicit are joining the resistance, said one former British political correspondent. The rewards for complicity are declining because the things this No. 10 now gives its favored outlets are of less value than the goodies given out by previous administrations.
(CNN) —\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren entered the 2020 presidential race this week in a strong financial position as a prodigious fundraiser with lots of available cash.\n\nWarren, who announced a presidential exploratory committee on Monday, has $12.5 million left over from her 2018 Senate campaign that she can transfer to her presidential campaign coffers. Only one other Democratic senator considering a presidential bid has come close to Warren's early war chest: New York's Kirsten Gillibrand, who ended the 2018 election season with $10.5 million remaining in her Senate campaign account.\n\nWarren, Gillibrand and the other Democrats weighing presidential bids will need every cent they can collect. For starters, President Donald Trump, who took the unprecedented step of filing for re-election on the day he was sworn into office in January 2017, already has raised a whopping $106 million for his reelection.\n\nAnd presidential campaigns are notoriously expensive affairs. The price tag of the 2012 general election contest between former President Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney – including money from the outside groups backing their campaigns – topped $2.3 billion, according to a tally by the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nHere's a look at the early fundraising picture for some of the possible contenders:\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\n\nWarren, a former Harvard law school professor turned consumer advocate, is known for her searing criticism of Wall Street banks. So, no, don't expect New York financiers to line up to raise money on her behalf. She's also ruled out help from a super PAC.\n\nI don't think we ought to be running campaigns that are funded by billionaires, whether it goes through super PACs or their own money that they're spending, Warren told reporters this week.\n\nShe enters the field with a sizable small-donor base: More than $6 of every $10 Warren raised from individual contributors for her 2018 Senate re-election came from donors who contributed in amounts of $200 or less, Federal Election Commission records show.\n\nWarren will need to lean on those kinds of donors, who can contribute repeatedly to her campaign before hitting contribution limits, to sustain her in a crowded Democratic field.\n\nShe already is racing to collect cash for the presidential exploratory committee she announced on New Year's Eve. A campaign email sent in the waning hours of 2018 urged supporters to make donations as small as $3.\n\nA key liberal activist, Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, immediately endorsed Warren's bid. He said her record of building coalitions to achieve policy goals, such as the creation of the watchdog Consumer Financial Protection Bureau following the 2008 financial crisis, gives her credibility with liberal donors.\n\nDonations to Elizabeth Warren are not an impulse buy, Green told CNN this week. They are fundamentally built on a track record of her consistently challenging power – whether that's challenging Wall Street and big insurance or challenging systemic racism.\n\nNew York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand\n\nGillibrand, raised nearly $18 million for her Senate re-election campaign and coasted to victory over a little-known rival. That's left her with a hefty war chest of leftover cash – $10.5 million.\n\nAs a senator representing the nation's financial capital, she also has ties to deep-pocketed donors. The securities and investment sector ranks among the top five industries supporting Gillibrand in recent years, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nShe's campaigned for other Democrats in the midterms and invested heavily in digital advertising on Facebook – a move that will help her expand her name recognition and build lists of potential supporters.\n\nBut Gillibrand ran afoul of some powerful Democratic donors after leading calls urging Minnesota Democrat Al Franken to resign from the Senate. Franken quit last year following allegations that he touched women inappropriately.\n\nLiberal billionaire George Soros told The Washington Post last June that he blamed Gillibrand for pushing out Franken in order to improve her chances.\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker\n\nThe New Jersey senator wasn't on the ballot in 2018, but he crisscrossed the country in an effort to influence the midterm elections – ranging from Georgia, where he stumped for Stacey Abrams, who ran unsuccessfully for governor, to the key presidential caucus state of Iowa.\n\nBooker, who has served in the Senate since October 2013, has extensive political and financial networks around the country and counts the people who work in the securities industry as among the top sectors donating to his campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics' analysis of donations.\n\nAnd Booker drew national attention long before he became a senator as part of a Sundance Channel documentary series, Brick City, which launched in 2009 and centered on his role as then-mayor of Newark, New Jersey. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, one of the planet's richest men, pledged $100 million to the city's schools during Booker's tenure.\n\nSteve Phillips, an influential Democratic donor in San Francisco, already has launched a pro-Booker super PAC, Dream United, and said he plans to raise $10 million to support a Booker presidential campaign.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\n\nSanders' army of grassroots supporters helped propel the Vermont independent senator into the No. 2 spot in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary.\n\nHis presidential campaign had raised some $228 million before Sanders conceded to Hillary Clinton in July of that year.\n\nSmall-dollar donors turned up again to help fund his re-election to a third Senate term in 2018. More than three-quarters of Sanders' individual contributions came in small amounts, and he ended the 2018 election with solid $8.8 million in the bank.\n\nBut with Warren and other progressives likely to enter the race, can Sanders still command small-donor devotion from liberal activists?\n\nRufus Gifford, who served as finance director of Obama's re-election campaign in 2012, is skeptical.\n\nSanders did almost nothing to raise money in 2016, Gifford wrote on Twitter this week. Because of the overwhelming level of grassroots support, he didn't have to. Question is: Is it still there? Can that strike twice? I am doubtful.\n\nSean Bagniewski, head of the Iowa's Polk County Democrats, said the online, small-donor fundraising techniques that Sanders pioneered in the 2016 campaign have grown commonplace among Democrats. And donors and activists are making fresh decisions about whom to support.\n\nI don't think the bases are staying with anybody in this next race. I know Bernie people who like Kamala and Cory, Bagniewski said, referring to Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker of California and New Jersey, respectively. I know Hillary Clinton people who like Elizabeth Warren.\n\nOutgoing Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke\n\nThe Texas Democrat emerged as the breakout fundraising star of the 2018 elections, collecting more than $80 million in his unsuccessful US Senate campaign against Republican incumbent Ted Cruz.\n\nBut the campaign drained his resources. O'Rourke ended the election season with just $477,000 remaining in his campaign's bank account.\n\nNearly half of O'Rouke's individual contributions came from small donors. And he's already attracting attention from some of the party's biggest fundraisers. Chicago financier and former US ambassador to the UK, Louis Susman, a fundraiser so successful that one of his hometown papers once called him a vacuum cleaner for his ability to suck up campaign dollars, recently told CNN that he would back O'Rourke should the Texan enter the race.\n\nA decade ago, that mix of establishment bundlers and small-donor enthusiasm helped Obama, then a freshman U.S. senator, defy the odds and build a fundraising juggernaut that defeated Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary.\n\nO'Rourke's backers aren't waiting for him to announce his candidacy. One Draft Beto group has established an ActBlue escrow account and is working to raise $1 million for his potential campaign. Another staged a day of action on his behalf last month in the early voting state of New Hampshire.\n\nWhile O'Rourke has drawn early comparisons to Obama's 2008 candidacy, one member of Obama's cabinet has already taken a formal step toward a 2020 race. Julian Castro, who ran the Housing and Urban Development department in Obama's administration, launched an exploratory committee last month.\n\nA formal announcement of his decision is expected Jan. 12 in his hometown of San Antonio, where he once served as mayor.\n\nBut Castro has not run for office outside of San Antonio and must work to establish a broader base of financial support. A political action committee he established in 2017 has raised about $490,000.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris\n\nThe California senator was not on the ballot in 2018, but she has raised big sums just two years into her Senate term.\n\nHarris collected nearly $7 million in her Senate campaign account. And about three quarters of her individual contributions came in small amounts, one of the highest proportions among Democratic senators considering running for the presidency in 2020.\n\nHarris also has raised more money for her leadership PAC than any other senator, according to a tally by a nonpartisan think tank, Issue One. (Leadership PACs are separate from candidates' principal campaign committees and provide a vehicle for politicians to raise money in larger increments than allowed by their campaigns. Harris' Fearless for the People PAC has collected $2.3 million.)\n\nHarris has deployed her campaign dollars to build a national profile and expand her lists of potential supporters.\n\nThrough the end of December, for instance, her campaign had spent more than $1.2 million on Facebook ads, according to an online database maintained by the social-media giant. A recent Harris ad on Facebook decried the December decision by a Texas judge to invalidate the Affordable Care Act and asked users to help defend health care by providing their first names, email addresses and ZIP codes.\n\nA reshuffled 2020 primary schedule that has pushed California's voting into early March offers a possible strategic advantage to Harris as the home-state senator.\n\nBut advertising across the populous state's multiple media markets will be expensive. And Harris could face competition from several other Californians, including Rep. Eric Swalwell who represents parts of the Bay Area, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and San Francisco billionaire Tom Steyer\n\nOhio Sen. Sherrod Brown\n\nThe Ohio Democrat raised a whopping $22.7 million in his Senate campaign, but he spent heavily to beat Republican Jim Renacci in a state Trump won by 8 percentage points in 2016.\n\nBrown ended the election with $1.8 million in leftover funds – not an ideal financial base to quickly build the infrastructure needed for a presidential campaign. But Brown's getting credit for waging a successful battle in a red-leaning state.\n\nGifford, the Obama fundraiser, put Gillibrand, Brown and another possible contender, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, in the same category.\n\nThese senators are unlikely to match the big names in fundraising, Gifford tweeted. But it will be a tortoise/hare thing for them. Need to peak at the right time and totally doable.\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar\n\nKlobuchar raised far less in her 2018 re-election campaign – about $8 million – than Gillibrand and Brown did in theirs.\n\nBut her star turn questioning Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, her victory by a 24-point margin on Election Day and her success in Minnesota's deep-red, rural counties have drawn more attention to the former county prosecutor and her 2020 prospects.\n\nKlobuchar ended the midterm election season with nearly $4.4 million banked in her campaign account – just ahead of Booker's $4.1 million cash balance.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden\n\nThe former vice president – who has toured the country promoting his book, Promise Me, Dad, and stumping for fellow Democrats – would enter the race as the early frontrunner. He led the field of potential contenders in a recent CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers.\n\nAnd Biden can draw on extensive ties to Democratic fundraisers forged during a Senate career that began in 1973 and as part of an Obama-Biden team that raised a combined $1.5 billion over two presidential elections.\n\nSince leaving office in January 2017, Biden also has built a network of nonprofits and academic institutions staffed by former aides and close allies, likely enabling him to quickly assemble a campaign infrastructure.\n\nMeanwhile, his political action committee, American Possibilities, raised more than $2.5 million since it was launched in 2017 and doled out more than $500,000 to Democratic candidates and committees during the 2018 midterms.\n\nIn recent interviews, a number of Obama's top financial backers told CNN they would help collect campaign contributions for Biden should he enter the race. But Biden, who would be 77 on Election Day 2020, may not be a shoo-in for everyone in the Obama crowd.\n\nStonyfield Farm co-founder Gary Hirshberg, a top-tier Obama bundler, said Biden likely would have won had he entered the race in 2016, but he believes Biden now is too old to seek the presidency.\n\nHirshberg told CNN he was looking mostly closely at supporting Brown or another possible 2020 contender, outgoing Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper.\n\nThe self-funders\n\nAnd then there are the candidates who will need no financial help at all should they jump into the race.\n\nAt least two billionaires, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and Steyer, an environmental activist and former hedge-funder, are weighing their own presidential bids.\n\nAnd they each unloaded more than $100 million into the midterms. Steyer focused heavily on driving youth turnout. Bloomberg and his team directed millions of dollars worth of advertising to two dozen House races to help Democrats successfully seize control of the chamber.\n\nAnother self-funder, departing Maryland Democratic Rep. John Delaney, already has declared his White House candidacy and has poured $3.5 million of his own money into the long-shot bid.
Gabriel Sterling speaks at Monday's news conference at the Georgia State Capitol. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n\nGeorgia Voting System Implementation Manager Gabriel Sterling urged Georgians to get out and vote in tomorrow's key Senate runoff election, and debunked President Trump's multiple baseless claims of election fraud in the state.\n\nSterling adamantly said that everybody's vote counts and was counted in the November general election despite assertions made by President Trump and others.\n\nIf you care about the value and direction of the nation you want to see, it is your obligation to turn out and vote tomorrow, Sterling said in a news conference in Atlanta.\n\nSterling said he is telling those who believe their votes were stolen or that there was voter fraud, If you believe in your heart of hearts that there was, the best thing for you to do is to turn out and vote and make it harder for them to steal, he said.\n\nHis comments come after audio from a Jan. 2 phone call between President Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger regarding the results of the 2020 election was released. In the call, Trump is heard attempting to pressure the official to find votes necessary to alter the election result in the state, which President-elect Joe Biden won.\n\nSterling stood next to a sign that said Claim vs Fact and refuted several claims that President Trump said during the released phone call.
(CNN) —\n\nThe miracle of life is a wondrous thing and this video of a baby octopus being born is nothing short of awe-inspiring.\n\nThe Virginia Aquarium & Marine Science Center welcomed the eight-armed baby to the world on Tuesday afternoon. The next day, adoring fans flocked to Twitter to see the grand birth of the Caribbean reef octopus in a 10-second video.\n\nThe baby octopus changes from a translucent white to a brownish color as it breaks from its egg sac. The explanation is a reasonable one – being born can be stressful.\n\nUpon hatching, the stress of being born can cause the octopus' chromatophores, or sacs that contain pigment, to fire.\n\nOur team believes it could have been either the stress of the hatch that caused them to fire or that it may have been related to the immediate instinct to camouflage for protection, explained Matthew Klepeisz, the public relations manager for the Virginia Aquarium & Marine Science Center.\n\nThe color change is a natural behavior for the octopus.\n\nThe octopus has specialized muscles that use electrical pulses to open and close the sacs allowing the octopus to camouflage itself, said Julie Levans, senior curator of fishes, invertebrates and herpetology.\n\nWhile this birth went smoothly, there was a point in the process where things didn't look so rosy.\n\nThe mother octopus was still in her exhibit when a bundle from her egg clutch fell, possibly while massaging her eggs, Klepeisz said. The team was able to recover it safely.\n\nThe baby featured in the video is doing well. The aquarium has yet to name the octopus. It's species is called octopus briareus, in case you were wondering.
(CNN) —\n\nWhat should have been a heartwarming photo of the Australian Prime Minister posing with his wife and kids has brought out the best in Aussie banter, thanks to one minor problem: the image showed the PM, Scott Morrison, with two left feet.\n\nThe Photoshopped picture – in which Morrison appeared to be wearing two white sneakers meant for the left foot – went viral and earned itself the hashtag #shoegate.\n\n#auspol story of 2019: our latest PM (ScoMo) had nice white shoes photoshopped onto his feet for his official https://t.co/eXNtcX7xTa site?! Yup. Regular bloke. Our tax dollars hard at work. #shoegate pic.twitter.com/kA0gG0yy9L — Luuke (@lukerhn) January 8, 2019\n\nThe Liberal Party politician, who replaced colleague Malcolm Turnbull as prime minister last year, made light of the situation Wednesday, tweeting a photo of himself wearing a grubby pair of K Swiss sneakers.\n\nHe blamed his department for the doctored photo, adding: but if you must Photoshop, please focus on the hair (lack thereof), not the feet!\n\nMessage to my Department (PM&C): I didn't ask for the shoeshine, but if you must Photoshop, please focus on the hair (lack thereof), not the feet! 😀\n\nHere they are in all their glory - my footwear of choice whenever I can get out of a suit. pic.twitter.com/hKKUstnArq — Scott Morrison (@ScottMorrisonMP) January 8, 2019\n\nThe leader's spokesman told Reuters the image was changed by staff without Morrison's knowledge or authorization.\n\nDespite the attempts at damage control, Morrison was mocked online for the blunder.\n\nSome took up the challenge and focused on the leader's hair – as he requested.\n\nOthers made fun of the fact that Morrison is the country's sixth prime minister in just over a decade.\n\nThe rival Green Party couldn't resist the chance to poke fun at the leader.\n\nAt times a controversial figure in Australia, Morrison was an enthusiastic advocate for the country's strict border protection regime during his time as immigration minister.\n\nIn November, he blasted schoolchildren who were organizing protests for action on climate change. Organizers criticized Morrison in an email to CNN at the time. They said he did not listen to climate scientists and failed to take action to stop dangerous climate change.
(CNN) —\n\nNew images obtained by CNN Tuesday indicate Iran is preparing to launch a remote sensing satellite into space, the latest sign that the Islamic Republic is moving ahead with the planned mission despite recent warnings from US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nThe high-resolution satellite images, captured by Planet Labs on January 4, 6 and 7, show activity at the Imam Khomeini Space Center consistent with steps that were taken prior to a previous launch in 2017, according to researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey.\n\nThere are no indications the launch is for military use despite Pompeo's argument that the launch vehicle incorporates technology used in ballistic missiles.\n\nSeveral Iranian media outlets have recently suggested that a launch is imminent and the new images appear to show preparations are already underway to send the satellites into orbit using a Simorgh space launch vehicle.\n\nThe Simorgh is a two-stage space launch vehicle that uses a cluster of four Shahab-3 engines in its first stage and smaller steering engines in its upper stage, according to according to Jeffrey Lewis, of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey.\n\nPHOTO: Planet Labs\n\nLast week, Pompeo implored Iran to scrap its planned satellite launches. While he stopped short of outlining how the US might react, Pompeo suggested the move could lead to new sanctions.\n\nThe United States will not stand by and watch the Iranian regime's destructive policies place international stability and security at risk, Pompeo said in a statement. We advise the regime to reconsider these provocative launches and cease all activities related to ballistic missiles in order to avoid deeper economic and diplomatic isolation.\n\nPompeo has argued space launches violate a UN Security Council resolution passed in support of the 2015 nuclear deal and said last week that Iran's launch vehicles incorporate technology that is virtually identical to that used in ballistic missiles.\n\nSuch actions would once again demonstrate Iran's defiance of UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 2231, which calls upon the Iranian regime not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, he said in last week's statement.\n\nThis action includes launching SLVs, which incorporate technology that is virtually identical to that used in ballistic missiles, including in intercontinental ballistic-missiles (ICBMs), the statement reads.\n\nBut that assertion is misleading, according to Lewis, who told CNN that the Simorgh is not an ICBM and it cannot, if used as a ballistic missile, strike the United States.\n\nIran has said its satellites are for telecommunications and the new images released Tuesday indicate it does not plan to heed Pompeo's warning.\n\nPHOTO: Planet Labs\n\nAnalysts say that a large white shipping container photographed on January 4 outside the site's assembly and checkout building was likely used to transport the rocket's first stage prior to its reassembly on the launch pad.\n\nPrior to Iran's 2017 space launch, a similar canister also appeared at the horizontal assembly and checkout building, according to Lewis.\n\nThe appearance of this canister is a strong indication that a rocket has been transported to the site and that a space launch is likely in the coming weeks, he said.\n\nAdditionally, the images also show unusual levels of traffic at the assembly and checkout building, including the presence of a large vehicle parked at the mobile launch gantry and a fuel truck located on site, analysts said.\n\nPHOTO: Planet Labs\n\nAccording to Lewis, Pompeo's argument linking Iranian space launches to ballistic missile activity is reminiscent of the Obama administration's stance on North Korea developing various rockets for civilian and military missions.\n\nThe United States, for many years, objected to North Korean space launches using arguments similar to the ones now being advanced against Iran's program, he told CNN.\n\nIn 2012, the Obama administration walked away from the so-called Leap Day Deal with North Korea over Pyongyang's plans to conduct a space launch in April. Abandoning that agreement did not stop North Korea's space program nor did it prevent North Korea from developing a series of new ICBMs using a different underlying engine and propellants, he said.\n\nPompeo, speaking in Jordan on Tuesday, insisted President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from Syria was not going to put a dent in efforts to contain Iran, though the planned move is widely seen as giving Tehran a victory. Pompeo also hinted at new economic sanctions against Tehran.\n\nYou'll see in the coming days and weeks we are, we're redoubling not only our diplomatic, but our commercial efforts to put real pressure on Iran to achieve what it is we set out for them back in May, Pompeo said. The President's decision to withdraw our folks from Syria in no way impacts our capacity to deliver on that, he insisted.\n\nReferring to 12 conditions that the US laid out in May for Iran to meet – which were widely seen as a demand for regime change in everything but name – Pompeo said, these are simple asks we ask of the Islamic Republic of Iran, to behave like a normal nation and the coalition is just as committed to it today as it was yesterday.\n\nCNN'S Nicole Gaouette contributed reporting.
Lamborghini is trying out a new slogan. We are not supercars. We are Lamborghini\n\nWait. What?\n\nThat statement, on the cover of the company's new sales brochure, sounds contradictory. If any company is supercars, it would have to be Lamborghini, right? The Italian ultra-luxury automaker pretty much invented the modern supercar, with famous cars like the Lamborghini Miura and Countach in the 1960s and '70s.\n\nBut now they are Super SUVs, too.\n\nRight below that crazy statement on the brochure is a picture of the Lamborghini Urus SUV, a high-riding, four-door vehicle that just went into production on a brand new assembly line at Lamborghini's Italian headquarters. Lamborghini is billing it as something entirely new, the world's first Super SUV. (The Urus is actually Lamborghini's second SUV model. There was only a limited run of its first, the LM002, in the late 1980s.)\n\nAnd the Lamborghini brand may have some more room to grow, said CEO Stefano Domenicali. An SUV is a big stretch for a brand with Lamborghini's image, but he said there could be other unexpected products in Lamborghini's future.\n\nAsked if Lamborghini is content to stop with just the SUV, Domenicali hinted that there's more to come in years ahead, but wouldn't share any specifics.\n\nLamborghini is following the path pioneered by its sister brand Porsche. (Both are part of Germany's Volkswagen Group (VLKAF).) Porsche successfully introduced an SUV in 2002, something that many purists decried as a sort of sacrilege. In the long run, Porsche's image as a maker of top-flight sports cars suffered no lasting damage, while its balance sheet benefited enormously. Porsche has pointed out that profits from the Cayenne SUV have allowed Porsche to spend more on the development of its sports cars.\n\nLike the Porsche Cayenne, the Lamborghini Urus, according to early reviews, has the performance capabilities to credibly carry the Lamborghini logo. Lamborghini expects the new model to double the brand's sales. In Lamborghini's case, that means it will sell a total of over 7,000 vehicles a year. It also means bringing in many new customers who would never have considered owning a Lamborghini before.\n\nPorsche followed the Cayenne with the Panamera four-door car and, later, the smaller Macan SUV.\n\nA four-door Lamborghini car has been considered in the past, such when the company unveiled the Estoque in 2008. That idea never went anywhere at the time but, perhaps, it could find its place in the future.\n\nNew body styles won't be the only change. There will be new power sources to drive the company's famous sports cars. Late last year, Lamborghini showed off an electric sports car concept it created with the help of MIT scientists.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered CitiFinancial Servicing and CitiMortgage to pay $28.8 million for giving the runaround to cash-strapped homeowners who were facing foreclosure.\n\nConsumers were kept in the dark about their options or burdened with excessive paperwork, said CFPB Director Richard Cordray, in a release on Monday. This action will put money back in consumers' pockets and make sure borrowers can get help they need.\n\nBoth mortgage servicers are subsidiaries of banking giant Citi (C).\n\nThe CFPB charged that in 2014, CitiMortgage requested unnecessary documents and forms from some homeowners who were seeking foreclosure relief. Many of these letters requested documents that had already been provided or weren't needed in the application process, according to the CFPB.\n\nRelated: Government sues America's largest student loan company\n\nThe government agency has ordered CitiMortgage to refund around $17 million to around 41,000 affected consumers and pay a $3 million civil penalty. Customers will receive $400 each, according to the CFPB.\n\nCitiMortgage must also halt any pending foreclosures that were involved in the flawed application process, and clearly identify the required documents borrowers must provide to apply for foreclosure relief.\n\nCitiFinancial Servicing, which collects mortgage payments as well as handles collections, loan modifications and foreclosures, is being ordered to better disclose its loan deferment policies and change how it reports certain accounts to credit reporting companies.\n\nThe government watchdog accused CitiFinancial Servicing of not properly disclosing foreclosure relief options to some customers and incorrectly charging some borrowers for credit insurance.\n\nCitiFinancial Servicing will pay around $4.4 million in restitution to about 7,800 consumers in varying amounts, according to the CFPB.\n\nA CFPB spokesperson said eligible consumers will be contacted by the two mortgage servicing units and added that CitiFinancial has already made the required refunds.\n\nIn an emailed statement to CNNMoney, a Citi spokesman said, We are pleased to resolve these matters.
Luxury tequila is having a moment right now.\n\nAnd Mexico's Clase Azul tequila brand is capitalizing on the craze.\n\nClase Azul -- which sells bottles ranging from $100 to $30,000 each -- has been served at some highly exclusive affairs, including movie premieres, the Screen Actors Guild Awards and celebrity parties.\n\nThe label has come a long way since it launched in 1997. Mexican founder Arturo Lomeli admits his first tequila was low-cost, terrible and packaged with a tacky sombrero and mustache.\n\nLomeli decided to go back to school to get a master's degree in luxury marketing to elevate his brand. He quickly learned about the value of crafting a higher quality product in unique packaging\n\nClase Azul tequilas are now sold in hand-sculpted, hand-painted ceramic decanters that are shaped like massive restaurant-style pepper grinders.\n\nWe started thinking in terms of exclusivity, in terms of giving the best that we can to those who can really appreciate it, he said.\n\nLomeli said he first became known as a high-end tequila craftsman in 2007 when he launched a $1,200 bottle of dark amber Clase Azul Ultra. It was simply intended to cause a stir on the tequila scene, rather than become an enduring product.\n\nWe didn't imagine that we were going to be in the business of selling super expensive bottles regularly, he said.\n\nLomeli considers himself lucky that he launched his luxury spirits as Americans were getting a taste for premium tequila.\n\nU.S. sales of high-end and super premium tequila have surged by 67% over the past decade, recently surpassing sales of cheaper varieties, according to the Distilled Spirits Council.\n\nClase Azul's most expensive offering with a $30,000 price tag features a ceramic bottle studded with items like amber and 24-karat gold. A collection of 15 of these luxury bottles were created to celebrate Clase Azul's 15th anniversary.\n\nClase Azul spirits are made in Mexico, but Lomeli has no plans to market the product to his compatriots -- although he does sell a few bottles to wealthy U.S. tourists at beach resorts in Cancun and Los Cabos.\n\nInstead, Clase Azul concentrates on export markets in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nWe decided not to sell to Mexicans from the beginning ... because it's difficult to make them change their preferences, he explains.\n\nIn 2016, the company sold 234,000 bottles of Clase Azul, with U.S. sales up 46% from the previous year.\n\nLomeli says his tequila is for savoring, not mixing in a cocktail or downing as a shot.\n\nWe want people to taste the tequila, to make them erase that bad memory that every single person has about low-quality tequila, he said. You can sip it and enjoy it neat without having that nightmare of hangovers.
CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta is a practicing neurosurgeon and the author of the new book Keep Sharp: Build a Better Brain at Any Age.\n\n(CNN) Ten months into the pandemic, I turned 51 and did the math: I'm entering the final third of my life. I know that sounds grim, and I am hoping to get more time than that, but I often do these mental calculations because the clock of life inspires me to make the most of the years that remain. That constant tick-tock reminds me to fill the final decades with invigorating experiences to bank in my inner black box -- a delightful cache of memories to replay over and over in my mind like a favorite movie.\n\nIn order for my plan to work, however, I have to invest in my brain now to ensure that it stays sharp into ripe old age, even if my body starts to betray me. Accomplishing this is well within my reach, and starts with a basic truth: Unlike most any other organ in the body, our brains are not pre-ordained to wither away, lose power, blunt their edge or, worst of all, become forgetful.\n\nMemories make us feel alive, capable and valuable. They help us feel comfortable with our surroundings, connect the past with the present, and provide a framework for the future. Truth is, this past year has resulted in a decade's worth of memories for me. Besides continuing to operate at the hospital, I have been reporting around the clock from my windowless home basement on every aspect of the novel coronavirus -- how it moves, the molecular keys it uses to gain entry, and what havoc it causes after entering the cells of the human body. And, when it became clear that Covid-19 was causing neurological deficits, from minor ones like temporary loss of smell and brain fog to more serious symptoms of a stroke, my worlds of brain surgeon and medical correspondent collided.\n\nDo not accept the false idea that brain decline is unavoidable, Dr. Sanjay Gupta writes.\n\nOver the last year, I have seen a movement gather steam unlike I have ever seen before. Within months of first identifying this novel virus, a global consortium of research scientists was established to study the relationship between Covid-19 and the brain. Among other things, these scientists are also re-examining a provocative idea: the possibility that certain infections raise the risk of cognitive decline and even the most common, dreaded form of dementia, Alzheimer's disease. It is a frightening prospect that should also motivate us to redouble our efforts to control overall risk factors for dementia and make our brains as resilient and sharp as possible. And the good news is that we have the tools to do this.\n\nIn my role as a doctor and public educator, I've noticed that people tend to have a limited view of what their brains are capable of doing as they age, and the power they have to make themselves better, faster, fitter and, yes, sharper. I think because the brain is encased in a hard shell of bone, many assume it is a black box, only measured by its inputs and outputs. Immutable, impenetrable, indecipherable and unable to be changed or improved. Up until recently, we used to think the brain was largely fixed with a certain number of brain cells, and as the years wear on, the neurons die off, the networks dim, and things like memory and processing speed take a hit.\n\nRead More

CNN took until November 13 to project Biden's victory in Georgia's presidential contest , 10 days after Election Day.\n\nThere's plenty of reason to expect a repeat. Early voting, the counting of which helped drag out the presidential results, is nearly keeping track in these special runoffs. In Fulton County, the state's most populous, the elections administrator said Monday that the early vote totals were larger for January than for November.\n\nRepublicans in the state have expressed concern that there may be a Democratic edge in the early vote totals. Which means that Republicans may need a strong showing on Election Day again.\n\nThat's where President Donald Trump's feud with Republican state officials over his own loss in the state could mean the difference in the GOP having a majority going forward.\n\nCNN's Ethan Cohen and Caroline Tounget looked at where the lead changed as the presidential votes in the state were counted during those 10 days:\n\nAt 7:16 p.m. on Election Night, when the first significant votes were reported, Biden jumped out to an early lead with almost 62% of the vote. Only 2% of the estimated vote had been reported.\n\nThe lead bounced back and forth for the next hour, but Trump pulled ahead at 8:07 p.m., with 10% reporting.\n\nEarly Wednesday morning Biden began to gain on Trump and finally overtook him at 4:48am on Friday, November 6, according to the vote count.\n\nBiden ultimately won by a little less than 12,000 votes.\n\nActually, it was 11,779. Trump's got that number burned on his brain since he specifically asked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in their phone call this past weekend to find one more -- 11,780 votes -- just enough to win him the election.\n\nWhile legal experts and constitutionalists are wondering if there's criminal liability for Trump's pressure on state officials to change results , the other end result of his war with Georgia officials from his party could be depressed turnout when the GOP needs it most.\n\nGabriel Sterling, the administrator of Georgia's election systems , said at a news conference Monday that the best thing for people frustrated by the presidential results would be to vote Tuesday.\n\nIf you're a Georgia voter, if you want your values reflected by your elected officials, I strongly beg and encourage you: Go vote tomorrow. Do not let anybody discourage you. Do not self-suppress your own vote. Do not make a self-fulfilling prophecy out of doing this. Don't let anybody steal your vote that way, Sterling said. That's what's happening if you self-suppress: You are taking away your important voice from this election.\n\nSo much rests on the outcomes in Georgia\n\nThe economy. The size and scope of recovery efforts will be shaped by who controls the Senate. Democratic wins would likely mean more from the government, The size and scope of recovery efforts will be shaped by who controls the Senate. Democratic wins would likely mean more from the government, writes CNN's Matt Egan\n\nA sweep by Democrats would open the door to more powerful fiscal stimulus that the shaky economy may very well need. But it would also raise the risk of corporate tax hikes that investors despise.\n\nBiden's ability to govern. His ability to get the people he wants in his Cabinet and in other key roles is entirely up to the Senate. One reason we don't yet know his pick to be attorney general has got to be that Biden doesn't know if it's a Republican or Democratic majority who will be voting to confirm.\n\nCongressional oversight and Biden. A Democratic majority will mean much less combative oversight, at least to start the Biden administration. It would also make Republican efforts to attack him over his son's previous business dealings -- Trump's top offensive in 2020 -- more difficult.\n\nAbout that phone call\n\nSince it became clear that Trump lost the election, he has been actively and openly trying to get state officials to ignore election results, a plan that was almost too brazen and anti-democratic to be believed.\n\nWhat's worse than openly trying to get around election results is quietly asking state officials to change them and find new votes two months after the election you lost. What Trump does behind closed doors, it turns out, is worse than what he does in the open.\n\nThe President is laser-focused on getting around his election loss and staying in power. If you think Trump is quietly working behind the scenes on Covid, which is If you think Trump is quietly working behind the scenes on Covid, which is killing an American every 33 seconds , the transcript of this call should put you straight.\n\nHe has no interest in hearing anybody else talk. Despite the best efforts of Raffensperger, who was respectful of Trump but firm in dismissing his theories, the President dominated the conversation, and all but threatened Raffensperger and his deputy.\n\nHe learned nothing from impeachment. For those senators who defended Trump and said he'd learned his lesson and would no longer use his office to pressure people for political favors, this must be a bitter pill. That a year after he was fighting impeachment, Trump would pressure a state official for votes is proof the tiger does not shed its stripes.\n\nImagine all the calls we'll never hear about and the pressure put on less scrupulous officials than those in Georgia.\n\nAside from fearing what Trump is capable of, this is also a moment to marvel at the strength of the US system, which so far has withstood all of his anti-democratic efforts. What's not clear is if any law enforcement agency -- the FBI or t he Fulton County DA , will make a criminal case out of this. Note: Prosecutions of former presidents are possible but have not occurred in modern times. It would be divisive and time-consuming.\n\nTrump's first punishment will come January 20, when he has to move out of the White House.
Luke Donald is a firm fan of the ice-white stride -- often seen down the disco as well on the golf course.\n\nJohn Daly is still pushing the envelope with sartorial swagger. Still, makes a change from the ubiquitous beige chinos.\n\nBriton Ian Poulter has made strides in the fashion arena in recent years, often taking us back to the era of Rupert the Bear trousers favoured by Watson in the 1970s.\n\nThe 1999 Ryder Cup at Brookline was controversial in more ways than one -- not least for these shirts with images of past U.S. teams.\n\nNo golf fashion debate would be complete without mention of the late Payne Stewart, who made the plus four his own.\n\nTom Watson has spanned the eras but the flat cap is a look not seen so much on professional tours these days. The pleated brown slacks aren't hard to find.\n\nEngland's Nick Faldo was an icon of the knitwear world with his 1987 take on what's cool on the course.\n\nBefore Rickie Fowler was even a glint in his parents' eyes, Gary Player was sporting the oversized baseball cap look.\n\nArnold Palmer, one of golf's original Big Three, championed the roll neck back in the day.\n\nThe Ryder Cup has always provided rich pickings for fashion critics - the 1951 British team were no exception with their voluminous trousers.\n\nFowler's 2016 get-up is a far cry from the threads of Harry Vardon, who won six British Opens and one U.S. Open between 1900 and 1914. But the Englishman paved the way for some of golf's later wardrobe whims.\n\nThe funky Fowler has always pushed sartorial boundaries -- he is known for wearing the orange of his alma mater Oklahoma State in Sunday rounds.\n\nFowler previously moved golf's fashion needle with his high-top shoes and jogging bottoms at the Abu Dhabi Championship. The golfing fraternity's more traditional elements might have been reaching for the defibrillator at the sight of these.\n\nAn untucked Hawaiian shirt might not fit the traditional preconceptions of what a professional golfer ought to look like, but Rickie Fowler has rarely followed the rulebook...\n\nStory highlights Rickie Fowler continues to push golf's dress code boundaries American star wore untucked Hawaiian shirt at first PGA Tour event of 2018\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe golf clubhouse might be traditionally the realm of collared shirts, sweaters and sensible slacks but one man is doing more than most to modernize the game.\n\nStep forward Rickie Fowler, seen wearing an untucked Hawaiian shirt at this week's Sentry Tournament of Champions on the island of Maui.\n\nThe American golfer tied for fourth after the first round, two shots off the leader Marc Leishman, but it was his sartorial selection that caused a stir.\n\nHaving previously donned high-top shoes and jogging bottoms at a prestigious tournament in Abu Dhabi, the 29-year-old is coming ever closer to flouting the governing body's dress code.\n\nPhotos: Club couture PHOTO: Gety Images/file From the lurid colors of John Daly's trousers right back to the first swingers in the 17th century, golfers have always tried to stand out from the crowd. Photos: Club couture PHOTO: Hulton Archive/Getty Images A portrait of William St. Clair of Rosslyn dating from around 1780. He was a member of the Honorable Company of Edinburgh Golfers (formerly known as the Gentleman Golfers of Edinburgh) who drew up the first known Rules of Golf. The military style coat was a familiar sight on the links in that era, Fleming says. Members of early golf societies in Scotland and England from the early 1700s onwards were quite frequently military men who would often have military style coats -- it was the fashion of the day to wear a button coat, Fleming told CNN. Different societies had different colors -- red is an R&A color and other societies also wore red, but others wore blue, green, there are instances of yellow (coats). It was symbol of membership. They would have special buttons for different societies, in the same way today that clubs have their own crest on jumpers and jackets, blazers, club ties. They also served a practical purpose -- they were warm and highly visible. Photos: Club couture PHOTO: Hulton Archive/Getty Images/file Old Tom Morris, photographed around 1880, won the Open Championship four times. Dressed in hard-wearing and warm tweed, Morris, the son of a weaver, is widely regarded as the first professional golfer. The early Open champions started to be known as pros, explains Fleming. They won money in competitions and were backed by the gentlemen golfers who would act almost like sponsors. They would bet against one another, put up prize money, trophies. Photos: Club couture PHOTO: Keystone/Getty Images A young King Edward VIII (right) seen here in 1916. Then the Prince of Wales, he was a golf lover and wore typical golfing dress rather than royal wear, Fleming says. His relaxed choice of clothing extended to wearing Fair Isle sweaters, which he helped popularize. The distinctive, multicolored weave is named after the small island in Shetland off Scotland's northeast coast. When Edward was appointed Captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club in 1922, a crowd of 6,000 onlookers watched him complete the Drive into Office (a ceremony on the first tee to mark the start of a new club captain's tenure) wearing a round-neck Fair Isle sweater. Knitwear became a look of its own and people would wear it outside the golf course -- thanks in part to Scottish knitwear companies like Pringle and Lyle and Scott, Fleming says. Photos: Club couture PHOTO: Topical Press Agency/Getty Images/file U.S. golf star Walter Hagen (left) shakes hands with Britain's Henry Cotton after the American won his fourth and final Open Championship at Muirfield in 1929. Dressed in plus fours, shirts, ties and v-neck sweaters, the pair were a dapper sight on the course. Walter Hagen loved wearing smart clothing and was known to talk about being a millionaire. He really liked bright colors, Fleming said. Photos: Club couture PHOTO: Fox photos/Getty Images/file Australian golfer Harry Williams sported a particularly fine pair of plus fours, or knickerbockers as they were more commonly known, in 1931. People always ask about the plus four and the plus two -- the difference is the width of fabric that's left at the knee. Plus fours equals four inches of fabric at the knee, Fleming says. If you ask people to name the traditional golfing look, it's diamond jumpers and plus fours. They were worn for lots of outdoor pursuits and golfers took to the knickerbockers. Even at the time people debated whether you looked silly! Photos: Club couture PHOTO: Gary NewkirkAllsport/file The late American golfer Payne Stewart revived the fashion for wearing plus fours and plus twos before his tragic death in 1999. People sometimes turn up at St. Andrews to play the Old Course in plus fours because they want to wear this great outfit. Payne Stewart loved to wear outrageous things, Fleming says. Photos: Club couture PHOTO: Topical Press Agency/Getty Images/file Female golf attire wasn't exactly progressive in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This outfit from circa. 1890 was typical of the heavy garb that women would wear. They were passionate about the game and careful about how they were perceived. They wanted to keep a good reputation, Fleming says. Photos: Club couture PHOTO: Hulton Archive/Getty Images/file A dainty and most becoming garment... Two decades later and fashions were starting to change, as this advert from 1910 suggests. Photos: Club couture PHOTO: L. Blandford/Topical Press Agency/Getty Images Four first-round competitors in a Ladies' Scottish Foursomes tournament on the Royal and Ancient Course in June 1928. Women golfers would sometimes wear what was called a Miss Higgins Hoop. It was really just a piece of elastic that was moved up to around their knees and designed to keep your skirt from blowing up in the wind -- women had to remain modest. Often what would happen is that they would weight their skirts with wire along the bottom edge rather than having the Miss Higgins Hoop, Fleming says. During the 1920s and 1930s women's fashion in general changed -- there was less corsetry -- so golf fashion kind of reflects wider fashions. Photos: Club couture PHOTO: Hulton Archive/Getty Images/file The elegant and striking figure of Gloria Minoprio caused a sensation at the English Ladies' Golf Championship in 1933 when she arrived carrying just one club and wearing trousers -- a first for a women golfer. She turned up using a one iron and wore an iconic outfit -- a pair of navy trousers quite high-waisted and well-fitting, a roll-neck sweater and a turban, all matching navy colors, Fleming says. From that period onwards, more golfing women thought, 'Well, maybe I could wear slightly more interesting fashion choices on the golf course.' Photos: Club couture PHOTO: Don Morley/Getty Images/file Max Faulkner, Open champion in 1951, was a colorful presence on the fairways during the 1950s and 1960s. He loved to wear bright colors and was known for being quite fun on the course. He was somebody who looked to make use of fashion, Fleming says. Photos: Club couture PHOTO: Augusta National/Getty Images Arnold Palmer teeing off at the 1960 Masters tournament. The American's victories at the 1961 and 1962 Open Championship helped revive interest in the sport's oldest and most prestigious trophy. I would like to be remembered for bringing golf to a worldwide audience, Palmer, who was known for his stylish presence on the course, told CNN in 2012. I liked a sharp crease in my slacks, my shoes polished to shine, while my shirts were conservative with a straight collar. It was a style I stuck with for most of my career. Photos: Club couture PHOTO: Steve Powell/Allsport Palmer's exploits in the UK inspired a young Jack Nicklaus to compete at the Open Championship. The 18-time major champion is pictured here at St. Andrews' Old Course in 1978, when he would win his third and final Claret Jug. Both Nicklaus, dubbed the Golden Bear, and Arnold The King Palmer would exploit their on-course success with profitable clothing businesses off it. Photos: Club couture PHOTO: Getty Images/file Both Nicklaus and Palmer built successful clothing brands. Nicklaus' distinctive Golden Bear logo is known to golfers throughout the world and Palmer, with the help of the sports agent Mark McCormack, settled on an umbrella logo for his wares. People of that era did become more aware of branding and Jack Nicklaus was an early pioneer in that, Fleming says. Photos: Club couture PHOTO: J.D. Cuban/Getty Images The trend of standing out on the links has been given new meaning by former Open champion John Daly in recent years. Although when he posed on St. Andrews' Swilcan Bridge with the Claret Jug in 1995, he wasn't quite so colorfully dressed.

But it isn't the natural disaster that defines a city -- it's the way they choose to regroup and rebuild.\n\nSeveral years later, Christchurch has been reconstructed to be respectful of locals and to be more thoughtful of the environment, creating a city that feels at once hopeful and dynamic. Vendors who once sold out of a pop-up mall of containers are now moving to brick-and-mortar locations, followed by loyal locals. Colorful street art about hope and resilience has appeared all over the city. Music performances are often held in rotating venues around the city instead of a single opera house or concert hall so more people have a chance to attend.\n\nThe elegant Canterbury Earthquake National Memorial pays homage to those who were lost, while the Transitional Cathedral -- intended to be, by its name, temporary refuge made of cardboard for locals to go following the quake -- has become a permanent part of the cityscape.\n\nDon't miss:\n\nLilit Marcus Kakano , a Maori-owned and -operated cooking school and cafe that aims to heal people through food and the Christchurch Art Gallery, which served as home base for post-quake first responders and is now a gorgeous centerpiece for a city on the move.Lilit Marcus\n\nEgypt\n\nThe ancient Egyptian temple of Abu Simbel stands on the shores of Lake Nasser.

Go for the Kona Gold Pineapple Cider or the Watermelon Double IPA, and stay to soak up the community vibe.\n\nResort aficionados, who long for breathtaking sunsets over the water, may wish to stay at the forthcoming Mauna Lani Auberge Resorts Collection, while boutique hotel seekers looking for something a little more rustic and down-to-earth can't go wrong at the Kamuela Inn , located in Waimea, an area of the island known for its ranching history.\n\nDon't miss: Hawaii Forest & Trail's new\n\nStacey Lastoe Hawaii Forest & Trail's new Volcano Unveiled tour takes guests on an off-road adventure to explore changes to Halemaumau crater.Stacey Lastoe\n\nThe Hebrides, Scotland, UK\n\nThe Callanish Standing Stones: A Hebrides mystery dating back 5,000 years. Martin Zwick/REDA&CO/UIG/Getty Images\n\nYou might have heard stories about Scotland's fine white sand dunes, turquoise waters, rugged mountains, crumbling castles -- but nothing can prepare you for seeing the Hebridean islands\n\nThe most famous of the lot, the Isle of Skye, makes it onto many travelers' must-see lists, but the lesser-visited Lewis and Harris, the most northerly Outer Hebridean Island, also deserves to be there.\n\nThe birthplace of Harris Tweed, the famous cloth that's been woven, dyed and spun by the islanders for centuries, is also home to its own Stonehenge-style mystery in the Callanish Standing Stones.\n\nUnlike Stonehenge, visitors can get up close to the standing circle of boulders at Callanish, which is believed to have been erected about 5,000 years ago.\n\nFor this and Lewis and Harris' other wonders, it's worth the drive to Ullapool, close to the northern tip of the Scottish mainland, and the 2.5-hour ferry across a choppy stretch of the Atlantic to explore these islands. Alternatively, there's the plane from Glasgow straight to Stornoway, the island's capital.\n\nEach Hebridean island has its own distinctive vibe, but they're all grounded in a similar small-town community spirit. Islay, the southernmost Hebridean isle, known for its whisky distilleries and incredible beaches, offers a true sense of island life. Driving around, visitors might be more likely to encounter cows than people, but any meeting with an islander will likely earn an Islay wave -- a friendly acknowledgment from a fellow driver.\n\nDon't miss: On Islay, head to atmospheric Loch Finlaggan, the late medieval meeting place of the Lords of the Isles, the former rulers of the Hebrides. Ferry provider\n\nFrancesca Street On Islay, head to atmospheric Loch Finlaggan, the late medieval meeting place of the Lords of the Isles, the former rulers of the Hebrides. Ferry provider Caledonian MacBride (CalMac) offers cheap travel between each Hebridean island, but the ride to the Isle of Barra by plane is worth it to experience one of the world's most picturesque plane landings, descending onto a stunning sandy beach.Francesca Street\n\nJaffa, Israel\n\nJaffa's narrow streets are packed with jewelers, sculptors, antique dealers, candlemakers and painters. noamarmonn / Pixabay\n\nTel Aviv-Yafo is often lumped together as one unit for the convenience of an airport and Google Maps, but 4,000-year-old Yafo (often spelled Jaffa in English) is as different from Tel Aviv as Brooklyn is from Manhattan.\n\nThe artsier sister, Jaffa has traditionally been home to narrow streets packed with jewelers, sculptors, antique dealers, candlemakers, painters and more displaying and selling their work. Also making the case for Jaffa as much more than a day trip are the three boutique hotels that opened in 2018 -- The Jaffa The Setai and The Drisco.\n\nHow to spend a perfect day there? Have hummus and pita at the jam-packed communal tables at Abu Hassan followed by sweets at Abulafia bakery. Experience the world's first deaf-blind theater company, Nalaga'at (there's a cafe next door where all the baristas are deaf and you can learn Israeli Sign Language signs for words like coffee), and don't forget to pick up banana-scented soaps and orange-blossom perfume from Zielinski & Rosen.\n\nDon't Miss: Jaffa is home to the first whisky distillery in all of Israel, the aptly named Milk + Honey.

Its spectacular natural landscapes -- think palm trees and sprawling backwaters -- lend the region the nickname God's Own Country.\n\nSevere floods during the summer of 2018 wreaked havoc across this southwestern state, but many of its top tourist destinations escaped unscathed.\n\nVisitors will likely land at Kochi International, an airport powered entirely by solar panels. The ancient port city of Kochi, once occupied by the Portuguese, is a multicultural hub offering plenty to do and see. It's a great place to check out traditional Kathakali dance, the storytelling dance form known for its colorful and intricate costumes and masks that hails from Kerala.\n\nKerala is also great for beaches, particularly in the southern part of the state. Postcard-perfect Kovalam is a surfing hotspot, while Varkala is good for just relaxing.\n\nKerala's backwaters are famous for a reason: a nexus of waterways linking the regions' villages and best explored via kettuvallam -- a traditional wooden houseboat. It's worth spending anywhere from a single afternoon to a week on one of the many rental houseboats on offer, enjoying the sights and sounds drifting by.\n\nOther top trips include Munnar to see the tea plantations, and Periyar National Park, a wildlife haven offering guided jungle treks.\n\nDon't miss: The food -- from the spice shops of Munnar to the coconut, which is everywhere in Kerala and used to make one of the state's signature dishes: Kerala prawn curry.\n\nFrancesca Street\n\nLiechtenstein\n\nLiechtenstein marks its tricentenary in 2019.

So why now?\n\nIn June 2019, New York will host World Pride , the world's biggest LGBTQ celebration, and simultaneously honor its own history with the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots.\n\nThe riots took place at an iconic Greenwich Village gay bar -- now part of a federally recognized National Monument where queer and trans individuals in the community pushed back against a police raid.\n\nThe event marked a major moment for the advancement and recognition of LGBTQ rights in the United States, and its half-century mark is a reminder that New York will always be a home to those in need -- as long as you don't try to push your way onto the subway before everyone else has gotten off.\n\nBeyond the special celebrations, there's a reason New York's classics are classics, from the Jackson Pollocks on display at the Met to a plate full of seafood at the 42nd Street Oyster Bar inside the architectural wonder that is Grand Central Terminal.\n\nDon't miss: The recently revamped\n\nLilit Marcus The recently revamped New York City Ferry system connects the boroughs in a new, easy way -- it's the best option to get from downtown Manhattan to surfer-friendly Rockaway Beach.

On June 6, 1944, the course of world history was altered because of the World War II English Channel crossing that launched the Allies' bloody liberation of France from Nazi rule.\n\nThere are more than 20 cemeteries in Normandy honoring war dead from Allied and Axis countries. The American Cemetery at Colleville-sur-Mer , on a bluff overlooking Omaha Beach, is seen in the opening and closing scenes of Saving Private Ryan and is a moving experience.\n\nThe Utah Landing Beach Museum , where you can see an original B-26 bomber, is one of several you can visit to learn more about the perilous effort.

Tarkine Rainforest, Tasmania\n\nA rarely visited, ancient and pristine forest wilderness, the Tarkine calls to mind myth and legend. It's in the northwest corner of Tasmania and is often referred to as the forgotten wilderness.\n\nIt's not entirely that. It's a wonderland of wild rivers, secret waterfalls, giant tree ferns, rare birds and the near-extinct Tasmanian devil (the world's largest carnivorous marsupial). Hikers who make it here leave enchanted.\n\nHow to do it: Tasmanian Expeditions offers a five-night walk on the Tarkine Rainforest Track, the only multiday rainforest trek of its kind. You'll be led by professional guides and spend nights camping in haunting and beautiful surroundings.\n\n2. Knoydart Peninsula, Scotland\n\nRugged, isolated and beautiful Knoydart Peninsula is often described as the last wilderness in Scotland . Tucked in the Highlands, it's accessible only by boat or on foot.\n\nThe journey is worth the effort: There are exhilarating mountain passes to cross and sandy inlets to explore. Whether they have soaked in epic sunsets or caught glimpses of the whales, dolphins and porpoises that live in its waters, visitors usually leave feeling spiritually restored.\n\nHow to do it: Wilderness Scotland offers extended guided trips.\n\n3. Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia\n\nThe stunning, lunar-like salt flats in the southwest of Bolivia are the largest in the world, covering 3,860 square miles.\n\nJune and July are arguably the best months, when the whole area appears blindingly white. After the rains, the salt desert resembles a giant mirror. It is beautifully barren and straight out of sci-fi central casting. You would be hard-pressed to find a more meditative escape. At more than 11,400 feet above sea level, you'll need to be able to handle high altitudes.\n\nHow to do it: A 10-night Bolivia itinerary taking in the Salar de Uyuni operated by UK-based Sunvil.\n\n4.

Eagles soar overhead and humpback whales put in an appearance in summer, joining orcas, dolphins and seabirds.\n\nHow to do it: Great Bear is remote, so the best way to access it is from the water. Nature Trek offers a seven-night, full-board Cruising the Great Bear Rainforest trip, which includes daily shore excursions to explore the forests, estuaries and coastlines on foot.\n\n6.

It's an Aladdin's trove of hills, canyons, gorges and deserts, wildlife (including the rarely spotted Nubian Ibex) and plant species. It's perfect for hikers, nature lovers and those seeking a slice of serenity.\n\nHow to do it: Base yourself at the award-winning Base yourself at the award-winning Feynan Ecolodge on the western border of the Dana Biosphere Reserve. This is no ordinary guest house: set up by Jordan's Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature, it's entirely solar powered and has won awards for its ethical practices.\n\nYou can hike, ride mountain bikes, stargaze, visit Bedouin homes, sip mint tea or unwind in serene courtyards.\n\nTravel the Unknown offers week-long tours, including a four-night stay at the lodge, hikes and bikes.\n\n9. The Isles of Scilly, United Kingdom\n\nFor wannabe castaways, little compares with what's probably the most beautiful spot in the UK, a tranquil sun and windswept archipelago 28 miles off the Cornish coast.\n\nBryher Island, with a population of around 80 (all trusting locals who leave their doors unlocked) offers coastal walks, sandy coves, wildflower-strewn bays and rocky outcrops for a wind lashing by Atlantic breakers.

The following is an excerpt from Latino in America by Soledad O'Brien with Rose Marie Arce. Published by arrangement with Celebra, a member of Penguin Group (USA), Inc. Copyright (c) Soledad O'Brien, 2009.\n\nWhen you have a name like María de la Soledad Teresa O'Brien, you have a lot of explaining to do. My mother is black and also Latina, more specifically Cuban. She is a devout Catholic who credits the Virgin Mary with any success she's had in this country. But it was my father, a man who spoke no Spanish, who chose the name María de la Soledad to honor the Blessed Virgin Mary of Solitude (solitude in Spanish is soledad).\n\nMy name is altogether too long for Americans, who've always struggled with it. It's even too long for a driver's license. African-Americans assume I'm named after the notorious Soledad prison or Mount Soledad in California. Latinos want to know if I'm lonely. That doesn't fit because I grew up with five siblings and I have four kids of my own, so I'm not lonely at all, though I do often seek solitude, the actual meaning of my name.\n\nMy father was Irish and Scottish, but from Australia, and my parents added Teresa when I was confirmed. My parents named all their children after people they loved and admired, and when it got to me, it was the Virgin Mary's turn. When I married, I thought about taking my husband's name (Raymond), but I realized that, odd as it is, the name I have works. I have a mass of kinky hair, light brown skin and lots of freckles. I'm black and Cuban, Australian and Irish, and like most people in America, I'm someone whose roots come from somewhere else. I'm a mixed race, first-generation American.\n\nMy ethnic roots are relevant when you look at the broader picture of who brings us the news. Who you are matters oh so very much when, according to the National Association of Hispanic Journalists (NAHJ), just 6 percent of the people working in TV news and 4 percent of the newspaper reporters in this country are Latinos. The NAHJ presents a report on media diversity called the Brownout Report, and it determined that less than 1 percent of the stories aired by the networks include Latinos, and that tiny amount is heavily concentrated on immigration, crime and drugs.\n\nIt's hard to be the lone ethnic face in the room. People look to me to explain a community that is diverse and ever-changing, a community with which sometimes I don't have a great deal in common. There is so little in-depth reporting on people of color that I set the bar high for myself and the people around me. I see the job I have now as my opportunity to get good reporting about black and brown people on TV, as a chance to bring people together, and to tell a fair and accurate story of communities of color, not just rehash stereotypes for the sake of drama. O'Brien wanted to share her multicultural experience »\n\nMore than anything, the stories have to be good, the story lines compelling and the people in them interesting. If no one watches, then I've accomplished nothing. The communities I cover have their own high expectations. People see this as a rare chance for good reporting about their communities to make it to television and they expect a lot. It can be exhausting to be reduced to your race and ethnicity. You can be made to feel bad about where you come from or feel bad about succeeding or feel like you're not a part of a community because your experience is different. My Cuban-born mother is wonderful on this topic. This woman who didn't teach her children Spanish did teach us pride.\n\nDon't let them tell you you're not black, she tells me. Don't let them tell you you're not Hispanic or not Cuban. And I don't. The fact that I work for CNN has fostered my commitment to telling great stories about people of color.\n\nCNN, a part of the Time Warner company, lives for news about everything and anyone. In the office, the bosses openly discuss the need for a diverse staff and diverse stories, and each time we draw new viewers, the effort intensifies. There is an active diversity council, aggressive diversity training, regular speeches from the highest officers of the company about how our country is changing and CNN has to be a part of that change. They see the demographics of the future and know they have to look at their hiring and reporting practices so that they appeal to the widest possible audience.\n\nAs CNN saw our growth in African-American viewership, they affirmed a fundamental truth of news coverage -- people will watch you if they see themselves in what you report. It doesn't hurt if the people doing the reporting look like them, too.\n\nIn 2007, CNN's coverage was altered dramatically by the launch of a series called Uncovering America, and the entire staff was asked to find compelling stories about the broadest range of people possible, not just people of color but folks of every race and ethnicity from all walks of life. That series was followed by the launch of a documentary project called Black in America, and I was tapped to be the correspondent.\n\nThe yearlong effort of Black in America was exhausting for me. I was one of a handful of black voices on the staff, and each day was a meshing of ideas and backgrounds and cultures. In other words, we argued a lot. I compiled everything. I learned new things about the black community that I'd lived in and covered my entire life. The result was a four-hour documentary that earned terrific reviews, got more viewers than almost any CNN documentary and started a discussion about the community of which I continue to be proud.\n\nNot everything was perfect.\n\nIt's critical in covering a community well to report both the good and the bad. I learned so much about reporting on race and some unexpected lessons about the stress of being a woman of color in the media. But by the time the project ended, I felt like I had started an important conversation about the struggles and the successes of the African-American community.\n\nIt became time to bring the same focus to bear on Latinos. So CNN began reporting Latino in America in the fall of 2008 with the goal of showing a community that was changing the United States even as the United States was changing them. I was tapped to be the correspondent once again.\n\nMy first thought was what a terrific opportunity this was for me! After so many years of fighting for fair and accurate coverage of people of color, I finally had a chance to work on a wide-ranging project that could show all Americans a fuller picture of who Latinos are and what they mean to this country. I vowed to give voice to the part of the community I knew, an optimistic, family-centered people who infuse U.S. culture with the warmth of their humanity.\n\nMy community embraced this project from the outset with an enthusiasm I'd not expected. Total strangers approached me with advice and assistance. Over and over, I was asked to please report on the people who are so often ignored, the Latinos who do not reflect the illegal alien who crosses the border to steal American jobs.\n\nPeople, many of them my own co-workers, asked me to push past the rancor of the immigration debate, which has strayed from being a discussion of policy and law enforcement to one that demonizes and stereotypes and hurts people whether they are illegal immigrants or not.\n\nLatinos saw this documentary as a wonderful opportunity to showcase the cultural struggles and contributions of Latinos; to focus on education, community and faith and show the broader public a more complete picture of how we live.\n\nIt was clear that the community felt starved for good solid coverage. No one asked me to do a snow job. Just please don't reduce us to crime, immigration and racial conflicts, they asked. Folks just didn't want to see their community hurt anymore and were very blunt about it. One afternoon I had lunch with Lupe Ontiveros in Los Angeles. She is a beloved Latina actor who has been reduced to the role of the maid or the nanny in scores of movies. I asked Lupe to be a major character in our documentary, and she offered an enormous amount of assistance.\n\nWhen I left the table she turned to my producer and said bluntly in Spanish, Please, just don't f-- us.\n\nIn the end, that wasn't hard because there are so many great untold stories to tell about Latinos that I knew would interest an audience of any racial or ethnic origin. The numbers of Latinos are exploding and spanning out into places where Latinos have never been seen before. Their impact on the United States is awesome.\n\nI knew from the outset I had to have as broad a focus as possible to cover such a large story. My team of producers, photographers and editors had to look at the Latino community through many sets of eyes. I urged our team to break new ground, to not end up rehashing the same old story told of any minority community, that there are Anglos unhappy they've arrived. That is not what it means to be Latino in America. We had to step back and watch a more complex human story unfold.\n\nAs we did our reporting, I realized quickly how challenging this was going to be. Latinos are an extremely diverse ethnicity that can be of any race and have many different origins, history and traditions. You can't easily group people who come from as far away as Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with people of Mayan, Incan and Taino descent who have mixed with Spaniards, Africans and Jews. We are about so much more than where we came from or how we look.\n\nThe essential point is that we don't come together in a real way until we set foot on U.S. soil. That's when our Latino experience begins. Latino is an American identity.\n\nIt is a word to describe Americans who are drawn to each other by this intangible cultural link, the similarity of the way we run our families, our devotion to faith, the warmth of our personalities and our connection to a history that recognizes no border to the south.\n\nLatinos are a people who celebrate the new culture they've created in the United States while struggling each day with whether we need to assimilate or integrate into this new society. We ask ourselves what good things we want to preserve from our culture and what American values we want or need to adopt. And that question never goes away, not one, two or three generations beyond immigration.
(CNN) Joe Biden mocks Pete Buttigieg's experience as a small-city mayor in a new digital ad the former vice president's campaign is using on YouTube and Facebook in New Hampshire ahead of Tuesday's primary.\n\nThe ad opened a bitter new chapter in the Democratic race, with Biden belittling Buttigieg on the campaign trail Saturday and the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor's supporters responding by calling Biden dismissive of those in small cities and towns.\n\nBiden, who is attempting to turn around his flagging campaign after a fourth-place finish in Iowa, dismissed comparisons between his attacks on Buttigieg and Hillary Clinton's criticism of then-Sen. Barack Obama's limited experience when the two were primary rivals in 2008.\n\nOh come on, man, Biden told reporters in Manchester. This guy's not a Barack Obama.\n\nBiden's attacks come as Democratic contenders grapple with a reshaped race after Buttigieg and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders paced the field in Iowa: Buttigieg is surging , seizing control of the race's more moderate lane, and Tuesday's primary could strengthen his standing. A new CNN poll Saturday showed him second to Sanders -- and well ahead of everyone else -- in New Hampshire. Buttigieg's rivals are increasingly desperate to slow his momentum and cast doubt on his experience and readiness for the presidency.\n\nBiden's attack ad\n\nThe ad, a digital spot appearing on Facebook and YouTube ahead of Tuesday's primary, was an opening salvo in a day of escalated attacks. Titled Pete's Record and reported first by CNN, it makes a series of cheeky comparisons between the two candidates -- contrasting Biden's time shepherding major legislation to passage and negotiating international agreements with the smaller challenges facing the mayor of a city of 100,000.\n\nIt's the most direct, negative ad aired to date by any leading Democratic presidential contender against a primary rival. The ad reflects a new sense of urgency in Biden's campaign: The former vice president and his aides have said they expect to lose New Hampshire, too -- but his campaign is looking to regain its footing as the race moves to Nevada and South Carolina later this month.\n\nWe're electing a President, the narrator says. What you've done matters.\n\nThe ad starts with a narrator saying: When President Obama called on him, Joe Biden helped lead the passage of the Affordable Care Act. And when parkgoers called on Pete Buttigieg, he installed decorative lights under bridges, giving citizens of South Bend colorfully illuminated rivers.\n\nWith each comparison, the music changes from a serious-sounding melody when describing Biden's record to a clownish melody to denote a mocking tone when describing Buttigieg.\n\nThe comparisons include Biden's help in negotiating the Iran nuclear deal and his work on the Recovery Act. Both Vice President Biden and Mayor Pete have helped shape our economy, the narrator says facetiously, saying that while Biden helped revitalize the economy by passing the Recovery Act, Buttigieg revitalized South Bend's economy by laying out decorative brick on the sidewalks.\n\nThe ad also knocks Buttigieg's record on race in South Bend, taking direct aim at the former mayor's biggest weakness in the Democratic presidential race: his lack of support from non-white voters.\n\nIt slams Buttigieg for the firing of the African American police chief of South Bend. And then he forced out the African American fire chief, too, the narrator ads.\n\nThe realities behind those charges are more complicated than Biden's ad lets on: Buttigieg sought to fire the police chief after the chief had not told Buttigieg his police department was under federal investigation. The chief was ultimately demoted. The fire chief, meanwhile, had announced his retirement -- only to change his mind after Buttigieg had already hired his replacement.\n\nButtigieg: No DC experience is 'exactly the point'\n\nButtigieg appeared to respond to the ad on Saturday at an event in Hanover, New Hampshire.\n\nWithout naming Biden, Buttigieg said, I know some folks are out there saying, 'What business does a mayor of South Bend have running for the presidency? You don't have an office in Washington. Your community is a little out of the way.'\n\nWhat I'm saying is that that's exactly the point, he continued. Right now there are so many communities, so many Americans, small and medium-sized cities like mine, and neighborhoods in some of the biggest cities in the country, that feel like Washington can't even hear us.\n\nI'm here to carry those voices to Washington, to bring solutions not from Washington but to our nation's capital, because I believe that we would be well-served if we could start to get Washington to work a little more like our best-run cities and towns rather than the other way around, Buttigieg said.\n\nButtigieg national press secretary Chris Meagher responded to the ad in a statement, writing, At this moment, the American people are crying out for something completely different from this classic Washington style of politics. While Washington politics trivializes what goes on in communities like South Bend, South Bend residents who now have better jobs, rising income, and new life in their city don't think their lives are a Washington politician's punchline.\n\nMeagher continued, Pete's on the ground experience as mayor, turning around a Midwestern industrial city, is exactly why he is running for president. The Vice President's decision to run this ad speaks more to where he currently stands in this race than it does about Pete's perspective as a mayor and veteran.\n\nMayors backing Buttigieg bash Biden over ad\n\nMayors who support Buttigieg's presidential campaign criticized the ad, saying that Biden was diminishing the importance of voices from small cities and towns.\n\nChristine Hunschofsky of Parkland, Florida, wrote, my city is Parkland, FL, with 33,000 residents. What happens in our cities matter too. This arrogant, disrespectful and dismissive tone is exactly what our country, our cities and our residents do not need.\n\n.@Rob_Flaherty and @JoeBiden, my city is Parkland, FL, with 33,000 residents. What happens in our cities matter too. This arrogant, disrespectful and dismissive tone is exactly what our country, our cities and our residents do not need. — ChristineHunschofsky (@CHunschofsky) February 8, 2020\n\nDayton, Ohio, Mayor Nan Whaley tweeted: I'm from Dayton, population 140,371. Are you saying voices from our towns don't matter?\n\n.@Rob_Flaherty and @JoeBiden, I'm from Dayton, population 140,371. Are you saying voices from our towns don't matter? https://t.co/U1isC3y5J3 — Nan Whaley (@nanwhaley) February 8, 2020\n\nWaterloo, Iowa, Mayor Quentin Hart said: As Mayor of Waterloo with a population of 68,000 are you saying that voices from cities like mine don't matter? All communities matter whether small or large.\n\nAs Mayor of Waterloo with a population of 68,000 are you saying that voices from cities like mine don't matter? All communities matter whether small or large. — Mayor Quentin Hart (@QuentinHart) February 8, 2020\n\nBiden's shift in tone\n\nBiden's shift in tone comes directly after he admitted a gut punch defeat in Iowa, coming in fourth in the state's caucuses. Wednesday at an event in New Hampshire, Biden singled out Sanders and Buttigieg during a speech, warning attendees that Sanders would hurt Democrats running in down ballot elections because he is a democratic socialist and admonishing Buttigieg for what he described as criticism of Obama's presidency.\n\nCampaigning on Saturday in Manchester, Biden said he was merely responding to Buttigieg arguing that Democrats should move beyond the politics of the past -- and also took credit for South Bend's resurgence.\n\nOne of the reasons why that city, in South Bend, did well is because I was able to direct about $65 million there from the recovery act. So I'm not picking on Pete, I'm just responding to Pete, Biden said.\n\nEarlier in the day, he'd compared his record in Washington with Buttigieg's in South Bend.\n\nDo I think there's a difference between getting a city budget passed in South Bend -- smaller than the city of Manchester? Or getting three Republicans to vote for a $900 billion recovery act, that saved us and generated less than 1% waste for fraud? Yeah, I do, Biden said.\n\nAt the Democratic Debate Friday, Biden seemed to downplay expectations in New Hampshire. It's a long race. I took a hit in Iowa and I'll probably take it here, he said, acknowledging that the neighboring senators, namely Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, are poised to do well because of their geographical advantage.
Story highlights Juventus unveils new club crest Minimalist design has divided opinion Club is most successful in Italian history\n\n(CNN) —\n\nApparently it's a symbol for a way of living that represents the future of football.\n\nThat's quite a billing the giants of Italian football Juventus have given its new 'designer' club crest, which was unveiled at the sort of glitzy ceremony usually reserved for a fashion show or car launch.\n\nA cast of soccer and celebrity royalty filed into Milan's Science and Technology Museum earlier this week for an event billed by the club as Black and White and More, with three-time Oscar winner and electronic dance music pioneer Giorgio Moroder on the decks.\n\nLife is a matter of Black and White. #2beJUVENTUS pic.twitter.com/qQgiPf0nKV — JuventusFC (@juventusfcen) January 16, 2017\n\nThe marketing blitz that accompanied the new logo boasted that Juve's new visual identity turns the sport's traditional style on its head and sets about blazing a new trail. The club's president declared the logo to be a symbol of the Juventus way of living.\n\nREAD: The rise of global 'super clubs'\n\nREAD: How family ties fuel Africa's deadliest striker\n\nREAD: How Brand Beckham conquered the US\n\nThe two sleek lines, both spelling out the letter J with Juventus written above replaces its old badge, a bull on a black and white shield, to represent its traditional colors.\n\nThe new visual identity has been designed to boldly take the club's spirit into new, unexpected realms, said Manfredi Ricca, chief strategy officer for EMEA & LatAm at Interbrand, which worked on the crest with Juventus, which is affectionately known in Italy as The Old Lady.\n\nEven Moroder, who wrote and produced hits for stars like David Bowie and Elton John, seemed to get caught up in the zeitgeist of the launch.\n\nI saw the future of music in the 1970s, said the DJ. Now, Juventus have seen the future of football.\n\nThe club's stated aim to is broaden its presence and expand its business operations through a series of radically innovative initiatives that not only target fans of the club but also those who might not be interested in football.\n\n'Change before you have to'\n\nIts not hard to see where this bold strategy has come from – its president Andrea Agnelli used to work in marketing for Ferrari, another world renowned Italian brand, and Philip Morris.\n\nThe more I look at the new logo of #Juventus, the more I like it. Focusing on the future. Always. 😎 — Romeo Agresti (@romeoagresti) January 17, 2017\n\nHe told the cognoscenti at the launch: Change before you have to.\n\nUnder Agnelli's stewardship, Juventus have moved to a brand new stadium, and are set to open the J Village later this year that will house an international school, a hotel and a new training facility.\n\nHowever, the logo divided opinion on social media. Many fans mocked up the badge in a series of unflattering poses, though others lauded its bold design.\n\nTennis star Robin Soderling, twice a beaten grand slam finalist, pointed out the similarity to the logo he launched for his website in 2013.\n\nThe club will adopt its new branding from July 2017 and hope it can help them compete on a global stage where the English Premier League and Spain's La Liga has overtaken the Italian league.\n\nJuve are the only club from Italy in the top ten rich list compiled yearly by Forbes, and hope to tap into lucrative markets in Asia and beyond.\n\nRicca expanded on the grand themes of the launch by telling Juve's official website: No club in Europe has so far been able to transcend sport and convey the philosophy behind that.\n\nVisit cnn.com/football for more news and videos\n\nIf there is one club capable of taking that step, it's Juventus – the brand is synonymous with ambition and excellence and these are principles that can inspire truly unique experiences.
Patrick Smith/Getty Images\n\nEvery Super Bowl stumble comes with a heartache that lasts deep into the offseason. Success hasn't made the New England Patriots immune to that darkness. A long, cold offseason awaits after a crushing 41-33 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII on Sunday.\n\nIn many ways it'll feel the same as the Patriots' two other Super Bowl losses since 2001, when their dominance began. And in one significant way it won't because there's another feeling settling in.\n\nThat feeling is uncertainty, and there's enough of it to put their dynasty in question.\n\nThe postgame second-guessing and agonizing over missed plays is familiar. This time the Patriots will wonder how much of a difference it would've made had kicker Stephen Gostkowski not lost four points on a missed field goal and a shanked extra point.\n\nThe Patriots, like the rest of us, will also spend seven months baffled by quarterback Tom Brady's rewriting history in Sunday's contest. He became the first quarterback to lose a game—any game—while throwing for 500-plus yards (he finished with 505 yards) with three touchdowns and zero interceptions, according to ESPN Stats & Information.\n\nThe Patriots have felt the bitter sting of a lost championship before and recovered by the next fall to keep rolling along just fine. Their contender status didn't fade, and the cozy seat they've occupied atop the league stayed warm.\n\nThe questions after every letdown are automatic, and the response that comes the following season has been too. For years we've wondered if this Super Bowl loss or that AFC Championship Game stumble is the final one before an impenetrable castle comes crumbling down and a dynasty is halted.\n\nVideo Play Button Videos you might like\n\nEvery time it seems the Patriots' doomsday clock is getting closer to midnight, the duo of Brady and head coach Bill Belichick chuckle and casually rewind those ticking hands. For Brady, the battle against time has defined him both personally and professionally, and winning it is central to the brand he's built.\n\nBut the Patriots are about to undergo significant change, all after a season with turmoil. Their chances to have more duck boat parades were always going to dwindle eventually. And now the only thing more difficult than swallowing a Super Bowl LII defeat will be keeping that window open by even a sliver.\n\nThe largest hurdle facing the Patriots in 2018 will be a reshaped coaching staff after the departure of both coordinators. Belichick is a masterful motivator and an advanced football mind who plans for seemingly every conceivable scenario. But even a genius on his level needs support, and likely losing both of his top sideline lieutenants in one offseason is a tough challenge to overcome.\n\nKeith Srakocic/Associated Press\n\nDefensive coordinator Matt Patricia will soon be the next head coach of the Detroit Lions. There was some confusion around Josh McDaniels' future earlier Sunday when ProFootballTalk's Mike Florio reported he's heard increasing chatter the 41-year-old might not decide to leave New England after all. However, Mike Chappell of Indy Sports Central reported McDaniels will still be the Colts' next head coach.\n\nThe Patriots defense may have been stunned by Eagles quarterback Nick Foles in Super Bowl LII. The unit allowed the backup to throw for 373 yards and three touchdowns while averaging 8.7 yards per attempt. But the Patriots had a shot at a sixth championship during the Brady-Belichick era largely because of Patricia's defense that weathered early-season struggles, allowing an average of only 18.5 points per game (fifth).\n\nMcDaniels, meanwhile, orchestrated an offense that put Brady in position to win his third MVP award. The Patriots offense led the league in average yards per game (394.2) and finished tied for second in points per game (28.6).\n\nContinuity can be the oxygen for a successful offense and quarterback. McDaniels had been the Patriots' offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach since 2012, his second stint in that position during Belichick's dominant reign over the AFC. Over McDaniels' most recent six-year run, Brady posted four seasons with 30-plus touchdown passes and three straight with a passer rating over 100.0, and he threw double-digit interceptions just once.\n\nSteven Senne/Associated Press\n\nSure, it's true that the Patriots machine has kept marching through other coaching changes, though it'll be tough for even Belichick to manage the loss of two coordinators. But the alarms reach a higher pitch when that critical hit is combined with other looming question marks.\n\nThe next such question brings us back to Brady's age and his grappling with time.\n\nHe might eat plenty of avocado ice cream and consume gallons of water daily. But history is one mighty foe, and Brady will turn 41 years old just prior to the 2018 season. Going down the list of the NFL's best quarterbacks in their age-41 seasons gets depressing fast.\n\nIt also doesn't take too long. Warren Moon threw 25 touchdown passes in 1997, which makes him the post-merger single-season leader among quarterbacks aged 41 or older, according to Pro Football Reference. Then there's a steep fall to Vinny Testaverde in second, with 17 touchdown tosses.\n\nEven if Brady stays in top physical condition, he only controls so much and relies on the weapons around him. Which is where the next potential dent in the Patriots dynasty comes in to slow him down.\n\nThe Patriots are projected to have only $19.3 million in salary cap space, according to Spotrac, which ranks 24th and is well below the league average of $38.8 million. They'll likely lose several key pending free agents from a group highlighted by left tackle Nate Solder, cornerback Malcolm Butler, wide receiver Danny Amendola and running backs Dion Lewis and Rex Burkhead.\n\nAdd in this noncommittal response from megastar tight end Rob Gronkowski when asked about retirement, and suddenly Brady is starting to look even older.\n\nBrady and Belichick have overcome towering obstacles before. But they haven't done it with so much changeover and with turmoil possibly brewing between them and owner Robert Kraft.\n\nESPN.com's Seth Wickersham reported on the trouble in Patriots paradise in January. Winning silences any fracture in a relationship, and the Patriots—with seven straight seasons of at least an appearance in the AFC Championship Game—have done plenty of that.\n\nThis time feels different, though, as Brady and Belichick age and the coaches and players around them drop off. There are too many elements aligning against them.\n\nEventually they won't be able to fend off the end of an era any longer. And that time could be here sooner than expected.
The President's legal team has been meeting at the White House every day around 11 a.m. ET since the trial started to go over what Democrats said the day before and to prep for their own opening statements, according to multiple people.\n\nWhile President Trump was out of town, there were late night discussions with him on the phone but now that he's back in town, he's participating directly.\n\nBut he's also on the phone regularly with outside allies, Republican lawmakers and Fox News hosts. After the session ended last night, Pat Cipollone, Trump's attorney, did not stick around much later, telling his team he was going home to get some sleep after a late night the evening prior, according to sources.\n\nTrump praised Cipollone's rare display of emotion during the opening debate over amendments, though multiple people have privately cautioned that the White House counsel is expected to be the staid attorney in this dynamic, while senators will more likely expect a boisterous performance from his legal counterpart, Jay Sekulow.\n\nPat Philbin, who is deputy counsel, also earned praise inside the West Wing after he addressed the Senate floor Tuesday night. He and attorney Pam Bondi were not originally slated to speak, but the White House was a little caught off guard by how many amendments Democrats offered, so they sent other members of the team up to break up the arguments.\n\nIt appears there has been little to no formal prep with attorneys Ken Star and Alan Dershowitz, according to multiple people. They have not been involved in the sessions on Capitol Hill, or seen in the White House, several people said.\n\nLater this week and next: Right now the White House expects to present for two days, not three, though a source cautioned that could change. Feeling comfortable Democrats will not have the votes to convict the President, the White House's number one goal right now: make sure there are no witnesses.\n\nOne person familiar says the legal team has also been preparing video clips they say will offer a counter-narrative to the clips shown by the Democratic managers.
Editor's Note: This is week 50 of a yearlong series. Laura Bernardini is director of coverage in CNN's Washington Bureau. The views expressed in this column belong to Bernardini.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nSpreading the word has got to be hard. St. Paul had it rough. As someone who has logged a lot of miles covering the world as a journalist, I empathize with the apostle. I can almost feel the sores on his sandal-covered feet.\n\nMy imagination ran wild about what Paul's life was like. When plotted on a map, Paul visited more places than most people get to today. Reading through his letters to the Ephesians, Colossians and Thessalonians kept this fascination going.\n\nPaul feels like a friend now. I worried about him as I read. He meets people who resisted his message, but he still plugged away at it.\n\nI even found myself saying this week, As I walk with Paul… My boyfriend wondered who in the world I was talking about.\n\nThe breadth of Paul's travels made me wonder. I can't even fathom how difficult it was for him to travel to spread the word of Jesus. This is far worse and daunting than being stuck in a middle seat for a long-haul flight.\n\nPaul is honest about this, You recall, brothers, our toil and drudgery, he says to the Thessalonians. I like to think he was talking about the difficulty of travel and not just the challenges of proselytizing.\n\nThe three books I read had a lot of repetition. You know how I feel about reading the same thing over and over. But with Paul, I didn't care. I feel like I am on this journey with Paul.\n\nThe overarching message he brings out to potential new worshippers follows the same themes: give up your idols, follow one God and make sure you are circumcised.\n\nEven though I read the message again and again, I was not annoyed. I have had a change of heart. I see Paul's words as a good reminder. I found a lot to meditate about (no, not the circumcision part).\n\nPaul simply tells the Colossians: But now, you must put them all away: anger, fury, malice, slander and obscene language out of your mouth. (Colossians 3:8) Mom, I promise to work damn hard on that last one.\n\nPaul pivots to what Christians should be doing. As God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, heartfelt compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience, bearing with one another and forgiving one another … And let the peace of Christ control your hearts, the peace into which you were also called in one body. (Colossians 3:12 & 15)\n\nWhen this project is done, I have decided the next book I read is going to be about Paul. He has captured my imagination more than any other prophet or apostle.\n\nI just want to know more.\n\nAs I wrapped up the first book of Thessalonians, I walked away with a new favorite meditation, Pray without ceasing. In all circumstance give thanks, for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus. (1 Thessalonians 5: 17-18)\n\nAmen to that.
Best original song: Shallow, performed by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper in A Star Is Born. The song was written by Gaga, Mark Ronson, Anthony Rossomando and Andrew Wyatt.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nAfter Time's Up and #MeToo, and two years of award shows heavy on political messages, the Golden Globes veered toward more comfortable territory for Hollywood – namely, patting itself on the back, while relying on the winners' passion, not the hosts, to carry a show that was alternately boring, shocking, sentimental and just plain silly.\n\nEmcees Sandra Oh and Andy Samberg opened with a joke at the expense of the Oscars – and its protracted search for a host, after naming and parting with Kevin Hart – saying that one lucky audience member would be chosen to host that show.\n\nThrough the course of the evening, the honorees registered political points on a variety of scores, whether that was Regina King discussing work parity for women; Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron, a dual winner for Roma, referring to the power of cinema to tear down walls – a clear reference to President Trump's proposed border wall; or Christian Bale, a winner for playing Dick Cheney in Vice, taking a shot at Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nBrad Simpson, accepting for FX's The Assassination of Gianni Versace, also cited the erection of walls and lingering presence of the homophobia reflected within the limited series, urging the arts community to let their voices be heard and Resist.\n\nFor the most part, though, the presentation's tone was celebratory, with Oh turning serious – after a comedy bit that actually flattered nominees in the guise of roasting them – to savor the greater inclusion in this year's lineup of movies, including films headlined by people of color like Black Panther and Crazy Rich Asians.\n\nWitness this moment of change, Oh said, triggering an appreciative response from the crowd.\n\nOne of the best-received statements came from Meher Tatna, president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, who spoke of the need for a free and robust press, announcing grants toward that end. (The HFPA devotes part of the millions that NBC pays to televise the awards to philanthropic causes.)\n\nAs noted, there were emotional moments, several nostalgic ones and plenty of major surprises, starting with Bohemian Rhapsody and Glenn Close, whose stunned reaction spoke volumes.\n\nPHOTO: Paul Drinkwater/NBCUniversal/Getty Images Hosts Andy Samberg and Sandra Oh\n\nOh, whose parents were in attendance, beamed as she collected an award for the BBC America drama Killing Eve. Michael Douglas thanked his 102-year-old dad; Dick Van Dyke garnered an extended standing ovation; Close teared up talking about her mother; and Carol Burnett inaugurated a new career-achievement honor with one of the night's best speeches.\n\nStill, with its slightly unorthodox hosting tandem, the comedy often veered into silliness, such as a pointless gag that involved giving audience members free flu shots. Samberg's cleverest line almost slid by in a blur of rat-a-tat banter, saying that Vice – questionably nominated as a comedy thanks to the Globes' drama and comedy/musical split – had invaded the wrong category based on false intelligence.\n\nPart of the challenge that the Oscars have faced in charting this year's show is the conflicting desire to somehow be both edgy and safe, to feature talent that will excite the audience without waking up to a huge next-day controversy.\n\nTo the extent these awards are viewed as one of the bellwether for the Oscars – despite a mixed track record on that score – the surprising results at best brought a bit more clarity to some key races, but confounded others. The HFPA remain a group that marches to its own drummer, giving the most conspicuous boosts to the period buddy film Green Book and Bohemian Rhapsody.\n\nThat early joke notwithstanding, the Globes didn't produce a candidate to host the Academy Awards, but they did provide a sort-of road map for how to navigate the award-show waters, putting the focus squarely on the ebullience of the winners to define the night.\n\nThat might not be the most exciting formula for an awards show that, from a production standpoint, felt sporadically amateurish. But it did produce its share of surprises, while reflecting the heart of what these events – at their core – are ultimately supposed to be about.
Washington (CNN) -- Less than a month after midterm elections brought a change in power in Congress, the White House and Republican leaders agree on one thing: changing the culture of earmarks.\n\nIn his weekly address, President Barack Obama called for reforming earmarks, which are funds inserted into spending bills intended for a specific program, project or purpose. Critics say earmarks often sail through without adequate review.\n\nGiven the deficits that have mounted up over the past decade, we can't afford to make these investments unless we're also willing to cut what we don't need, Obama said.\n\nThat's why I've submitted to Congress a plan for a three-year budget freeze, and I'm prepared to offer additional savings, he said. But as we work to reform our budget, Congress should also put some skin in the game. I agree with those Republican and Democratic members of Congress who've recently said that in these challenging days, we can't afford what are called earmarks.\n\nObama said while some earmarks support worthy projects in local communities, many others do not.\n\nWe can't afford 'bridges to nowhere' like the one that was planned a few years back in Alaska, said Obama, referring to the infamous $400 million bridge to nowhere project that Sarah Palin initially supported but later killed as governor of Alaska.\n\nAs president, time and again, I've called for new limitations on earmarks. We've reduced the cost of earmarks by over $3 billion. And we've put in place higher standards of transparency by putting as much information as possible on earmarks.gov, Obama said.\n\nHe said the administration updated the site with more information about where last year's earmarks were actually spent, and made it easier to look up members of Congress and the earmarks they fought for.\n\nRepublican House leaders are calling for a vote on an earmark ban next week when Congress returns for a lame duck session.\n\nIn a statement, House Republican leader Rep. John Boehner and Republican House whip Rep. Eric Cantor said the GOP conference will hold a vote and call on the Democratic leadership to do the same.\n\nEarmarks have become a symbol of dysfunctional Congress and serve as a fuel line for the culture of spending that has dominated Washington for too long, the members said in a joint statement.\n\nThey reference President Obama's voiced support for earmark reform and say Washington has previously failed to prioritize the way that taxpayer dollars are spent.\n\nThe announcement comes as Republicans prepare to become the majority party in the House, a shift that will likely include a Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor. Earmark reform was one of the items addressed in the Republican Pledge to America, which outlined priorities for Republicans going forward.\n\nCNN's Dana Bash, Deirdre Walsh, Gabriella Schwarz and Jim Kavanagh contributed to this report.

They helped Moscow-friendly politicians get elected and hold onto power for nearly a decade.\n\nManafort and Kilimnik stayed in touch after their Ukrainian clients were ousted in 2014. They met twice in the United States during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to their own public statements. News reports have detailed their phone calls and emails in 2016, including one exchange where Manafort tried to use Kilimnik to reach a prominent Russian oligarch.\n\nBut Tuesday's filing revealed they had a third meeting, this time in the Spanish capital of Madrid. One redacted portion quoted Mueller's team: After being told that Mr. Kilimnik had traveled to Madrid on the same day that Mr. Manafort was in Madrid, Mr. Manafort 'acknowledged' that he and Mr. Kilimnik met while they were both in Madrid. A spokesman for Manafort sought to clarify the filing in a statement Tuesday night, saying that the third meeting happened in early 2017, after the election.\n\nThe growing list of Manafort-Kilimnik contacts could be relevant to the collusion question because, according to previous court filings from Mueller, the FBI has assessed that Kilimnik has ties to a Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016.\n\nMany of their contacts happened while the Russian government was aggressively meddling in the US election. Court filings said Kilimnik was affiliated with the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency that was responsible for hacking Democratic targets and orchestrating the WikiLeaks releases.\n\nCNN reported in February 2017 that Manafort was among a handful of senior Trump advisers who were in constant communication with suspected Russian operatives during the campaign. At the time, Manafort told CNN in a statement, that is 100% not true, at least as far as me.\n\nSharing campaign polls\n\nBeyond the fact that Manafort was in regular touch with Kilimnik, the unredacted court filings shed new light on the content of some of their conversations. For the first time, the public learned that Manafort shared polling data about the 2016 campaign with his Russian friend.\n\nIssues and communications related to Ukrainian political events simply were not at the forefront of Mr. Manafort's mind during the period at issue and it is not surprising at all that Mr. Manafort was unable to recall specific details prior to having his recollection refreshed, Manafort's lawyers wrote. The same is true with regard to the Government's allegation that Mr. Manafort lied about sharing polling data with Mr. Kilimnik related to the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThere aren't any additional details – all this tells us is that Mueller believes that Manafort fed polling data to Kilimnik, possibly even polls commissioned by the Trump campaign.\n\nPolling data is a key part of any modern political operation – presidential campaigns and outside groups like super PACs spend millions of dollars on polls. These numbers can drive decisions on messaging, where to campaign and advertising, both on television and in the digital space.\n\nTrump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale ran Trump's data team in 2016. They've publicly touted about how they used data to target voters.\n\nIt's possible Manafort innocuously gave the polls to Kilimnik because he is a political junkie and wanted to dig into the crosstabs. But there's also a possibility that Kilimnik, with his active ties to Russian intelligence, funneled the information to Russian agents to influence the election.\n\nThe primary suspect would be the troll farm in St. Petersburg that essentially acted as a pro-Trump super PAC and pumped out political propaganda to millions of Americans on social media during the 2016 race. These messages can be targeted to specific demographics based on polling data. There aren't any publicly known ties between Kilimnik and the troll farm.\n\nUkraine peace plan\n\nTuesday's filing also unintentionally disclosed that Manafort and Kilimnik discussed a Ukraine peace plan.\n\nAfter being shown documents, Mr. Manafort 'conceded' that he discussed or may have discussed a Ukraine peace plan with Mr. Kilimnik on more than one occasion, the filing said. The document was filed by Manafort's team, but this line appears to quote a past Mueller filing.\n\nThe filing revealed no details about what the Ukraine plan would entail. After Manafort's clients were ousted in 2014, Russian forced annexed Crimea and Kremlin-backed proxies invaded eastern Ukraine. Western nations condemned the moves and have applied economic sanctions against Moscow ever since. The diplomatic and military crisis is ongoing.\n\nThe news that Manafort was in talks with Kilimnik about a Ukraine peace plan is interesting, because it's not the first time the Ukraine conflict became an issue inside Trump's orbit.\n\nDuring the 2016 Republican National Convention, Trump campaign officials intervened to change language in the GOP platform about the Ukraine conflict. Their actions blocked a provision that called on the US to arm the Ukrainian government to fight the Russian proxies.\n\nAt the time, Manafort denied that the Trump campaign was involved. He also said he was not personally involved in any effort to change the platform and learned of it from news reports.\n\nThe Ukraine issue came up again shortly before Trump's inauguration.\n\nAn informal Ukraine peace plan was hatched at a January 2017 meeting between Trump's longtime attorney and fixer Michael Cohen, former Trump business partner Felix Sater and Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Artemenko. The proposal was seen by some as friendly to Moscow.\n\nCohen confirmed to CNN that the meeting took place but denied discussing Ukraine. In comments to other news organizations, Cohen acknowledged the so-called peace plan and said he delivered the proposal to the office of then-national security adviser Michael Flynn. The White House denied that anyone ever received any documents from Cohen about Ukraine.\n\nIt is not clear if this proposal was related in any way to the plan that Manafort discussed with Kilimnik. There aren't any publicly known ties between Artemenko and Kilimnik, though Kilimnik is an insider in Ukrainian political circles and has relationships with many lawmakers there. Artemenko has cooperated with Mueller and testified before the grand jury last summer.\n\nCNN's Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.
You've probably heard by now that the new tax reform bill will hit your paycheck as soon as February. But the change may not accurately reflect your ultimate tax bill.\n\nAbout 90% of people will see more take-home pay, according to the U.S. Treasury. That may sound like great news, but here's the problem: There's a chance you'll end up with too much money in your paycheck -- meaning you'll either be stuck paying it back at tax time next year or get a smaller refund.\n\nThere's also a possibility that too much will be withheld, and your paychecks will be smaller than they should be.\n\nFiguring out how much to withhold from your pay is always a bit of a guessing game. It's an estimate based on how you filled out your Form W-4 and calculation tables created by the IRS.\n\nBut in a rush to implement the new law this year, the estimate could be off more than usual.\n\nThat's because the IRS has updated the calculation tables, but not the Form W-4.\n\nWe've done the best we can in the short term to come up with tables that accurately reflect the tax liability of individual taxpayers. Going forward, in order to be more precise, we're going to need a new system, said a senior IRS official on a call with reporters last week.\n\nA new Form W-4 won't be ready for the 2018 tax year. The new calculations were made to work with the existing form, but the form factors in some deductions and credits that no longer exist or have been changed under the new law.\n\nFor most people, the amount withheld throughout the year is usually more than your actual tax bill -- which means you get a refund after your file your tax return. If not enough is withheld, you end up owing money to Uncle Sam. Generally, you want to get as close as possible to breaking even.\n\nThe new tables may result in under-withholding for some employees.\n\nThose who claim a large number of allowances based on their number of dependents, or on itemized deductions that no longer exist, or are limited by the new law, have the most reason to re-examine their withholding status, said Mike O'Toole, the Senior Director of Publications, Education, and Government Relations at American Payroll Association. The group's members represent 17,000 employers.\n\nBut the changes could also result in over-withholding.\n\nThe good news is the withholdings are within your control. You can always update your Form W-4 to change the amount that's withheld from your paycheck.\n\nHere's what you can expect.\n\nWhen will I see a change in my paycheck?\n\nThe IRS has encouraged employers to start using the new withholding tables by February 15, but it may take your employer longer to make the change.\n\nI can't say that this particular change is appreciably more difficult than in other years. But what will be different is the time pressure and the pressure from employees, who are going to be more sensitive to this, said Jonathan Zimmerman, a partner at Morgan Lewis, who helps employers with benefit plans and payroll matters.\n\nDon't expect your employer to advise you on whether you should change your allowances on the W-4, though. Employers should explain the uniqueness of the situation to workers, communicate when the new rates will be implemented, and then suggest consulting with a tax adviser, according to Mike Boro, a partner at the accounting firm PwC.\n\nHow can I make sure my pay is accurate?\n\nWait for your first paycheck that accounts for the new withholding tables before making any changes, said Barbara O'Neill, a CFP and a financial management specialist at the Rutgers Cooperative Extension.\n\nThen, you can estimate what you think it should be and adjust accordingly.\n\nIRS officials said the agency will be publishing a new online calculator by the end of February that can help you decide how to adjust your allowances based on information you provide regarding your income level and number of children under the age of 17.\n\nBut you can also try to estimate your 2018 tax liability yourself. Then divide that amount by however many paychecks you'll receive this year.\n\nIf the math is close, hang tight, O'Neill said.\n\nIf the math is way off, that's when you'll want to make a change to your Form W-4. You can make a change to the number of allowances you've selected, or you can simply change your allowances to zero and write in how much you want withheld exactly, O'Neill said.\n\nThe changes don't need to be made immediately. O'Neill always recommends taking a look mid-year. By then you'll know if you are receiving a raise or if you'll have additional income coming in during the year.\n\nWhat happens if my withholding is still off?\n\nIf too much is withheld, you'll simply get a bigger refund check after filing your 2018 taxes.\n\nThis amounts to an interest-free loan to the government until then, and could tighten your cash flow, said CFP Jim Guarino.\n\nIf too little is withheld, you could owe money after filing and possibly face a tax penalty if the balance is $1,000 or more, Guarino said. Generally, you can avoid paying the penalty in this case if you paid at least 90% of what you owe or at least as much as you owed during the previous tax year.
(CNN) —\n\nAlexa is constantly learning. On top of features like Whisper mode or Alexa Guard from Amazon itself, there's a growing community of developers who are constantly thinking of new Skills. These apps for Echos are affectionately named Alexa Skills and let you do all kinds of things with these smart speakers or smart displays.\n\nBetter yet, they work with any Echo, and CNN Underscored has reviewed nearly all of the Echo family: Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Studio, Echo Flex, Echo Show 5, Echo Show 8 and Echo Show. We have a guide here for how to set them up.\n\nBut after you've entered the world of Alexa, it can be a challenge to discover all the features you'll really like. So let's dive into some tips and tricks for Alexa and your Echo.\n\nReminders and alarms\n\nIf you're the forgetful type, you can use Alexa to set up reminders and alarms. All you have to do is say, Alexa, then tell her what you want to be reminded of and when. The same goes for alarms. To edit or create them manually, open the Alexa app, access the menu (the three white bars on the top left), then tap Reminders & Alarms. You can even set them to repeat or modify the sound your alarms make.\n\nSports updates\n\nOn top of asking Alexa general questions about recent sporting events, you can actually get her to keep track of your favorite teams. From the menu in the top left, select Settings and then Sports Update. Once you're there, you can compile a list of your teams. After this setup, you can ask Alexa for a sports update and she'll let you know how your teams have been stacking up.\n\nAmazon orders with Alexa\n\nPHOTO: Jacob Krol/CNN\n\nThis one's so deceptively simple that you may not even think of it. With Alexa, you can order items on Amazon with just your voice. Running low on paper towels? Just tell Alexa to add the item to your shopping cart, then tell her to order the items in your cart. Just keep an eye on your cart contents in case you tend to window-shop.\n\nRead with Alexa\n\nThe best way to get Alexa to read one of your audiobooks that you have with Kindle is to simply ask her. You can even jump to different pages or chapters. Alternatively, you can have her read one using the Alexa app. Just go to the menu, tap Music, then Video & Books, then Audible. After that, you can tap the audiobook you want and get started.\n\nUber or Lyft\n\nOne of Alexa's many skills is her ability to call an Uber or Lyft for you. Just open the Amazon app, go to Skills & Games and search for your service of choice, using the magnifying glass on the top right. You will then have to log in and either verify your account or tap Allow. Now you can ask for a ride just using Alexa, and even specify what kind you need or find out pricing before you order one. As a note, make sure your device has your home address. To do so, head to the menu, tap Settings, then specify your home address. You can add more locations too, such as a work address.\n\nTravel\n\nPHOTO: Jacob Krol/CNN\n\nOne skill that'll really surprise you is Alexa's ability to check on airport security queue times. Yes, Alexa's aptly named Airport Security Line Wait Times skill keeps track of over 450 US airports. Just look up your airport's abbreviated code and find out your terminal, then ask, Alexa, ask Security Line what is the wait time for my airport and terminal?\n\nDrop-In and calls\n\nThe Alexa app has a few communication options you may find useful. Within the app, tap the Communicate tab on the bottom, which looks like a chat bubble. First off, you have the option to call or message someone from your contacts. If you don't see anyone listed, you can add a contact or import them from the device running the app. You can also use the Drop-In feature to create a two-way call between your Amazon device and a friend's. Last but not least, you can make announcements to all your Alexa-enabled devices, even when you're away.\n\nWhisper mode\n\nIf you're looking to keep things quiet, you can enable Alexa's Whisper mode. The primary method is to just tell her to do it, saying something like, Alexa, turn on Whisper mode. Otherwise, you can activate it from the Alexa app. Go to the menu, tap Settings, then select Voice Responses. That option will be under the Alexa Preferences bar. Finally, enable Whisper mode by flipping the adjacent switch to the right.\n\nSmart devices\n\nPHOTO: Jacob Krol/CNN\n\nThere's plenty of tech out there to make your home smarter, much of which Alexa can interact with. Just open your Alexa app, tap the menu, then tap Add Device. You'll get a sizable list of types of devices (scroll down for more), and after tapping one, you can select the brand. You can hook up smart bulbs, cameras, plugs, speakers, microwaves, slow cookers — the list goes on. A particularly useful device by Amazon is the Echo Flex, which plugs into any outlet to let you interact with Alexa in that room. Depending on the device's brand, you may receive further instructions in the Alexa app.\n\nRoutines\n\nWith Alexa, you can set up routines where she'll give you specific information and perform specific actions at the drop of a phrase. From the Alexa app, go to the menu and select Routines. After you click the plus icon, you can name your routine, specify a phrase to activate it (such as Alexa, good morning) and add actions. Actions range from playing music and giving you traffic or weather information to briefing you on new emails, and much more. Of course, you can also use these to activate devices like those discussed in our previous tip.\n\nAlexa Guard\n\nMan's best friend has been pulling guard duty in our homes for decades, but it's time to give Fido a break. With Alexa Guard, you can turn your Echo smart speakers into security devices. Once the feature is enabled, your Echo devices can listen for signs of trouble — breaking glass, smoke alarm and doors opening, among others — and then contact emergency services if necessary. It's not quite as robust as a professional security system, but it's a helpful monitoring system when old Fido is too lazy to get off the couch.\n\nGet nutrition tips\n\nIf you're looking to fine-tune your diet with some healthy suggestions, Alexa can provide nutrition information sourced from Mayo Clinic. Before you start any kind of nutrition program, it's important you speak with your primary doctor. But Alexa is a quick way to get educated and learn about the importance of good nutrition. Just say, Alexa, give me a nutrition tip.\n\nCheck the weather report\n\nPHOTO: Jacob Krol/CNN\n\nBack in the day you had to watch your local news to get up-to-the-minute weather information. With Alexa, you have your own personal weather forecaster who can provide the current temperature at a moment's notice. Simply say, Alexa, what's the weather like outside? and she will tell you if you need an umbrella or if it's time to throw on some SPF 30.\n\nGet your heart rate up\n\nAlexa has access to a number of workout skills designed to raise your heart rate. One of our favorites is 7-Minute Workout, which features a variety of exercises to help you achieve your fitness goals. You can tailor your experience by choosing your preferred workout style, such as low impact, and even ask to target a specific muscle group. To get started, tell Alexa to start 7-Minute Workout, and you'll be guided through an exercise routine.\n\nPlay some games\n\nAlexa doesn't just provide you with helpful information; the assistant also likes to have fun. The next time you get together with friends and family (lockdown restrictions permitting), ask Alexa to play a game. There are a variety to choose from, including 20 Questions, Jeopardy and Bingo, among others. If you don't have an old-fashioned board game in the hall closet, Alexa is a good way to get the party started.\n\nCheck the news\n\nIf you don't have time to read the news, Alexa has you covered. There are a variety of news sources to choose from. Just say, Alexa, what's my flash briefing? and you'll hear the latest news and breaking news for US, world, weather, entertainment, politics and health.\n\nStart your engines\n\nAlexa, start my car is the type of phrase you'd expect in The Jetsons, but it's actually real life. There are a number of skills from top auto makers that allow you to start your car remotely, change the interior temperature and lock or unlock doors. Of course, you'll need a compatible car, but there are skills from Hyundai, Ford and Tesla, to name just a few.\n\nWe'll be updating this list from time to time as we discover more cool features, but don't be afraid to explore Alexa's many skills for yourself.
New York's ambitious tuition-free plan was debated for more than six hours Tuesday at the state legislature's first public hearing on the matter.\n\nGovernor Andrew Cuomo announced his plan to make in-state public colleges tuition free earlier this month alongside Bernie Sanders. But it's not something lawmakers are going to green-light easily.\n\nOn Tuesday, state legislators discussed who would be eligible, how much it would cost taxpayers, and if it a tuition-free policy is the best way to make college more affordable for New York families.\n\nCuomo put the proposal in this year's budget, which means it must be reviewed and voted on by the legislature before April 1.\n\nAs proposed, New York could be the first state to make tuition free at both community colleges and four-year degree programs statewide. (Rhode Island is considering a similar proposal during the state's budget negotiations, and both Tennessee and Oregon have made two-year community college programs tuiton-free.)\n\nStudents at New York's public colleges -- SUNY and CUNY schools -- would pay nothing for tuition as long as they fell below an income cap, which would be phased in over the first three years of the program. It would first apply to families who earn $100,000 this year, then to those who earn $110,000 or less next year, and eventually reaching $120,000 or less in 2019.\n\nThere's still a couple of months to hammer out the details -- and for lawmakers to decide whether or not the program, called the Excelsior Scholarship, should be in the state budget at all.\n\nHere are some parts of the plan that drew the most concern from lawmakers on Tuesday:\n\nExcluding part-time students\n\nAs proposed, only those students who enroll in at least 15 credits a semester would be eligible. It's designed to encourage students to complete their degrees on time.\n\nBut this would work against students who go part time so that they can also work, because they have a family, or because they have a disability.\n\n'Free-tuition' doesn't mean it's a free ride\n\nFor those who do qualify for the free-tuition plan, they're still on the hook to pay for room and board, fees, books or other living expenses -- which can cost more than tuition itself.\n\nAverage tuition at SUNY costs $6,470 a year, but fees and room and board cost an additional $14,000.\n\nAssemblyman Victor Pichardo suggested it might make sense to change the formula so that award money could cover some living costs for the neediest students.\n\nHow much will it cost the state?\n\nThe cost of the program is still unclear. The governor's office estimates it will start at $163 million in the first year, but some lawmakers say that's low-balling it.\n\nIf it was that inexpensive to do, we would have done it a long time ago, Assemblyman James Skoufis told CNNMoney. He proposed a bill three years ago that would have made tuition free.\n\nThe state already spends $1 billion on need-based financial aid for student scholarships alone.\n\nRelated: Average college degree pays off by age 34\n\nThe chancellors at both the SUNY and CUNY systems testified Tuesday that they had teams crunching the numbers, but cannot yet estimate how many of their students would be eligible.\n\nSUNY Chancellor Nancy Zimpher said that 80,000 of the system's students last year were from families who would meet the income criteria and are enrolled in 15 credit hours.\n\nBut that number does not factor in that half of SUNY students already pay nothing for tuition because they get federal Pell grants and/or the state's need-based Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) award. Those students would not get any more money under the free-tuition proposal because it's structured to cover the remaining cost to the student after accounting for other types of financial aid.\n\nWill increased enrollment jeopardize quality?\n\nBoth Zimpher and CUNY Chancellor James Milliken agreed that enrollment would increase if the tuition-free plan was enacted, but neither could estimate by how much.\n\nZimpher expects it to increase applications from low-income students who may have gotten significant financial aid under the current system, but weren't aware of those aid programs and didn't think college was an option for them.\n\nJust putting the term 'tuition-free' out there will move the dial on access, she said.\n\nA handful of lawmakers expressed concern about jeopardizing the quality of the SUNY and CUNY systems by bringing more students in.\n\nBoth school systems are working to determine what max capacity would be. And Milliken said CUNY plans to offer more online courses in the future, which could help with an increase in enrollment.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said students would be required to take 15 credits a year. In fact it's 15 credits per semester.
(CNN) —\n\nTwo decades after taking a baby from a hospital and raising the child as her own, a South Carolina woman pleaded guilty Monday to kidnapping and interference with custody, prosecutors said.\n\nGloria Williams, 52, allegedly posed as a hospital nurse and took Kamiyah Mobley only hours after she was born on July 10, 1998, at a Jacksonville, Florida, hospital. The infant's mother, Shanara Mobley, told investigators a woman she thought was a nurse entered her room. The new mother asked the woman to place her daughter in a baby carrier, but the nurse instead left with the newborn, according to an incident report filed with the sheriff's office.\n\nAuthorities said Williams used fraudulent documents to establish a new identity for the child and raise her in Walterboro, South Carolina, northwest of Charleston. That child, now 19, goes by the name Williams gave her – Alexis Manigo.\n\nProsecutors are seeking up to 22 years in prison on the kidnapping charge and up to five years on the interference charge under the negotiated plea deal, said David Chapman, a spokesman for the Florida state's attorney office for the fourth judicial circuit. Sentencing is set for the first week of May.\n\nThis is a range that we are good with, zero to 22 years, but it will be up to the judge to decide, Chapman said\n\nPHOTO: Facebook Alexis Manigo, born as Kamiyah Mobley\n\nWilliams, who appeared in a Jacksonville courtroom on Monday, could have faced up to life in prison if the case had gone to trial and ended with a conviction. Williams' attorney, Diana L.

We definitely felt like we were in some small way a part of history, says Nour. That created a real feeling of sisterhood among the founding players, and even now as the people on the league have come and gone, that sisterhood remains. Pictured: Nermine Abi Aad, jewelry designer; and Nouran El Kabbany, a graphic designer.\n\nThe CaiRollers specifically came into being at a time when things were really changing in Egypt and we definitely felt like we were in some small way a part of history, says Susan Nour, one of CaiRoller's founding players. Their first games were held after the revolution that brought down Mubarak's rule of almost 30 years.\n\nRoller derby first took off as a competitive sport in the United States in the 1930s. Since its 2001 revival on a flat, rather than oval track, roller derby has been experiencing something of a resurgence globally, and even more so in the unlikeliest of capitals - Shanghai, Beijing, Johannesburg, Dubai, Seoul and Daegu in South Korea - all boast teams. Pictured: A few of CaiRoller's 25 strong team prior to practice.\n\nCaiRollers consist of working women - teachers, social workers, engineers, architects, researchers, and even a pharmacist - all spend twice weekly evenings on the derby track. In line with tradition, the players adopt unique names that reflect their alter ego and on-track persona.

Boots strapped, helmet fastened, mouth guard in place, she braces herself for the hits and knocks that will inevitably come.\n\nThe trick to minimizing unsightly bruises, is to learn to fall in the right way. Even before we learn how to skate we learn how to fall, laughs Diab, a 24-year-old research analyst.\n\nEgypt is famous for many things, but roller derby isn't one of them. Diab along with her fiercely competitive teammates known as the CaiRollers want to change this.\n\nJust 25 girls make up the team created over four years ago – hardly enough for a sporting revolution – but the CaiRollers are focused towards a slow and steady track to derby hegemony.\n\nThey'll be anchoring for a win in a competition against Abu Dhabi this month, and later in April, they'll take on Marseilles' league. Taking place at Cairo's International stadium, both games will be the first significant derby matches within the Arab world.\n\nThey are just friendly games but I think it might be something in the future, says Diab. Maybe we'll have a small tournament … in this part of the world, she adds.\n\nGlobal comeback\n\nPHOTO: J. A.

It's not the thing that you expect from the culture and the Arab girl so it was very interesting to try that out, recalls Diab. No one had heard about the game before here in the region.\n\nThe group has more than doubled in size since its formation in 2012 by two American teachers and is almost exclusively made up of Egyptian women.\n\nChanging stereotypes\n\nChallenging perceptions further, far from being students, the CaiRollers are mostly working women - teachers, social workers, engineers, architects, researchers, and even a pharmacist - all spend twice weekly evenings on the derby track.\n\nI have played sports all my life, but there's something about being able to play such a rough and tumble game, says Susan Nour, a teacher and one of CaiRoller's founding players.\n\nShe adds: There is aggression, there is hitting but there are also strict rules. There are social and psychological parts to the game.\n\nFor Egyptian players however, it's an expensive sport, gear has to be ordered from abroad, which incurs shipping costs.\n\nWatch: Africa's deadliest striker follows his father\n\nYou can spend between $100 to $200 on very basic skates and $300 to $400 on upgraded vinyl or leather skates so there are quite high initial costs, explains Nour.\n\nEquipment costs can quickly spiral to the total of an average month's salary in Egypt. However, there is some reprieve for cash strapped enthusiasts – helmets and protective gear can be rented at a fraction of the price.\n\nWhat keeps the women attached to the game are ideas around female camaraderie - a core theme of the sport. We are not just friends on the track, we are also friends outside the track, says Diab.\n\nSkating, after revolution\n\nThe CaiRollers came into being at a time when things were changing at speed in Egypt notes Nour. Their first games were held after the Tahrir Square protests that eventually brought down Hosni Mubarak's rule of almost 30 years. Many of the girls were part of the protests and derby, for them, embodied the spirit of female empowerment.\n\nWe definitely felt like we were in some small way a part of history, Nour says, that created a real feeling of sisterhood among the founding players, and even now as the people on the league have come and gone, that sisterhood remains.\n\nFor Diab, it's also a crucial international network. She was hosted by Abu Dhabi's crew of rollers during a trip to the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIf you are a derby skater then all the rest of the [global] derby skaters are your sisters, says Diab,roller derby girls have this bond that stretches beyond borders.\n\nHer teammate, Nour agrees, We've gotten so much support from roller derby leagues around the world in the form of gear donations, shout outs and just plain love. It's truly a powerful and empowering sport.

(CNN) Maybe the fiasco of the late reporting results from the Iowa caucus this year will have a positive legacy -- the end of the caucus process and the invitation to another state to start the delegate selection process.\n\nThe caucuses are an embarrassment to the Democratic Party and the United States. This is no way to pick a nominee.\n\nIt's not just that the Iowa caucus is unrepresentative demographically -- more than 90% white. It's far more white than a national party that prizes its diversity. The problem is even more fundamental.\n\nConsider the secret ballot, a foundational value in democratic systems. The caucus is a public process, so that neighbors must advertise their choices in public. This is just wrong.\n\nBut the problem is much worse. The caucuses -- especially in this cursed year -- demand hours of commitment. This limits the number, and kind, of people who can attend, despite Iowa Democrats allowing satellite caucuses this year. Many people who work at night still cannot attend. People who care for children or other relatives cannot attend. People who have other commitments cannot attend.\n\nRead More

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nLawyers working for former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort accidentally revealed on Tuesday the clearest public evidence of coordination between the campaign and Russians, adding new details to the murky mosaic of potential collusion in 2016 – including sharing polling data with an alleged Russian operative.\n\nThe explosive new information was buried in a court filing from Manafort's lawyers, though the portions about his contacts with a shadowy Russian during the campaign were meant to be redacted.\n\nBut the document was fully searchable, even the blacked-out parts, revealing fresh details about the core of the ongoing investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the latest disclosures and how they might fit into the existing puzzle.\n\nRelationship with Kilimnik\n\nClose watchers of the investigation have been intrigued by the still-developing role of Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian political consultant who worked closely with Manafort in Ukraine. They helped Moscow-friendly politicians get elected and hold onto power for nearly a decade.\n\nManafort and Kilimnik stayed in touch after their Ukrainian clients were ousted in 2014. They met twice in the United States during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to their own public statements. News reports have detailed their phone calls and emails in 2016, including one exchange where Manafort tried to use Kilimnik to reach a prominent Russian oligarch.\n\nBut Tuesday's filing revealed they had a third meeting, this time in the Spanish capital of Madrid. One redacted portion quoted Mueller's team: After being told that Mr. Kilimnik had traveled to Madrid on the same day that Mr. Manafort was in Madrid, Mr. Manafort 'acknowledged' that he and Mr. Kilimnik met while they were both in Madrid. A spokesman for Manafort sought to clarify the filing in a statement Tuesday night, saying that the third meeting happened in early 2017, after the election.\n\nThe growing list of Manafort-Kilimnik contacts could be relevant to the collusion question because, according to previous court filings from Mueller, the FBI has assessed that Kilimnik has ties to a Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016.\n\nMany of their contacts happened while the Russian government was aggressively meddling in the US election. Court filings said Kilimnik was affiliated with the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency that was responsible for hacking Democratic targets and orchestrating the WikiLeaks releases.\n\nCNN reported in February 2017 that Manafort was among a handful of senior Trump advisers who were in constant communication with suspected Russian operatives during the campaign. At the time, Manafort told CNN in a statement, that is 100% not true, at least as far as me.\n\nSharing campaign polls\n\nBeyond the fact that Manafort was in regular touch with Kilimnik, the unredacted court filings shed new light on the content of some of their conversations. For the first time, the public learned that Manafort shared polling data about the 2016 campaign with his Russian friend.\n\nIssues and communications related to Ukrainian political events simply were not at the forefront of Mr. Manafort's mind during the period at issue and it is not surprising at all that Mr. Manafort was unable to recall specific details prior to having his recollection refreshed, Manafort's lawyers wrote. The same is true with regard to the Government's allegation that Mr. Manafort lied about sharing polling data with Mr. Kilimnik related to the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThere aren't any additional details – all this tells us is that Mueller believes that Manafort fed polling data to Kilimnik, possibly even polls commissioned by the Trump campaign.\n\nPolling data is a key part of any modern political operation – presidential campaigns and outside groups like super PACs spend millions of dollars on polls. These numbers can drive decisions on messaging, where to campaign and advertising, both on television and in the digital space.\n\nTrump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale ran Trump's data team in 2016. They've publicly touted about how they used data to target voters.\n\nIt's possible Manafort innocuously gave the polls to Kilimnik because he is a political junkie and wanted to dig into the crosstabs. But there's also a possibility that Kilimnik, with his active ties to Russian intelligence, funneled the information to Russian agents to influence the election.\n\nThe primary suspect would be the troll farm in St. Petersburg that essentially acted as a pro-Trump super PAC and pumped out political propaganda to millions of Americans on social media during the 2016 race. These messages can be targeted to specific demographics based on polling data. There aren't any publicly known ties between Kilimnik and the troll farm.\n\nUkraine peace plan\n\nTuesday's filing also unintentionally disclosed that Manafort and Kilimnik discussed a Ukraine peace plan.\n\nAfter being shown documents, Mr. Manafort 'conceded' that he discussed or may have discussed a Ukraine peace plan with Mr. Kilimnik on more than one occasion, the filing said. The document was filed by Manafort's team, but this line appears to quote a past Mueller filing.\n\nThe filing revealed no details about what the Ukraine plan would entail. After Manafort's clients were ousted in 2014, Russian forced annexed Crimea and Kremlin-backed proxies invaded eastern Ukraine. Western nations condemned the moves and have applied economic sanctions against Moscow ever since. The diplomatic and military crisis is ongoing.\n\nThe news that Manafort was in talks with Kilimnik about a Ukraine peace plan is interesting, because it's not the first time the Ukraine conflict became an issue inside Trump's orbit.\n\nDuring the 2016 Republican National Convention, Trump campaign officials intervened to change language in the GOP platform about the Ukraine conflict. Their actions blocked a provision that called on the US to arm the Ukrainian government to fight the Russian proxies.\n\nAt the time, Manafort denied that the Trump campaign was involved. He also said he was not personally involved in any effort to change the platform and learned of it from news reports.\n\nThe Ukraine issue came up again shortly before Trump's inauguration.\n\nAn informal Ukraine peace plan was hatched at a January 2017 meeting between Trump's longtime attorney and fixer Michael Cohen, former Trump business partner Felix Sater and Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Artemenko. The proposal was seen by some as friendly to Moscow.\n\nCohen confirmed to CNN that the meeting took place but denied discussing Ukraine. In comments to other news organizations, Cohen acknowledged the so-called peace plan and said he delivered the proposal to the office of then-national security adviser Michael Flynn. The White House denied that anyone ever received any documents from Cohen about Ukraine.\n\nIt is not clear if this proposal was related in any way to the plan that Manafort discussed with Kilimnik. There aren't any publicly known ties between Artemenko and Kilimnik, though Kilimnik is an insider in Ukrainian political circles and has relationships with many lawmakers there. Artemenko has cooperated with Mueller and testified before the grand jury last summer.\n\nCNN's Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.
Editor's Note: Grace Forrest is a founding director of Walk Free Foundation, an international organization focused on the eradication of modern slavery. Davina Durgana is a report co-author and senior statistician on the Walk Free Foundation's Global Slavery Index. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nOn any given day in 2016, 40.3 million people were living in slavery – more than the populations of Australia, Portugal and Costa Rica combined.\n\nWhen this startling research, The Global Estimates of Modern Slavery, was released at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2017, it revealed the true scale of this often-invisible scourge. A crime thought to be left in the 19th century, not only existing but thriving in the present day.\n\nPHOTO: Grace Forrest, Walk Free Foundation Grace Forrest\n\nThe pioneering data set was the culmination of years of hard work between the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Walk Free Foundation, in partnership with the International Organisation for Migration.\n\nThe research provides governments with a baseline estimate of the problem, and encouragingly, some are already acting.\n\nTackling slavery across borders\n\nIn January, the Canadian government announced the creation of an independent ombudsman to investigate allegations of human rights abuses linked to Canadian corporate activity overseas.\n\nPHOTO: Davina P. Durgana, Walk Free Foundation Davina Durgana\n\nThis means the Canadian government is actively working to scrutinize and eliminate slavery, especially forced labor, within global supply chains.\n\nRead more on modern-day slavery\n\nA country like Canada showing leadership on this issue is something to be celebrated and marks a major development in the international debate.\n\nIt is in line with the research partners' call for global cooperation between governments, organizations and the business community to tackle modern slavery across sectors and borders. A crime this large and far-reaching requires a transnational and cross-sector response.\n\nExploiting the vulnerable\n\nGlobal slavery is one of the most profitable criminal industries in the world. Despite this it is largely invisible, in part because in many societies it disproportionately affects the most vulnerable and marginalized. That is why measuring this problem is so crucial in exposing and ultimately resolving it.\n\nWomen and girls are disproportionately affected by modern slavery, accounting for 28.7 million, or 71 per cent of the overall total, 84 per cent of victims of forced marriage and 99 per cent of victims of forced labor in the commercial sex industry, according to the Global Estimates.\n\nRead more: Women and girls are key to slavery fight\n\nThe Global Estimates included forced marriage – finding about 15 million people were in forced marriages around the world.\n\nMore than one third of all of these victims were children at the time of the marriage, and almost all child victims were girls. This is an area that still requires significant global intervention.\n\nIn the Global Estimates, forced marriage refers to situations where people, regardless of their age, were forced to marry without their consent. This can happen through physical, emotional or financial duress, deception or the use of force and threats.\n\nIt has been recognized for more than 60 years that forced marriage is in international law a slavery-like practice. Once forced to marry, all too often victims of forced marriage are subjected to other human rights abuses, including sexual and domestic servitude, and forced labor. Children are particularly vulnerable in these situations.\n\nBuilding tangible change\n\nThe Global Estimates of Modern Slavery represented a milestone achievement for the field. It is the baseline foundation on which we now must take action and build tangible change.\n\nFrom the data we have collected over the last five years, we know that 89 million people have experienced some form of modern slavery during that time – for periods ranging from a few days to the entire five years.\n\nIt is important to reflect on the significant challenges that remain. While the odds may seem overwhelming, we must remember that the challenges that face us are man-made.\n\nEach and every individual has the right and the power to continue this momentum by applying pressure to governments and corporates.\n\nThis report should serve as a sharp reminder to all world leaders about the responsibility they have in individually and collectively tackling this problem. We must work collaboratively and effectively to finally eradicate modern slavery in this century.\n\nNational governments must take responsibility for modern slavery at home and be accountable for the slavery that may permeate their borders through long supply chains.\n\nThe Global Estimates provides governments with clear visibility of a problem that has long been overlooked. Ignorance is no longer an excuse.\n\nWe cannot accept that on any given day there are tens of millions of people living in modern slavery.
Daisy Carrington Tiffany Ap , for CNN Written by\n\nDubai, long champion of all things biggest longest and most expensive , will soon have some competition from neighboring Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 13 – Step inside the Jeddah Tower The world's next tallest building, the Jeddah Tower, is scheduled to be completed by 2020 in Saudi Arabia. This 3,280-feet tower will be taller than the Dubai's iconic Burf Khalifa. Credit: CNN\n\nDubai's iconic Burj Khalifa , the world's tallest building, could be stripped of its Guinness title if Saudi Arabia succeeds in its plans to construct the even larger Jeddah Tower -- a prospect looking more likely as funds for the $1.23 billion project have been secured.\n\nA Saudi government press release on Sunday said Jeddah Economic Company and Saudi Arabia's Alinma Investment had signed a financing deal for 8.4 billion Saudi riyals (or $2.2 billion) to build Jeddah City, including the sky-piercing tower.\n\nChinese skyscraper built in 19 working days\n\nThe project is currently built up to the 26th floor, it added. The 3,280-feet (1 kilometer) skyscraper is scheduled for completion in 2020 . The Burj Khalifa, by comparison, stands at a meeker 2,716 feet, or 827 meters.\n\nWith this deal, we will reach new, as yet unheard of highs in real estate development, and will fulfill the company's objective of creating a world-class urban center that offers an advanced lifestyle, so that Jeddah may have a new iconic landmark that attracts people from all walks of society with comprehensive services and a multitude of uses, said Mounib Hammoud, Chief Executive Officer of Jeddah Economic Company.\n\nAn architectural feat\n\nPreviously dubbed Kingdom Tower, the building will boast 200 floors and overlook the Red Sea. Constructing it will require about 5.7 million square feet of concrete and 80,000 tons of steel, according to the Saudi Gazette\n\nBuilding a structure that tall, particularly on the coast, where saltwater could potentially damage it, is no easy feat. The foundations, which will be 200 feet (60 meters) deep, need to be able to withstand the saltwater of the nearby ocean. As a result, Advanced Construction Technology Services will test the strength of different concretes.\n\nWind load is another issue for buildings of this magnitude. To counter this challenge, the tower will change shape regularly.\n\nShadowless skyscraper: A game-changing architectural concept?\n\nBecause it changes shape every few floors, the wind loads go round the building and won't be as extreme as on a really solid block, Gordon Gill explained to Construction Weekly . Gill is a partner at Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture , the design architects for the project.\n\nDelivering the concrete to higher floors will also be a challenge. Possibly, engineers could use similar methods to those employed when building the Burj Khalifa; 6 million cubic feet of concrete was pushed through a single pump, usually at night when temperatures were low enough to ensure that it would set.\n\nThough ambitious, building the Kingdom Tower should be feasible, according to Sang Dae Kim, the director of the Council on Tall Buildings\n\nAt this point in time we can build a tower that is one kilometer, maybe two kilometers. Any higher than that and we will have to do a lot of homework, he told Construction Weekly.

A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here\n\nLondon (CNN Business) After the elections in November, Wall Street put predictions of a blue wave aside. Now, investors are once again reckoning with the possibility that for the next two years, Democrats could control both chambers of Congress and the White House.\n\nWhat's happening: CNN projects that Rev. Raphael Warnock will defeat Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, while the race between Republican Sen. David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff remains too close to call.\n\nWall Street, however, is acting like an Ossoff win is likely, as investors scramble to readjust their portfolios. Nasdaq futures were last down 2.2%, while the yield on benchmark 10-year US Treasuries jumped above 1% for the first time since March.\n\nSince November, investors have been betting that government in Washington would remain divided, restraining more ambitious Democratic policy efforts that could hit corporate earnings and the stock market.\n\nBut with Democrats closing in on 50 seats in the Senate, that calculus is changing.\n\nMarkets seem to be fussing that a Democratic sweep in the Georgia Senate election runoffs will lead to higher taxes, tech regulation, a sharper environmental focus and bigger moves towards wealth redistribution, Axi chief global market strategist Stephen Innes said.\n\nConcerns about a crackdown on the tech sector are front and center. Facebook's stock is off 3% in premarket trading, while shares in Amazon, Apple and Google parent Alphabet are all down more than 2%.\n\nThe extent of the risk, however, remains up for debate. Alec Phillips, chief US political economist at Goldman Sachs, pointed out Wednesday that 60 votes will still be needed for most Senate legislation. Bipartisan support would still be necessary to pass legislation on issues like infrastructure, a minimum wage increase, tech regulation and environmental policies, he said.\n\nWhile change is in the air for the US, changes in US legislation may not be very radical, Berenberg chief economist Holger Schmieding told clients, noting that more progressive bills may fall flat with moderate Democrats.\n\nPlus, a blue wave is expected to unleash another round of stimulus spending to support the economy during the pandemic — a big positive for markets. Phillips said Goldman Sachs has penciled in another $600 billion package in the near-term under this scenario.\n\nOil prices reach their highest level since February\n\nSaudi Arabia's decision to voluntarily cut oil production has sent global crude prices to their highest level in more than 10 months.\n\nThe latest: The kingdom said Tuesday that it will reduce output by 1 million barrels per day from January's levels.\n\nWe do that willingly and we do that with the purpose of supporting our economy, the economies of our colleagues, Saudi Minister of Energy Prince Abdulaziz Bin Salman said during a press conference.\n\nBroadly, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied producers have agreed to hold production steady in February and March, my CNN Business colleagues Charles Riley and Chris Liakos report. While Russia and Kazakhstan will produce more oil over the coming months under a deal reached this week, the impact may be offset by Saudi Arabia's pullback.\n\nThe news has sent Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, to $54.24 per barrel. Prices haven't been that high since last February. US oil is trading at $50.24 per barrel.\n\nBeyond the headlines, however, analysts are concerned that disagreement among oil producers is growing as the pandemic drags on. While some countries — like Saudi Arabia — are worried that new lockdowns and economic uncertainty could weigh on demand, others, like Russia, are eager to get pumping again.\n\nRystad Energy analyst Louise Dickson said that two factions have emerged within the OPEC+ group.\n\nThe division is a blow to the alliance, raising again the question of whether or not its members, with very different agendas and production structure, can continue to work together, Dickson said.\n\nThe last time the group splintered, back in March, a brief but intense battle for market share ensued between Saudi Arabia and Russia, sending oil prices crashing.\n\nTrump confronts China again with new executive order\n\nPresident Donald Trump keeps piling pressure on Chinese tech companies in the closing days of his administration — though it's not clear his latest actions will have real bite.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump signed an executive order banning transactions with eight Chinese apps, including Ant Group's Alipay, my CNN Business colleagues Jason Hoffman and Jill Disis report. The order will also hit Tencent's QQ Wallet and WeChat Pay, as well as the apps CamScanner, SHAREit, VMate and WPS Office.\n\nRemember: Prior efforts targeting Chinese tech firms have run into trouble.\n\nAn order banning WeChat downloads in the United States was temporarily blocked by a federal judge, and multiple courts have issued temporary injunctions against the administration's attempts to ban the short-form video app TikTok.\n\nThe new order is also set to take effect in 45 days. That's after Trump leaves office.\n\nThe Trump administration is still rushing through its list of penalties to restrict the US-China relationship in hope of inducing China into retaliating, further worsening ties, and tying [President-elect Joe] Biden's hands, said Scott Kennedy, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. While the restrictions on these apps are meant to be highly disruptive, it remains to be seen whether they will actually be implemented, he added.\n\nUp next\n\nThe ADP private employment report for December arrives at 8:15 a.m. ET. US crude oil inventories follow at 10:30 a.m. ET.\n\nComing tomorrow: Initial claims for unemployment benefits are forecast to rise to 800,000.
(CNN) South Korea recorded more deaths than births in 2020 for the first time ever, prompting calls for action to revive the country's falling fertility rate.\n\nFor years, South Korea has struggled with a growing demographic crisis. The country's fertility rate -- the average number of children a woman will have in her lifetime -- has repeatedly hit record lows, and ranks near the bottom of the lowest fertility rates in the world. Meanwhile, South Korea's population continues to age, sending the country into a demographic decline.\n\nBut last year's census data, released by the Ministry of Interior and Safety on Monday, appears even more alarming.\n\nThere were only 275,815 births, a record low -- compared to 307,764 deaths, a 3.1% increase in fatalities from the previous year. This is the first time South Korea has hit the population death cross, when the number of deaths surpasses births, the ministry said in a news release -- and the first time the total population has shrunk.\n\nThe population continues to age rapidly, the census showed: 32.7% of people are in their 40s and 50s, and nearly a quarter are over the age of 60.\n\nRead More
Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton blasts Sen. Bernie Sanders in a new documentary, saying nobody likes him and declining in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter to say whether she would endorse and campaign for him if he's the Democratic 2020 nominee.\n\nJUST WATCHED Sanders on Clinton comment: On a good day, my wife likes me Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Sanders on Clinton comment: On a good day, my wife likes me 01:10\n\nHe was in Congress for years. He had one senator support him. Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done, Clinton says in the film, according to The Hollywood Reporter. He was a career politician. It's all just baloney and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it.\n\nThe comments in the documentary are aimed directly at his core campaign appeal -- that he's a political outsider pitching revolutionary change.\n\nThe new round of lacerating attacks come less than two weeks before the Iowa caucuses, which Clinton narrowly won in 2016 and where Sanders is locked in a tight four-way race this year. They also have the potential to reignite a divisive, four-year-old fight that has never fully faded from Democrats' minds. More recently, and in comments since her loss to President Donald Trump, Clinton has blamed Sanders for damaging her campaign.\n\nIn response to Clinton's remarks, Sanders said in a statement that his focus was President Donald Trump's impeachment trial.\n\nRead More

I didn't know what I wanted to do. I shucked oysters; I was a hostess; I was a bartender; I was a waitress; I painted houses; I sold vacuum cleaners … I thought I would finally settle on some job, and make enough money to pay my rent.\n\nBut after a personal tragedy, DeGeneres began writing, and she penned a piece that would change her life.\n\nWhat poured out of me was an imaginary conversation with God, which was one-sided, and I finished writing it, and I looked at it and said to myself …. I'm going to do this on 'The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,' DeGeneres told the Tulane students.\n\nIn 1986, despite never having intended to pursue stand-up comedy, DeGeneres did in fact get her spot on The Tonight Show – and the rest is history, including her sitcom that featured a lead character coming out as gay, Ellen.\n\nAsk DeGeneres, as author Yael Kohen did in her book We Killed, and she'll tell you that she never intended to change anything. Yet by stumbling into stand-up, that's exactly what she did.\n\nHere are five other trailblazing funny women whose humble beginnings led to legendary careers.\n\nCarol Burnett\n\nPHOTO: Photofest\n\nFor Carl Reiner, the man behind genre-defining productions like The Dick Van Dyke Show, Carol Burnett is the single most talented performer ever.\n\nBut before she earned that title, breaking the sketch comedy mold with her namesake series in the late '60s, Burnett was a hat-check girl.\n\nBorn in Texas to parents who struggled with alcoholism, Burnett grew up as a child of modest means with her grandmother in Hollywood. She initially picked journalism as her field when she started at UCLA in 1951, but an acting class soon opened Burnett's mind to new possibilities.\n\nIn 1954, she packed up for New York with her sights set on a career in musical comedy. I had no plan. I don't know what I thought – I guess that I would land and all of a sudden there would be the flipping pages of a calendar and then you'd see me on Broadway, like in a movie, Burnett told The Washington Post. Instead, she found herself paying $18 a week to split one boardinghouse room five ways.\n\nHer first few years were spent hustling in search of her big break, but that's where grit came in: I was never afraid, Burnett recalled of her time entering show business. I knew in my heart I would make a living so that I could put food on the table, clothes on my back and pay the rent.\n\nAmy Poehler\n\nPHOTO: Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images for Relativity Media\n\nFor Amy Poehler, it was working part-time in a retro ice cream parlor before college that solidified her icy resolve.\n\nWhen she took the job, Poehler described in an essay for The New Yorker, she wasn't even sure she wanted to be bothered with show business at all.\n\nI was planning to go to Boston College as an English major and maybe become a teacher, like both of my parents, Poehler said. But the ice cream gig had a performance element to it, and Poehler found that when she stood in the dining room and demanded attention I was reminded of things I already secretly knew about myself. I wasn't shy, I liked to be looked at, and making people laugh released a certain kind of hot lava into my body that made me feel like a queen.\n\nAfter a summer spent taking sundae orders from teen boys who asked Poehler to hold their nuts, the future comedy star knew what was before her – and it didn't include an ice cream scoop or serenading patrons on their birthdays.\n\nI quit when the summer ended, Poehler recalled in her essay. I was angry; I wanted to be gone. … (I) was aching for what came next. I felt my whole life stretched out before me … I turned toward my future, mouth watering.\n\nTina Fey\n\nPHOTO: Theo Wargo/NBC/Getty Images for 'The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon'\n\nKnown today along with Amy Poehler as one of the women who has redefined American comedy, Tina Fey always knew where she wanted to be: in front of an audience, cracking jokes.\n\nSomewhere around the fifth or seventh grade I figured out that I could ingratiate myself to people by making them laugh, Fey told Believer magazine in 2003. After a while it became part of my identity. … I was already trying to define myself as 'the jokester.'\n\nSo when she landed in Chicago in the early '90s, she zeroed in on the iconic Second City, where she could study improv at night. And by day? The future first female head writer of Saturday Night Live could be found working the front desk at a local YMCA.\n\nI had the worst shift imaginable. Five-thirty in the morning 'til 2 in the afternoon, Fey told Believer. But I had my nights free to take classes at Second City. … I was very serious about it. I was like one of those athletes trying to get into the Olympics. It was all about blind focus. I was so sure that I was doing exactly what I'd been put on this Earth to do.\n\nPhyllis Diller\n\nPHOTO: Getty Images\n\nConsidered today to be the grande dame of comedy, a pioneer who kicked open the door for other women in stand-up, Phyllis Diller's career almost didn't happen.\n\nFor roughly the first two decades of her adult life, Diller was a housewife and mom of five kids. She was trained as a classical pianist but didn't work in music; in the early 1950s, right before she got her big break, she worked as a copywriter for the San Leandro News-Leader newspaper in Northern California to help pad her family's income.\n\nBut comedy was always as natural as breathing for Diller. According to the Los Angeles Times, Diller once said that from the age of 12 she found the only way to handle the terror of social situations was comedy — break the ice, make everybody laugh. I did it to make people feel more relaxed, including myself.\n\nShe was so funny that her husband encouraged her to try telling jokes professionally. Her first stand-up set came at San Francisco's Purple Onion Club on March 7, 1955. By the 1960s, Diller's career – and her trademark blond hair, eccentric outfits and groundbreaking quips about relationships, beauty and womanhood – was one for the history books.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg\n\nPHOTO: Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images for HBO\n\nThe comedic force who would one day win an Oscar for her supporting role in the 1990 movie Ghost (not to mention deliver the quote that launched 1,000 memes) worked among the dead while she was trying to make her way in show business.\n\nIt was the mid-'70s, and Goldberg moved from her native New York to California. Since she'd gone to beauty school, Goldberg did have options to support herself, although she might not have anticipated that she'd find work as a mortuary beautician.\n\nI was a hairdresser on dead people, the award-winning entertainer told Time magazine in 2010, which made it clear to me that you can be evicted at anytime. Make the best you can with the time you have.\n\nThat Goldberg did: In addition to winning an Oscar, she has also become a member of the limited and coveted EGOT club, having also earned Emmy, Grammy and Tony honors.
(CNN) — Through rainforest, over mountain ridges, across open plains, beside lakes and oceans, Australia has so much to offer the hiker who's prepared to pull their boots on and get stuck in.\n\nHere's our list of great hikes, taking from half a day to a week.\n\nAnd, if you're in the mood to run a cursor across a map, there's a handy chart of all 10 hikes, plus a few extras, right here\n\nMULTIDAY TREKS\n\n1. Overland Track, Tasmania\n\nSurvey the scenery at Mount Ossa. Courtesy brewbooks/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nWalkers can trek independently but must book with the Parks & Wildlife Service, or use one of the many guided-walk operators.\n\nWe went with Cradle Mountain Huts , known for its eco-friendly lodges tucked away from the track.\n\nHighlights include Marion's Lookout with (if the weather's good) great views of Cradle Mountain; Barn Bluff towering over an exposed alpine plateau; and the beautiful D'Alton and Ferguson Falls. Worth the challenge, weather permitting, is the five-hour side trip climbing Mount Ossa.\n\nOur guide points out two rocky towers, nicknamed The Gates of Mordor, after that dire place in The Lord of the Rings. And up we go.\n\n2. Larapinta Trail, Northern Territory\n\nTrek through rugged landscapes on the Larapinta Trail. Courtesy Andrew Dolman/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nThe Larapinta Trail winds through a rugged and ancient landscape in the Northern Territory.\n\nWaving goodbye to Alice Springs from the Euro Ridge, walkers head westward, experiencing the beauty of Simpsons Gap, Standley Chasm and Ormiston Gorge and ascending Mount Sonder at the end.\n\nBeing remote, this trail is best tackled on a group tour.\n\nMichele Eckersley of World Expeditions (WE) says: It's our No. 1 trek worldwide. Apart from the six-day classic experience -- support vehicles reduce the total walk -- there's also a 14-day end-to-end option (the whole 223 kilometers).\n\nBoth treks are organized by WE subsidiary Australian Walking Holidays.\n\n3. Great Ocean Walk, Victoria\n\nThe Twelve Apostles are a highlight of the Great Ocean Walk. Julian Finney/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nSince 2006, the Great Ocean Walk has enabled us to go where its namesake road could not.\n\nStretching 104 kilometers from Apollo Bay, the track meanders through gum and eucalypt forest, reaches Cape Otway Lightstation , traverses sand dunes, beaches and cliff-top tracks.\n\nThere are shipwrecks to inspect and magnificent views of the Twelve Apostles, those much-photographed limestone sea stacks. If you're walking independently, there's a shuttle service transporting gear from one stop to the next and visitvictoria.com has information.\n\nFor guided walks or self-guided inn-to-inn packages try auswalk.com.au\n\n4. Six Foot Track, New South Wales\n\nThe Jenolan Caves are some of the world's most spectacular cave formations. Courtesy russellstreet/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nMarked out in 1884 as a six-foot-wide (1.83 meters, if you really must know) track to allow loaded horses to pass each other while traveling from Katoomba to Jenolan Caves, the Six Foot Track in the Blue Mountains is iconic.\n\nTaking three days and two nights, the 44-kilometer track starts at the Explorers' Tree, drops into Megalong Valley and crosses Coxs River by the Bowtells Swing Suspension Bridge. Challenging climbs take walkers to the Black Range ridge before heading for the caves.\n\nFor independent walking information, check out Wild Walks . Wanting a more relaxed time? Try guided walks with life's an adventure -- they'll set up your tent and you'll just carry a day pack.\n\n5. Cape to Cape Walk, Western Australia\n\nCape Leeuwin is a lighthouse located on the most south-westerly point of Western Australia. Courtesy Amanda Slater/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nThis seven-day walk can be done independently or on a guided group tour with Inspiration Outdoors ; participants carry a day pack and accommodation and transport is included.\n\nThe track mostly follows the coast, sometimes along cliff-top paths, at other times crossing beautiful beaches. Several inland loops traverse sections of karri forest, while staff at the spectacular lighthouses at both ends run guided tours.\n\nONE-DAY TREKS\n\n6. Kosciuszko Walk, New South Wales\n\nLake Cootapatamba is a post-glacial lake. Courtesy Andrea Schaffer/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nFrom the Kosciuszko Express chairlift at Thredbo in the summer, a 14-kilometer return walk (five hours) goes to the summit of Mount Kosciuszko -- at 2,228 meters, Australia's highest peak.\n\nThe landscape features rocky granite outcrops, wildflowers and glacially carved Lake Cootapatamba.\n\nMany walkers seem oblivious to the stream near the trail, but we pause to see the beginning of a waterway that became a legend thanks to Banjo Paterson's poem The Man from Snowy River.\n\nPassing the sign at Rawson Pass, it's not much further before there's a carnival atmosphere among hikers who have made it to the top of Australia. The route's easy to do independently but guided walks are an option.\n\n7. Kings Canyon Rim Walk, Northern Territory\n\nThe reasonably fit should not be deterred by the 500-step climb to the top because it's then quite flat. This walk of six kilometers (four hours) follows the rim of Kings Canyon in a horseshoe fashion.\n\nThere's a sense of awe at this ancient land with 100-meter-high sheer cliff walls, weathered dome-like structures called the Lost City and the Garden of Eden with its permanent waterholes. It's enough to make one feel humbled.\n\nStay the night before being sure to start early to avoid hiking in the midday heat.\n\nKings Canyon Resort lays on various accommodation levels and guided tours.\n\n8. Dove Lake Circuit, Cradle Mountain National Park\n\nCradle Mountain is a mountain in the Central Highlands. Courtesy Atsushi Kase/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nThis six-kilometer walk leads around the shores of Dove Lake in Cradle Mountain-Lake St. Clair National Park in about two hours. It's an easy grade of walk, much of it on boardwalk, and one of Tasmania's most popular.\n\nHighlights include the much-photographed boat shed, built in 1940 by the first Ranger at Cradle Mountain, Glacier Rock, which bears the marks made by Ice Age glaciers and the peaceful cool temperate rainforest known as the Ballroom Forest.\n\nTowering above it all is Cradle Mountain. Look several times to see its mood change from bright to brooding with the weather.\n\n9. Binna Burra to Green Mountains (O'Reilly's), Queensland\n\nThe Gwangorool Pool, Binna Burra. Courtesy gailhampshire/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nPart of the Gold Coast Hinterland Great Walk , a multi-day hike, the section from Binna Burra to O'Reilly's Rainforest Retreat in the Green Mountains section of Lamington National Park makes a good full-day walk.\n\nThe Border Track passes through stands of Atlantic Beech forest, subtropical and cool-temperate rainforests and along the rim of the Tweed Valley volcanic erosion caldera. From Wanungara Lookout views extend over Limpwood Valley, Mount Warning and sometimes as far south as Byron Bay.\n\nThe 23-kilometer hike takes six or seven hours and can be done in either direction, completely independently or with transport by O'Reilly's\n\n10. Manly to the Spit Bridge\n\nWalk along the beautiful expanse of Forty Baskets Beach. Cameron Spencer/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images\n\nHiking in the middle of the city? Absolutely. Walks through Sydney Harbor National Park provide a peaceful perspective.\n\nA favorite is Manly to the Spit Bridge, a 10-kilometer one-way walk of three hours. No human guide is needed -- Manly Guide has an excellent map.\n\nCatch the ferry from Circular Quay, alight at Manly Wharf and head west along the foreshore.\n\nHaving crossed the picturesque and oddly named Forty Baskets Beach, the track heads up through a reserve with spectacular lookouts. Quiet beaches like Castle Rock give the walker reason to pause, before everything becomes busier approaching the Spit Bridge, which we see open for a ferry to pass.\n\nBruce Holmes is an Australian freelance travel writer and photographer who lives in the Hunter Valley, New South Wales.

They would become the world's top two players, he predicted.\n\nNot that anyone expected their father's unorthodox blueprint to develop into one of sport's greatest stories.\n\nEveryone thought he was crazy, Nick Bollettieri, renowned coach of many a grand slam champion, once said.\n\nPHOTO: MIKE NELSON/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Serena (L) celebrates with sister Venus (R) and father Richard (C) after beating Steffi Graf in a 1999 final.\n\nAfter reaching her eighth Australian Open final this week, Serena offered an insight into how her father's vision helped create a dynasty that has dominated the women's game for nearly two decades.\n\nHis big innovation was teaching the sisters techniques no one else was trying.\n\nPeople were like, 'What are you doing? That's not the right way,' Serena recalled of those early days in Compton.\n\nWe were definitely able to revolutionize a lot of things in the game. We were able to come out here and just be two really strong women standing up for everything we believed in.\n\nREAD: Williams sisters to meet in Australian Open final\n\nREAD: A rare interview with Richard Williams\n\nREAD: Nadal wins epic to set up dream Federer final\n\nPHOTO: Al Bello/Getty Images North America/Getty Images/file Serena and Venus with their mother Oracene in 1999.\n\nNew beginning\n\nThe sisters have both topped the women's rankings – in 2002 Venus became the first African American player to be a tennis No. 1, and Serena followed her that same year.\n\nAnd they have been under the spotlight of grand slam finals before, of course.\n\nThere was a time when all-Williams finals were a regular feature in the tennis calendar. But this Australian Open final feels different. It is an unexpected flashback to a different age, a contest to savor.\n\nThough both great champions have been defiant against Father Time, and neither has mentioned retirement, the siblings are in the final chapters of their remarkable careers.\n\nSaturday's final could be their last together at this stage of a grand slam and, as Serena herself has admitted, it is an extraordinary tale.\n\nThis is something that I couldn't write a better ending, the 35-year-old said of the match in which she could finally win an Open-Era record 23rd grand slams.\n\nThis is a great opportunity for us to start our new beginning.\n\nPHOTO: Getty Images/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images With a combined age of 71, the all-Williams clash will be the oldest grand slam final in the Open Era.\n\n'It's a win-win situation'\n\nVictory would place Serena in history's gap between Steffi Graf (22 major titles) and Margaret Court (24) and return her to the world's No. 1 ranking.\n\nAt the other side of the net, however, will be older sister Venus, a seven-time grand slam champion and a 36-year-old whose later career has been hampered by an incurable auto-immune disorder.\n\nIn 2011 she was diagnosed with Sjogren's Syndrome, which causes fatigue and joint pain. It is a major reason for her recent absence from grand slam finals, with her last being in 2009 at Wimbledon.\n\nSerena has predicted Saturday's match, their ninth grand slam final battle but first for almost eight years, will be uncomfortable, but the six-time Melbourne champion is relaxed whatever the outcome.\n\nAfter everything that Venus has been through with her illness and stuff, I just can't help but feel like it's a win-win situation for me, she explained.\n\nI was there for the whole time. We lived together. I know what she went through.\n\nIt's the one time that I really genuinely feel like no matter what happens, I can't lose, she can't lose. It's going to be a great situation.\n\nPHOTO: Sean Garnsworthy/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images Serena Williams won her first Australian Open title by beating sister Venus in the final in 2003.\n\n'I can compete against the odds'\n\nThe sisters – owners of 29 major singles titles between them, plus 14 together in doubles – have been the dominant forces in women's tennis for almost two decades and, in this tournament, have been as commanding as they once were in the early part of this century.\n\nSerena has returned to form after an extended break at the end of last year.\n\nShe has not dropped a set in Melbourne and, having dominated her rivalry with Venus – Serena holds a 16-11 record and has won six of their past seven grand slam finals – the world No. 2 is favorite to triumph for a seventh time Down Under.\n\nWho will triumph? Have your say on our Facebook page\n\nWhen I'm playing on the court with her, I think I'm playing the best competitor in the game, said Venus, who lost to Serena in her only other Australian Open final in 2003.\n\nI don't think I'm chump change, either. I can compete against any odds. No matter what, I get out there and I compete.\n\nVisit cnn.com/tennis for more news and videos\n\nI know that it won't be easy. You have to control yourself, then you also have to hopefully put your opponent in a box. This opponent is your sister and she's super awesome. It's wonderful.

The adverse consequences of the shutdown are wide and growing.\n\nThe closure of key government agencies comes as American business owners are struggling to deal with the fallout of President Donald Trump's trade wars, as well as increased market volatility and growing economic uncertainty.\n\nTrump has said the shutdown could last for months – or years – and while it most immediately affects government workers and federal contractors who aren't getting paid, it has created severe challenges for businesses that depend on government data, licensing or other functions.\n\nFarmers, for example, would normally be looking to a monthly report on the supply and demand of agricultural products around the world to help determine what to plant next season. But the next report won't come out as scheduled on January 11 if the US Department of Agriculture remains unfunded.\n\nBusinesses that rely on monthly export and import data missed an update Tuesday because the Commerce Department isn't fully operating either. And US businesses that import steel and aluminum and are seeking an exclusion from Trump's tariffs may have to wait longer to hear if their application has been approved, because those applications are also handled by the Commerce Department.\n\nThe shutdown also poses challenges for industries that need approval from the federal agencies temporarily shuttered. Pending company mergers, for example, are being slowed because the Securities and Exchange Commission isn't fully staffed.\n\nBreweries trying out new craft beers are stuck, too, because the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which must sign off on all new labels and packaging, has been shut down.\n\nThe list of nuisances goes on. The Internal Revenue Service isn't staffed to take questions from employers that must send out W-2s to workers by the end of January, or businesses who have questions about changes under the new tax law.\n\nEmployers will also have to wait until the shutdown is over to use the online E-Verify system to confirm whether applicants have a legal right to work in the United States. It doesn't prevent someone from starting to work, but prolongs the on-boarding process – and opens up the risk that companies may have to let go of employees who don't later pass the check, even if they've already started working.\n\nTrump's efforts to overhaul the global trading system has already strained some business owners and farmers. He's said that he wants foreign countries to change their practices and treat Americans fairly, but despite what the President has often suggested, it's not China that's paying for the tariffs but US importers. The duties have raised the price of goods ranging from foreign steel and aluminum to Chinese-made semiconductors and luggage for American companies.\n\nSome businesses, like Missouri-based Cap America, have had to start paying a 10% tariff on a majority of their inventory because it comes from China. The company made most of their baseball caps in-house (and was appropriately named) until 2001, but it became cheaper to buy them from China. Now, about 89% of the caps sold in the United States comes from China. Cap America then embroiders them here.\n\nIn December, the company had to set prices for 2019 without knowing if there would be a 10% or 25% tariff on their imports. Trump had threatened to raise the tariff rate to 25% on January 1, but put off the hike while he and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day truce that ends in March.\n\nPhil Page, chairman and CEO of Cap America, said he doesn't expect to know how his price increase will affect demand until the end of the first quarter.\n\nIt's the uncertainty that causes the most stress in this situation, he said.\n\nRetaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries have closed off some markets to American farmers. China stopped buying American soybeans for about six months, though purchases restarted in December. Mexico put tariffs on American pork and Canada imposed duties on beef.\n\nA new trade deal struck between the United States, Mexico and Canada to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement has offered some reassurance to farmers that markets to the North and South would remain open to trade.\n\nBut even though Trump and his counterparts signed the deal in December, it must still be approved by Congress where leaders from the Democratically controlled House have voiced concerns about its labor and environmental provisions.\n\nLawmakers are expected to wait for an economic impact study before taking a vote, but it's unlike that will come before mid-March. It's being done by the US International Trade Commission, which has suspended investigative activities during the shutdown. Plus, Trump has threatened to withdraw from the original deal in the meantime, which could invite more tariffs on US goods and risk an economic shock.\n\nDespite the new trade deal, the retaliatory tariffs will remain in place while Trump keeps duties on foreign steel and aluminum. Many businesses and farmers have urged the administration to lift those taxes.\n\nIn the interim, the US Department of Agriculture has offered some financial aid to farmers hurt by the tariffs – but it's not processing new applications during the shutdown. The agency said Tuesday that it would extend the application deadline by the number of days the government remains shut down, but won't pay out money until Congress votes to reopen.\n\nUncertainty is a problem, said Brian Duncan, who grows corn and soybeans and raises hogs in Illinois. We deal with enough uncertainty, the weather, the wind, snow, you name it. When you add more layers of uncertainty, it makes business more difficult.\n\nCNN's Vanessa Yurkevich contributed to this report.
(CNN) — After four years of confusion, it has finally happened.\n\nThe United Kingdom officially severed ties with the European Union last night, as the Brexit transition period ended at 11 p.m. UK time.\n\nBrexit hasn't been an easy road politically, and the UK -- which voted 52-48 to leave the EU in 2016 -- is going into the new year more divided than ever.\n\nBut what does that mean for travel?\n\nIt all depends on whether your passport is UK, EU, or from somewhere else -- and what currency zone you're coming from.\n\nFor some travelers, the tanking pound means a trip to the UK is looking very attractive.\n\nBut for UK and EU nationals, things are going to change.\n\nCan UK nationals travel to Europe now?\n\nLong-term, yes. Short-term -- possibly, or probably, not. Most EU countries have borders currently closed to citizens from outside the bloc, due to Covid-19. Now that the UK has third country status, citizens have lost their right to travel freely within the EU. There's technically no difference now between a UK citizen wanting to visit France, and an American citizen -- who, of course, have been banned since March -- hoping to do the same.\n\nHowever, since EU states remain sovereign nations, each country has control over its own borders, and will be able to make an exception for UK citizens should it so wish. It might take some time to see how this pans out, since arrivals from the UK are currently banned from most of Europe, thanks to the new variant of Covid-19, which was first identified in the south of England.\n\nMost EU countries have placed Covid-related restrictions on entry from the UK until at least January 6. It's only after that that we might get some clarification on whether or not countries will make exemptions for Brits once the current health crisis begins to abate.\n\nThere might be some surprises. Germany, for instance, has already included the UK in its list of permitted travel (although entry from the UK is currently banned until at least January 6 due to the new variant of Covid-19).\n\nRelated content 21 places to go in 2021\n\nGreece is also currently allowing travelers from the UK, and has not indicated that this will change.\n\nHowever, Britain's historic ally, Portugal -- which last year launched a Brelcome campaign, promising Portugal will never leave you -- has announced that UK nationals will not be permitted from January 1, except for essential travel. Belgium and Norway have said the same.\n\nFrance, Italy and Spain have not yet made any announcements, though non-resident travel from the UK is currently banned to all three, due to the Covid variant.\n\nHow about the other way round?\n\nEU citizens can travel to the UK without too many problems. The UK has never closed its borders at any point during the pandemic. Anyone can enter as long as they have a visa or visa exemption -- you just need to fill in a passenger locator form , and you should self-isolate for 10 days on arrival (or five days, if using the Test to Release scheme) unless coming from a country on the  travel corridors  list.\n\nWill it be cheaper to visit the UK?\n\nProbably, though of course it depends what currency zone you're coming from. The pound crashed in June 2016 when the referendum was announced, and has yet to claw its way back to pre-Brexit levels against the euro and the dollar.\n\nHowever, it's not as bad (or good, depending on your point of view) as it was -- following another historic crash in March, when sterling fell to a 30-year low against the dollar and an 11-year low against the euro at the start of the latest round of negotiations (compounded by the pandemic), the pound has regained slight value, and rallied again after a trade deal with the EU was announced on December 24.\n\nIf you're converting US dollars, however, that's a vast difference from the heady days of 2007, when the conversion rate was $2 to £1. For many, the drop in sterling will make a UK trip finally viable.\n\nI'm British. Once borders have reopened post-Covid, can I still travel freely to the EU?\n\nPost-Covid restrictions, whenever that may be, you will still be able to travel visa-free. But you'll only be allowed to spend 90 days out of every 180 days in the Schengen area (most EU nations plus Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein). That means spending the winter in the Med is no longer possible. If you entered the EU on January 1, for example, you would need to leave on April 1 -- you wouldn't be allowed back until June 30, and then would have to leave before October.\n\nRelated content Backpacking is a rite of passage for many travelers. Covid could end it forever\n\nThose allowances are cumulative and Schengen-wide -- so you can't spend three months in one country, go home, and pop back for a weekend city break.\n\nThe EU is introducing a visa waiver scheme, called ETIAS (similar to the US ESTA scheme), by the end of 2022. It is likely that UK citizens will be included in the scheme, which will cost around €7 for three years.\n\nHow about the other way round?\n\nVisas are not needed for EU citizens visiting the UK at the moment. Currently you can spend six months in the UK without applying for a visa.\n\nThe UK is expected to include EU citizens in its ETA visa waiver scheme by 2025.\n\nWill things get more expensive for UK citizens?\n\nExchange rate aside, probably. Leaving the EU means that UK phone companies can now charge roaming fees once more while you're traveling there (they were previously abolished under EU rules). The UK's major providers have said that they won't be introducing them, but check with yours before you go.\n\nConversely, EU residents could be charged roaming fees when using their phones in the UK. Again, check with your provider.\n\nHow about health care?\n\nUK citizens will need travel insurance, according to the government -- even though the December 24 deal says that European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) cards (which provided health coverage on a par with what locals receive) will be valid until their expiry date. Note that they will not be valid in Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland.\n\nRegular treatment for chronic conditions -- like dialysis, or chemotherapy -- will continue cross-border, with pre-booking.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK has stated that it will create a global health insurance card for its citizens, although details (and timing) have yet to be released.\n\nExpect there to be a lot of confusion over the coming months -- when CNN called the EHIC inquiries line on December 31, a call handler advised that the cards would no longer be valid from January 1, and we should call back in two weeks to find out if the government had arranged an alternative.\n\nWill we need new paperwork?\n\nUK citizens will now need six months' validity left on their passports to enter the EU (technically the EU requires three months' validity but the UK is advising its citizens to have six months remaining). EU residents can use identity cards to enter the UK until October 1, 2021. After that you will need a passport, unless you're a UK resident.\n\nSpeaking of paperwork, you may need to bring a lot more with you. Pandemic aside, Spain, for instance, reserves the right to refuse entry to tourists -- even those with valid visas, or who qualify for visa-free travel -- if they cannot provide proof of where they will be staying, a documented itinerary or a round-trip flight. In addition, anyone wishing to enter Spain must demonstrate that they have sufficient means of support available to enter Spain -- that means at least €90 per day of your trip, and a minimum of €810 for your entire trip (even for a cheeky weekend city break). The days of freewheeling around Europe as the mood takes you may be over for the Brits.\n\nHow about driving?\n\nLast night, just four and a half hours before the transition period ended, the UK government confirmed in a tweet that its citizens will be able to drive in the EU without International Driving Permits -- UK licenses will be recognized as they were pre-Brexit.\n\nWill that be reciprocal? We're not sure yet. The relevant page on the UK government website states that it is out of date\n\nIf taking a British car into the EU, it must have a GB sticker on display, and you must have a Green Card detailing your insurance in multiple languages.\n\nWhat happens at the border?\n\nOfficially, UK nationals are no longer entitled to use the EU passport gates at border control. However each EU country will be able to decide whether or not to grant an exception. With the UK banned from most countries at the moment because of Covid, the situation will probably become clearer in a few months.\n\nThe UK has confirmed that EU citizens can continue to use the UK/EEA channels, and ePassport gates, at UK border control. These are also open to citizens of Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and the US, as before.\n\nWhat about pets?\n\nTaking your dog on your summer holiday is a rite of passage for many Brits. Now that the UK is no longer part of the EU pet passport scheme, you'll need to get an animal health certificate at least 10 days before traveling. These are obtainable from your vet. Note that you'll also need a certificate when traveling from England, Wales or Scotland to Northern Ireland.\n\nHow about moving abroad?\n\nThere is no longer freedom of movement between the EU and the UK. Anyone wanting to move between the two will now need to apply for a visa.\n\nWhat about Gibraltar?\n\nIn an 11th hour deal on December 31, it was announced that Gibraltar -- the UK territory on the southern tip of Spain -- will become part of the Schengen area, as an entry point to Spain. However, the Chief Minister, Fabian Picardo, has confirmed that only the territory will be part of the Schengen area -- not the people. In other words, UK nationals will not be able to use it as a back-door way into Spain.\n\nThere will be two entry points: one for Gibraltar, and one for Schengen. The airport will be in the Schengen area, so there will be no immigration checks for intra-Schengen flights.\n\nAnd Ireland?\n\nThe Republic of Ireland is exempt from the 90/180 rule for British citizens. And there is no limit on items you can take across the border with Northern Ireland, as long as they are for personal use or for gifts.\n\nThere will be no border checks between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland; however, you cannot take meat or dairy products from England, Scotland or Wales into Northern Ireland, and if traveling with a pet, it must have a certificate -- even if you are not planning to cross into the Republic of Ireland.\n\nAny upsides?

Hill: I just do what I think is right\n\nDemocratic Congressional candidate Katie Hill speaks to supporters at her election night party in California's 25th Congressional district on November 6, 2018 in Santa Clarita, California.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nWhen Katie Hill opened the heavy wooden door to her new congressional office in the Longworth House Office Building, one feeling smacked her in the gut.\n\nWell, this doesn't feel like me, recalled the freshman congresswoman from California's 25th District.\n\nSo yeah, this very formal place being my home base does feel strange, she added. I don't want to become more formal. That's not on the table.\n\nHill argues her life doesn't allow her to embrace any of the formal trappings of Washington. Raised in suburban Los Angeles, she prefers sneakers to heels. She's a Democrat and the daughter of a Republican police officer and survived a sexual assault. Socially conscious, she married a man but identifies as bisexual.\n\nThe thrust of her career has been in non-profits, as an advocate for the homeless. She also embraces the sexist criticism, known as resting bitch face, about a serious woman (like her) not smiling while thinking.\n\nThis isn't the sort of resume or life story that typically precedes a seat in Congress, but that's just fine with Hill and the voters who elected her. An unconventional woman, the 31-year-old joins the 116th Congress, the most diverse legislature in history by many measures — gender, race and sexual orientation.\n\nRefusing to change is part of the internal feedback loop in Hill's first days in Washington.\n\nSometimes in the middle of an unreal day, you just really need to hug your mom.\n\n\n\nWe're about to be sworn in. Let's do this. pic.twitter.com/8zmyMbgvb9 — Rep. Katie Hill (@RepKatieHill) January 3, 2019\n\nA grassroots candidate\n\nHill won with an insurgent campaign spurred by the 2016 election. She channeled her anger at the victory of President Donald Trump by taking aim at her congressman, Rep. Steve Knight, who voted with fellow House Republicans in May 2017 to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Who is going to run against him? Hill typed out on her social media accounts. A friend said, Why not you?\n\nWhy not, thought Hill.\n\nA year and a half later, Hill flipped the suburban Los Angeles district for Democrats. The first-time candidate had started her grassroots campaign out of a rented apartment backed by a hoodie-wearing millennial staff, chain-sipping La Croix sparkling water. The team raised more than $8 million without taking a cent in corporate or special interest money.\n\nHill won over voters as a progressive advocate for affordable housing while offering a pragmatic willingness to work across party lines for her purple district. Trying to fit into Washington is not why Hill was elected nor does it sit anywhere on her agenda.\n\nPlaying nice isn't really something that's in my vocabulary, she said. I just do what I think is right.\n\nDemanding to be heard\n\nThat philosophy may sound quaint, even naive, for Washington, but Hill believes that's the shared sentiment among the incoming freshmen congressional class.\n\nA record-setting 127 women were elected to the 116th Congress, the majority of whom are Democrats. More African Americans, Latinos and LGBTQ members now serve in Congress. The legislature also saw its median age drop by approximately a decade with its newly elected members.\n\nPHOTO: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images Katie Hill laughs as Nancy Pelosi's granddaughter reacts to votes for Pelosi to become Speaker of the House.\n\nHill is notable for her youth as well as being California's first openly bisexual woman elected to Congress. But it's the sheer size of the freshman class, at 92 new members with 46 flipped seats in the 2018 midterm election, that's politically powerful to her.\n\nTraditionally, new legislators have been expected to wait their turn while more seasoned members drove the agenda. But this time, and in this age, the newbies are demanding their voices be heard.\n\nI think we have enough power and enough strength in numbers and enough of a strong mandate from voters that we're going to be able to continue to stay true to the things that we ran on, said Hill, who was elected to the Democratic House leadership team as one of two new members representing freshmen.\n\nPHOTO: Win McNamee/Getty Images Katie Hill, right, poses with other members of the newly elected Democratic House Leadership team in November.\n\nThe result, she hopes, will be in them governing differently.\n\nA new agenda and attitude\n\nTop of Hill's agenda is focusing on a more equitable system, from health care to taxes to housing. Hill believes the biggest problem with Washington has been the billionaire class being controlled by special interest donors and ignoring the needs of the politically powerless.\n\nWe are regular, middle class people, said Hill, the now third-youngest member of Congress (behind Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Iowa's Abby Finkenauer.)\n\nWe're young. We look like and speak like the people that we're there to represent. We're not people who came up through the political process. The majority of us are first-time candidates. We're not stuck in the old way of doing things, she said.\n\nThis Freshman class is larger, younger, and more diverse than ever before and that's not a coincidence – it's a call to action.\n\n\n\nYesterday @JoeNeguse and I were elected to be the Co-Representatives to Leadership for this historic class and we are so ready to get to work. pic.twitter.com/GZv3FUElNe — Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) November 29, 2018\n\nHill spoke to CNN as she made the flight to Washington from Burbank, California, inviting us to chronicle her journey from candidate to congresswoman-elect to swearing in.\n\nA millennial, Hill embraces the sharing philosophy of her generation via social media and speaks easily with reporters as cameras roll. She's shared on Twitter and Facebook her personal stories about surviving sexual assault and an unplanned pregnancy that ended in a miscarriage. In her unconventional political ads, she went rock climbing.\n\nAs Hill checked in for the 6:45 a.m. flight, she remarked, I've never lived outside of California or traveled with so many bags. For the record, there were three suitcases.\n\nShe wore athletic clothing for the flight, noticing then, under the bright fluorescent lights of the ticket counter, that her black pants were covered in her dog's white hair. Oh well, she said, as she walked towards airport security. Her goal, she said, is to demystify Congress by bringing her voters with her on this journey and through her entire term, dog hair and all.\n\nI think what I, and many of the other freshmen have, what's kind of unique, is this sort of ability to relate to people in a different way.\n\nI left my house in SoCal and it was 37 degrees, landed in DC and it's more than 50 degrees here! What a warm welcome! ☀️\n\n\n\nCan't believe inauguration is this week — I'm so ready to get to work. 💪🏼 pic.twitter.com/UV28nRQPFO — Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) December 29, 2018\n\nIt's why on Hill's Twitter feed she's posted frequent updates on her first impressions of Washington during new member orientation, known as Congress Camp. She talked about what committees she hoped to join to best represent her district, a sprawling community with suburban middle-class families and lower-income desert communities, and doesn't plan on slowing down the tweets.\n\n'There's going to be fights'\n\nHill signed the lease at her new home – a small, no frills, two-bedroom apartment that gives off a corporate, temporary housing sensibility. It's there she caught up with her roommate and fellow freshman, Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois. Nearly the same age, the congresswomen initially give off a bubbly vibe of moving into a college dorm.\n\nYou can only have tough dinner table conversations if you first get the dinner table! 😂\n\n\n\n@LUnderwood630 is the best Ikea partner I could imagine — the true test of roommate compatibility! (And maybe our negotiation skills too...) pic.twitter.com/knACssVjXF — Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) December 30, 2018\n\nBut as Underwood talked, it became apparent that both carried the weight of their new elected jobs.\n\nI think it's going to be hard, said Underwood, who also flipped her district, defeating a Republican male incumbent. She is now the youngest black woman to ever serve in Congress. We don't walk in and everything automatically changes.\n\nI would imagine there will be confrontations, said Hill. There's going to be fights between the old guard and the new one. But I feel very optimistic that the existing leadership all want us to be part of this process. They recognize the change that's happening, and they're trying to include us.\n\nPHOTO: Kyung Lah/CNN The nameplate for Rep. Katie Hill outside her office on Capitol Hill.\n\nOn inauguration morning, a crush of cameras greeted Hill, swarming around her as she tried to enter the Capitol to be sworn in.\n\nIt feels good. It feels like we can finally get to work, she said.\n\nShe stepped into the US Capitol through the south door entrance and disappeared into the tunnel. Her cross-country journey had ended but her new role as Congresswoman Katie Hill had just begun.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nLawyers working for former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort accidentally revealed on Tuesday the clearest public evidence of coordination between the campaign and Russians, adding new details to the murky mosaic of potential collusion in 2016 – including sharing polling data with an alleged Russian operative.\n\nThe explosive new information was buried in a court filing from Manafort's lawyers, though the portions about his contacts with a shadowy Russian during the campaign were meant to be redacted.\n\nBut the document was fully searchable, even the blacked-out parts, revealing fresh details about the core of the ongoing investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the latest disclosures and how they might fit into the existing puzzle.\n\nRelationship with Kilimnik\n\nClose watchers of the investigation have been intrigued by the still-developing role of Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian political consultant who worked closely with Manafort in Ukraine. They helped Moscow-friendly politicians get elected and hold onto power for nearly a decade.\n\nManafort and Kilimnik stayed in touch after their Ukrainian clients were ousted in 2014. They met twice in the United States during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to their own public statements. News reports have detailed their phone calls and emails in 2016, including one exchange where Manafort tried to use Kilimnik to reach a prominent Russian oligarch.\n\nBut Tuesday's filing revealed they had a third meeting, this time in the Spanish capital of Madrid. One redacted portion quoted Mueller's team: After being told that Mr. Kilimnik had traveled to Madrid on the same day that Mr. Manafort was in Madrid, Mr. Manafort 'acknowledged' that he and Mr. Kilimnik met while they were both in Madrid. A spokesman for Manafort sought to clarify the filing in a statement Tuesday night, saying that the third meeting happened in early 2017, after the election.\n\nThe growing list of Manafort-Kilimnik contacts could be relevant to the collusion question because, according to previous court filings from Mueller, the FBI has assessed that Kilimnik has ties to a Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016.\n\nMany of their contacts happened while the Russian government was aggressively meddling in the US election. Court filings said Kilimnik was affiliated with the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency that was responsible for hacking Democratic targets and orchestrating the WikiLeaks releases.\n\nCNN reported in February 2017 that Manafort was among a handful of senior Trump advisers who were in constant communication with suspected Russian operatives during the campaign. At the time, Manafort told CNN in a statement, that is 100% not true, at least as far as me.\n\nSharing campaign polls\n\nBeyond the fact that Manafort was in regular touch with Kilimnik, the unredacted court filings shed new light on the content of some of their conversations. For the first time, the public learned that Manafort shared polling data about the 2016 campaign with his Russian friend.\n\nIssues and communications related to Ukrainian political events simply were not at the forefront of Mr. Manafort's mind during the period at issue and it is not surprising at all that Mr. Manafort was unable to recall specific details prior to having his recollection refreshed, Manafort's lawyers wrote. The same is true with regard to the Government's allegation that Mr. Manafort lied about sharing polling data with Mr. Kilimnik related to the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThere aren't any additional details – all this tells us is that Mueller believes that Manafort fed polling data to Kilimnik, possibly even polls commissioned by the Trump campaign.\n\nPolling data is a key part of any modern political operation – presidential campaigns and outside groups like super PACs spend millions of dollars on polls. These numbers can drive decisions on messaging, where to campaign and advertising, both on television and in the digital space.\n\nTrump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale ran Trump's data team in 2016. They've publicly touted about how they used data to target voters.\n\nIt's possible Manafort innocuously gave the polls to Kilimnik because he is a political junkie and wanted to dig into the crosstabs. But there's also a possibility that Kilimnik, with his active ties to Russian intelligence, funneled the information to Russian agents to influence the election.\n\nThe primary suspect would be the troll farm in St. Petersburg that essentially acted as a pro-Trump super PAC and pumped out political propaganda to millions of Americans on social media during the 2016 race. These messages can be targeted to specific demographics based on polling data. There aren't any publicly known ties between Kilimnik and the troll farm.\n\nUkraine peace plan\n\nTuesday's filing also unintentionally disclosed that Manafort and Kilimnik discussed a Ukraine peace plan.\n\nAfter being shown documents, Mr. Manafort 'conceded' that he discussed or may have discussed a Ukraine peace plan with Mr. Kilimnik on more than one occasion, the filing said. The document was filed by Manafort's team, but this line appears to quote a past Mueller filing.\n\nThe filing revealed no details about what the Ukraine plan would entail. After Manafort's clients were ousted in 2014, Russian forced annexed Crimea and Kremlin-backed proxies invaded eastern Ukraine. Western nations condemned the moves and have applied economic sanctions against Moscow ever since. The diplomatic and military crisis is ongoing.\n\nThe news that Manafort was in talks with Kilimnik about a Ukraine peace plan is interesting, because it's not the first time the Ukraine conflict became an issue inside Trump's orbit.\n\nDuring the 2016 Republican National Convention, Trump campaign officials intervened to change language in the GOP platform about the Ukraine conflict. Their actions blocked a provision that called on the US to arm the Ukrainian government to fight the Russian proxies.\n\nAt the time, Manafort denied that the Trump campaign was involved. He also said he was not personally involved in any effort to change the platform and learned of it from news reports.\n\nThe Ukraine issue came up again shortly before Trump's inauguration.\n\nAn informal Ukraine peace plan was hatched at a January 2017 meeting between Trump's longtime attorney and fixer Michael Cohen, former Trump business partner Felix Sater and Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Artemenko. The proposal was seen by some as friendly to Moscow.\n\nCohen confirmed to CNN that the meeting took place but denied discussing Ukraine. In comments to other news organizations, Cohen acknowledged the so-called peace plan and said he delivered the proposal to the office of then-national security adviser Michael Flynn. The White House denied that anyone ever received any documents from Cohen about Ukraine.\n\nIt is not clear if this proposal was related in any way to the plan that Manafort discussed with Kilimnik. There aren't any publicly known ties between Artemenko and Kilimnik, though Kilimnik is an insider in Ukrainian political circles and has relationships with many lawmakers there. Artemenko has cooperated with Mueller and testified before the grand jury last summer.\n\nCNN's Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.
The World Health Organization (WHO) is holding a meeting today where it could decide whether the spread of the Wuhan virus constitutes a public health emergency of international concern.\n\nThe WHO held a similar meeting yesterday but delayed its decision, due to a lack of information.\n\nThe decision about whether or not to declare a public health emergency of international concern is one I take extremely seriously, and one I am only prepared to make with appropriate consideration of all the evidence, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters Wednesday.\n\nToday, there was an excellent discussion during committee meeting but it was also clear that to proceed, we need more information, he said.\n\nThe WHO defines a public health emergency of international concern as an extraordinary event that constitutes a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response. Previous emergencies have included Ebola, Zika and H1N1.
This was excerpted from the January 1 edition of CNN's Meanwhile in America, the daily email about US politics for global readers. Click here to read past editions and subscribe.\n\n(CNN) Welcome to a new political year in America.\n\nA new presidency is a time of renewal, and this country — like the rest of the world — badly needs hope amid the darkest winter of modern times, as Covid-19 ravages the population and suppresses the joys of normal life.\n\nDonald Trump will soon be a private citizen. But largely because of his divisive and democracy-tainting term, his successor Joe Biden may be tested more than any new US President since the 1930s. The pile of crises that the new commander in chief inherits in this new year could dwarf the Great Depression-era threat to capitalism confronting President Franklin Roosevelt in 1933.\n\nAmerica's wretched partisan fury means Biden has only the narrowest of paths to forging successful policy responses to America's big problems. Creating a meaningful presidency from such unpromising beginnings will take extraordinary political skill, missteps by his political enemies and luck.\n\nWhat Biden faces in 2021
Written by Darran Simon, CNN\n\nDon Lutes Jr. kept the 1943 copper penny he stumbled upon in his high school cafeteria seven decades ago in a safe behind a wall in his Massachusetts home.\n\nAll US pennies were supposed to be made of zinc-coated steel that year to conserve the copper needed for wartime essentials like shell casings and telephone wire, according to Heritage Auctions, a Dallas-based auction house. But a small number of copper pennies were created by mistake. Only a few of them exist today, making them special to coin collectors.\n\nLutes knew his coin was rare and held on to it. But as his health declined last year, Lutes decided to sell the coin because, he wanted to make sure it went to a good home, said Peter Karpenski, a friend and fellow coin collector.\n\nLutes' prized possession fetched a pretty penny -- $204,000 -- after a live auction Thursday at the Florida United Numismatics convention in Orlando, Florida. Heritage Auctions , which oversaw the sale, estimated the coin was worth at least $170,000.\n\nThe top bid after a two-week online auction had been $130,000, according to Heritage Auctions.\n\nWhat makes this so exciting is that it's the only time ever in history when the discovery coin for this piece has been available for sale. In other words, this was the first one that was ever found, said Sarah Miller, Director of Numismatics for Heritage Auctions' New York office.\n\nThe 1943 copper penny is the most famous error coin, according to Heritage Auctions.\n\nAround the end of 1942, a small number of bronze planchets -- a plain metal disk that is stamped as a coin -- got caught in the trap doors of the mobile tote bins used to feed the blanks into the Mint's coin presses, according to Heritage Auctions. Those planchets went unnoticed when the bins were refilled with zinc-coated steel planchets in 1943, Heritage Auctions said.\n\nThey eventually became dislodged and were fed into the coin press, along with the wartime steel blanks. The few resulting copper cents were lost in the flood of millions of steel cents struck in 1943 and escaped detection by the Mint's quality control measures, according to Heritage Auctions.\n\nMiller said 10 to 15 of the 1943 copper pennies exist today.\n\nLutes set his 1943 copper penny aside to study it later when he found it in a bundle of change in the Pittsfield High School cafeteria in 1947.\n\nA US Army veteran, he would amass some 50,000 coins by the 1970s when he retired from the family manufacturing business, according to Karpenski. Lutes died in September 2018 at the age of 87, according to Miller.\n\nThe Pittsfield resident was a quiet man with a small circle of friends that included fellow members of the coin and genealogy clubs he belonged to. A widower, he volunteered for decades at Berkshire Athenaeum, Pittsfield's public library, according to Karpenski, who owns a coin store in Pittsfield.\n\nThe library named a volunteer of the year award after him, according to Karpenski.\n\nAnd the library meant just as much to Lutes.\n\nLutes wanted the proceeds from the sale of his prized penny to go to the library, Miller said.
With Trump out of office, how often will he be fact-checked?\n\nThis is what prompted The New York Times to reach out to Gov. Cuomo's second accuser\n\nNEW YORK, NY - JULY 23: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo speaks during the daily media briefing at the Office of the Governor of the State of New York on July 23, 2020 in New York City. The Governor said the state liquor authority has suspended 27 bar and restaurant alcohol licenses for violations of social distancing rules as public officials try to keep the coronavirus outbreak under control. (Photo by Jeenah Moon/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 04: U.S. President Donald Trump is joined by Vice President Mike Pence while speaking to the media after a meeting with Congressional leaders about ending the partial government shutdown, in the Rose Garden at the White House on January 4, 2019 in Washington, DC. The U.S government is going into the 13th day of a partial shutdown with Republicans and Democrats at odds on agreeing with President Donald Trump's demands for more money to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN Business) —\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the Reliable Sources newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.\n\nThe wall funding fight that has forced a partial government shutdown is also a fight over facts. President Donald Trump has repeatedly distorted the situation at the southern border and stoked fear about immigration. Government agencies have shared misleading statistics. And Trump's media allies have created an echo chamber for the falsehoods.\n\nJournalists keep having to step in to state the facts. Case in point, Fox News Sunday moderator Chris Wallace anticipated this trickery by Sarah Sanders: We know that roughly nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is southern border.\n\nWallace interrupted: I know the statistic. I didn't know if you were going to use it, but I studied up on this. Do you know what those 4,000 people come where they are captured? Airports.\n\nSanders said not always, purposefully trying to confuse and scare people. Airports, Wallace emphasized. The State Department says there hasn't been any terrorists found coming across the southern border.\n\nThank you, Chris Wallace…\n\nFacts v. emotional appeal\n\nThe Wallace interview especially stood out because other Fox shows have been promoting faulty stats to stir up fear. But it's definitely not just about stats. I was reminded of this while watching Fox & Friends this weekend, with its numerous segments about violent crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. Emotions trump reason.\n\nAs Security analyst Adam Isacson was quoted saying in Sunday's WaPo: They are stuck on this wall thing because of its emotional appeal.\n\nFear-mongering in action\n\nTrump and his aides are knowingly lying in the service of their political goal, Frank Bruni said on Sunday's Reliable Sources when I highlighted the Sanders/Wallace exchange.\n\nIt reminded me of this Post story from a few days ago. Ellen Nakashima reported that the DOJ has acknowledged errors and deficiencies in a controversial report issued a year ago that implied a link between terrorism in the United States and immigration, but — for the second and final time — officials have declined to retract or correct the document.\n\nNew Trump campaign ad warns about drugs and gangs\n\nThe fear-mongering is evident in this new Trump 2020 ad. The ad began airing on CNN on Saturday, so I brought it up on Sunday's show. Drugs, terrorists, violent criminals and child traffickers trying to enter our country – but Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer care more about the radical left than keeping us safe, the ad claims. The consequences? Drug deaths. Violent murder. Gang violence. We must not allow it…\n\nPelosi to Nielsen: I don't believe your facts\n\nThat brings us back to the fight over facts. The other day the WSJ described a tense exchange between Pelosi and DHS secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, with Pelosi interrupting Nielsen's presentation to dispute DHS data. CNN's Boris Sanchez had details in this story on Saturday — he said Pelosi twice cut into Nielsen's presentations to dismiss DHS statistics on border security as inaccurate.\n\nPer a W.H. official, Pelosi told Nielsen I don't believe your facts. A Pelosi aide told CNN: In presentations made, they have repeatedly used statistics not supported by fact. They're trying to cast every single migrant as a terrorist or someone with a violent criminal history. The secretary has proven herself to not be credible on these issues.\n\n– Important CNN piece: Fact-checking the DHS border presentation\n\nWhere does Trump get his facts?\n\nOn State of the Union, Jake Tapper raised a related issue – the president's sketchy sources of information — in a very newsy interview with new acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Tapper pointed out that managing the flow of info to Trump has been an issue for the past two years. Mulvaney responded: The president gets the best information that's available. He just does.\n\nTapper brought up the concern in the context of Trump's recent expression of support for the Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan… I also brought up Trump's revisionist history on Reliable, with David Frum, who has said that POTUS straight-up spouted Russian propaganda. Frum's question: How did this particular piece of disinformation get into the president's head? That's something you can't report, we can only surmise.\n\nWill news coverage move the needle?\n\nNews coverage is showing the impacts of the partial government shutdown – will it make a difference? Will the personal stories and the pictures of long airport security lines influence the negotiations?\n\n→ Headline on CNN.com right now: This family thought their troubles were over. Then the government shutdown left them in limbo.\n\nFrum says Trump coverage should be even tougher\n\nWith Jill Abramson causing controversy for saying her former paper, the NYT, is anti-Trump, we had a very interesting conversation on Sunday's show about what it means to be anti-Trump. (Abramson declined our interview requests because her book comes out in a month.)\n\nI don't think we've been anti-Trump. I think we have been negative. And I think that's the only honest way to cover this presidency, NYT op-ed columnist Frank Bruni said.\n\nDavid Frum went even further: Relative to the truth, the prestige press in this country has a pro-Trump bias. Relative to the truth, Trump gets easier coverage than he deserves. Watch him make the case here…\n\nHow Fox talks about impeachment\n\nWe know how POTUS feels – you can't impeach somebody that's doing a great job. But how do his Fox fans talk about it? Here are three examples…\n\n– On Sunday's F&F, Pete Hegseth called NYT's David Leonhardt a fraud for writing a column that said The US has never had a president as demonstrably unfit for the office as Trump. And it's becoming clear that 2019 is likely to be dominated by a single question: What are we going to do about it? Hegseth didn't bother engaging with the core points of the column…\n\n– Jeanine Pirro to Rep. Rashida Tlaib: Show me where in the Constitution, Rashida, it says you can impeach a president because you hate him?\n\n– Jesse Watters: If you impeach Trump, you get President Pence. Now imagine what kind of judges HE'LL name to the Supreme Court. They'll make Kavanaugh look like Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nNOW, FROM RIGHT TO LEFT…\n\nWe led Sunday's show with the Democratic power shift and how Dems are covered by the press in the Trump age. This Bill Kristol tweet caught my eye: As a non-Democrat, I'm struck by how much the media seem obsessed by possible rifts among Democrats, narrow lines they'll have to walk, stray utterances of their backbenchers, etc, than by the rather more massive fact that we have a president and administration in total meltdown. Is that true? Three CNN political commentators, all Democrats, joined me in the A block…\n\n– Symone Sanders talked about the disconnect between pundits and the public. It's really important that folks go on the ground, and that we're talking to real people…\n\n– Karen Finney (in her first appearance as a CNNer!) emphasized the importance of language. We can't be afraid to call out things that are racist or sexist…\n\n– Dan Pfeiffer said Trump drives clicks for media outlets so Democrats will have to rely on alternatives, from podcasts like his own (Pod Save America) to Instagram live chats…\n\nInside Sherrod and Schultz's 2020 discussions\n\nConnie Schultz, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist and the better half of Democratic senator Sherrod Brown, told me they will decide in the next two months about whether he'll run for president. I appreciated how candid she was about the decision-making process… We also talked about the framing of the 2020 primary, how female candidates like Elizabeth Warren are described differently, and more… Video of our TV interview is up now, and CNN's Devan Cole has a recap…\n\nPLUS: The full interview is on our podcast… Listen via Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, TuneIn, or your favorite app…\n\nRead more of Sunday's Reliable Sources newsletter… And subscribe here to receive future editions in your inbox…\n\nFOR THE RECORD\n\nBy Katie Pellico:\n\n– Anne Helen Petersen diagnoses Millennials as the burnout generation… (BuzzFeed)\n\n– A Grindr harassment suit could change the legal landscape for tech — and free speech.

GO WITH AFP STORY by Desiree Martin A picture taken on April 12, 2013 shows plants of marijuana at the plantation of the Sibaratas Med Can association in Mogan on the southwest coast of the island of Gran Canaria. The plants grow from cuttings for approximately two months and then blossom before being harvested, dried, stored in jars for a month and later processed to be consumed on site. Spanish law prohibits the possession of soft drugs like cannabis in public and its growth to be sold for profit is illegal. But the law does tolerate growing cannabis for personal use and its consumption in private. Dozens of private marijuana smoking clubs operate across Spain that take advantage of this legal loophole that serve cannabis users who do not want to get their drugs from the streets. AFP PHOTO / DESIREE MARTIN (Photo credit should read DESIREE MARTIN/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAn Israeli agricultural engineer inspects marijuana plants at the BOL (Breath Of Life) Pharma greenhouse in the country's second-largest medical cannabis plantation, near Kfar Pines in northern Israel, on March 9, 2016. The recreational use of cannabis is illegal in the Jewish state, but for the past 10 years its therapeutic use has not only been permitted but also encouraged. Last year, doctors prescribed the herb to about 25,000 patients suffering from cancer, epilepsy, post-traumatic stress and degenerative diseases. The purpose is not to cure them but to alleviate their symptoms. Forbidden to export its cannabis plants, Israel is concentrating instead on marketing its agronomic, medical and technological expertise in the hope of becoming a world hub in the field. / AFP / JACK GUEZ (Photo credit should read JACK GUEZ/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThousands of people with misdemeanor marijuana possession convictions will be pardoned in Washington state, Gov. Jay Inslee said.\n\nWashington voters approved legalizing marijuana as a tax revenue measure in 2012. Initiative 502 legalized and regulated the production, possession and distribution of cannabis for people ages 21 and older.\n\nNow, Inslee has announced the Marijuana Justice Initiative, a plan to expedite record clearances for thousands of citizens who were convicted of small-time possession charges before the law came into effect. About 3,500 people could be pardoned by the Marijuana Justice Initiative, according to the governor's office.\n\nInslee said he hopes the change will alleviate undue burden on those previously convicted.\n\nWe shouldn't be punishing people for something that is no longer illegal in Washington state, Inslee said. Forgiving these convictions can help lessen their impact and allow people to move on with their lives. It's a small step, but one that moves us in the direction of correcting these injustices.\n\nThese misdemeanor convictions can be over a decade old, but still create barriers to housing, employment, student loans, credit scores and even the ability to participate in a child or grandchild's school field trip.\n\nCarrying around misdemeanors for something that is no longer considered illegal is unfair, and they disproportionately affect communities of color the governor said.\n\nOnly people with a single conviction on their record will be eligible for the pardon, according to the statement. That person must also have been convicted between January 1, 1998 and December 5, 2012 for misdemeanor marijuana possession as an adult. That prosecution must have occurred under state law in Washington.\n\nThose who have an adult misdemeanor marijuana possession and believe they qualify for a pardon can submit a petition online, the statement said. Once the Office of the Governor reviews the case and confirms they are eligible, Inslee will pardon the conviction and ask Washington State Patrol to remove the offense from the criminal history report that is available to the public.\n\nSeattle already overturned the convictions of more than 500 people in September.\n\nAll seven judges on the city's municipal court agreed to vacate convictions from 1996 to 2010 for misdemeanor marijuana possession, saying that they disproportionally impacted people of color.\n\nOf the more than 500 cases cited, 46% involved African-American defendants, the judges said in their ruling. As of July 2017, the population of Seattle was about 7% African-American, according to US Census data.\n\nAnd Washington isn't alone is overturning the convictions.\n\nMore than 3,000 cases of marijuana smoking and possession, dating to 1978, were dismissed in September in New York City. And California lawmakers last summer approved a bill that would allow residents to petition the judicial system to have their old pot convictions expunged.
(CNN) When a freezer that was used to store the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine at a Northern California hospital broke, officials soon realized they only had about two hours to administer the more than 800 doses that were inside.\n\nAnd they took on the challenge.\n\nThe executive team at Mendocino County's Adventist Health Ukiah Valley Medical Center was notified during a safety inspection Monday morning that a freezer was found to be at room temperature, Judson Howe, of Adventist Health, told CNN. And the alarm that was supposed to alert staff of the temperature change had also malfunctioned.\n\nUnlike the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Moderna's vaccine can be stored in normal freezers and does not require ultra-cold transportation. But at room temperature, the vaccine has a shelf life of about 12 hours, Howe said.\n\nHospital officials contacted Moderna but did not hear back. So, the hospital decided to race the clock and administer the vaccines.\n\nRead More
Two major flaws in computer chips could leave a huge number of computers and smartphones vulnerable to security concerns, researchers revealed Wednesday.\n\nAnd a U.S. government-backed body warned that the chips themselves need to be replaced to completely fix the problems.\n\nThe flaws could allow an attacker to read sensitive data stored in the memory, like passwords, or look at what tabs someone has open on their computer, researchers found. Daniel Gruss, a researcher from Graz University of Technology who helped identify the flaw, said it may be difficult to execute an attack, but billions of devices were impacted.\n\nRelated: Apple says all Macs and iOS devices affected by chip flaws\n\nCalled Meltdown and Spectre, the flaws exist in processors, a building block of computers that acts as the brain. Modern processors are designed to perform something called speculative execution. That means they predict what tasks they will be asked to execute and rapidly access multiple areas of memory at the same time.\n\nThat data is supposed to be protected and isolated, but researchers discovered that in some cases, the information can be exposed while the processor queues it up.\n\nResearchers say almost every computing system -- desktops, laptops, smartphones, and cloud servers -- is affected by the Spectre bug. Meltdown appears to be specific to Intel (INTC) chips.\n\nMore specifically, all modern processors capable of keeping many instructions in flight are potentially vulnerable. In particular, we have verified Spectre on Intel, AMD, and ARM processors, the researchers said.\n\nRelated: What to do about the Spectre and Meltdown risks\n\nGovernment agencies issued statements warning users about the vulnerabilities.\n\nThe U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team said that while the flaws could allow an attacker to obtain access to sensitive information, it's not so far aware of anyone doing so.\n\nThe agency urged people to read a detailed statement on the vulnerabilities by the Software Engineering Institute, a U.S.-government funded body that researches cybersecurity problems.\n\nThe institute said that fully removing the vulnerability requires replacing vulnerable [processor] hardware.\n\nIt later changed its guidance on Thursday to suggest updating software was enough. The institute didn't say why it had made the change and didn't immediately respond to a request for further information.\n\nIt said the problems affect technology giants including Apple, Google and Microsoft.\n\nRelated: The year tech took a dark turn\n\nThe U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team recommended that users read advice posted online by Microsoft and software company Mozilla.\n\nThe U.K.'s National Cyber Security Center advised organizations and individuals to continue to protect their systems from threats by installing patches as soon as they become available.\n\nGoogle (GOOGL) programmer Jann Horn of Project Zero was one of the researchers who discovered the flaws. In a blog post, he said his group alerted chipmakers to the issues in June. Since last fall, security researchers and companies have investigated and updated software systems to address the flaws.\n\nRelated: Hackers take advantage of bitcoin's wild ride\n\nIntel chips are found in everything from personal computers to medical equipment. The company's shares were down 3% on Wednesday.\n\nThe company said in a press release that many types of computing devices — with many different vendors' processors and operating systems — are susceptible to these exploits.\n\nIntel said it is working with other chipmakers, including AMD and ARM Holdings, to solve the issue. ARM said in a statement a small subset of its processors are susceptible to the flaws. AMD said in a statement there is a near zero risk of exploitation for one of the security issues, due to architecture differences.\n\nA fix requires both the chip manufacturers and software makers to update their products before pushing it out.\n\nEstimates posted on Linux message boards suggested computer performance could slow down between 5% and 30% once patched, however Intel said users will not see significant performance changes.\n\nTech website The Register was first to report the processor flaws on Tuesday.\n\nA spokesperson for Microsoft (MSFT) told CNNMoney the company is aware of the issue and is in the process of deploying mitigations to cloud services and has released security updates to protect Windows users.\n\nRelated: The hacks that left us exposed in 2017\n\nGoogle's Cloud Platform has been updated to prevent the vulnerabilities, the company said.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) said in a statement most of its cloud computing machines affected by the flaw are already protected, but it was updating the rest on Wednesday.\n\nApple (AAPL) revealed Thursday that all its Mac and iOS devices were affected by the flaws, but said that there are no known exploits impacting customers at this time. The company has already released some fixes for Meltdown, and will release others for Spectre in subsequent updates.\n\nIt's important for all users to update their devices when new updates are released.\n\nFlaws in chips are unusual. Back in 1994, a major error in Intel's Pentium processor caused computers to incorrectly calculate results.\n\n-- Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.
(CNN) As we move into the new year, it's easy to see that things changed for a lot of people in 2020.\n\nAlongside a deadly pandemic, 2020 also delivered reminders of the severity of the climate crisis facing the world -- droughts, floods, heatwaves wildfires and hurricanes continued to disrupt life for communities across the globe, in addition to and in spite of the challenges brought by Covid-19.\n\nImages of some of these climate events -- visually stunning and sobering in equal measure -- have been captured by NASA's fleet of Earth-observing satellites and instruments found on the International Space Station.\n\nUnprecedented wildfires\n\nOn this day last year, NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer captured images of thick, tan-colored smoke drifting across Southeastern Australia, taken as the country was ravaged by one of its worst wildfire seasons on record.\n\nFire season in Australia is always dangerous -- but conditions were unusually severe in 2020, fanning the flames and making firefighting conditions particularly difficult.\n\nExperts say climate change has worsened the scope and impact of natural disasters like fires and floods -- weather conditions are growing more extreme, and, for years, and fires have been starting earlier in the season and spreading with greater intensity.\n\nThis natural-color image of Southeastern Australia was acquired on January 4, 2020 by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on NASA's Aqua satellite.\n\n2020 was also a year to remember for many residents of US West Coast states , where deadly wildfires in California, Oregon and Washington forced tens of thousands of people into shelters amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn the image below, captured on September 9, a thick blanket of smoke can be seen along the West Coast,\n\nClimate and fire scientists have long anticipated that fires in the U.S. West would grow larger, more intense, and more dangerous. But even the most experienced among them have been at a loss for words in describing the scope and intensity of the fires burning in West Coast states during September 2020, NASA said.\n\nThis image shows North America on September 9, 2020, as a thick blanket of smoke covered the West Coast.\n\nSeveral of this year's fires were triggered by lightning, but extreme conditions including record-breaking temperatures, dry air, fierce winds and drought caused the fires to wreak havoc on nearby forests, and, eventually, homes.\n\nThe Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) sensors, found on the NOAA-NASA Suomi NPP satellite, collected daily images of thick plumes of aerosol particles blowing throughout the US West, which, according to NASA, was on a scale that satellites and scientists rarely see.\n\nDrought\n\nOn July 3, 2020, the Operational Land Imager on Landsat 8 captured this false-color image of the river near Rosario, a key port city in Argentina.\n\nThough this picture seems to show a lush and green oasis, the image, captured by NASA's Landsat, actually reveals the parched river basin of Argentina's Paraná River.\n\nAn extended period of unusually warm weather and drought in southern Brazil, Paraguay and Northern Argentina caused the river to drop to its lowest levels in decades. Not only has the drought contributed to an increase in fire activity in the surrounding delta and floodplain areas, but it has also affected local businesses and residents, with ships grounded and low water levels costing millions of dollars in the grain industry.\n\nHuman activity has been linked to the world's risk of drought since the start of the 20th century: Greenhouse gases generated by power plants, farming, cars, trains and human activities in general have influenced the risk of droughts, and experts predict that drought linked to climate change will worsen.\n\nHurricanes\n\nHurricane Laura, one of the 10 strongest hurricanes to make landfall in the US, swept through southwestern Louisiana in August, killing at least six and leaving a wide path of destruction it its wake.\n\nThe 2020 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active on record, and many of the storms that slammed into the Gulf Coast, Central America and the Caribbean last year showed signs that they were supercharged by global warming.\n\nThe Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on NOAA-20 acquired this image of Hurricane Laura at 2:20 a.m. Central Daylight Time on August 26, 2020.\n\nIn the image above, captured by the VIIRS on the NOAA-20 satellite, the storm looms off the US coastline, highlighted by the darkness of night, while clouds are shown in infrared using brightness temperature data, and overlaid onto imagery showing city lights.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo says the federal government just lobbed an economic missile at New York by limiting tax filers' state and local tax deduction.\n\nAnd he urged the state's lawmakers Tuesday to take action now to avoid it.\n\nChange our tax code in a way that thwarts that attack, Cuomo said Tuesday in his 2018 budget address.\n\nThe purpose of the attack, in his view, is to subsidize the trillions in tax cuts contained in the new federal tax overhaul passed in December.\n\nCuomo noted that New York already sends $48 billion more every year to the federal government than the state gets back. Capping the SALT deduction at $10,000 will add another $14 billion to that, his office estimates.\n\nBut, Cuomo said, two structural changes to New York's tax code might mitigate the impact of the cap on New York taxpayers. The governor's office estimates the SALT cap will increase New York middle class families' property and state income tax burden by 20% to 25%.\n\nAdopt a payroll tax\n\nCuomo has directed his Department of Taxation and Finance to outline options for creating a state payroll tax to replace the income tax on wages.\n\nThe payroll tax would be paid by employers based on the wages they pay their workers. And the employers may still deduct those payroll taxes on their federal return.\n\nEmployees, meanwhile, would not pay any state tax directly on their wages. Instead, their wages likely would be a bit lower to reflect the cost of the new tax to their employer.\n\nCuomo explained it this way: Say you paid $5 to the state in income taxes for every $100 you earned last year. Under the new system, that $5 would be paid by your employer. But your income likely would be $5 less as a result. You'd still end up with the same $95 either way. And your employer's costs would still be $100 but your company could deduct the $5, since the payroll tax is a deductible employer expense.\n\nAt the end of the transaction, it costs business nothing and the employee is held harmless from ... the loss of (state and local tax) deductibility, Cuomo said.\n\nHe acknowledged such a switch would be dramatic as well as complicated, since the state also would maintain its income tax for non-wage income.\n\nBut the idea of a new payroll tax may not sit well with all businesses.\n\nOne upstate business advocacy group worries that it could create more administrative burden and higher costs for employers.\n\nSimply shifting New York's ever-increasing tax burden onto employers -- rather than reducing state spending or reforming property taxes -- will likely exacerbate New York's already well-established economic challenges and population decline, said Greg Biryla, executive director of Unshackle Upstate.\n\nOffer state tax credits for charitable contributions\n\nTo help offset the limitation on people's property tax deductions at the federal level, Cuomo has also asked his tax department to outline options to let New York state residents make a charitable contribution to the state through local government funds that might help finance education or health programs.\n\nIn exchange for the charitable contribution, the state would issue the resident a tax credit, although it's not likely to be dollar for dollar, Cuomo said. In addition the resident could deduct his charitable contribution on his federal tax return, since the new federal tax law does not curb charitable deductions.\n\nA similar proposal has already been introduced in California, which is another high-tax state worried about the SALT deduction cap's impact on its residents.\n\nMore details on both proposals are expected later this week when the New York Department of Taxation and Finance is expected to put out its preliminary report.

With almost 200 residents, it's one of the the largest care homes in the country.\n\nIt's Tuesday morning, and more than 20 residents are seated around a room flooded with natural light, holding weights and performing moderate physical therapy exercises with an instructor.\n\nThe mood is calm, and people are engaged, yet there is excitement in the air. Every few minutes, residents glance toward the door in anticipation.\n\nTheir guests of honor are late.\n\nYou can't help but feel the infection, said 90-year-old Fay Garcia, who was waiting patiently. It's like someone comes in and turns the light on, she said.\n\nThe infection – and light – comes in the form of a class full of children 2 to 3 years old who frequent the physical therapy session – and many other parts of the daily lives of the residents at the Jewish care home.\n\nIn September, Nightingale House opened the doors to its on-site nursery, Apples and Honey Nightingale, the first co-located nursery in the UK. Children and elderly residents have access to a program filled with activities that include baking, gardening and art, as well as exercise. Residents can also access the nursery to spend time with the kids.\n\nPHOTO: Meera Senthilingam/CNN Residents of Nightingale House during a physical therapy session.\n\nThe children work with and play with the residents every single day, said Ali Somers, co-founder of Apples and Honey Nightingale, who also heads evaluation and impact for this program.\n\nThe premise is intergenerational care, providing wisdom to the young and relationships – and, in turn, longevity – to the old.\n\n'Good things are happening'\n\nWhen we bring children and residents together, the elderly together, you can see right away that good things are happening, Somers said.\n\nThese good things are evident to any observer.\n\nMore than 10 children make their way along the garden paths into the lounge where the residents are stretching their arms and shaking their legs. Most faces in the room are smiling, and a few residents reach out to encourage the kids to come toward them specifically.\n\nAs small children roam about, trying the exercises themselves, cuddling up to residents and in some cases performing headstands, the rest of the room comes alive.\n\nThey're responding to an external stimulus, which is a toddler with an adorable grin fumbling towards them, carrying a toy, trying to interact, Somers said.\n\nThe benefits in terms of health are also clear to see.\n\nResidents very often forget their own physical limitations, and they find that they are encouraged; they stretch themselves; they will lean up out of their chair, extend a hand, engage in conversation, she added.\n\nThe average age of residents in the home is over 90, with 10% of them over 100, meaning issues regarding mobility and frailty are a priority, as well as loneliness.\n\nIf residents are more engaged, they're encouraged to walk from the home down to the nursery. They're going outside more. They want to opt in to working with and spending time with and playing with the residents, Somers said.\n\n'Adopted grandchildren'\n\nAt first, I couldn't see the connection between early years and old age, said Garcia, who moved into the home a little over three years ago, having lived in New York for most of her adult life.\n\nThe idea of intergenerational care didn't mean much to her, she said, as she had never had children of her own. But once she was informed about the benefits and began spending time with the children, she soon changed her perspective.\n\nWhen the children come in, they recognize you after some time, and now I have all these adopted grandchildren and great-grandchildren, Garcia said.\n\nIt's a whole new beginning for me, she said.\n\nPHOTO: CNN Fay Garcia, 90, visits with a child from her care home's on-site nursery.\n\nThe team at Nightingale has seen the change in Garcia and most of the home's residents – both physical and psychological.\n\nShe has been going to the mother and toddler groups and visiting the nursery, walking around and just having fun with the little ones, said Simon Pedzisi, director of care services at Nightingale House. His daughter attends the nursery and spends a lot of time with Garcia.\n\nI see (Garcia) move round and round the building walking, going to different places, he said. That's physical exercise with a purpose, because she's got somewhere to go, and she's got something that she's doing, which is different from trying to motivate herself.\n\nEnding age apartheid\n\nThe idea of intergenerational care is new to the UK, but the idea stems from similar centers in the United States and other parts of the world.\n\nPeople are becoming more and more aware of the age apartheid that we live with, said Judith Horowitz, who co-founded the nursery with Somers.\n\nHorowitz highlighted the fractured society that is increasingly dominant, where people actually don't mix, where you often don't have extended family that are living close to you.\n\nWe're not learning from each other, she said. Very small children are very nonjudgmental. They're very accepting, and they're also very interested and very creative. They see things often from rather quirky directions.\n\nAny significant differences made by the program are yet to be calculated, as the nursery has been in operation for only a few months. But a baby and toddler group preceded the creation of the nursery in January 2017, from which Somers is already seeing results – and expects to see more.\n\nImprovements for the elderly participants include reduced depression, increased mobility, better communication and language, and lower levels of dementia and memory loss.\n\nThe residents enjoy watching the children and observing them, Somers said. They engage different parts of their brains.\n\nSomers believes the days of institutionalizing – and separating – child care and later life care are coming to an end.\n\nSarah Harper, professor of gerontology at the University of Oxford, agreed, adding that today, people go to school and work and often then live with people of a similar age.\n\nThe consequence? As partners, siblings, cousins and other lateral generations die, people may find themselves very isolated and alone, said Harper, who is not involved in the Nightingale project.\n\nIn the old days, people used to live together in households … (or) with different generations just down the road, she said. In a way, it's very sad that we have to set up intergenerational programs. It should be actually very natural thing for the generations to live together.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWhile programs are typically set up to benefit the elderly, Harper believes they end up equally benefiting the younger ages: Both young children and teenagers having older people as role models.\n\nLove and relationships and getting into the world it isn't new for (the older) generation. I think that can be really comforting and reassuring, she said. We should naturally try to get the generations to live together.
Editor's Note — This article was originally published in October 2016.\n\n(CNN) — Rome is a magnet for visitors, but sometimes they struggle to escape its pull. That could change with the launch of a new collection of pilgrimage routes that begin or end in the Italian capital.\n\nThe  Italian Wonder Ways  radiate outward from Rome , taking modern day-pilgrims through the provinces of Umbria, Lazio, Tuscany and Marche. They're seen as smaller-scale rivals to northern Spain's popular Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route, but with less emphasis on arduous activity.\n\nThese trails showcase some of the finest scenery, food and culture in central Italy . They're not just aimed at pilgrims either.\n\nTailored itineraries created by a hospitality industry consortium cater to folks with different interests and levels of fitness. Pilgrims can strike out for a strictly religious or spiritual experience alongside hikers, bikers, families and even travelers on horseback.\n\nMedieval marvels\n\nDestination Rome: All trails converge on the Eternal City. Daniel Allen\n\nAlternatively, they can pick up a map and guidebook and travel independently at their own pace.\n\nHighlights along the five routes include magnificent medieval towns and cities such as Siena, Assisi, Gubbio, Itri and Anagni. There's also the spectacular scenery of the Apennine mountains, volcanic lakes such as Lake Albano and Lake Bolsena, and the Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo.\n\nAccommodation ranges from high-end luxury to low budget.\n\nMarco Aguiari, a dentist from Nemi, near Rome, is one of the first to explore the trails, praising the diverse scenery, food, wine, culture and opportunity to meet fellow pilgrims and local residents that they offer.\n\nThere's something for everyone, he says. You don't have to be a dedicated hiker or even religious to appreciate them.\n\nTranscontinental pilgrimage\n\nOne of the five routes, the Via Francigena, is a medieval walking trail that extends from Canterbury, through France and Switzerland, to Rome, and then onward to Jerusalem.\n\nMeaning Frankish route, it was once followed by archbishops traveling to the Eternal City to receive papal blessings and paperwork, as well as ordinary religious pilgrims. Though it fell out of favor compared with the pilgrimage route to the city of Santiago de Compostela in northwest Spain, parts of the Via Francigena have survived until the present day.\n\nIn 2009 the Italian government launched a project to restore the whole Italian section of the route.\n\nOther routes include the Cammino Francescano Della Marca/Via Lauretana, Via Di Francesco, Via Amerina and Cammino di San Benedetto.\n\nChariot tracks\n\nOld town: Itri boasts beautiful churches and bell towers. Daniel Allen\n\nThe Via Francigena del Sud traces its origins all the way to Roman times when it formed part of the most important paved road of Rome, the Via Appia, connecting the capital to the western port of Brindisi.\n\nAlong the route, Itri boasts a number of beautiful churches and bell towers.\n\nA short drive from Itri, the characterful Grande Albergo Miramare (Via Appia Lato Napoli; +39 0771 320047) is an elegant hotel housed in a former summer residence of Italian Queen Elena di Savoie, and comes complete with its own private beach.\n\nJust outside Itri, the Via Francigena follows the route of the Appian Way as it passes through the beautiful Parco Naturale dei Monti Aurunci.\n\nAt various points the original Roman flagstones of the Appian Way are visible, complete with ruts from chariot wheels.
After Snapchat's blockbuster IPO wraps up this week, the company will come away with billions in the bank -- and a whole new set of problems.\n\nSnap, the parent company of Snapchat, will use its new cash pile and stock to better compete against bigger tech companies for acquisitions and talent, with plans to keep hiring at a rapid pace, according to its IPO paperwork.\n\nLike its larger rivals, however, Snap may find the money comes at a price. Its corporate culture, public image and core products could each be impacted by its Wall Street performance, according to people who have worked with similar tech companies going public.\n\nIt's likely [Snap] will feel more pressure to prove themselves as a big, grownup company, and not a quirky startup, says Claire Diaz-Ortiz, an early Twitter (TWTR) employee who left the company a year after its IPO. The risk in this, of course, is losing what makes people love you.\n\nSnap has mostly lived in its own world. Its main U.S. office is by the beach in Los Angeles, far from the main tech scene in San Francisco. Snap's CEO rarely does interviews and its team shies away from holding the usual product demo events. Instead, the company drops new products from the sky.\n\nNow, Snap's top executives will be expected to do routine conference calls with analysts to talk strategy and walk through their quarterly financial performance.\n\nWhen the numbers fall short, it will be he harder to remain in that happy little bubble, says Lise Buyer, an IPO expert with Class V Group, who helped take Google (GOOGL) public.\n\nRelated: Snapchat's $4 billion man\n\nFacebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR), two of Snap's closest competitors, each struggled early on as public companies. Investors worried that Facebook couldn't make money on mobile users and Twitter couldn't grow its users enough to be truly mainstream.\n\nFacebook eventually proved Wall Street wrong, but Twitter is still trying to prove it has room to grow. Worse still, the damning narrative on Wall Street has arguably shaped the general public's perception of Twitter as an influential, but niche service.\n\nThe same could happen to Snap. Investors are expected to watch closely to see if Snapchat's user numbers stagnate and whether it can make substantially more money from each of its users.\n\nIf those two particular measures don't meet expectations, it will be a little more challenging for them to tell their own story, Buyer says.\n\nSnap only began trying to make money two years ago. Since then, it has introduced unusual products like sponsored geofilters and photo lenses as well as smart sunglasses sold through smiling yellow vending machines. It even put out its own line of backpacks and playing cards.\n\nBut as a public company, Snap may feel the need to go the traditional route: bombarding users with ads.\n\nThey are going to be under pressure to show they can generate revenue, and the easiest way to do that sometimes is to offer more standardized ad formats, says Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst with eMarketer.\n\nRelated: Snapchat's IPO has a Twitter problem\n\nIf failure on Wall Street doesn't limit Snap's creativity, success might.\n\nThe early, entrepreneurial employees who help build a company are more likely to bristle at working for a larger, publicly traded business.\n\nThe biggest difference they will see is the type of talent they will attract going forward. Public companies tend to attract more conservative employees, says Pat Flynn, a former recruiting director at Twitter and now a partner at The Errigo Group.\n\nDiaz-Ortiz, the early Twitter employee, remembers the company buttoning up across the board around the time of its IPO. No longer were we a handful of employees eating Whole Foods takeout around the clock and sending tweets into the ether, she says.\n\nA culture shift is most likely to impact early employees, who ... often have more financial incentive to leave anyway, Diaz-Ortiz adds. Putting on your IPO pants doesn't come without its personnel changes.

Mayfield, Georgia (CNN) Johnny Thornton stood on his sprawling catfish farm, once a symbol of empowerment in this majority Black county, and explained how the local election board once tried to strip him of his right to vote.\n\nIn 2015, after a failed attempt to shutter almost every polling location in a county three times the area of Atlanta, the Hancock County Board of Elections and Registration tried to remove 174 voters, almost all of them African American, ahead of a Sparta city election. The board even sent deputies to homes, summonsing voters to prove eligibility\n\nThe city's roll at the time included only 988 voters, so it meant about one in five potential ballots. The majority-White board ultimately clipped 53 residents from the rolls.\n\nHad Thornton and others not fought back, suing the BOER in federal court -- which in 2016 restored most voters to the rolls -- many county residents could have been disenfranchised, he said last month.\n\nJohnny Thornton says his catfish farm in Mayfield is his official address, but the BOER insisted he didn't live there.\n\nA lot of the individuals that they were targeting, they either worked out of town or did not have the means or resources to push back, said Thornton, a retired special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration. Voter suppression through administrative chaos is my term for it.\n\nWith Georgia voters set to decide control of the US Senate in Tuesday's runoffs , the challenges to the voting rolls in Hancock County, whose residents have long fought for their right to vote, remain under the supervision of a court-appointed examiner. Legal experts say the US Supreme Court pulling teeth from the Voting Rights Act is to blame.\n\nThe high court's 2013 ruling in Shelby County v. Holder effectively ended a provision that, in jurisdictions such as Hancock County, would have required preclearance for any voting changes. Since the ruling, lawyers have filed lawsuits alleging voter suppression from Alabama to Alaska.\n\nGeorgia has been a particularly active battleground, but some experts say Hancock County, a reliably Democratic enclave of about 8,500 people situated between Atlanta and Augusta, is one of the most troubling examples they've seen.\n\n'They were making Black votes disappear'\n\nThornton has means -- a rarity in a county where per capita income is $16,704, less than half the national average. He could afford a lawyer and federal court fees, whereas many other Black residents could not.\n\nWith 71% of its residents African American, Hancock is one of the Blackest counties not just in Georgia but in the nation. The percentage is even higher in Sparta, its county seat and only incorporated area.\n\nThe lawsuit highlighted disparities among the Black and White populations in 2015: Black households had a median income of $22,056 ($37,083 for White); almost 34% of Black residents lived in poverty (22% for White); and 26% of Black households received food benefits (6% for White).\n\nA man rides a bike through downtown Sparta last month.\n\nAhead of the 2015 Sparta elections, the lawsuit said, BOER Vice Chairwoman Nancy Stephens, who is White, began filing voter challenges as a citizen, then voting on them as a board member. When concerns were raised, a local resident began filing challenges in a format that closely resembled the format of those filed by the Vice Chair, the lawsuit said.\n\nThe challengers consistently failed to provide credible evidence based upon personal knowledge that the challenged voters were not qualified to vote, the lawsuit said. The BOER frequently accepted hearsay, speculation, and unsubstantiated rumors provided by unnamed witnesses and anonymous individuals as sufficient evidence to remove registered Black voters.\n\nStephens, who is no longer vice chair but remains a BOER member, referred questions to county attorney Andrea Grant, who did not return a phone call to discuss past and present concerns residents expressed.\n\nThe BOER, responding to the lawsuit, vigorously and strenuously denied illegally targeting Black voters or violating state laws.\n\nThornton can't understand why the BOER would claim he didn't live in the county, or why the board would try to remove him from the rolls. His catfish farm is in unincorporated Mayfield, 20 minutes outside Sparta, and he wasn't eligible to vote in the city elections. What's more, he receives bills at his catfish farm, which is the address on his driver's license. He also served as county NAACP treasurer and on the Sparta Housing Authority. He owns property outside the county but spends most of his time at the catfish farm, hunting and doing maintenance.\n\nHis attorney informed the elections supervisor that he could not appear before the board and would be out of town for several weeks, he said. The board removed him anyway, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWord moves quickly in Hancock County, especially when deputies are delivering summonses. Larry Webb heard the BOER was removing Black voters from the rolls and began attending meetings.\n\nSitting after two of the meetings, I thought, 'What would they do if someone challenged some White voters?' recalled Webb, who is Black.\n\nLarry Webb, seen last month at his Powelton home, decided to begin challenging White voters at the BOER meetings.\n\nHe went through the 2014 voting roll and pulled voters he knew were dead or had moved and submitted 14 challenges. Emails included in the lawsuit revealed BOER members didn't take Webb's challenges seriously and defended White voters. According to the lawsuit, Chairwoman Kathy Ransom wrote of Webb's challenges, Just a guess...he's targeting folks that are 'white' :)\n\nWebb asked for deputies to serve summonses to the residents he challenged, but he was told the sheriff's department was now charging $50 each, he said. When Webb's 14 challenges finally went before the board, Ransom told the White resident who had been challenging Black voters that deputies would no longer serve his summonses as a courtesy, as they had in the past, the lawsuit said.\n\nThe BOER determined before the hearing that four of Webb's challenged voters were dead and removed them from the rolls. Of the remaining challenges, the board nixed one voter from the rolls and moved another to inactive status. Both were Asian American, the lawsuit said.\n\nWhat they did was beyond voter suppression. If something is wrong with your voter registration, they should call you and tell you what's wrong. What they were doing is taking you off the rolls, and you wouldn't find out until the election, Webb told CNN. They were making Black votes disappear.\n\n'It had a discriminatory effect'\n\nIn Shelby County v. Holder , the US Supreme Court ruled that the coverage formula dictating which jurisdictions were subject to preclearance in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was unconstitutional. The formula, the court said in its 5-4 ruling, was based on 40-year-old facts having no logical relation to the present day.\n\nSince the death of the Georgia civil rights icon US Rep. John Lewis, politicians and activists have called for Congress to honor Lewis by crafting an updated coverage formula , as permitted by the high court, but it hasn't come to pass.\n\nWithout the formula, which forced jurisdictions with a history of discrimination, most of them Southern, to prove proposed changes to voting laws did not discriminate against minorities, many jurisdictions undertook changes to their elections procedures that voting rights experts say have a disproportionate impact on minorities.\n\nThe Hancock County Courthouse was rebuilt in 2014 after fire consumed much of the structure built starting in 1881.\n\nJulie Houk with the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, who worked on the Hancock County case, disagrees with the Supreme Court's finding that the conditions that originally justified these measures no longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions.\n\nWhy then did jurisdictions across the South and beyond immediately take actions that would have otherwise required preclearance under the previous iteration of the Voting Rights Act?\n\nTexas and North Carolina moved to stiffen voter ID laws, which already hampered Black and Latino voters, Houk said. The Lawyers' Committee has also challenged restrictive absentee ballot rules and fought voter purges, redistricting decisions and efforts to limit ballot drop boxes -- which tend to burden minorities the most.\n\nIn Macon-Bibb County, Georgia, Houk said, elections officials moved a Black voting precinct -- in a community that had rocky relations with law enforcement -- to the sheriff's office, which she called very problematic as it threatened to dissuade African Americans from voting. The Lawyer's Committee got the precinct moved, she said.\n\nGeorgia has been especially problematic, said Helen Butler, executive director of the Atlanta-based Coalition for the People's Agenda, whose team worked on the Hancock County case, as well as a handful in other Georgia counties.\n\nIn 2015, Georgia's then- Secretary of State Brian Kemp cited Shelby in informing counties they were no longer required to submit polling place changes to the Department of Justice.\n\nNumerous groups have reported added hardships on Georgia's minority voters since the US Supreme Court decision. American Public Media reporters found in 2019 that tens of thousands of voters state officials said had likely died or moved away had, in fact, not.\n\nThe ACLU of Georgia reported in September that of 313,243 voters removed from the state rolls in 2019, almost 200,000 were likely erroneously purged . While the secretary of state said it was routine maintenance, removing voters it had classified as inactive, Andrea Young, state ACLU executive director, countered that the state's method of maintenance was prone to tremendous error.\n\nA voting sign lays in the grass last month outside a home on the outskirts of Sparta.\n\nTwo weeks before the November general election, ProPublica, in collaboration with public broadcasters, reported, The state's voter rolls have grown by nearly 2 million since the US Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013, but polling locations have been cut by almost 10%, with Metro Atlanta hit particularly hard.\n\nThe outlets published their report under the point-blank headline , Why do nonwhite Georgia voters have to wait in line for hours? Their numbers have soared, and their polling places have dwindled.\n\nI'm not saying they intentionally discriminated, Butler told CNN, but it had a discriminatory effect.\n\n'Way past problems with Black and White'\n\nEven with all the battles unfolding in Georgia and across the nation, Hancock County stands out, experts say.\n\nHouk's colleague at the Lawyers' Committee, John Powers, who previously reviewed preclearance submissions for the US Justice Department, told a webzine in 2016 the Hancock County case was the worst case of voter suppression that I have ever seen.\n\nHancock County is just one example and probably one of the worst examples of how Shelby County is impacting individual voters, Houk said. This type of change in process would've been governed by preclearance. It would've stopped this whole process. ... This is why preclearance was so important: Discriminating against Black voters would've been rejected.\n\nSparta Mayor Allen Haywood defends the BOER, saying it was trying only to clean the rolls.\n\nWhile the county voluntarily entered into a consent decree, agreeing to the appointment of an examiner to oversee any changes to its voting rolls, Sparta Mayor Allen Haywood insists the agreement was unnecessary. There was no racist intent in the board's work, he said.\n\nThe truth about 2015 depends on what side you talk to, he said. No candidate could win in the city, now estimated at 89% African American, without securing a swath of the Black vote, said Haywood, who is White and is certain he was elected on his promise of reform, he said.\n\nThe board of elections was just trying to clean the rolls, he said. It's not a racial problem except for those who want to keep it that way. People just want to see a change here. They knew that if I got in, I was going to make things transparent.\n\nHe won the 2015 Sparta mayoral election but stepped down after news surfaced he had a 1982 felony gambling conviction in Alabama. He was betting on football games across state lines, he told CNN, and wasn't aware the conviction rendered him ineligible to seek office.\n\nHe had his record expunged and two years later won a City Council seat, serving as mayor pro tempore before ascending to the mayor's office in 2019 with less than 80 White votes cast, he said.\n\nHaywood inherited numerous problems, including a seven-figure tax-and-utility bill , the paying down of which has been a priority of his administration. He also hopes to lure investment back to the county and is considering a historic tourism initiative, but myriad problems persist, as evidenced by the dilapidated downtown.\n\nA mural declares, This is Sparta, on a building downtown, where many storefronts sit empty.\n\nLargely built before 1930, many stores lay not just empty but in disarray. A colorful butterfly mural on one corner proclaims, This is Sparta, while another mural honors Methodist bishops Lucius Holsey, an emancipated slave, and George Pierce, who owned Holsey's would-be wife before mentoring Holsey and assigning him to his first church\n\nCast-iron storefronts and other architectural relics reminisce the charm Sparta exuded in its heyday, as local businesses post signs encouraging residents to spend money locally and embrace the historic preservation of downtown, an entry on the National Register of Historic Places\n\nWe are way past problems with Black and White here, Haywood said. Now, people are excited things are getting fixed.\n\n'A disproportionate lack of growth'\n\nOnce fat on cotton and timber, Hancock was one of the richest counties in the state. It had a progressive reputation. Black residents, who have long been the majority, could own land and aspire, according to the book, Black Boss: Political Revolution in a Georgia County.\n\nAfter cotton crumbled, Hancock was destitute, the book explains. Before the Voting Rights Act of 1965, it had no Black elected officials until John McCown -- an activist more in the mold of Stokely Carmichael than Martin Luther King Jr. -- came to town, luring investment and ushering Black residents to power\n\nBy 1968, Hancock was the first US county since Reconstruction to come under Black political control, in large part because of the charismatic leadership of McCown, who became county commissioner, the book says. By the mid-1970s, African Americans held almost every elected office.\n\nMcCown remains revered among many Black residents, despite investigations into his alleged misspending of grant money and other improprieties. They consider his achievements landmarks, including an affordable housing project and job creators like a cinder block factory and Thornton's now-defunct catfish farm. McCown's antebellum home still stands , abandoned and in need of upkeep.\n\nThornton examines an old aerial photograph of his property, when it was a functioning catfish farm in Hancock County.\n\nMcCown's efforts weren't always well received by White folks, many residents also recall, and when tensions flared over desegregation in 1971, the city and McCown's hunting club went on machine gun-buying sprees that required the intervention of Gov. Jimmy Carter and the US Justice Department, UPI reported\n\nA 1976 plane crash killed McCown, and a federal investigation into his fundraising killed the county's resurrected prosperity, but his legacy survived in the Black leaders succeeding him.\n\nHe created a political strategy, and African Americans voted themselves into power, Thornton said. It has come to a point where (Hancock County) is one of the most impoverished in America. There is a wives' tale -- I don't know if it's true or not -- that some political leaders in Georgia have always said that if we can't vote the people of Hancock County out, we'll starve them out -- and there's been a disproportionate lack of growth to this particular community.\n\n'Folks decided voting wasn't worth it'\n\nThe BOER strenuously denied that it was illegally targeting Black voters with its challenges but agreed to enter the consent decree and abide by the standards and procedures the decree lays out. The court also ordered the defendants to pay more than $500,000 in attorneys' fees and other expenses, court documents show.\n\nAs part of the consent decree, the BOER agreed to not engage in discriminatory challenges to voters' eligibility, and to adhere to certain procedures in such challenges, according to court documents. It also restored certain voters to its rolls and agreed not to take action on other voters restored to the rolls for at least two federal election cycles.\n\nThe decree also outlined the appointment of an examiner, who will review the BOER's actions regarding list maintenance and voter challenges based on residency and make recommendations on how to comply with state law and the consent decree, a court order says.\n\nIf the BOER disagrees with or does not follow the recommendations any party may bring that issue to the Court's attention, the decree says.\n\nAtlanta attorney R. Gary Spencer was named examiner in June 2018. His term will run to December 2021. The consent decree will not expire until early 2023.\n\nFormer Sparta registrar Marion Warren began filming the BOER meetings after he learned of the voter challenges.\n\nButler considers the consent decree a victory preserving the legacy of Black empowerment in Hancock County, but it did not come without some casualties, she said.\n\nIt had a chilling effect on voters, she said. A lot of folks decided voting wasn't worth it.\n\nDespite the voting rolls growing by a few dozen electors since 2012, she laments that many voters were intimidated by the deputies and the summonses. They still haven't returned to the polls. Several residents -- including Thornton, Webb and former Sparta registrar Marion Warren -- each know multiple voters who never voted again after the deputies came to their homes, they say.\n\nIt will affect several elections down the road because people will say that I'm not going to be bothered by this ever again. I'm not going to vote, Warren said. You have virtually destroyed their whole trust in the system altogether.\n\nAside from Stephens, Robert Ingram, who is Black and now chairs the board, is the only remaining member of the 2015 BOER. He did not return a message from a CNN reporter seeking to discuss present-day ramifications to the 2015 challenges. The federal lawsuit cites a half dozen Black voters he defended during the challenges.\n\n'Virtually destroyed their whole trust'\n\nHancock County has been sort of noneventful since Spencer was appointed examiner, he said. The county has submitted voters it wants removed, as instructed, and during the November election, the NAACP seemed to think everything went OK, he said.\n\nSpencer's team is always concerned, he said, and events happening at the state and national level, including Georgia's secretary of state calling to end no-excuse absentee voting and President Donald Trump challenging elections results, only exacerbate his worry.\n\nAt this point, however, he has seen nothing in Hancock County that would spur him to request an extension to his term or the consent decree, but before making any final decision, I would certainly check on it just to do some due diligence.\n\nThornton and others remain worried. The county is playing with house money, he said. Where Thornton shelled out his own earnings to defend his right to vote, the county used his tax dollars to fight him. Again, he emphasized, most Hancock County residents don't have his resources.\n\nI am definitely worried that once the consent decree ends that the BOER will start its same antics again, he said. They can say, 'Hey, we'll get everybody except Johnny Thornton, and the other people that we go for might not have the legal means or expertise to push back or to fight against the system.'\n\nA person walks past a downtown Sparta pharmacy. A sign in its window urges residents to buy locally.\n\nWarren, in addition to previously serving as Sparta's registrar, is a Black county resident who began filming BOER meetings in 2015 when he learned of the challenges. He had trouble last year, he said, when applying for a mail-in ballot. A county elections official told him his home wasn't his registered address, he said.\n\nHe isn't alleging any misbehavior -- he was able to sort it out before the general election -- but such a county notice might have been enough to deter a less-resolute voter from casting her or his ballot. In poor, rural areas like Hancock County, minor hiccups such as a rainy day or a washed-out road can have major effects on voting.\n\nBecause there is so little work in the county, people work multiple jobs or leave the county for employment, making it difficult to find time to vote, he said. Residents can struggle with transportation in a county it takes almost an hour to traverse end to end. There are literacy and education issues at play as well, he said.\n\nAll you've got to do is find an obstacle that you can put between them and the polling place. It don't matter what it is, he said. Because we are as a race, we are very critical of the voting process in the first place.
Story highlights Ryan Speedo Green is a bass-baritone opera singer He had a rough childhood and spent time in juvenile detention, but music changed the course of his life\n\n(CNN) —\n\nAt 9 years old, Ryan Speedo Green was put in a class with some of the worst kids in his district.\n\nThe first day of class, the way I introduced myself to (my teacher) was I threw my desk at her, Green said. She took my chair away and told me I could learn from the floor. When I was ready to learn from my desk, I could have my chair and my desk back.\n\nThis was one of the first tough love lessons his teacher Elizabeth Hughes taught Green. But she never gave up on him.\n\nGreen grew up in low-income housing in southeastern Virginia. His father wasn't in his life, so his mom raised him.\n\nI had a lot of anger issues, and I lashed out a lot, he said. I don't think I liked myself as a person or my home life.\n\nHughes was the first teacher who believed in him, he said.\n\nPHOTO: Courtesy Ryan Speedo Green Ryan Speedo Green with Elizabeth Hughes, his teacher from ages 9 to 11, who saw the best in him.\n\nShe was one of the first people in my life to ask me, 'Are you OK? Is everything OK at home?' … instead of just sending me to the principal's office.\n\nGreen spent two years in her class. Once he left that safe space, he found himself reverting to his old ways.\n\nI was in a situation at home where I threatened my mom's life and my brother's life, he said. At 12 years old, I remember being taken away in a cop car. My hands were cuffed, and my legs were shackled.\n\nGreen spent the next two months in a juvenile detention center, mostly in solitary confinement.\n\nI just remember how alone I felt. It was probably the lowest point in my life, he said.\n\nWhen he got out, he was willing to do anything to keep from going back. He joined the Latin club and started playing football. But it wasn't until he signed up for choir that his life began to change.\n\nI was actually a horrible singer, he said. I thought I could stand in the back and not have to do anything. But it was the exact opposite. I had to sing in front of the class.\n\nGreen auditioned for the Governor's School for the Arts in Norfolk, Virginia, when he was in ninth grade. It was there that he met another influential teacher, Robert Brown.\n\nWhen I was facing a lot of problems in my academics … he took it upon himself to give me free voice lessons and free coaching so I wouldn't fall behind, he said. He became almost like a father figure to me.\n\nOpera changed his life\n\nWhen Green was 15, Brown took him to see his first opera at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. It was Carmen, and the lead was played by Denyce Graves, an African-American mezzo-soprano.\n\nSeeing a person who looked like me on stage and meeting her made it tangible for a young kid like me, he said. I told Mr. Brown, 'I know what I want to do with my life. I want to sing at the Met. Not just any opera house but the Metropolitan Opera House.' That was the first time I ever had a dream.\n\nInstead of telling him it was impossible, Brown told him everything he needed to do to do it. Slowly, Green began checking everything off that list.\n\nPHOTO: Courtesy Ryan Speedo Green Ryan Speedo Green, right, with his music teacher Robert Brown, who became like a father to him.\n\nHe attended The Hartt School at the University of Hartford and earned a master's degree in music at Florida State University. Then he auditioned for the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions. A couple of weeks later, he was singing on the Met stage.\n\nThis was nine years from the day I told Mr. Brown I wanted to sing at the Met. And I was singing at the Met, he said.\n\nBrown died a year and a half before that. But the head of the program for The Governor's School for the Arts came to the finals and sat in the front row with a picture of him.\n\nI felt like Mr. Brown was there smiling down on me and telling me to keep moving forward and to let my dream get bigger, he said.\n\nGreen, now 30, has been singing professionally for the past six years. The bass-baritone's last performance at the Met was as Colline in La Bohème by Puccini.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nI love the fact that I get to come back every now and then to the place that gave me this dream to be who I am today, he said.\n\nIn 2016, Green's life was the subject of the book Sing For Your Life: A Story of Race, Music, and Family by Daniel Bergner. He also got married last year and lives with his wife in Vienna, Austria.\n\nIf I could leave a message with any child or adult who feels like they are not seen or heard. … Find something positive that interests you and focus on that, he said.

(CNN) Next year will be a crucial year for Erika Kirgios as she works to complete her doctorate, publish academic papers and try to land a faculty job at a university.\n\nNot surprisingly, one of her New Year's resolutions is to focus on her career.\n\nIn order to find some delight in what could be long nights working alone, she is applying her research in the science of behavior change to pair meticulous work -- writing research articles -- with a decadent temptation -- in her case, a particular candle and cup of tea.\n\nI'm really going to focus on writing, Kirgios said. I only light my favorite candle and drink my favorite tea when I'm writing because I need to make sure that I have the external motivations to get started.\n\nThe doctoral student at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School has an advantage -- her research focuses on ways we can ensure successful behavioral change.\n\nThe good news is that her lab has found a litany of ways science can make your resolution stick this year. Here's how to proceed.\n\nBehavior change\n\nKirgios' method for increasing her likelihood of a successful resolution is known as temptation bundling, according to Katy Milkman, professor of operations, information and decisions at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nMilkman oversees Kirgios' research and co-directs Penn's Behavior Change for Good Initiative.\n\nKirgios and Milkman tested temptation bundling in a study published this year of more than 6,000 members of 24 Hour Fitness gyms around the United States. One group was given a free audiobook and encouragement to listen to it while working out; a second group was given the free audiobook without the extra nudge; and a third group didn't receive the book.\n\nThose who consciously bundled the temptation of the free audiobook with exercising were 10% to 14% more likely to have a weekly workout than those who didn't have a book.\n\nThat same concept can work in other situations.\n\nCreate an incentive: As the mother of a 4-year-old, Milkman, the Wharton professor, is thinking about setting a resolution to stay off her phone and be more present with her family during dinner.\n\nOne way she could accomplish that is by having her husband make a donation to a charity she hates every time she slips up and responds to a buzz on her phone during dinner.\n\nOne online tool, StickK , enables you to put real money on the line to help you stick to your commitments.\n\nMilkman declined to name which loathed charity her husband might pick to send 10 bucks whenever she slips her phone out at the table. But use your imagination, and brainstorm how you can up the ante financially to encourage positive behavior in yourself or a friend.\n\nCreate a plan: For goal setting, you can follow the For goal setting, you can follow the WOOP framework , which stands for Wish, Outcome, Obstacles and Plan. That means beginning with a wish and imagining a positive outcome that could emerge from achieving that goal. Then you identify any obstacles hindering you, before devising a plan to navigate around them.\n\nPiggybacking: It's similar to temptation bundling, and refers to stacking an activity you'd like to start after a routine habit. Many people brush their teeth every day, but fewer people floss. So British scientists designed It's similar to temptation bundling, and refers to stacking an activity you'd like to start after a routine habit. Many people brush their teeth every day, but fewer people floss. So British scientists designed a study in which one group of people was told to floss before brushing, and another after brushing.\n\nEight months later, those who trained to floss after brushing had a stronger habit than the other group.\n\nFrame your resolution positively: A recent study by scientists published in the open-access journal PLOS One showed that framing your resolution positively could be a way to increase your likelihood of success.\n\nResearchers from Stockholm University and Linköping University in Sweden noticed that resolvers with approach goals were 12% more likely to succeed than those with goals centered around avoiding something.\n\nSo consider phrasing your resolution, I want to start cycling, rather than, for instance, I want to quit eating ice cream.\n\nMulligan or cheat day: Slipups happen. So factor them in. Rather than trying to meditate every day, your goal could be to meditate five out of seven days per week.\n\nThat's one way to avoid what behavior change researchers call the Abstinence Violation Effect, in which you say screw it after missing a day of routine and let it slide even more. So use your slips as an opportunity to learn.\n\nDon't let a slip become a fall, said John Norcross, distinguished professor and chair of psychology at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania and author of the book  Changeology: 5 Steps to Realizing Your Goals and Resolutions .\n\nFind a partner or a mentor: Besides focusing on writing papers and job searching, Kirgios also has a resolution to do yoga for 15 minutes every evening with her mother.\n\nThat way, we can be each other's commitment device, she said. I have the added benefit of helping my mom achieve her goals, too, and of sharing some daily quality time.\n\nHang out too much on Twitter or Facebook? Announce your resolutions on social media, so your community can help hold you accountable, too.\n\nThere's hundreds of studies in the health psychology literature suggesting in fact that social support does in fact make a difference, Norcross said.\n\nAnd people don't fail at resolutions as much as we think they do. About 40% to 44% of New Year's resolutions are successful, as measured six months later when researchers check back in with resolvers, according to a 1988 study published in the Journal of Substance Abuse.\n\nOn the one hand, that feels like a pretty decent track record. On the other hand, it still means the majority of New Year's resolutions fail by the Fourth of July.\n\nIt brings up a key question: Should we even set resolutions?\n\nA fresh start\n\nI'm very much a fan of New Year's resolutions. I'm a fan of Monday resolutions, and beginning of the month resolutions, and after rejection resolutions and after-you-miss-your-noon-workout resolutions, Milkman said.\n\nThat faith comes from studying what she calls the fresh start effect, which she observed in a 2014 study . She and colleagues observed that gym visits, commitments to and Google searches for terms such as diet all increase around particular landmarks in time.\n\nThese new mental accounting periods could be the start of a new semester, a birthday or a holiday.\n\nI love that there's moments throughout our lives when we sort of stand back and assess what we could do better and I think that's how we grow, she said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAnd if you worry about setting a resolution this year because it might not work, there's virtue in trying anyways, to find out what the exercise could teach you.\n\nOne of the key things I feel like I've learned in the last decade of studying this is that goal failure is the norm, Milkman said. The whole ball game is figuring out how we recover from failure, keep trying and getting better.
I have $400,000 in savings from which I need to draw monthly retirement income. Is it possible to do that with an immediate annuity? --V.D.\n\nSure, not only is it possible to convert $400,000 -- or retirement savings of almost any amount -- to monthly income by buying an immediate annuity, that's exactly what an immediate annuity is designed to do: turn a lump sum of money into guaranteed payments that can support you throughout retirement.\n\nAnd for many people, although certainly not all, an immediate annuity can be an excellent way to generate at least some of the retirement income they require. After all, one of the most valuable features of immediate annuities is that they can churn out monthly income that's guaranteed to last no matter how long you live (which, given today's longer lifespans, might be well into your 90s).\n\nAside from the financial advantages of having income you can count on for the rest of your life, research also shows that retirees who receive income from a pension or annuity tend to be more satisfied with their life in retirement.\n\nRelated: Is a 15% savings rate enough for a secure retirement?\n\nBut immediate annuities also have downsides, the main one being that once you invest your money in such an annuity, you generally give up access to it. That means whatever portion of your savings you devote to an annuity will no longer be available to cover unexpected expenses that may pop up in retirement.\n\nSo you don't want to put all of your savings into an immediate annuity. You'll want to have other assets, like a diversified portfolio of stock and bond funds and a cash reserve, that can provide some long-term capital growth to help you maintain your living standard in the face of inflation and that you can tap for emergencies and such.\n\nAll of which is to say that the real issue you need to consider is whether an immediate annuity fits into an overall retirement income plan that makes sense for your situation.\n\nAnswering these three questions can help you decide whether that's the case and, if so, just how much of your four hundred grand you might want to devote to an annuity.\n\n1. How much retirement income do you actually need? The first step toward gauging whether you're a candidate for an immediate annuity is to get a handle on how much annual income you'll require to cover your retirement expenses. And the best way to do that is to create a retirement budget.\n\nThis budget doesn't have to be accurate down to the last cent. Rather, if you estimate your expenses as best you can and then refine your figures as you get a better sense of your actual retirement spending, that should be fine. You want to come away with as realistic an idea as you can of what your outlays will be during retirement so you can gauge how much income you'll need to cover them.\n\nYou can create a retirement budget with pencil and paper if you like. But I think you'll find it easier (and more accurate) to use an online tool like BlackRock's Retirement Expense Worksheet. This free interactive worksheet allows you to enter upwards of 50 separate expenses. It includes a section for discretionary items (entertainment, dining out, hobbies, traveling, etc.), which gives you a sense of how much maneuvering room you have should you need to reduce expenses and makes it easy to identify specific expenses you can easily pare.\n\nWhile you're doing your budget, I suggest you also take the time to do a little lifestyle planning -- that is, consider such issues as whether you'll stay in your current home, downsize or maybe even relocate to a less expensive area; whether you'll seek part-time work after you call it a career; and, whether you plan to spend most of your time pursuing activities close to home or do lots of traveling. The more you can factor the way you plan to live in retirement into your budget, the more accurate it will be.\n\n2. How much income will you receive from Social Security and other assured sources? Before you commit to buying more guaranteed income via an annuity, you should check to see how much assured income you're already scheduled to receive.\n\nFor example, if you're among the minority of workers these days who qualifies for a traditional check-a-month pension, you can check with your HR department to see what size benefit you'll receive after retiring. (Some pension plans offer the choice of taking your pension benefit in monthly payments or as a lump sum (or even both), in which case you'll need to consider which option makes the most sense.)\n\nFor most people, though, Social Security will be their main, if not only, source of guaranteed retirement income. If you haven't already begun collecting benefits, you can see what size payments you're projected to receive based on your work history by going to the Social Security Administration's Retirement Estimator tool.\n\nYou can (and should) also use the tool to see how much your monthly Social Security payment may increase if you delay collecting for a few years. The amount you receive rises roughly 7% to 8% for each year you postpone taking benefits between the ages of 62 and 70. Unless you have good reason to believe you'll live less than your life expectancy, it's generally a good idea to hold off claiming Social Security, provided you have sufficient assets to fund your retirement while you delay.\n\nThe main idea, though, is to gauge how much guaranteed income you can count on without buying an annuity. By comparing that figure to the amount of income you'll need to cover your retirement expenses, you'll be in a much better position to decide whether it makes sense to devote a portion of your savings to an annuity to generate even more guaranteed income.\n\n3. How much additional guaranteed income, if any, do you feel you need? If the monthly income you'll get from Social Security and any pensions is sufficient to pay all or nearly all of your essential retirement expenses, then from a purely financial standpoint you probably don't need additional guaranteed income from an annuity. You can probably draw as needed from your retirement nest egg to cover any expenses beyond what Social Security and any pensions will cover as well as any money you may need for emergencies and unplanned expenses.\n\nThat said, if you feel that additional assured income from an annuity will give you greater peace of mind or allow you to better enjoy your retirement, then, hey, go for it. Just be sure that you'll still have enough savings in stocks, bonds and cash to give yourself enough financial flexibility should your income needs change in retirement.\n\nIf, on the other hand, your basic living costs are greater than what you'll collect from Social Security and any pensions -- which will probably be the case for most people -- then you might want to at least consider bridging some or all of the gap by using a portion of your nest egg to buy income with an immediate annuity.\n\nToday, for example, investing $100,000 in an immediate annuity will get a 65-year-old man about $560 a month in guaranteed income for life. That same $100,000 would buy about $530 a month in lifetime income for a 65-year-old woman and about $480 a month in monthly payments that would be paid as long as either member of a 65-year-old couple (man and woman) is still alive.\n\nRelated: Annuity payment calculator\n\nOf course, even if your expenses exceed the income you'll receive from Social Security and any pensions, that doesn't automatically mean you need an annuity. If the gap between your expenses and assured income is relatively small -- or if your nest egg is so large that you run very little risk of running through it during your lifetime -- then you may very well be able to rely on withdrawals from savings for any additional income you need.\n\nTo get an idea of how long your nest egg is likely to last given different levels of withdrawals, you can check out this retirement income calculator.\n\nFinally, if you do decide you're a likely candidate for an annuity, I recommend that you learn a bit more about how immediate annuities work and get to know their pros and cons. You might also want to check out these 5 tips for choosing the best annuity.\n\nIf you feel you need some help in assessing whether an immediate annuity is a good choice, you can always consult an adviser. But if you do, be sure you're dealing with a financial pro who can be objective when it comes to annuities, not one who would never recommend an annuity under any circumstances, nor one who's really more about selling annuities than providing financial advice.

Hill: I just do what I think is right\n\nDemocratic Congressional candidate Katie Hill speaks to supporters at her election night party in California's 25th Congressional district on November 6, 2018 in Santa Clarita, California.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nWhen Katie Hill opened the heavy wooden door to her new congressional office in the Longworth House Office Building, one feeling smacked her in the gut.\n\nWell, this doesn't feel like me, recalled the freshman congresswoman from California's 25th District.\n\nSo yeah, this very formal place being my home base does feel strange, she added. I don't want to become more formal. That's not on the table.\n\nHill argues her life doesn't allow her to embrace any of the formal trappings of Washington. Raised in suburban Los Angeles, she prefers sneakers to heels. She's a Democrat and the daughter of a Republican police officer and survived a sexual assault. Socially conscious, she married a man but identifies as bisexual.\n\nThe thrust of her career has been in non-profits, as an advocate for the homeless. She also embraces the sexist criticism, known as resting bitch face, about a serious woman (like her) not smiling while thinking.\n\nThis isn't the sort of resume or life story that typically precedes a seat in Congress, but that's just fine with Hill and the voters who elected her. An unconventional woman, the 31-year-old joins the 116th Congress, the most diverse legislature in history by many measures — gender, race and sexual orientation.\n\nRefusing to change is part of the internal feedback loop in Hill's first days in Washington.\n\nSometimes in the middle of an unreal day, you just really need to hug your mom.\n\n\n\nWe're about to be sworn in. Let's do this. pic.twitter.com/8zmyMbgvb9 — Rep. Katie Hill (@RepKatieHill) January 3, 2019\n\nA grassroots candidate\n\nHill won with an insurgent campaign spurred by the 2016 election. She channeled her anger at the victory of President Donald Trump by taking aim at her congressman, Rep. Steve Knight, who voted with fellow House Republicans in May 2017 to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Who is going to run against him? Hill typed out on her social media accounts. A friend said, Why not you?\n\nWhy not, thought Hill.\n\nA year and a half later, Hill flipped the suburban Los Angeles district for Democrats. The first-time candidate had started her grassroots campaign out of a rented apartment backed by a hoodie-wearing millennial staff, chain-sipping La Croix sparkling water. The team raised more than $8 million without taking a cent in corporate or special interest money.\n\nHill won over voters as a progressive advocate for affordable housing while offering a pragmatic willingness to work across party lines for her purple district. Trying to fit into Washington is not why Hill was elected nor does it sit anywhere on her agenda.\n\nPlaying nice isn't really something that's in my vocabulary, she said. I just do what I think is right.\n\nDemanding to be heard\n\nThat philosophy may sound quaint, even naive, for Washington, but Hill believes that's the shared sentiment among the incoming freshmen congressional class.\n\nA record-setting 127 women were elected to the 116th Congress, the majority of whom are Democrats. More African Americans, Latinos and LGBTQ members now serve in Congress. The legislature also saw its median age drop by approximately a decade with its newly elected members.\n\nPHOTO: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images Katie Hill laughs as Nancy Pelosi's granddaughter reacts to votes for Pelosi to become Speaker of the House.\n\nHill is notable for her youth as well as being California's first openly bisexual woman elected to Congress. But it's the sheer size of the freshman class, at 92 new members with 46 flipped seats in the 2018 midterm election, that's politically powerful to her.\n\nTraditionally, new legislators have been expected to wait their turn while more seasoned members drove the agenda. But this time, and in this age, the newbies are demanding their voices be heard.\n\nI think we have enough power and enough strength in numbers and enough of a strong mandate from voters that we're going to be able to continue to stay true to the things that we ran on, said Hill, who was elected to the Democratic House leadership team as one of two new members representing freshmen.\n\nPHOTO: Win McNamee/Getty Images Katie Hill, right, poses with other members of the newly elected Democratic House Leadership team in November.\n\nThe result, she hopes, will be in them governing differently.\n\nA new agenda and attitude\n\nTop of Hill's agenda is focusing on a more equitable system, from health care to taxes to housing. Hill believes the biggest problem with Washington has been the billionaire class being controlled by special interest donors and ignoring the needs of the politically powerless.\n\nWe are regular, middle class people, said Hill, the now third-youngest member of Congress (behind Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Iowa's Abby Finkenauer.)\n\nWe're young. We look like and speak like the people that we're there to represent. We're not people who came up through the political process. The majority of us are first-time candidates. We're not stuck in the old way of doing things, she said.\n\nThis Freshman class is larger, younger, and more diverse than ever before and that's not a coincidence – it's a call to action.\n\n\n\nYesterday @JoeNeguse and I were elected to be the Co-Representatives to Leadership for this historic class and we are so ready to get to work. pic.twitter.com/GZv3FUElNe — Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) November 29, 2018\n\nHill spoke to CNN as she made the flight to Washington from Burbank, California, inviting us to chronicle her journey from candidate to congresswoman-elect to swearing in.\n\nA millennial, Hill embraces the sharing philosophy of her generation via social media and speaks easily with reporters as cameras roll. She's shared on Twitter and Facebook her personal stories about surviving sexual assault and an unplanned pregnancy that ended in a miscarriage. In her unconventional political ads, she went rock climbing.\n\nAs Hill checked in for the 6:45 a.m. flight, she remarked, I've never lived outside of California or traveled with so many bags. For the record, there were three suitcases.\n\nShe wore athletic clothing for the flight, noticing then, under the bright fluorescent lights of the ticket counter, that her black pants were covered in her dog's white hair. Oh well, she said, as she walked towards airport security. Her goal, she said, is to demystify Congress by bringing her voters with her on this journey and through her entire term, dog hair and all.\n\nI think what I, and many of the other freshmen have, what's kind of unique, is this sort of ability to relate to people in a different way.\n\nI left my house in SoCal and it was 37 degrees, landed in DC and it's more than 50 degrees here! What a warm welcome! ☀️\n\n\n\nCan't believe inauguration is this week — I'm so ready to get to work. 💪🏼 pic.twitter.com/UV28nRQPFO — Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) December 29, 2018\n\nIt's why on Hill's Twitter feed she's posted frequent updates on her first impressions of Washington during new member orientation, known as Congress Camp. She talked about what committees she hoped to join to best represent her district, a sprawling community with suburban middle-class families and lower-income desert communities, and doesn't plan on slowing down the tweets.\n\n'There's going to be fights'\n\nHill signed the lease at her new home – a small, no frills, two-bedroom apartment that gives off a corporate, temporary housing sensibility. It's there she caught up with her roommate and fellow freshman, Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois. Nearly the same age, the congresswomen initially give off a bubbly vibe of moving into a college dorm.\n\nYou can only have tough dinner table conversations if you first get the dinner table! 😂\n\n\n\n@LUnderwood630 is the best Ikea partner I could imagine — the true test of roommate compatibility!

She is now the youngest black woman to ever serve in Congress. We don't walk in and everything automatically changes.\n\nI would imagine there will be confrontations, said Hill. There's going to be fights between the old guard and the new one. But I feel very optimistic that the existing leadership all want us to be part of this process. They recognize the change that's happening, and they're trying to include us.\n\nPHOTO: Kyung Lah/CNN The nameplate for Rep. Katie Hill outside her office on Capitol Hill.\n\nOn inauguration morning, a crush of cameras greeted Hill, swarming around her as she tried to enter the Capitol to be sworn in.\n\nIt feels good.

Her cross-country journey had ended but her new role as Congresswoman Katie Hill had just begun.
Story highlights Final government decision awaited on reclassifying manatee status US Fish and Wildlife Service cites improvements in the population, habitat\n\n(CNN) —\n\nIn the next several weeks, the US Fish and Wildlife Service is expected to make public its final decision on whether to downlist the manatee from an endangered to a threatened species – a marker of progress in the species' recovery.\n\nThe agency invited public comment last year after it proposed reclassifying the aquatic creatures, which weigh half a ton and range up to 13 feet long.\n\nNearly 4,000 people weighed in. One comment captured the appeal of the endearing animal: The manatee has become a living icon of Florida as much as orange juice, Mickey Mouse and the beaches.\n\nThe government's decision will come amid signs that the manatee is thriving. For the third straight year, spotters counted more than 6,000 manatees navigating Florida's waters. But some believe reclassification is premature.\n\nWhat's being considered\n\nThe US Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages manatee refuges and sanctuaries, last year proposed reclassifying the West Indian manatee from endangered to threatened – a less serious status. The Florida manatee is a subspecies of West Indian manatee.\n\nThe Endangered Species Act defines an endangered species as one currently in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. A threatened species is one that is likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future.\n\nThe designation came with federal restrictions on such things as boat speed and waterfront development that are credited with protecting the species and reversing its decline. The agency said it will continue to lead efforts to increase the population and reduce threats.\n\nThe arguments for and against\n\nThe agency pointed to significant improvements in the manatee population and habitat conditions. The manatee's recovery is incredibly encouraging and a great testament to the conservation actions of many, Cindy Dohner, the Southeast regional director for US Fish and Wildlife, said at the time.\n\nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission submitted comments in favor of the reclassification.\n\nOne of the things we deal with is … people assume if a species comes off the endangered species list … it is a failure, said Gil McRae, head of the commission's Fish and Wildlife Research Institute.\n\nPart of government's job, McRae said, is to make conservation improvements that get species reclassified as soon as possible.\n\nHis thoughts were echoed by Christina Martin, an attorney for the Pacific Legal Foundation, which has pushed for the manatee's status change. There is a limited amount of resources available to protect all the species, she said, adding officials should focus on the species most in need of being saved from going extinct.\n\nPHOTO: Wolfgang Polzer /ddp images/Sipa USA Manatees are protected by federal and state law in Florida.\n\nThe foundation has represented residents who formed the organization Save Crystal River. Martin said Save Crystal River is concerned the federal government might adopt more and more restrictions that would be harmful to their community.\n\nKatie Tripp, director of science and conservation for the Save the Manatee Club, agrees the aim is to eventually have the manatee downlisted – but she said there are legitimate concerns about the plan.\n\nWhat I work for every day is to get them to the point of recovery. It is not clear to me how we do that when so many manatees are dependent on things we can't control, she said.\n\nTripp singled out coastal power plants.\n\nThe state has underscored the importance of a warm-water habitat for manatees in Florida. But Tripp said 60% to 70% of the creatures rely on artificial or man-made sources of heat, specifically outflow from coastal power plants.\n\nWhy it matters where manatees congregate\n\nThe Save the Manatee Club said it is concerned about the concentration of manatees during the winter outside power plants, particularly in the northern part of the state.\n\nThe manatee management community has no control over the power industry, Tripp said. What will we do if one of these power plants goes away?\n\nTripp said up to 1,200 animals have gathered outside a single plant. And, she said, during a 2010 cold snap there was higher mortality outside such facilities.\n\nMcRae, with the state research institute, said there is no definitive data on such deaths. He contends manatees will experience cold kills if they cannot find this warm water.\n\nHe agrees it would be ideal for more of the lovable sea cows to gravitate toward natural springs instead of artificial heat sources. Long term, it is a challenge what to do about that affinity, if in fact any of these plants go offline.\n\nWhat happens to protections if the status changes\n\nShould we decide reclassification is warranted, there would be no changes in protections, said Chuck Underwood, a public information officer for the US Fish & Wildlife Service office in Jacksonville. All existing protections remain in place and enforceable and additional protections, if needed, could be implemented. The species would remain protected under both the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act.\n\nPHOTO: Fish & Wildlife foundation of florida For a $25 annual fee (plus registration fees), Floridians can help conservation of the species.\n\nMcRae said the state would continue its current program. He touts the state's Save the Manatee Trust Fund. Proceeds from a special manatee license plate contributed to $3.8 million in revenues from the fund in 2015-2016.\n\nWith the long-term support of the Trust Fund, FWC has developed state-of-the-art techniques to monitor manatee abundance, trends in abundance, and threats … the commission says on its website.\n\nTripp, with the Save the Manatee Club, said her group is concerned that a downlisting may cause some officials and communities to be less willing to allocate funds for certain manatee protection.\n\nWhat the public thinks\n\nThe federal wildlife agency asked the public to speak up. A government website lists supporting documents and 3,813 comments sent in last year.\n\nA majority appear to oppose the reclassification.\n\nPHOTO: Christopher Burke/regulatons.gov\n\nChristopher Burke, 9, pleaded for officials to keep the current status: I'm so happy that manatee population is increasing! But at the same time hopping you will not stop protecting them! Please don't down list manatees. I LOVE manatees and got my best friend to love them too.\n\nBut Marion Gibbons supports the change.\n\nCrystal River, FL has hands on experience addressing the needs of manatees, motor boaters, paddle water craft, tour operators, wildlife enthusiasts, residents and visitors, Gibbons wrote. They are excellent stewards of all these groups. Reclassifying the West Indian Manatees to threatened, will allow Crystal River to change their focus from a 'single species protection' (Endangered) to an 'expanded' focus of all wildlife in their area.\n\nTripp, of the Save the Manatee Club, said some of those who participated in a peer review for the US Fish and Wildlife Service raised questions about the proposal.\n\nAll comments and information received during the public comment are given consideration during the status review, Underwood said. Comments, including those from peer reviewers, are addressed in our forthcoming final decision.\n\nThe current health of the species\n\nMcRae said wildlife officials feel really good about these numbers. An aerial survey ending earlier this month had a preliminary total of 6,620 creatures, compared to 6,250 in 2016 and 6,063 the year before. That's a far cry from the estimated 1,267 manatees seen in 1991.\n\nThe supply of seagrass, the principal diet of the manatee, is good, although there were some challenges in the eastern part of the state in Indian Lagoon, he said.\n\nWhile the number of counted manatees increased, so, too, did their losses to boat-inflicted injuries. Of 520 deaths last year, 104 were attributed to boats, said McRae.\n\nFederal and state regulations, typically seasonal, target speeders in manatee zones and have a positive impact, he said.\n\nWhile manatee deaths typically fall in the upper 300s to lower 400s, 830 were reported to have died in 2013.\n\nWe do see year to year variation in the total numbers, said McRae.\n\nWhile the species are resilient when it comes to water quality fluctuations, toxic red tide has killed a large number of manatees in the past.\n\nPHOTO: visitcitrus.com Manatees swarm at the Three Sisters Springs in Crystal River.\n\nLong-term recovery plans\n\nThe Save the Manatee Club said it wants the US Fish and Wildlife Service to update its manatee recovery plan and bring back recovery teams. Such plans provide a framework for actions to protect a federally-listed species with the goal of helping the species become self-sustaining.\n\nThere is not enough planning for the future at this point and I think manatees will suffer because of it, Tripp said.\n\nMcRae said new data and positive population changes should be reflected in an updated federal plan. Underwood, with the federal agency, said updating the West Indian manatee plan is one of many recovery tasks that will be undertaken.\n\nThis would include establishing a new recovery planning team, he said. Who would be invited to be members, what task groups might be formed, etc. would be decided at that time. No date or specific schedule has been set as our current focus remains on the reclassification decision before us.
The rally in the stock market has been truly incredible. Records are shattered almost every day and 401(k) balances have swelled. It's no surprise so many investors are suffering from stock market FOMO -- fear of missing out.\n\nHopefully, you've been investing along the way. But before you put every last penny in the stock market, consider this: Trying to pick highs and lows -- market timing, as it's known -- is best left to the professionals. For the rest of us, some simple rules can take the anxiety out of the decision-making.\n\nFirst, know your risk. The younger you are, the more of your retirement portfolio should be in stocks. From 25 to 35 years old, you can load up on stocks. You can afford to have a very high risk tolerance in this age group.\n\nBy 55, it's a different story. You should lighten up on the stocks, and have a blend of stocks, bonds, cash, real estate and alternative investments. This is called asset allocation, and it will change over time, from risky in the early years of your career to conservative as you near retirement age.\n\nRelated: Figure our your risk tolerance with CNNMoney's risk calculator\n\nOnce you've settled on your asset allocation, make sure to rebalance that portfolio periodically. Especially when stocks are red hot, your allocation can get out of whack and you could end up being too heavy on stocks. Trim here and add there to keep the portfolio appropriate for your age and risk. In many 401(k) plans, you can set this to be automatic, rebalancing quarterly or annually.\n\nSpeaking of automatic, the best way to ride markets up (and down) is to buy stocks at regular intervals whether they are rising or falling. Dollar-cost averaging smooths out the risk over time.\n\nRemember that diversification is a long game. When certain investments -- like stocks -- are rising rapidly, resist the urge to simply jump on the bandwagon, says certified financial planner Doug Flynn of Flynn-Zito Capital Management. Consider your overall asset allocation.\n\nLook to the sectors which have not participated as much of late. Over time, performance comes from not only riding the winners -- but adding a bit to the losers, Flynn says. Not everything goes up forever and having some investments a little out of favor now can help smooth out the ride when what goes up eventually comes down.\n\nRelated: The stock market is on fire. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nIntimidated by the stock market? Consider legendary investor Warren Buffett's advice: buy a low-cost index fund tracking the S&P 500. Ignore peaks and valleys and business headlines and consistently add to your stocks until you near retirement.\n\nIf you are intent on buying and selling individual stocks, make sure you're playing with money you can afford to lose.\n\nThe biggest debate in money today is whether the stock market is unstoppable or a bubble ready to pop.\n\nUnstoppable or frothy? If your asset allocation is in line with your risk tolerance and you are consistently rebalancing, then it's beside the point.

(GREG BAKER/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nIf this is the cup I must take, I will drink with no regret.\n\nBenny Tai was defiant and emotional as he faced the court. Outside, he and his fellow defendants raised their fists and supporters displayed yellow umbrellas, the symbol of Hong Kong's beleaguered pro-democracy movement.\n\nThat movement is looking shakier than ever, as Tai and others begin the new year facing possible jail time – up to seven years in prison – for their roles in inspiring the 2014 Umbrella Movement, when tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the semi-autonomous Chinese city demanding elections free of Beijing's interference.\n\nSeveral thousand people – including former Umbrella leaders – took part in a traditional New Year's march Tuesday, warning of shrinking freedoms and issuing a call for greater democracy. They were joined by a small group of pro-independence demonstrators, some of whom said they faced harassment and intimidation ahead of the gathering.\n\nOn Wednesday, a spokesman for the Hong Kong government reiterated its zero tolerance on 'Hong Kong independence'.\n\nPolice and organizers estimated the crowd to be roughly half that of last year's march, which will be a concern for the pro-democracy camp as they face a difficult 2019. The prosecution of Tai and his co-defendants could pale in comparison to what some fear will happen if the Hong Kong government, under pressure from China, moves to pass a hugely controversial anti-sedition law.\n\nCritics say this could criminalize swathes of opposition figures, ranging from pro-democracy activists and separatists to religious minorities and media figures critical of Beijing.\n\nPHOTO: ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Baptist minister Chu Yiu-ming, 74, law professor Benny Tai, 54, and sociology professor Chan Kin-man, 59, shout slogans with supporters before entering the West Kowloon Magistrates Court in Hong Kong on November 19, 2018.\n\nTai, a mild-mannered Hong Kong University professor with a round clean-shaven face and thin-rimmed glasses, was a marginal political figure when, in January 2013, he proposed a civil disobedience campaign to pressure the government to introduce universal political suffrage — a long overdue promise of Hong Kong's de facto constitution known as the Basic Law.\n\nUnlikely icon\n\nJoined by fellow professor Chan Kin-man and Reverend Chu Yiu-ming, Tai launched Occupy Central with Love and Peace later that year, with a protest date set for October 2014.\n\nWe shall be like preachers communicating enthusiastically with different communities to convey universal values such as democracy, universal and equal suffrage, justice and righteousness, he said at the time, adding he hoped Hong Kongers will be willing to pay the price.\n\nHong Kongers were willing, and then some. In late September 2014, a student boycott movement led by Joshua Wong's Scholarism and the Hong Kong Federation of Students (HKFS) attempted to occupy Civic Square, a traditional protest venue outside Hong Kong's legislature. After police used pepper spray and later tear gas on the mostly teenaged protesters, thousands of outraged Hong Kongers took to the streets.\n\nThe demonstration spiraled from there, with pro-democracy protesters occupying main roads in parts of the city for months, shutting down traffic and defying police and counter-protesters' attempts to remove them.\n\nPolice were finally able to clear the last protesters in December 2014, after 79 days.\n\nPHOTO: Paula Bronstein/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images 2014's Umbrella Movement was a pivotal moment for Hong Kong's democracy movement.\n\nPyrrhic victories\n\nIf the Umbrella Movement was a high point for Hong Kong's democrats, it's been largely downhill from there.\n\nEven apparent opposition successes, such as those in September 2016 legislative elections, have turned out to be pyrrhic victories. Multiple lawmakers elected that year have since been turfed out of office on dubious legal grounds.\n\nWong, along with HKFS leaders Nathan Law and Alex Chow, was briefly jailed in 2017, and continues to face the threat of further prison time. Other activists have also faced court hearings, as analysts warned of a deliberate slow drip of prosecutions designed to sap the pro-democracy movement.\n\nRestrictions on political speech have grown, with the pro-independence Hong Kong National Party led by Andy Chan officially banned under public security laws, the first time these had been used against a political organization.\n\nIn the wake of that ban, Victor Mallet, a Financial Times journalist from Britain who had hosted a speech featuring Chan, had his application for a visa renewal rejected — a move which many saw as a blow against press freedom.\n\nPHOTO: ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Activists hold flags which read Hong Kong Independence and Hong Kong Is Not China during a gathering outside the government headquarters to mark the fourth anniversary of mass pro-democracy rallies, known as the Umbrella Movement, in Hong Kong on September 28, 2018.\n\nPolitical litmus tests are increasingly becoming the norm. The latest victim was Eddie Chu, who was recently barred from standing in a local poll because an election official ruled that he had defended independence as an option to Hong Kongers, even though he himself disavowed separatism. Bizarrely, Chu currently sits in the city's top legislature – raising questions over whether he can retain that position if deemed unsuitable to run for a more junior one, or if he will become the latest pro-democracy lawmaker ejected from office.\n\nThese repeated setbacks have had an impact on the broader opposition movement, and protest fatigue is also a factor in a city which has become famous for them. Numbers at anti-government demonstrations have fallen and many in the pro-democracy camp are seemingly at a loss on the way ahead in the face of an increasingly aggressive establishment.\n\nIn November, the opposition camp flunked a major test when its candidate failed by a wide margin to hang on to the legislative seat of Lau Siu-lai, who had herself been expelled in 2017. As a result pro-democracy lawmakers were unable to regain veto power in the city's legislature, a development which could clear the way for the government to introduce its controversial anti-sedition legislation.\n\nPHOTO: ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Protestors take part in a National Day pro-democracy rally in Hong Kong on October 1, 2018.\n\nWorrying future\n\nArticle 23 of the Basic Law instructs the local government to enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the Central People's Government … and to prohibit political organizations or bodies of the Region from establishing ties with foreign political organizations or bodies.\n\nAn attempt to implement such a law in 2003 drew half a million people onto the streets, demanding the resignation of Hong Kong's first Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa. He stepped down less than two years later. The protest is often pointed to as an example of the greater political freedoms which Hong Kongers enjoy compared to mainland Chinese.\n\nPHOTO: PETER PARKS/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Trams sit stranded as hundreds of thousands of people block the streets in a huge protest march against a controversial anti-subversion law known as Article 23 in Hong Kong in 2003.\n\nSince then, Article 23 has loomed over Hong Kong politics, either a bogeyman or a panacea depending on one's ideological bent. While the immediate effects of an anti-sedition law are likely overstated by its opponents (the police are probably not going to start rounding up pro-democracy legislators), it could have a major psychological and chilling effect in curbing a famously truculent body politic.\n\nSelf-censorship, while difficult to measure, is also seen as an increasing problem. As the cost of dissent has risen in Hong Kong, there are signs of a growing wariness among some sectors of society.\n\nIn November, two events featuring Chinese dissidents were called off amid apparent fears of repercussions from Beijing. One eventually went ahead after strong public pressure on the event venue to change course.\n\nPHOTO: ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Article 23 of Hong Kong's Basic Law, an anti-sedition clause, has long loomed over the city's politics.\n\nChu, the lawmaker barred in December from standing in a local poll, accused the government of moving the goalposts to intimidate people against speaking out, lest their comments be used against them one day.\n\nThe political logic … comes from the Cultural Revolution, where everyone had to be thought police, he added.\n\nIn his closing statement to the court in December, Tai said the Occupy movement was ultimately intended to pursue justice and he had no regrets about standing up for Hong Kong's future.\n\nThe purpose of civil disobedience is not to obstruct the public, but to arouse public concern to the injustice in society and to win sympathy from the public, he said.\n\nI am not afraid or ashamed of going to prison. If we were to be guilty, we will be guilty for daring to share hope at this difficult time in Hong Kong.\n\nThe court will hand down its verdict on April 9, 2019.
(CNN) He was never called upon to break a tie or influence how the Senate impeachment trial might end, but Chief Justice John Roberts' legacy will be forever entwined with President Donald Trump's.\n\nIt's not just that Roberts was in the chair presiding over the two-week hearing and historic vote on Wednesday to acquit Trump, just as Chief Justice Salmon Chase oversaw the acquittal of President Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Chief Justice William Rehnquist that of President Bill Clinton in 1999.\n\nRoberts now faces unprecedented litigation at the Supreme Court involving the President's personal business dealings. The justices will hear three cases in March testing Trump's efforts to block subpoenas from the US House and a Manhattan district attorney for his tax returns and other financial records.\n\nThe disputes challenge the respective powers among the branches of government and could ultimately determine whether Trump makes his tax returns public, as his recent predecessors chose to do.\n\nOther cases involving the President and top officials, such as former White House counsel Don McGahn , are wending their way through federal courts, as are multiple challenges to Trump administration policies.\n\nIf Trump wins another four-year term, Roberts could be in the position of ruling on a Trump-dominated docket until 2025.\n\nIrrespective of whether this President serves one term or two, America's 17th chief justice is already bound for an unusual union with the 45th President, arising from the combination of Trump's impeachment trial, Supreme Court litigation and their dueling notions of an impartial federal judiciary.\n\nWhen Roberts heard the first major challenge to a Trump administration policy, the travel ban directed at majority-Muslim countries, he wrote that Trump should be treated like any other US president.\n\nThe travel ban, Roberts wrote in a June 2018 opinion , is an act that ... could have been taken by any other President. Roberts rejected evidence of Trump's anti-Muslim remarks, saying that we must consider not only the statements of a particular President, but the authority of the Presidency itself.\n\nWhether Roberts' time presiding over the impeachment trial has altered his view of Trump might be seen over time. Roberts is in his 15th year as chief justice and, at only age 65, he could easily serve five more years, or twice that.\n\nAt the impeachment trial\n\nThe Constitution specifically dictates that the chief justice presides over the impeachment trial of a president. The role is distinct from the real authority of the chief justice at the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Senate has the sole power, according to the Constitution, to decide whether a president is convicted or acquitted. A two-thirds vote is required, and on Wednesday afternoon the Senate failed to reach that 67-vote threshold or even a simple majority. The vote was 48-52 to convict Trump on an abuse of power charge and 47-53 on an obstruction of Congress charge.\n\nThe US House in December had passed two articles of impeachment related to Trump's alleged conditioning of US security aid to Ukraine on Ukrainian investigations of Democrats. Last Friday the Senate voted against hearing from witnesses who might have direct knowledge of Trump's dealings on Ukraine.\n\nAfter that vote, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, queried Roberts as to whether he would become involved in other matters . Is the chief justice aware that in the impeachment trial of President Johnson, Chief Justice Chase, as presiding officer, cast tie-breaking votes on both March 31 and April 2, 1868?\n\nAppearing to speak from a prepared text, Roberts responded, I am, Mr. Leader. The one concerned a motion to adjourn; the other concerned a motion to close deliberations. I do not regard those isolated episodes 150 years ago as sufficient to support a general authority to break ties.\n\nRoberts continued, drawing a line between the legislative and judicial branches, If the members of this body elected by the people and accountable to them divide equally on a motion, the normal rule is that the motion fails. I think it would be inappropriate for me, an unelected official from a different branch of government, to assert the power to change that result so that the motion would succeed.\n\nAs Roberts sidestepped the controversy over witnesses, he also showed little emotion as he read senators' often awkward, leading questions for the House impeachment managers and Trump's lawyers (per the customary process). Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said a total of 180 questions were delivered to Roberts to read.\n\nOne of the most dramatic moments came when Roberts rejected an attempt by Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky to induce him to say aloud the name of the alleged whistleblower who first brought Trump's Ukrainian dealings to public light.\n\nPerhaps most striking was the many hours Roberts endured on the dais hearing piercing criticism of the President, who is becoming a regular litigant at the Supreme Court. US House managers characterized Trump as a liar and cheat, a man who put his own interests above those of the country.\n\nTrump's lawyers rejected those assertions but seemed to accept some transgressions, saying that no matter what the President had done, his conduct did not warrant a Senate conviction.\n\nIn the courtroom\n\nNeither Johnson nor Clinton faced voters for another term after their impeachments, and Chief Justices Chase and Rehnquist did not hear protracted court disputes in the vein of what Roberts already has on the docket related to Trump.\n\nThe cases tied most directly to Trump, centered on whether his personal business records are subject to subpoena, will be heard on March 31.\n\nUnlike his role in the Senate, at the high court Roberts will cast votes and, in fact, could steer the outcomes of the cases, Trump v. Mazars, Trump v. Deutsche Bank and Trump v. Vance. Roberts not only sits at the center of the elevated mahogany bench but also resides at the ideological middle of the nine-member court.\n\nTrump's veracity, which was attacked by the House managers during the impeachment trial, is also at issue in the subpoena cases. As lawyers for the House noted in one of their filings to the justices, A common thread in each of these inquiries is the accuracy of statements made by President Trump on various financial disclosures.\n\nHouse lawyers say the disclosures are needed for committees in the House of Representatives that are exploring the possibility of new legislation on conflicts of interest and other ethical concerns.\n\nTrump's lawyers say the House lacks the constitutional or statutory authority to subpoena the documents, held by Trump's longtime accountants and banks: To call these subpoenas unprecedented would be an understatement. This is the first time that Congress has subpoenaed private records of a sitting President.\n\nThey quarrel with the House's assertion that the Trump financial information is needed for a legislative purpose. Trump lawyers noted that a request to the Mazars USA accounting firm said the House wanted to investigate the accuracy of the President's financial statements to see if he had broken the law. Such an investigative focus, Trump's lawyers say, reveals that House committees are not engaged in a legislative effort.\n\nIn Trump v. Vance -- testing a subpoena sought by Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance, who is looking into hush money paid to women who claimed affairs with Trump -- the President's lawyers have asserted that he is immune from criminal investigation -- not only from indictment, which had been common understanding -- while he holds office.\n\nOn how judges should rule\n\nBeyond the Senate trial and Supreme Court litigation, Trump and Roberts have collided over regard for the impartiality of the judiciary. Trump has suggested in remarks on Twitter and elsewhere that he believes his judicial appointees would side with him, while Democratic appointees would automatically rule against him.\n\nWhen Trump denigrated a California US district judge who had ruled against the administration as an Obama judge, Roberts issued a statement in November 2018 that said, We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\n\nIn Roberts' most recent year-end report , issued on December 31, he might have had the Twitter-addicted President in mind when he said that social media can instantly spread rumor and false information on a grand scale. The chief justice urged people to celebrate our strong and independent judiciary.\n\nAt his State of the Union speech on Tuesday night, Trump shook hands with Roberts, as he did with other justices in attendance. Roberts looked somber, betraying none of what he was thinking, as was his way during the Senate trial.\n\nAs the Trump trial closed less than 24 hours later, Roberts expressed appreciation to Senate leaders for their support as he attempted to carry out ill-defined responsibilities in an unfamiliar setting. He offered senators good wishes as we carry out our common commitment to the Constitution.\n\nAnd Roberts closed by saying he looked forward to seeing them again under happier circumstances.
The group has become a support system. Manzi says it's just one avenue for veterans to see that trauma doesn't have to dictate the outcome of one's life. I want them to take away a little bit of hope, because hope leads to courageous actions.\n\nManzi was photographed on a cold and windy Veteran's Day at Folly Beach, South Carolina, during Warrior Surf's final class of the season on November 11, 2017.\n\nThe program is open to families because trauma doesn't affect only the veteran, Manzi said. When we started, it was very veteran-based. We definitely were focusing on the veterans. But really quickly it became apparent that the whole family needs this stuff. We try to create an opportunity where the family can come back together again.\n\nThe group has found that having therapy on the beach makes it more approachable for veterans. They aren't required to participate if they're not ready, but they are encouraged to work with the organization's therapist.\n\nJust being lifted up on that wave, it's like finding peace, said Warrior Surf participant Mike Lovett.\n\nSince 2015, Manzi's foundation has provided free services to more than 300 veterans and active duty service members and their families.\n\nSurfing can be a way to decompress after a talk therapy session, said Manzi. When anxiety gets high, the water can have a calming effect for him and other vets.\n\nMarine Sgt. Andrew Manzi served two tours in Iraq. He returned home with a brain injury and some PTSD, lost and angry. But then he discovered the healing power of surfing, and wanted to give that same healing to other veterans. Manzi started Warrior Surf, a nonprofit that provides free six-week-long surf camps and therapy sessions to veterans. Because of his work, Manzi has been selected as a Top 10 CNN Hero for 2017.\n\nStory highlights A review of veteran care finds world class mental care, but veterans have a hard time accessing it Over half of those who need care don't know that they do\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThomas Burke Jr., a Marine who returned from tours in Afghanistan and Iraq to attend Yale Divinity School, has also done three tours in the Veterans Health Administration for mental health care and says he's experienced mixed results.\n\nBurke, 28, served in the infantry. He said his first counselor, in 2011, didn't have much experience with combat veterans and wasn't much help. In 2012, he clicked with his second counselor, who really cared and took time to get to know me and gave me enough of a baseline to productively go through my academics.\n\nBefore becoming a minister and providing mental care of his own, he tried to get back into counseling. But it was a very negative experience, he said.\n\nI went in, being vulnerable and laying out my problems, and they were dismissive and condescended to me and treated me like I am some victim and were not getting to the bottom of the problem and essentially said 'thanks for telling us,'  Burke said. Imagine what damage that can do to veterans who seek help.\n\nIt's hard for me to badmouth the VA, because there are a lot of good people there who are trying to help and do care about vets, but a lot of people I talk with do badmouth them, Burke said.\n\nMany Americans who served in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars need mental health care, but they aren't always getting enough from the Department of Veterans Affairs' Veterans Health Administration, according to the results of a congressionally mandated investigation released Wednesday.\n\nAbout 4 million people have served in Iraq and Afghanistan, the longest sustained US military operations in history. A disproportionate number have come back with mental health challenges like anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, research shows. The number of suicides for veterans of these wars has reached a record. The VA has not always been able to handle this crushing need for services.\n\nBut when veterans get mental health care from the VA, it is of comparable or superior quality to the kinds of care available elsewhere.\n\nAccording to the new study, nearly half of American veterans who need mental health care don't get it. Also, more than half of those who would benefit from care don't know they need it, the research by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found.\n\nThe majority of those who could use these services don't know whether they are eligible, don't know how to get the services and don't even know that the VA provides mental health care, according to the report.\n\nThat's one of the things the report pointed out that I found the most distressing, said Louis Celli, national director of the American Legion's veterans affairs and rehabilitation division, which was not involved in the new report.\n\nCelli said the VA does a herculean job through social media campaigns and outreach with their partners to let veterans know about the care it provides. It's hard to imagine more you could do, short of knocking on everyone's door, but he believes the lack of care is a failure on the community's part.\n\nOne workaround that the American Legion has found successful is enlisting veterans' families to help them get the care they need.\n\nThat's what helped Seth Robbins. An Army veteran who was stationed predominantly in Korea, the 40-year-old has gotten his health care through the VA for more than a decade, but he sought help for anxiety only after his wife gave him an ultimatum.\n\nAs soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen, we are taught to 'suck it up and drive on.' We heard that on a regular basis, and it gets into your head, Robbins said.\n\nHe also hesitated to seek treatment because he had concerns that were shared by veterans in the report.\n\nFor instance, Robbins worried that his rifles would be taken away if he talked about his anxiety. There's also the stigma or the feeling that something is broken and I'm not the normal one or that they'll lock you up, he said. But I've got a job and a family to support and a house. The VA has helped him get to a place where I can manage.\n\nVeterans also find the VA's appointment system burdensome and unsatisfying, the report said. Robbins agrees and says he's lucky his father, a Vietnam veteran, showed him how to navigate the system.\n\nHe also feels lucky to have a federal job that gives him the freedom to go to appointments that can take hours out of his day. Other veterans said transportation challenges and the distance to the VA from their homes can be a huge obstacle to getting care, according to the report.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nFor veterans like Robbins who succeed in getting treatment, the report found that they encounter tremendous mental health care expertise and that the system can deliver care in a truly integrated and strategic manner. But the report added that chronic staffing challenges and confusing procedures and policies continue to be a challenge.\n\nThe American Legion's Celli said that along with the new report, he thinks it's important to note that the system has improved amid the extra scrutiny of the agency over the past several years. Robbins, for one, has noticed a change in 15 years – a vast improvement.\n\nCelli said that he knows the system isn't perfect but that the American Legion will continue to fight to improve it.\n\nWe are not VA cheerleaders, but we do work with them every day to make sure they do rise to the occasion and take care of veterans, he said. We've seen the progress, and we hope more veterans will seek out this care.

(CNN) The Sunrise Movement, a youth-led climate activist group, has quickly announced itself as one of the most influential progressive forces in the formative days of President-elect Joe Biden's incoming administration.\n\nProtesters from the activist group Sunrise Movement march down H Street outside Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C. to express their objection to President Trump's response to the election results on November 5, 2020. (Photo by Matthew Rodier/Sipa USA)(Sipa via AP Images)\n\nAs Biden builds out his White House senior staff and Cabinet, the climate movement has notched a series of high-profile victories, one of the few divisions of the Democratic left to successfully embed a number of its top allies -- and ideas -- into the new government's upper echelons. But the promise of today, before Biden has even taken office, will soon be met by the grinding realities of governing in divided Washington.\n\nBut Sunrise's young leaders say that, after two years of pitched battles across the country, they are prepared for the fights to come.\n\nBiden has already nominated movement favorite Deb Haaland , a Democratic congresswoman from New Mexico, to lead the Interior Department and created a high-level White House climate shop, with former Environmental Protection Agency head Gina McCarthy and former Secretary of State John Kerry in top roles. Together, with willing partners in Biden's inner circle, Sunrise and allied organizations have helped craft the structures -- at least on paper -- that could position the administration to pursue audacious goals to meaningfully combat climate change in the coming years.\n\nFounded in 2017, the group first scored national attention when its members arrived as uninvited guests for a sit-in at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office on Capitol Hill, shortly before she formally reclaimed the speakership, after the 2018 midterm. Since then, it has emerged as an activist powerhouse with growing electoral might. While they are closely allied with groups like Justice Democrats in backing progressive primary challengers, the group's most significant campaign victory came months before Biden defeated Trump in November.\n\nEarlier this year, the organization launched an all-out defense of Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, a co-author with New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of the Green New Deal resolution, against a Democratic primary challenge from Rep. Joe Kennedy III this summer. Its successful marshalling of progressive energy behind Markey, in what most viewed as an uphill fight to win renomination, underscored the potency of the group's political operation -- and projected a sense among the Washington elite of the outsiders having a growing handle on the inside game.\n\nMost people just see us as the agitators who are never happy, who are never really going to back anyone, who are just constantly throwing stones but not willing to go to bat for any political leader, besides maybe AOC, executive director Varshini Prakash told CNN. The Markey campaign was an opportunity to show that we are willing to back you if you back us, and that we are willing to throw down if you are willing to take the risks to your friendships, your image or whatever it is that you're worried about.\n\nFrom Bernie to Biden\n\nGetting on board with Biden, though, was a more complicated proposition -- and sell to volunteers and supporters who overwhelmingly supported Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders during the primary. Sunrise political director Evan Weber said the Biden team made the first contact, a courtesy call in June 2019, after the campaign put out the first iteration of its climate plan. But the group was all-in for Sanders and there were no further conversations, he said, until after Super Tuesday in March.\n\nAt that point, the primary was effectively decided. Biden was on track to be the nominee and his team launched a more aggressive courtship. Biden aide Cristobal Alex, who had made the initial call last year, reached out again -- this time to schedule a conversation with Weber and Prakash. Symone Sanders, a senior campaign adviser, and Biden policy director Stef Feldman also wanted to chat.\n\nThey were being very intentional, seeing the writing on the wall -- one, that they were likely going to win the primary and, two, they had a big problem with young people, young progressives, and the Bernie wing of the party, Weber said.\n\nWhen Sanders dropped out in April, Sunrise and other allied groups addressed an open letter that began by congratulating Biden, but mostly outlined what they viewed as his shortcomings and where he should consider shifting his positions.\n\nI think they were probably a little bit upset about the public letter, Weber said, but they did reach out and listen to us and really engaged us.\n\nStill, the extent -- and limits -- of the moderate-progressive coalition that would eventually help elect Biden was not clear until after the unity task forces commissioned by Biden and Sanders wrapped up and published their reports and recommendations. Of the six working groups, none yielded as much movement from the Biden side as the group gathered to address climate policy.\n\nPrakash, a Sanders pick for the climate group, emerged from the weeks of virtual meetings with cautious optimism. That Biden chose heavy-hitters -- two of them, Kerry and McCarthy, are now headed to the White House -- to represent his side had been a good sign.\n\nBut as Prakash said then, what followed the general election was an open question -- one that the past few weeks have only begun to answer.\n\nI don't think that we have seen the dreaded 180 from the Biden team, where it's that they won and then they're immediately ghosting us and not talking to us and not involving us in this process, Prakash said. They have involved us in several of the processes, taken our recommendations really seriously.\n\nThe selection of Haaland, who endorsed Warren in the primary, to run the Interior Department was the culmination of a campaign led by an array of progressive, Indigenous and climate groups, who helped make her case not only with Biden officials but House Democratic leadership, which ultimately blessed a pick that will, for a time, further shrink their majority.\n\nThe decisions to tap former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm to lead the Energy Department and Michael Regan , now the secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, to head the Environmental Protection Agency have also been met with enthusiasm. But by installing Kerry, McCarthy and Ali Zaidi as his top domestic national climate advisers, Biden has assembled a team with institutional chops and movement trust to lead his climate efforts.\n\nIn a statement formally introducing Biden's Climate team, his transition described the group as bold thinkers (who) know how to pull every lever of government to take on the urgent, existential threat of climate change.\n\nSunrise and other groups welcomed the picks, who will arrive without the private sector baggage some of Biden's other selections are carrying.\n\nBiden has built his team by assembling trusted hands. On the climate-oriented positions is actually where we've seen the most divergence from that, I would argue -- it's the most progressive team overall in the administration, Weber said. You've got a really visionary, bold team, who's really serious and ambitious about the task at hand and are really all advocates and public servants.\n\nAn education\n\nPrakash and her team are new to the intricacies of government-building. It feels like a ton of hearsay, just a giant rumor mill, she said, describing the closely guarded nature of the deliberations. How decisions happen and what exactly is responsible for making them happen is more opaque than I even expected.\n\nBoth she and Weber are in consistent contact with Biden transition officials. They have met with the EPA agency review team, among others. That on its own speaks to the unique standing the climate movement -- apart from other interests of the progressive firmament -- has established with the Biden team, including members it has harshly criticized.\n\nIn November, Prakash responded to the appointment of Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond , who accepted fossil fuel donations as a candidate, as a senior adviser and director of the White House Office of Public Engagement by calling it a betrayal. But when Richmond convened a virtual meeting with progressive movement leaders and gun violence prevention advocates last week, Sunrise was invited and took part.\n\nThe headlines that sprung from the group's pushback to Richmond's selection took Prakash by surprise, she said. And looking back, the 27-year-old added, maybe I wouldn't have approved using exactly that word. But the message came across. And it penetrated. A few days later, Richmond as a guest on The Breakfast Club was asked by co-host Charlamagne tha God about his ties to the oil and gas industry. He answered in part by noting his role in drafting Virginia Rep. Donald McEachin, co-founder of the House United for Climate and Environmental Justice Task Force, into Biden-Sanders climate task force, then shrugged off the suggestion that his acceptance of fossil fuel industry money influenced his legislative work.\n\nThe Richmond dust-up wasn't the first time Sunrise and the Biden team were at loggerheads. During the first general election debate, Biden, under a barrage from Trump, repeatedly disavowed any suggestion that he supported the Green New Deal. In public, Weber and Prakash kept their focus on Trump.\n\nBut after the debate, Weber called a Biden campaign aide.\n\nWe said, 'Hey, we know you guys have your own plan, but it's really not helpful for you to be sh*tting on the Green New Deal, Weber recalled. He prodded the campaign to stick to the language it embraced in more comfortable settings and its own website, which described the project gauzily as a useful framework for boosting the economy, fighting for environmental justice and addressing the climate crisis -- all of it baked into Biden's own Build Back Better agenda.\n\nBut that crossroads moment was about more than climate policy. Young voters were the foundation of the Sunrise-Biden relationship during the campaign. Biden wanted their support. Sunrise understood what it took to unlock it. The desire of Democrats to keep them energized now is what could, potentially, sustain the coalition going forward.\n\nWhat we wanted to make clear to them, Weber said of the post-debate conversation, was our perspective that ... just as there's a fierce right wing constituency and it's animated against the Green New Deal, there's an even bigger constituency of young people for whom the Green New Deal is something that they are dedicating their lives to realizing and making possible.\n\nBy shoving it aside on such a big stage, Weber believed, Biden had, in effect, telegraphed to young voters that he did not take the issue -- one they prized above all others -- seriously.\n\nBiden's rhetoric mostly stayed the same. He spent parts of the final few weeks of the campaign insisting that he had never supported, or even hinted, that he wanted to ban fracking. But on the ground, the campaign targeted young voters with information about its climate plan.\n\nOne foot in, one foot out\n\nSunrise leaders, along with other progressives who have established relationships with Biden's inner circle, have praised his close aides for keeping a thick skin. The Richmond episode didn't shut the door on communications. Other criticism of his picks has been largely brushed off -- a departure from the Obama administration, which had the reputation of taking less kindly to sharp, public pushback.\n\nPrakash never lobbied the Obama team -- she was in her teens during the last Democratic transition -- but said she has heard from older allies that the attitude of (Biden chief of staff) Ron Klain vs. (Obama chief of staff) Rahm Emanuel is night and day.\n\nWhen Prakash praised Kerry's selection as international climate envoy in a tweet, but added that she was keeping her eyes peeled for a domestic equivalent, Klain responded, retweeting her and adding: Stay tuned!! A few weeks later, Biden rolled out McCarthy and Zaidi.\n\nStill, there are conflicts up ahead.\n\nSunrise is trying to pull off a balancing act, of keeping one foot inside the halls of power and another with its activist ranks on the streets, that grassroots organizations often tout but rarely accomplish.\n\nIt's an uncomfortable position. It's really weird and personally difficult, Prakash said. But it is absolutely possible and, I think, absolutely necessary to have both of them.\n\nThe first clash could come in the opening days and weeks of the Biden presidency, when the administration and Democrats in Congress craft and begin negotiations with Republicans on what he has promised will be a transformative stimulus bill. This summer, Prakash told CNN she believed that if the first leg of this is a massive infrastructure and jobs plan to reboot the economy and climate isn't a central pillar of that, we're totally screwed.\n\nAsked last week if she still believed this coming legislation could be the climate movement's first and last best shot to secure the level of green investment activists believe is necessary to alter the trajectory of the crisis.\n\nThe answer, Prakash said, was complicated.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding control of the Senate, where Democrats need to sweep a pair of runoff elections next week to win a majority, had created additional murkiness around Sunrise's plan of action. The details of the stimulus bill will be important, she said, but we can't bank on Congress to legislate and have that be the be-all-end-all for climate policy in 2021 or in the Biden administration.\n\nBiden's willingness to exert his authority and the administration's commitment to pushing all the levers of power could end up being decisive.\n\nThere is a ton that Biden can do. And as we've seen, movements are behind him in utilizing the full power of the executive branch, Prakash said. It is a by any means necessary kind of approach.

Aired 1-2p ET\n\nAired November 19, 2019 - 13:00 ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\n[13:00:00] JORDAN: -- Mr. Eisenberg had told me to take my concerns to him.\n\n\n\nThen I ask you did -- did Mr. Eisenberg tell you not to report, to go around Mr. Morrison. And you said actually he did say that I shouldn't talk to any other people. Is that right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes, but there's a whole -- there's a period of time in there between when I spoke to him and when he circled back around. It wasn't that long a period of time but it was enough time for me to ...\n\n\n\nJORDAN: Enough time for you to go talk to someone that you won't tell us who it is right.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I've -- I've -- I've been instructed not to, Representative Jordan.\n\n\n\nJORDAN: Well, here's what I'm getting. The lawyer told you don't talk to any other people and you interpret that as not talking to your boss but you talk to your brother, you talk to the lawyers, you talk to Secretary (inaudible), you talk to the one guy Adam Schiff won't tell you -- won't let us -- won't let you tell us who he is. Is that right.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Representative Jordan, I did my job.\n\n\n\nJORDAN: I'm not saying you didn't. All I'm saying is you -- your -- the instructions from the lawyer was you shouldn't talk to anybody and you interpret that as don't talk to my boss but I'm going to go talk to someone that we can't even ask you who that individual is.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is incorrect.\n\n\n\nJORDAN: Well, I just read what you said. I shouldn't talk to any other people.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: The time of the gentleman has expired.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: There's -- I'm sorry, Chairman, but that sequence is not the way it played out.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nJORDAN: I'm reading through (ph) the transcript Colonel Vindman.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: Jordan, please let Colonel Vindman ...\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: There's -- the sequence played out where immediately afterwards I expressed my concerns. I did my coordination function, Mr. Eisenberg circled back around, told me not to talk to anybody else. In that period of time I did not manage to talk to ...\n\n\n\nJORDAN: So that's when it happened. That's when you talked to someone.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: Mr. Heck, you are recognized. Mr. Heck.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That's right.\n\n\n\nHECK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Colonel Vindman, let's go back to that pair of meetings on July 10 in Ambassador Bolton's office and down in the war (ph) room where you witness Ambassador Sondland inform the Ukrainian officials that as a prerequisite to a White House meeting between the two presidents, quote, the Ukrainians would have to deliver an investigation into the Bidens, end quote.\n\n\n\nYou said that Ambassador Sondland was quote, calling for an investigation that didn't exist into the Bidens in Burisma, is that correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is correct.\n\n\n\nHECK: It's that same afternoon you went to Mr. Eisenberg, the council, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That meeting occurred in the afternoon and within, you know, a couple -- I'm sure it was within a couple hours I spoke to Mr. Eisenberg.\n\n\n\nHECK: How did he react?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He was cool, calm, and collected. He took notes and he said he would look into it.\n\n\n\nHECK: And did he not also tell you to feel free to come back if you had additional concerns.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He did. He did, Congressman.\n\n\n\nHECK: Ambassador Sondland had told you that his request the Ukrainians had been coordinated with the chief of staff -- acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. Did you report that to Mr. Eisenberg?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I did.\n\n\n\nHECK: And what was his reaction?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He -- he took notes and he said he was going to -- he'll follow up or look into it. I don't recall exactly what he said.\n\n\n\nHECK: Colonel, you've also testified that on the July 25 call now between the two presidents, quote, there was no doubt, end quote, that President Trump asked for investigations into the 2016 election and Vice President Biden's son in return for a White House meeting. Within an hour of that call you reported back to Mr. Eisenberg, did you not?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I did.\n\n\n\nHECK: Went back to him just to see (inaudible) suggestion would be appropriate.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He's an assistant the president. He -- it was less a suggestion and more than -- more of an instruction.\n\n\n\nHECK: Did you tell the lawyers that President Trump asked President Zelensky to speak to Mr. Giuliani.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes.\n\n\n\nHECK: And the lawyers -- it was at this point, told you not to talk to anyone else.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is -- that's -- that is not correct with regards to timing. They didn't fall back -- they didn't circle back around. What ended up happening is in my coordination role I spoke to state (ph) -- I spoke to number (ph) of intelligence community and the general counsel from one of the intelligence bodies notified Mr. Eisenberg that there was -- you know that there was information on the call, on the July 25th call, as that point Mr. Eisenberg told me I shouldn't talk to anybody else about it.\n\n\n\nHECK: Colonel, I want to go back to 2014 in Iraq. When you were blown up, I presume that given the point in your military career and what else was going on in the world that upon recovery there was the very real prospect or possibility that you might once again find yourself in harms way. Is that correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes, Congressman, it happened in 2004, but yes.\n\n\n\nHECK: Four, excuse me, thank you. Did you consider leaving the military service at that point?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: No. Frankly, Congressman, I suffered light wounds I was fortunate compared to my counterparts in the same vehicle. And I returned to duty as, I think it may have been that same day.\n\n\n\n[13:05:00]\n\n\n\nHECK: But you could have been subjected to additional harm. You chose to continue service in uniform.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I continued to serve in combat for the remaining 10 or 11 months of the tour.\n\n\n\nHECK: You know, Colonel, I have to say I find it a rich but incredible painful irony that within a week of the President contrary to all advise of the Senior Military Officials he pardons those who were convicted of war crimes, which was widely decried in the military community. Within the week of him doing that he is engaged in an effort and allies on his behalf including some here today to demean your record of service and the sacrifice and contribution you have made. Indeed, sir, less than 20 minutes ago the White House officially quoted out, out of context the comments referred to earlier by Mr. Morrison in (ph) your judgment.\n\n\n\nI can only conclude, sir, that what we though was just the President is the subject of our deliberations in this inquiry isn't sufficient to capture what's happening here. Indeed what subject to this inquiry and what is apparel is our constitution and the very values upon which it is based. I want to say thank you for your service. But you know thank you doesn't cut it. Please know, however, that it comes from the bottom of my heart and I know on the bottoms of the heart of countless other Americans, thank you for the service, sir. I yield back.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: Mr. Jordan.\n\n\n\nJORDAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Sunday the Speaker of United States House of Representatives called the President of the United States an impostor. Speaker of the House called the President an impostor. The guy, 63 million people for, the guy who won an Electoral College landslide, the Speaker calls an impostor. That's what happened to our country, to this Congress. The Speaker statement says it all. The Democrats have never accepted the will of the American people. Democrats don't trust the American people. The American people who wanted to send someone to this town who was willing to shake it up a bit.\n\n\n\nThey don't trust that and they have tried to do everything they can to undo what the American people decided on November 8, 2016. They've been out to get the President since the day he was elected. The whistleblowers lawyer, the whistleblowers legal team said this January 30, 2017, the President had been in office about a week, coup has starter, first of many steps. Next sentence impeachment will follow ultimately. I guess we're in the final step. It started three and half years ago. Congressman Tlaib started this Congress. First day of Congress said impeach the President.\n\n\n\nRepresentative Greene said if we don't impeach him the President's going to win reelection. We got to do it. Mot importantly, most importantly five Democrat members of this committee voted to move forward with impeachment before the phone call ever happened. The truth is the attacks actually started before the Inauguration even before the election. Ranking Member talked about this. Hi opening statement July 2016 FBI opens investigation so called Trump-Raja (ph) coordination collusion which was never there. Opened an investigation spied on two American citizens associated with the Presidential campaign. My guess is that's probably never happened in American History, but they did it.\n\n\n\nAnd for 10 months Jim Comey FBI investigated the President, guess what after 10 months they had nothing. And you know why we know that because when we disposed Mr. Comey last Congress he told us they didn't have a thing. No matter, Special Counsel Mueller gets appointed and they do a two year $40 million, 19 lawyer unbelievable investigation and guess what they come back and they got nothing. But the Democrats don't care. So now we get this, a bunch of depositions in the bunker and the basement of the Capital, witnesses who aren't allowed to answer questions about who they talked to about the phone call. We get this all based on some anonymous whistleblower, no first hand knowledge biased against the President.\n\n\n\n[13:10:00]\n\n\n\nThese facts have never changed, we learned these right away. Who worked with Vice President Biden , who wrote a memo the day after somebody talked to him about the call, awaited 18 days to file a complaint, 18 days to file a complaint. What did he do in those 18 days? We all know, ran off and talked with Chairman Schiff's staff. And then hired the legal team that I just talked about, one of those steps in the whole impeachment coup as his legal team has said.\n\n\n\nThis is scary what these guys are putting our country through. It is sad, it is scary, it is wrong. And the good news is the American people see through it all, they know the facts are on the President's side as Representative Stefanik said, four facts will never change. We've got the transcript which they never thought the President would release. Shows no coordination, not conditionality, no linkage. We got the two guys on the call President Trump, President Zelensky, who have side nothing wrong no pressure no pushing here. We've got the fact that Ukrainians didn't even know aid was held up at the time of the call and most importantly we have yet to have one witness tell us that the any evidence from anyone that President Zelensky did anything on investigations to get the aid released.\n\n\n\nThose facts will never change. The facts are on the President's side, the process is certainly not. It has been the most unfair process we have ever seen and the American people understand that. Those 63 million Americans they understand it and frankly I think a lot of other do as well. They see what this for what it is. And they know this is wrong, especially wrong just 11 months before the next election. I yield bank.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: Mr. Welch.\n\n\n\nWELCH: Thank you. What this hearing is about, I think was best stated by Colonel Vindman's opening statement. The question before us is this, is it improper for the President of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate the United States citizen and political opponent? It's very well stated.\n\n\n\nI just listened to Mr. Jordan, as you did as well, and I heard his criticisms in the process, nothing really happened, a lot of people are out to get the president. I didn't hear an answer to the question, as to whether it's proper for the President of the United States to demand a foreign government to investigate a U.S. citizen and political opponent.\n\n\n\nAnd to date, I haven't heard any one of my Republican colleagues address that question.\n\n\n\nColonel Vindman and Ms. Williams, thank you. I want to ask some questions that go through the background. What's come out during this process is that we had two Ukraine policies.\n\n\n\nOne was bipartisan and long-standing, and that was to assist Ukraine, which had freed itself from the domination of Russia, to fight corruption and to resist Russian aggression. Is that a fair statement, Colonel Vindman?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I think that's a fair characterization, Congressman.\n\n\n\nWELCH: And to give folks a reminder of the extent of corruption, by the way, a legacy of Putin's Russia, is your understanding that when their prior president, Mr. Yanukovych fled to Russia into the arms of Mr. Putin, he took with him $30 to $40 billion of that impoverished country?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Those -- there are different estimates, but it's on that scale, yes.\n\n\n\nWELCH: Vast scale for a poor country. And is it your understanding that powerless, but motivated Ukrainians rose up in protest to this incredible graft in theft and abuse by their president?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is correct.\n\n\n\nWELCH: And that was in the Maidan -- it was called the Maidan Revolution, the Revolution of Dignity, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nWELCH: And young people went into that square in downtown Kiev, and demonstrated for months, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct. And 100 died.\n\n\n\nWELCH: One hundred and six young people died, and older people died, correct? That is in -- in -- in -- between February 18, 2014 and February 22, is that correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\n[13:15:00]\n\n\n\nWELCH: One hundred and six died, including people who were shot by snipers, kids, and Yanukovych had put snipers on the rooftops of buildings to shoot into that square and kill, murder, slaughter, those young people. Is that your understanding?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is correct.\n\n\n\nWELCH: In our bipartisan support, and by the way, I want to say to my Republican colleagues, a lot of leadership to have this bipartisan support came from your side, thank you. But our whole commitment was to get rid of corruption and to stop that Russian aggression, is that correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That amounts to some of the key pillars. WELCH: That's right. And the Giuliani, Sondmand (ph), and it appears, Trump policy was not about that, it was about investigations into a political opponent. Correct? I'll take that question back, we know it.\n\n\n\nAnd you know, I'm going to say this to President Trump, you want to investigate Joe Biden, you want to investigate Hunter Biden, go at it. Do it. Do it hard. Do it dirty. Do it the way you do do it. Just don't do it by asking a foreign leader to help you in your campaign. That's your job, it's not his.\n\n\n\nMy goal in these hearings is two things, one is to get an answer to Colonel Vindman's question. And the second, coming out of this, is for us, as a Congress, to return to the Ukraine policy that Nancy Pelosi and Kevin McCarthy both support. It's not investigations, it's the restoration of democracy in Ukraine and the resistance of Russian aggression. I yield back.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: Mr. Maloney.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: thank you both for being here. You know, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, this may be one of your first Congressional hearings like this, so you may not --\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: And hopefully the last.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nMALONEY: I can't blame you for feeling that way, sir. Particularly when I've been sitting here listening to my Republican colleagues, one of the advantages of being down here at the kids table, is that you get to hear the folks above your ask their questions. And I've been listening closely to my Republican colleagues and I've heard them say just about everything except to contradict any of the substantive testimony you've both given.\n\n\n\nYou may have notices, there's been a lot of complaints and there's been a lot of insinuations and there's been a lot of suggestions maybe that -- that you're -- that you're service is somehow not -- not to be trusted.\n\n\n\nYou know, you were treated to questions about your loyalty because of some half-baked job offer, I guess, the Ukrainians made you, which you, of course, dutifully reported. I guess, Mr. Castor's implying you're -- you've got some dual loyalty, which is, of course, an old smear we've heard many times in our history, to try to demean you as though maybe you're -- you've overstated the your importance of your job.\n\n\n\nBut, of course, you were -- this -- the guy on the National Security Council responsible for directing Ukrainian policy. We've heard the air out some allocations, with no basis improve, but they just want to get them out there and hope maybe some of those strands of spaghetti, I guess, will stick on the wall if they keep throwing them.\n\n\n\nWe've even had a member of this Committee question -- this is my favorite, question why you would wear your dress uniform today. Even though that dress uniform includes a breastplate that has a Combat Infantry badge on it and a Purple Heart metal ribbon.\n\n\n\nSeems like if anybody gets to wear their uniform, it's somebody who's got breastplate with those accommodations on it. So, let's do it again, let's do the substance, can we do that? Because we've had a lot of -- a lot of dust kicked up.\n\n\n\nMs. Williams, you heard the call with your own ears, right?\n\n\n\nWILLIAMS: Yes sir.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: Not second hand, not hear say, you heard the president speak. You heard his voice on the call?\n\n\n\nWILLIAMS: Correct.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And you conclusion was what he said about investigating the Bidens was your words, unusual and inappropriate, I believe. Am I right?\n\n\n\nWILLIAMS: That was my testimony.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And Mr. Vindman, you were treated to a July 10th meeting in the White House, where you heard Ambassador Sondland raise investigations, conditioning a White House meeting on that investigations, that you thought were unduly political, I believe that's how you described them. And you went to NSC Council and you reported, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And then later, you too, were on the White House call, am I right? You heard it with your own ears?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: Not second hand, not from somebody else, not hear say, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: You heard the president's voice on the call?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I did.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And you heard him raise that subject again, that Ambassador Sondland had raised before, about investigating the Bidens, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I did.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And I want to ask you, when you heard him say that, what was the first thought that went through your mind?\n\n\n\n[13:20:00]\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Frankly, I couldn't believe what I was hearing. There was probably an element of shock that maybe in certain regards my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out. And how this was likely to have significant implications for U.S. national security.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And you went immediately and you reported it, didn't you?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I did.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: Why?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Because that was my duty.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: Do you still have your opening statement handy?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I do.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: Read the last paragraph for me again, not the one -- the very last one, the second to last one. Would you read that one again for me? Because I think the American public deserves to hear it again.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: The dad...\n\n\n\nMALONEY: That's the one.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I think my dad would appreciate this one too.\n\n\n\nDad, my sitting here today in the U.S. Capitol, talking to our elected officials, is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to the United States America in search of a better life for our family. Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: You realize when you came forward out of sense of duty that you are putting yourself in direct opposition to the most powerful person in the world. Do you realize that, sir?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I knew I was assuming a lot of risk.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And I'm struck by that word don't -- that phrase do not worry, you addressed your dad. Was your dad a warrior?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He did serve. It was a different military though.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And he would have worried if you were putting yourself up against the president of the United States, is that right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He deeply worried about it because in his context there was -- it was the ultimate risk.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And why you have confidence that you can do that and tell your dad not to worry?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Congressman, because this is America. This is the country I have served and defended, that all of my brothers have served. And here, right matters.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: Thank you, sir. I yield back.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE) SCHIFF: Ms. Demings.\n\n\n\nDEMINGS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\n\n\nFirst of all, Ms. Williams, let me thank you for your service to our nation. It truly matters.\n\n\n\nLieutenant Colonel Vindman, I had the honor of speaking to a group of veterans this past weekend. And what I said to them was that no words, no words are really adequate or sufficient to fully express our gratitude for their service to our nation. So, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, today I say to you, there are no words that are sufficient to fully express our gratitude to you for what you have done for our nation and, amazingly, what you are still willing to do for our nation.\n\n\n\nIt is vitally important that the American people understand how President Trumps unethical demand that Ukraine deliver a politically- motivated investigation in exchange for military assistance created a security risk for our, the United States of America, national security. The president was not just playing a political game by upholding military aid and meetings with Ukraine, threatening the hundreds of millions of dollars of military assistance that Congress had appropriated has real-life consequences for Ukraine and for the USA.\n\n\n\nIn your test deposition, Colonel Vindman, you testified, and I quote, a strong and independent Ukraine is critical to our security interests. Could you please explain why a strong and independent Ukraine is so critical, and why it is so vital to U.S. interests?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: We sometimes refer to Ukraine as a front-line state. It's on the front-line of Europe. It's -- they have actually described to me, the Ukrainians, that that is -- it is a -- they consider themselves as a barrier between Russian aggression and Europe. And what I have heard them describe is the need for U.S. support in order to serve this role in order to protect European and Western security.\n\n\n\nDEMINGS: Lieutenant Colonel, this is not just a theoretical conflict between Ukraine and Russia. You have already said this morning that Russia is actively fighting to expand into Ukraine, that Ukraine is in a hot war with Russia right now, is that correct?\n\n\n\n[13:25:00]\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: It's stable, but it's still a hot war.\n\n\n\nDEMINGS: And isn't it true, Lieutenant Colonel, that even if the security assistance was eventually delivered to Ukraine, the fact that it was delayed, just that fact, could signal to Russia that the bond between Ukraine and the U.S. was weakening?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That was the concern of myself and my colleagues.\n\n\n\nDEMINGS: And was the risk of even the appearance that the U.S.-Ukraine bond is shaky is that it could embolden Russia to act with more aggression, would you say that is correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I believe that was my testimony.\n\n\n\nDEMINGS: Just last month, during an interview, President Putin joked about interfering in our political elections. I can only guess that is what we have become to Russia and its president. I think he felt emboldened by the president's reckless actions, both attempts to hold critical military aid from Ukraine and President Trump's effort to blame Ukraine, not Russia, for election interference.\n\n\n\nMs. Williams and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, I can only say that every American, regardless of our politics, should be critically concerned about that. And let me just say this. Yes, we do trust the American people. But you know what, the American people trust us too as members of Congress to support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. And we intend to do just that.\n\n\n\nThank you again for your service.\n\n\n\nMr. Chairman, I yield back.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: Mr. Krishnamoorthi.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Good afternoon, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and Ms. Williams. Thank you for your service.\n\n\n\nLieutenant Colonel Vindman, I am concerned that your loyalty has been questioned not just because you are bringing forward evidence of wrongdoing against the president, president of United States, but because you are an immigrant. Recently FOX News host Brian Kilmeade said, he, meaning you, were born in the Soviet Union, emigrated with his family young, he tends to feel simpatico with the Ukraine. I find this statement reprehensible because it appears that your immigrant heritage is being used against you.\n\n\n\nLieutenant Colonel, I came to this country when I was three months old. Your family fled the Soviet Union and moved to America when you are just three-and-a-half years old, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: And I understand that your father worked multiple jobs while also learning English, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Your father stressed the importance of embracing what it means to be an American, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: You and your family faced difficult times during your childhood, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes. KRISHNAMOORTHI: I can relate. That's my story too. But your father went on to become an engineer, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He reestablished himself in his former profession in the United States.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I can relate. I -- I got a B.S. in engineering. Of course some people claim I practice the B.S. part now.\n\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\nYour father never gave up working hard to build his very own American dream, did he?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He did not.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Well Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, your father achieved the American dream and so did you and your family. From one immigrant American to another immigrant American, I want to say to you that you and your family represent the very best of America. I assume that you are as proud to be an American as I am, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes, sir.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Sir, I want to turn your attention to Yuriy Lutsenko. You called him a disruptive actor in your opening statement, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Mr. Lutsenko, the former prosecutor general in Ukraine has made various claims about various Americans, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: You are unaware of any factual basis for his accusations against Ambassador Yovanovitch. Right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: He also was a source for an article by John Solomon in The Hill, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: And you said that key elements of that article as well as his accusations are false. Right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Lutsenko is not a credible source, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\n[13:30:00]\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Sir, the other side claims that there was absolutely no pressure on this July 25 phone call. I think that's what we heard earlier, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I believe so.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: And you have termed what President Trump asked in terms of investigations on that phone call as a demand. Correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: And you've pointed out the large power disparity between President Trump on the one hand and President Zelensky on the other. Correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: There was pressure on that phone call, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: The -- the Ukranians needed the meeting. The Ukrainians subsequently when they found out about it needed the security assistance.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: So the pressure was brought to bear on them, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I believe so.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Sir, Colonel Vindman, last week we heard a decorated military veteran namely Ambassador Bill Taylor come before us. You interacted regularly with Ambassador Taylor and you know him to be a man of integrity and he's a patriotic American. Isn't that right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: A superb individual.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I asked Ambassador Taylor a series of questions based on his experience as an infantry commander. I asked him quote, is an officer allowed to hold up action placing his troops at risk until someone provides him a personal benefit? Ambassador Taylor responded, no sir. Colonel Vindman, do you agree with Ambassador Taylor?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I do.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I then asked Ambassador Taylor quote, is that because they would be betraying their responsibility to the nation? Ambassador Taylor responded, yes, sir. Colonel Vindman, do you agree with Ambassador Taylor?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I do.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I then asked Ambassador Taylor, quote, could that type of conduct trigger a court martial? Ambassador Taylor said yes sir. Do you agree with Ambassador Taylor Colonel Vindman?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I do.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Thank you for your service.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: That concludes the member questioning. Representative Nunes, you're recognized for any concluding remarks. NUNES: Well Act 1 of today's circus is over. For those of you who have been watching at home, the democrats are no closer to impeachment then where they were three years ago. In the process they've -- the Department of Justice, FBI, State Department, elements within the I.C., the ICIG have all suffered long-term damage. The democrats can continue to put -- to poison the American people with this nonsense. We sat here all morning without any evidence for impeachment which would be a very serious crime, high crime and misdemeanor as it says in the Constitution. No such thing.\n\n\n\nPolicy disagreements and the democrats failure to acknowledge their involvement in the 2016 election, I would say it's astonishing but that would be putting too little emphasis on their actions. With that I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: I thank the gentleman. I want to thank our witnesses today, Ms. Williams, Colonel Vindman, both of you for your service to the country, for your testimony here today and I just want to address briefly some of the evidence you presented as well as others thus far in the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\n\nFirst of all, I want to join my colleagues in thanking you Colonel Vindman for your military service and I should tell you that notwithstanding all of the questions you got on why didn't you go talk to your supervisor. Why didn't you go talk to Mr. Morrison? Why did you go to the national security lawyer as if there is something wrong with going to the national security lawyer.\n\n\n\nAre you aware that we asked Mr. Morrison whether he went to the national security lawyer right after the call and that he did.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I am.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: And are you aware also that we asked him, well if you have this problem with Colonel Vindman not going to you instead of the lawyer, naturally you must have got your supervisor in you know what his answer was? He didn't go to his supervisor, either. He went directly to the National Security Council lawyers. I hope my colleagues will give him the same hard time for not following his chain of command that he complained about with you apparently.\n\n\n\nThe president may attack you and has. Others on right-wing TV might attack you, and they have. But I thought you should know and maybe you know already that this is what the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had to say about you Colonel Vindman. He is a professional, competent, patriotic and loyal officer. He has made an extraordinary contribution to the security of our nation in both peacetime and combat. I am sure your dad is proud to hear that.\n\n\n\n[13:35:00]\n\n\n\nMy colleagues have tried to make the argument here today and we've heard it before that the president was just interested in fighting corruption. That's our goal, fighting corruption in Ukraine, this terribly corrupt country. The problem of course with that is there is no evidence of the president trying to fight corruption. The evidence all points in the other direction. The evidence points the direction of the president inviting Ukraine to engage in the corrupt act of investigating a U.S. political opponent.\n\n\n\nAmbassador Yovanovitch was known as a strong fighter of corruption so what does the president do? He recalls her from her post. Ambassador Yovanovitch, in fact, was at a meeting celebrating other anticorruption fighters including a woman who had acid thrown in her face on the day she was told to get on the next plane back to Washington. You prepared talking points for the president's first conversation with Zelensky. He's supposed to talk about rooting out corruption. If this President had such a deep interest in rooting out corruption in Ukraine, surely he would've brought it up in the call but of course we now know that he did not.\n\n\n\nWe then see Rudy Giuliani not fighting corruption but asking for an investigation of the Bidens and my colleagues say well maybe he was acting on his own. Even though he says he's acting as the President's lawyer, maybe he was really acting on his own but the two investigations that Rudy Giuliani wanted, come up in the meeting you participate in on July 10th at the White House, when Ambassador Sondland brings up the Bidens and Burisma of 2016, tells the Ukrainians who want that meeting at the White House, you've got to do these investigations.\n\n\n\nNow they would say Ambassador Sondland was acting on his own, but that doesn't quite work either because we have the call record from July 25th, which the President was forced to release, in which the President doesn't bring up corruption, he doesn't say how are those anti-corruption courts going or great work at the Rada. Of course not.\n\n\n\nWhat does the President say? I want you to invest the -- investigate the Bidens and this debunked conspiracy theory pushed by Vladimir Putin, that also helps me in my re-election. So much for fighting corruption.\n\n\n\nThe message to Ukraine -- the real message to Ukraine, our U.S. policy message is don't engage in political investigations. The message from the President, however, was the exact opposite -- do engage in political investigations and do it for my re-election.\n\n\n\nAnd it's also made clear they want the White House meeting and ultimately if they want $400 million in U.S. aid, this is what they have to do. The only lament I hear from my colleagues is it wasn't successful, they got caught, they didn't get the political investigations and they still had to release the money. Now, they still haven't gotten the White House meeting but they had to release the money because the whistleblower blew the whistle -- the whistleblower the President wants to punish -- and because Congress announced it was doing investigations, and very soon thereafter, the President was forced to lift the hold on the aid.\n\n\n\nThey argue well this makes it -- this makes it OK, that it was a failed effort to bribe Ukraine, a failed effort to extort Ukraine. That doesn't make it better, it's no less odious because it was discovered and it was stopped. And we have courageous people like yourself who come forward, who report things, who do what they should do, who have a sense, as you put it, Colonel, of duty -- of duty. Not to the person of the President, but to the presidency and to the country, and we thank you for that.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, I think this all comes back to something we heard from another career foreign service officer just last Friday, in a conversation he overheard with the President in a restaurant in Ukraine, in which the President, not Rudy Giuliani, not anyone else, the President of the United States wanted to know are they going to do the investigation? This is the day after that July 25th call -- are they going to do the investigations? And he's ensured by Ambassador Sondland they're going to do it.\n\n\n\nAnd what does Sondland relate to this foreign service officer after he hangs up that call? The President doesn't give a expletive about Ukraine, he only cares about the big things that help his personal interests. That's all you need to know.\n\n\n\nAnd it isn't just about Ukraine. Of course, Ukraine is fighting our fight against the Russians, against their expansionism. That's our fight, too -- that's our fight, too, at least we thought so on a bipartisan basis, that's our fight, too. That's why we support Ukraine with the military aid that we have.\n\n\n\n[13:40:00]\n\n\n\nWell the President may not care about it but we do. We care about our defense, we care about the defense of our allies and we darn well care about our Constitution. We are adjourned. I please ask the -- the audience to allow the witnesses and the members who have to go vote to leave first.\n\n\n\nJAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: I'm Jake Tapper, live in Washington.\n\n\n\nToday's first round of the impeachment hearings for this week is in the books. We just heard from Jennifer Williams. She's a State Department aide to Vice President Mike Pence. We also heard from Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman. He is the National Security Council's top Ukraine advisor at the White House.\n\n\n\nHouse Intelligence Democrats have largely focus on the witnesses' impression of that phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky on July 25th, which both of them were listening to, while Republicans have attempted to discredit and undermine the witnesses, especially Lieutenant Colonel Vindman.\n\n\n\nBefore we get to an analysis, I want to play to what could be a key point of this entire investigation of this entire impeachment hearing.\n\n\n\nWhen you strip away the Democrats talking about Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's patriotism, his service, his inspiring story as an immigrant to this country when he was a little boy, when you strip away Republicans trying to undermine him, questions about whether or not he followed the chain of command when it came to his concerns about the call, this is really what this hearing is about.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nDANIEL GOLDMAN, COUNSEL FOR HOUSE DEMOCRATS: So just to summarize in this July 25th call between the presidents of the United States and Ukraine, President Trump demanded a favor of President Zelensky to conduct investigations that both of you ang acknowledge were for President Trump's political interest, not the national interest, and in return for his promise of a much-desired White House meeting for President Zelensky.\n\n\n\nColonel Vindman, is that an accurate summary of the excerpts we just looked at in.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes.\n\n\n\nGOLDMAN: Miss Williams?\n\n\n\nJENNIFER WILLIAMS, AIDE TO VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: Yes.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Jeffrey Toobin, your response?\n\n\n\nJEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: When you strip away everything, what we have learned over the past month is one thing, which is for the first time in American history, an American president has used taxpayer dollars to persuade, bribe, extort another president for information that will help him get reelected.\n\n\n\nThat was the initial accusation. And that's what's been proven over and over again with all these witnesses.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Dana Bash?\n\n\n\nDANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. And what you haven't heard is any Republican on that day say anything other than that. No Republican has tried, even attempted to poke a hole in that fundamental question, why we are all here, why these hearings are taking place.\n\n\n\nWhat Republicans did instead is question the credibility of the witness, question the story, repeat conspiracy theories that have been debunked by the Intelligence Community.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: About whether or not Russia or Ukraine interfered in the election?\n\n\n\nBASH: Yes. And by the Trump Justice Department, which we can get to in a second. But just keeping it broad, the fact that Republicans didn't even try to go there on the substance of the allegation and what the picture of these witnesses, just like the ones last week, painted, is very, very telling. It goes to the notion of, OK, he did it. And a lot of these\n\n\n\nRepublicans have said in other forums, it wasn't the right thing to do but it's not impeachable and the process is bad.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: John King, during the hearing, President Trump didn't tweet at Lieutenant Colonel Vindman or Jennifer Williams as he has before about both of them.\n\n\n\nBut the White House official account did tweet something -- if we could put that tweet up. The White House official account, paid by your tax dollars, if you're an American watching right now, saying, Tim Morrison, Alex Vindman's former boss, said he had concerns about Vindman's judgement.\n\n\n\nNow that is factually accurate to Morrison, who is no longer on the National Security Council. Did say that he had concerns about whether or not Vindman had the right policy making chops for the job.\n\n\n\nBut it is remarkable to see taxpayer dollars being used to attack a current National Security Council official.\n\n\n\nJOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. First, you had the president do it. He's faced a lot of blowback from Republicans, saying please don't do that, please don't attack these witnesses, we're trying to do this on a different track. Now you have the taxpayer accounts, as you mentioned, doing it here.\n\n\n\nBut it's part of the Republican strategy. Number one -- and you saw some of this in the hearing as well -- Mr. Morrison did say that.\n\n\n\nIf you read the full transcript of Mr. Morrison, he said something damaging about the president. He, too, went to the National Security Council lawyer and reported his concerns about the call.\n\n\n\nThey Republicans are and this is smart politically -- it would be smart in a trial for a lawyer -- they're cherry-picking the information that they believe helps them. They're want challenging the facts. I think that is the most important part.\n\n\n\n[13:45:04]\n\n\n\nWe've now had five witnesses in public hearings, the public impeachment hearings, and the Republicans are not challenging the facts.\n\n\n\nThe facts are being billed that everyone involved, whether they're in Ukraine or the State Department or today inside the West Wing of the White House, thought this was off the rails, thought it was wrong, thought it was improper, though it was possible illegal when you got to the question of putting the hold on the money. The Republicans aren't challenging that.\n\n\n\nWhat they're trying to do is hold the Republicans in line by raising questions about judgment, about loyalty, about maybe political motivations or we're you leaking. It's all a side show, but it's an important side show politically to keep Republicans from breaking. TAPPER: Laura Coates, your take on, this time, not the president but\n\n\n\nthe White House itself attacking a witness -- that's my interpretation -- I should say criticizing, publicly airing critical testimony against one witness while that witness was testifying?\n\n\n\nLAURA COATES, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: What I really have a problem with is this idea in isolation not providing the full context of the statement. When you do that and you use selective quotes, you mislead the public and the job of the White House is not to do just that. It's supposed to guide the public to lead them in genuine fact. In fact, that didn't happen. That led to the quote.\n\n\n\nThe real issue for me is let's compare last week to now. Last week, it was all about, well, he was inappropriate but not outlandish. Now it's, you described an abuse of power, you described a quid pro quo, but you didn't say the words bribery and extortion, therefore, it's not really a problem. That's the only leg they have to stand on.\n\n\n\nThat combined with -- the really offensive one here to me was the idea of, who are you to tell me this information, Vindman? They questioned why he had the audacity to want his name referred to as lieutenant colonel instead of mister. Who do you think you are? You have the audacity to wear your uniform in this courtroom, this professional hearing room. Who do you think you are?\n\n\n\nAnd here you are, taking outside --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: You see Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother, who also works in the White House, walking through the halls.\n\n\n\nI'm sorry.\n\n\n\nCOATES: And you have both of them walking the halls and both in positions of real power. But he refused repeatedly to overstate his position. He refused to say that he was somebody who was in charge of policy.\n\n\n\nNobody questioned that he was in charge of policy to the -- that the president of the United States had the prerogative to set foreign policy as the real -- real diplomat. But they tried to attack him for that because they had nothing else there. It was the audacity arguments, the semantics.\n\n\n\nI think it's the most effective unpersuasive and effective here. And one was, as Dana was talking about, if you do not have anything to retort to the actual substance, you have to fire shots at the messenger and take the position of, well, it may be important for the world to have heard this, but you were the wrong person to tell us.\n\n\n\nIf that's the case, Jake, who should it have been?\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Andrew McCabe, former deputy director of the FBI, you know a little about mean tweets from President Trump and the White House.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: So without going through your entire history, we heard Ambassador Yovanovitch last week say, in real time, that she found President Trump's tweet intimidating. Republicans have said that mean tweets cannot be intimidating, it just mean tweets, who cares.\n\n\n\nHaving been on the end of it, having been on the end of a negative campaign from President Trump, coming from the White House, what is it like? Is it intimidating? And what do you say to people who say, it's just a negative tweet, who cares?\n\n\n\nANDREW MCCABE, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: First of all, nobody said that to me because that's not what it is. It's absolutely horrifying. I know that from my time still serving in government, while I was serving as deputy director and acting director.\n\n\n\nTo be receiving those sorts of attacks from the president that you serve, while you're in a government position, and therefore not in any position to ever respond or reply or defend yourself in public, it is both horrifying to be turned upon like that by our chief executive of the nation.\n\n\n\nAnd also just oddly -- you just feel so defenseless because there's absolutely nothing you can do to respond to it, to respond in a way with the sort of amplification and clarity that the president has when he speaks about anything.\n\n\n\nIt is absolutely horrifying. It's chilling to your family.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: We heard Lieutenant Colonel Vindman say it's not just about the attacks of the president, it's everything it set off.\n\n\n\nMCCABE: Right, that it sets off. It unleashes a whole torrent of the president's supporters, people who follow him closely, voters and folks like that. But even worse so, people on the Hill, other folks, elected representatives, in positions of authority, who pick up these false narratives and then begin to repeat the lies that the president says about you.\n\n\n\nIt's just -- I can't even adequately describe it. And I know exactly how Ambassador Yovanovitch feels.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: So stepping back from that tweet from the White House, John Dean, tell us what you think was effective. What wasn't effective, what point were made?\n\n\n\n[13:50:06]\n\n\n\nJOHN DEAN, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL: If I could just footnote what Andrew said about having been attacked. He knows, I know, you know the basic truth of what happened and efforts to stir up, confuse it. You get a certain comfort in knowing you've told the truth, and attacks just don't affect that.\n\n\n\nI happened to have been in the Witness Protection Program, so I had extra help in protecting myself. But what's happened this morning, to me, was not surprising. There was a lot of speechifying. Republicans found they really had no questions very quickly and posturing, and started posturing, attacking the process. And it shows the weakness of their position overall. The Democrats obviously refuted some of that.\n\n\n\nBig picture, nothing has changed. We're getting more confirmation, the public is getting educated, putting faces on these people and learning what, indeed -- how unprecedented that a president would use his office in this manner to get political advantage over his potential opponent.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Scott Jennings, I want to ask about one point that I thought was not ineffective by Republican Congressman Chris Stewart, of Utah, taking issue with Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's use of the word demand for that part of the call with President Trump, suggesting he'd like a favor and wants President Zelensky to do something for him.\n\n\n\nWe heard Jennifer Williams and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman say they thought it was inappropriate and a demand.\n\n\n\nBut here's Chris Stewart taking issue with that. Take a listen.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nREP. CHRIS STEWART (R-UT): Much has been talked about as we discussed between President Trump and President Zelensky and the word favor and it being interpreted as a basis for impeachment.\n\n\n\nAnd your interpretation of the word favor -- and I'll paraphrase you and feel free to correct me. You said, In the military culture, which you and I are both familiar with, when a superior officer asks for a favor of a subordinate, they will interpret that as a demand.\n\n\n\nIs that a fair synopsis of what you previously stated?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Representative, when a superior makes a request, that's an order.\n\n\n\nSTEWART: OK. In short then you think your interpretation of a favor is a demand based upon your military experience in the military culture?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I think that is correct.\n\n\n\nSTEWART: I think that is correct. Is President Trump a member of the military?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He is not.\n\n\n\nSTEWART: Has he ever served in the military?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Not that I'm aware of.\n\n\n\nSTEWART: Is President Zelensky a member of the military? VINDMAN: I don't believe so.\n\n\n\nSTEWART: The answer is, he's not.\n\n\n\nWould it be fair then to take a person, who has never served in the military, and to take your re-evaluation of their words based on your military experience and your military culture, and to attach that culture and that meaning of those words to someone who's never served?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Representative, I made that judgment, and I stick by that judgment.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: He calls in nonsense. I think that's nonsense, is what Stewart says right after I made that judgment. What do you think?\n\n\n\nSCOTT JENNINGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes. I thought it was an interesting line of questioning. But it went to the overall assertion by Republicans today that Vindman isn't in a position to know exactly what the president's state of mind was.\n\n\n\nOn other occasions, he says he never met or advised the president directly. He said, quote, I don't know what the president was thinking. He said, quote, I was making a judgment call as a layman.\n\n\n\nWhat Stewart was doing was effective. To say you heard this but, because you don't know the president, you didn't speak to the president, and have a different frame of reference, you're giving your opinion instead of what may be the most important fact, which is what is the president's state of mind.\n\n\n\nIt's fine for Republicans to argue that today and I thought it was effective. That's all going to change tomorrow when Gordon Sondland shows up, because he actually has been talking to the president.\n\n\n\nI view today, Jake, as bit of a bridge day to get to the main event, which is Sondland.\n\n\n\nKING: It is a smart strategy. The Republicans are trying to get that one or two moments that are played on FOX News, that are played on social media, Trump-friendly social media. Where you say, aha, you think it's a demand, because you're a colonel, but the president wouldn't.\n\n\n\nRepublicans want you to focus on that one moment. The other day, it was, well, Ambassador Yovanovitch, if they wanted to remove you so they could be corrupt in Ukraine, why replace you with Bill Taylor, a man of great integrity? They want you to look at the one moment as opposed to the weeks before, the weeks after, which is Sondland, and more on what Rudy Giuliani were up to.\n\n\n\nTOOBIN: Far be it for me to predict what viewers of FOX News will think. But can we talk about what a crazy position Stewart was taking there? This president of Ukraine has people dying from lack of military equipment. He has people dying every day because they don't have military equipment.\n\n\n\n[13:55:00]\n\n\n\nDonald Trump holds in his hand the potential to save the lives of Ukrainians. Do you think maybe he's going to agree to what Donald Trump says about anything to get that money?\n\n\n\nI mean, the idea that this is -- well, it would be nice if you investigated Joe Biden. It's not a request. It's a demand with Ukrainians lives on the line.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Hold that thought. We'll talk about that.\n\n\n\nWe'll take a quick break.\n\n\n\nUp next, the impeachment testimony resumes with two additional witnesses.\n\n\n\nPlus, the president just responded to today's hearing.\n\n\n\nStay with us.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[14:00:00]

And that will change everything.\n\nTrump has sought to look on the bright side of divided control of government to date – insisting that maybe he will be able to make deals with the new Democratic majority in the House. It really could be a beautiful bipartisan situation, he said at a press conference the day after the 2018 election.\n\nBut the early returns are not promising. The federal government has been shut down for the past 12 days – and there's little reason to believe that will change at any point soon. Trump has dug in on his demand for $5 billion to fund construction of his border wall. Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, are equally dead-set on providing zero dollars for Trump's wall.\n\nAnd this is only the beginning. Starting today, Democrats in the House will make Trump's life a living hell. Efforts are already underway to bring a number of his Cabinet officials before Congress, to extricate his tax returns from his grip and to more deeply probe his business dealings both before and during his presidency.\n\nTrump, a political neophyte prior to the 2016 race, has never had to deal with this sort of opposition before. Sure, Democrats have never been willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. But he never really needed Democrats to do much of anything, either. The Republican majorities in the House and Senate ensured Trump got his tax cuts and two Supreme Court picks. There was no real political penalty for his total unwillingness and inability to work with Democrats.\n\nThose days are now over. Democrats can now do Trump real political damage using the official means of their House majority. While they may not be able to, say, force his tax returns into public view (the jury remains out on that), they can make sure the issue is front and center and create major distractions for a White House that has already shown it can distract itself very well, thank you very much.\n\nTrump claims to understand this, likely with his self-professed titanic intellect. To me, that's like when people who are about to have a baby say they are totally ready for it. As evidence, they point to their nursery being all set up, the Diaper Genie being up and running, and so on and so forth. Then the baby comes – and they realize, like every parent that has gone before them, that no amount of planning or bracing could fully prepare them for their new reality.\n\nThat's Trump and the new Democratic House majority.\n\nThe Point: Look out: It's going to be a mess.
Elie Honig is a CNN legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer readers' questions on CNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera on weekends.\n\n(CNN) When President Donald Trump called Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and implored him to somehow find exactly enough votes for Trump to win the state, Trump certainly abused his power and, beyond that, might well have committed criminal offenses. We can no longer write off Trump's dangerous, potentially criminal conduct as merely Trump being Trump. It's time for prosecutors to do their jobs.\n\nAt a minimum, prosecutors at both the federal and state levels need to dig in and take a hard look here. Trump's conduct first could have violated federal law that prohibits a person from knowingly and willfully depriv(ing) or defraud(ing)... the residents of a State of a fair and impartially conducted election process by... the procurement, casting, or tabulation of ballots that are known by the person to be materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent.\n\nThere's no real question that Trump asked Raffensperger to count ballots that were never actually cast for him. Trump's theory that he won Georgia, and the presidential election as a whole, is a madcap patchwork of self-perpetuating conspiracy theories, utterly divorced from reality. In fact, everybody from Trump's former attorney general to the FBI to the Department of Homeland Security to dozens of judges across the country (appointed by both political parties) have soundly rejected Trump's claim of widespread voter fraud.\n\nPerversely, Trump's best defense here might be that he actually -- however delusional it may sound -- believes he won Georgia and had votes stolen from him. In that case, it would be difficult for prosecutors to prove that the ballots Trump seeks to have counted were known by the person to be materially false.\n\nBut a prosecutor might point to Trump's own language to counter that defense. Trump didn't ask Raffensperger simply to count all the votes, but rather to find -- Trump's own word -- exactly 11,780 ballots , which would give Trump a win in Georgia by one vote . That doesn't sound like a true belief that he won; that sounds like an effort to manufacture a win.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has stated publicly that he will respect the Justice Department's independence: I'm not going to be telling them what they have to do and don't have to do. I'm not going to be saying go prosecute A, B or C -- I'm not going to be telling them. Biden is absolutely right to stay out of the Justice Department's prosecutorial decision-making.\n\nBut, according to NBC News, Biden also reportedly does not want his presidency to be distracted by investigations of the former president. If true, on that count, Biden would be wrong. It's simply not acceptable for prosecutors to glide past Trump's misconduct -- and to decline even to investigate -- solely for fear of ruffling some feathers. Sometimes prosecutors have to take hard looks at powerful people. It's unacceptable to take a pass on a case merely because it might upset political tranquility in Washington, DC.\n\nGeorgia state-level prosecutors also have a role to play here. Georgia state law is similar to federal law; it prohibits a person from solicit(ing) or request(ing) that another person violate election law, including tampering with vote counts or reporting false election returns.\n\nUltimately, Georgia prosecutors could be the only ones left standing. If Trump tries to issue a pardon to himself during his last days in office, that pardon -- even if it was legally valid, which is far from certain -- would protect him only against federal charges. But a presidential pardon has no impact on state-level charges.\n\nI spent 14-plus years as a federal and state prosecutor. I understand how difficult it can be to prove a crime based on the subject's state of mind. And I fully appreciate the political and practical issues that could accompany a potential criminal charge against the prior president. It is fair for prosecutors to weigh these concerns. But prosecutors are simply not doing their jobs if they don't at least commit to investigate, find all the relevant facts, and then make a decision about whether a criminal charge is warranted. To not even open an investigation -- to refuse to even dig in and get all the facts -- would be an abdication of prosecutorial duty.\n\nNow, your questions\n\nMike (Oregon): If the same political party controlled both the House and Senate, could they legally vote to overturn electoral votes cast for the other party's presidential candidate?\n\nFortunately, this has never happened. But the Electoral Count Act of 1887 seems, on its face, to permit such a possibility. That law provides that, if at least one member of both the House and Senate lodges an objection to the electoral vote count, then Congress must debate the issue. At that point, if a majority of both the House and Senate agree, then Congress could reject certain electoral votes.\n\nBut there is a legitimate argument that the federal law itself is unconstitutional because it violates separation of powers principles to empower Congress to unilaterally override the vote of the citizenry and choose the president on its own. At a minimum, if one political party ever did go so far as to try this, it would almost certainly be met with a substantial legal challenge that likely would wind up in the Supreme Court for resolution.\n\nBrenda (Switzerland): Is there any way the inauguration date can be postponed, as suggested by White House trade adviser Peter Navarro?\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.

It's not the safest thing to do.\n\nAs she pursued both her sporting and academic ambitions, Latsha then moved out of her family home and into a place of her own.\n\nStellar of a performance by @LadyBlitzBokke. I'm beyond proud. pic.twitter.com/9wKZqhXhmr — Babalwa Latsha (@BabalwaLatsha) December 1, 2018\n\nIt was the best thing to happen, actually, for my academics and also for my rugby, says Latsha, who was part of the inaugural South African Rugby Legends Association's (SARLA) development program in 2014.\n\nShe did not, however, abandon her roots, and still lives in the township of Khayelitsha.\n\nI'd say it is a tough place to live, but I don't think that I would want to change it for anything, she says. Khayelitsha has its own flavor, if you like.\n\nIt requires a specific way of life, if you know what I mean. So, it's a special place, really.\n\nVisit CNN.com/sport for more news, features and videos\n\nWith her astonishing work ethic – she is also studying law at the University of the Western Cape – Latsha has had to develop a powerful physique to help deal with the demands of playing the prop position.\n\nShe has also found herself trailblazing a new path for South African women's sports.\n\nWhether I like it or not, this is not about me as an individual. It's about the person who looks at me and thinks, 'Maybe I can do the same,' she says, speaking in a manner that evokes wisdom beyond her years. In my heart that is what it's about.\n\n01:05 - Source: CNN South Africa unites with Rugby World Cup win\n\nREAD: How to build a ruby player – Inside England's Under-20s camp\n\nREAD: Cape Town Sevens: Blitzboks to wear jersey to honor Nelson Mandela\n\n'Inspiration to all of us'\n\nThis year Latsha captained the Springbok women for the first time in a sevens tournament against Spain, Italy and Wales, and was named South Africa Rugby Women's Top Achiever for 2017.\n\nShe's an inspiration to all of us, SARLA chief Stefan Terblanche told South Africa's Independent Media of Latsha.\n\nAnother person to be inspired is her 12-year-old sister, who is already following in Latsha's footsteps as a primary school rugby player.\n\nShe copies everything I do, basically, so for her the next best thing was to start playing rugby. Actually, she's quite good, Latsha says. I hope to leave a legacy, so she'll continue it.\n\nLatsha also represents Western Providence in the 15-a-side format of the game and aspires to qualify the Springboks for the 2021 Women's Rugby World Cup in New Zealand.\n\nSouth Africa first developed a women's rugby union team in 2004. Since then it has played in three World Cups, collectively winning two matches and losing 13 before missing out on 2017 qualification.\n\nHaving a world class talent like Latsha could be transformative to the Springbok Women, however.\n\nBalancing act\n\nShould her game continue to develop, a rugby team from one of the more competitive women's leagues in the UK or continental Europe could come calling.\n\nBut prying Latsha away from South Africa will be difficult, considering she's on path to become a lawyer, a dream she has had since childhood.\n\nAs early as I can remember, I was always fascinated by how lawyers spoke so eloquently and all those gowns, she recalls. In my eyes, they were champions of justice and all of those things.\n\nBalancing the intense training required for rugby and the mound of reading for her legal studies has not been easy.\n\nI think time management is a very important thing because I need to train, she notes. Somehow, I've managed to find a way up until now, and it works.\n\nLook, a law degree is really demanding, in terms of time, she adds. In order to do that, there's a whole process that you need to undergo. So, I've decided to embark on that journey and actually embrace the process.
The King of Wakanda's reign at the box office has begun.\n\nBlack Panther, which stars Chadwick Boseman and Marvel's first African-American director, Ryan Coogler, nabbed $75.8 million domestically on its opening day Friday. That's the third biggest opening day gross for a Marvel Studios title behind both Avengers films and the eighth largest opening day of all time, according to comScore (SCOR).\n\nThe Disney (DIS) superhero film is now heading for a weekend in which more records will fall. Box office projections for the film have been all over the map, but analysts are forecasting a three-day opening weekend of $175 million or more. That would topple 2016's Deadpool, which holds the February opening weekend record, making Black Panther one of the biggest openings for a superhero film ever.\n\nDisney is projecting an opening in the range of $190 million to $210 million for the four-day President's Day holiday weekend. That would be a record for the holiday weekend by roughly $50 million.\n\nA massive opening weekend and a long run at the box office would prove that films like Black Panther can be both bankable and culturally influential, prompting the rest of the movie industry to encourage diversity in front of and behind the camera. We saw this play out after Wonder Woman's box office success. We also saw this happen with other recent movies by African-American filmmakers, according to K. Austin Collins, a staff writer at The Ringer who covers film and culture.\n\nStraight Outta Compton and this year's Oscar best picture nominee, Get Out prove that films made by and starring African-Americans can garner both critical acclaim and box office success.\n\nIf anything changes, it should be the expectations, which dictate the extent to which studios are willing to take risks, Collins said. The mega-success of 'Black Panther' would hopefully change that.\n\nCollins added that African-American action movies, or even ones with African-American leads and a diverse cast, still feel relatively rare.\n\nRelated: 'Black Panther' is heading for a record-breaking box office weekend\n\nThis is a movie with a loyal audience that's been underserved, he said. Appealing to that audience on this level is as good for business as it is for that audience.\n\nIf projections hold, Black Panther should easily take the title for highest-grossing opening for a African-American director ever, a distinction held by F. Gary Gray, who directed The Fate of the Furious, which opened at $98 million last April.\n\nBlack Panther could reach the kind of box office success that has eluded other African-American films. Get Out, Hidden Figures and Straight Outta Compton have all done well, but they still rank No. 250, No. 269, and No. 296 respectively on the all-time domestic box office list, according to data from Box Office Mojo.\n\nBlack Panther was hailed by journalist Jamil Smith as the first mega-budget movie helmed by an African-American director.\n\nHollywood has never produced a blockbuster this splendidly black, Smith wrote in Time magazine. 'Black Panther' is poised to prove to Hollywood that African-American narratives have the power to generate profits from all audiences. And, more important, that making movies about black lives is part of showing that they matter.\n\nBlack Panther's success forces Hollywood to reckon with its hesitation to produce movies that star minorities, according to Collins.\n\nRelated: More than a movie, 'Black Panther' is a movement\n\nNow that we know diverse casts make money, rather than losing it, there's no logic — not financial, not social — in which not having diverse casts makes the most sense, Collins said. Equity of representation behind the scenes should simply be the default. There's no excuse.

(GREG BAKER/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nChange is coming to men's restrooms in New York – and it's going to be a big help to fathers all over the state.\n\nA new law requires all new or renovated buildings in New York that have bathrooms used by the public to make changing tables available to both men and women.\n\nThe rule, which passed in April 2018 but didn't go into effect until the new year, applies to restaurants, stores and movie theaters as well as state facilities such as parks and offices of the Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nAt least one changing table must be available to both genders on each floor of a building that is accessed by the public, according to the law. The legislation also states that building managers should post clear signs showing the location of the nearest available changing table.\n\nThere was no previous state law that required changing tables in bathrooms used by the public, according to a statement from the office of Gov. Andrew Cuomo when the legislation passed.\n\nParents and caregivers of young children often struggle to find a safe, sanitary place to change their child's diaper, the statement said. In addition, when changing tables are available, they are disproportionately available in only women's restrooms.\n\nState Sen. Brad Hoylman, who wrote the legislation, said in a statement, It's not just moms who change diapers. Dads need to step up and do their part of the dirty work, too.\n\nHoylman is one of the fathers who took to social media to document the difficulty men face when changing their children's diapers.\n\nGay dads like my husband & me may never have to change diapers on a bathroom floor👇🏻👇🏻again! @NYGovCuomo budget mirrors my legislation (S574) requiring new buildings to have baby changing tables in public restrooms for both women & men. #pottyparity pic.twitter.com/blQPy34OOw — Brad Hoylman (@bradhoylman) January 23, 2018\n\nHoylman, who is gay, also said in the statement the new law is a step in recognizing new parental norms, including a new generation of gay dads like me who no longer should have to change their babies on the bathroom floor because there's no changing station in the men's restroom.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, fathers are much more involved in child care than they were 50 years ago. Data analysis of American Time Use Survey from 2016 shows fathers reported spending about eight hours a week on child care – triple the time they reported in 1965.\n\nLast year, a Florida father went viral after sharing photos of himself squatting on the restroom floor of a steakhouse while changing his son's diaper.\n\nWhat's the deal with not having changing tables in men's bathroom as if we don't exist!!, Donte Palmer wrote on Instagram. He used the hashtag #SquatForChange, which has become a social media campaign raising awareness about the lack of changing tables in men's restrooms.\n\nIn 2016, President Barack Obama signed a Bathrooms Accessible in Every Situation Act, or the BABIES Act, which requires diaper-changing tables in all restrooms in public federal buildings, such as courthouses and post offices.\n\nAccording to the BABIES Act, if a bathroom doesn't have a changing table, hallway signs must direct parents to the nearest facilities.\n\nCNN's Isabelle Chapman contributed in this report.
Monongahela, Pennsylvania (CNN) It sits on the banks of the Monongahela River like a monstrous monument to extinction.\n\nWith no fire in its belly and no smoke in its stacks, the rusting power plant provides only one sign of its former inhabitants, scribbled on a white board in a padlocked guard booth.\n\nRIP Mitchell, the handwriting reads. You gave us a good few years.\n\nThe Mitchell Power Station, just south of Pittsburgh, actually turned Pennsylvania coal into power for a good 65 years before the discovery of cheaper, cleaner forms of energy.\n\nAs fracked natural gas and renewables like wind and solar undercut the price of coal, both Mitchell and the nearby Hatfield's Ferry power plants were deactivated on the same day in 2013.\n\nMany in this corner of coal country blamed Obama-era regulations on their demise, so when a candidate named Donald Trump promised to end a so-called war on coal, they were ready to believe.\n\nWe are putting our great coal miners back to work, he repeated to rally crowds waving Trump Digs Coal signs. I'm coal's last shot.\n\nThen-candidate Donald Trump pledged to help coal miners in 2016.\n\nBut thanks largely to free-market forces, more coal-fired power plants have been deactivated in Trump's first two years in office then in Obama's entire first term. When asked about the President's claim to be the savior of coal, veteran miner and industry consultant Art Sullivan bristles.\n\nHe's trying to get their votes, he says, standing by the fenced-off entrance to a mine not far from Mitchell where he once served as Face Boss, a coal industry term for managers. He's lying to them.\n\nFormer miner and now mining consultant Art Sullivan says coal miners have the ability to transfer to other fields.\n\nFor 52 years, Sullivan worked in mines around the world and, like many in western Pennsylvania, he remembers Hillary Clinton's 2016 Ohio town hall where she said, We're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\n\nIn her book What Happened, Clinton devoted an entire chapter to the gaffe, which eclipsed her early campaign promise to provide a $30 billion aid package to struggling coal communities.\n\nSullivan had his own thoughts. What you need to say to coal miners is 'We're going to figure out a way to give you better, safer, healthier jobs.' These guys and the few gals are simply too good. They are too capable to simply say that we don't need you, he said.\n\nLooking for a cure\n\nEnergy plants are increasingly powered by cheaper and cleaner alternatives to coal.\n\nThey wanted hope, Blair Zimmerman says of his fellow miners in Greene County, Pennsylvania, who put their faith in Trump. If someone that has a sickness or a cancer and the doctor says 'I can cure that,' they believe ... I can't blame them or question them for trusting (Trump).\n\nNow a county commissioner, Zimmerman is part of a local group hoping to lure natural gas investors from Texas to drill in Pennsylvania and he scoffs at the Trump administration's efforts to deregulate coal-fired power plants. It will help this much, he says, holding his fingers an inch apart. But it won't bring back coal as king .\n\nThe Mitchell Power Plant was in operation for 65 years.\n\nTrump's EPA -- now led by former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler -- recently moved to lift Obama-era caps on how much poisonous mercury and heat-trapping carbon power plants would be allowed to pump into the sky. The argument was that less regulation could boost the coal industry and perhaps lead to cheaper electricity.\n\nThe 2012 regulations should not be considered appropriate and necessary, the EPA said, even though utility companies already spent billions installing pollution control technology and the agency's own reports say that the rule changes could lead to as many as 1,400 more premature deaths a year by 2030.\n\n'Nothing can stop' transition to renewables\n\nThe EPA also joined 11 other national agencies -- from the Pentagon to the Smithsonian -- in the alarming Black Friday report that warns of a catastrophic future unless drastic steps are taken to slow down man-made climate change.\n\nI think there's enough resilience in the (Earth's) system that we can withstand one four-year term of Donald Trump, says Penn State climatologist Michael Mann. I'm not sure we can withstand two.\n\nPenn State climatologist Michael Mann does not believe coal jobs in the US are being saved or coming back.\n\nMann is among the chorus of international climate scientists who argue that to save life on Earth as we know it, wealthy nations like the US need to switch to carbon-free electricity by 2030. This would mean 80% of current coal reserves would need to stay in the ground, he wrote.\n\nWe've undergone transitions like this before, Mann says on another unseasonably warm winter's day in State College, across Pennsylvania from the Mitchell Power Station.\n\nWe got off whale oil because something better came along. That was fossil fuels, he says. Now something better has come along and that's renewable energy and there's nothing that can stop that transition.
(CNN) As the votes trickled in, millions of Americans held their breath. Arguably the most consequential election in recent US history took five days to be called in favor of the Democratic candidate Joe Biden and, for many people, the wait was unbearable.\n\nWhile the ballots were being tallied in states from Nevada to Pennsylvania, the baseball player Bruce Maxwell was grateful for a distraction; he was in training but still paying very close attention to the news.\n\nFor Maxwell, the outcome of the 2020 Presidential election was personal and, for him, those anxious days would come to represent a conclusion of intertwining narrative arcs that were both devastating and inspiring.\n\nGrowing up in Alabama, baseball has been the story of Maxwell's life; his dream was fulfilled when he arrived in Major League Baseball as a catcher for the Oakland A's.\n\nBut it also led him to the darkest place that anybody could imagine, contemplating the act of suicide.\n\nSpeaking to CNN, Maxwell vividly recalled the moment when his life almost came to a premature end, a desperate hour spent alone with a gun pointing at his forehead.\n\nAll I had to do was pull the trigger, he said, recalling those moments of intense despair.\n\nI felt like I was in a never-ending hole. I couldn't talk on the phone, I couldn't talk to my family. I felt like my family and the people that knew me were better off without me.\n\nAnd yet, this is a man who took an historic stand in his sport, an athlete whose name deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the NFL's iconic protester Colin Kaepernick or Tommie Smith and John Carlos, the American sprinters who defied the US Olympic Committee with their infamous Black power salute in 1968.\n\nIn 2017, Maxwell became the first major league baseball player to take a knee to protest police brutality and racial injustice, but it took another three years for anyone else to follow his lead in the big leagues.\n\nBruce Maxwell kneels in protest on September 24, 2017.\n\nMaxwell always knew that he was a little different.\n\nThe son of a mixed-race couple in the Deep South, he didn't see many people that looked like him. He told CNN that baseball is not a very popular sport among the African-American community down where I'm from.\n\nAs he grew up, he began to notice there were less and less of us on the field. I felt out of place.\n\nAccording to a USA Today report in August 2020, only 7.8% of the league was made up of Black players.\n\nIt may have felt uncomfortable at times, but baseball was also giving him a blueprint for life in general.\n\nI learned from a very early age that I love this game, he said. The more I worked at it, the more I fell in love with it. It taught me how to fight; it taught me how to accept and grow from failure.\n\nAnd so that has led into my life outside of baseball and just being able to conquer and to bounce back every time I get an obstacle put in my way.\n\nIn July 2016, Maxwell made his MLB debut with the A's, but it was the events that played out 14 months later that really changed his life.\n\nOn September 22, 2017, President Donald Trump went to Maxwell's hometown in Huntsville, Alabama. During his address to a packed arena, Trump took aim at the NFL players who'd been kneeling during the national anthem, protesting police brutality.\n\nTo a cheering crowd, Trump said: Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a b*tch off the field right now. Out! He's fired. He's fired!'\n\nThe sports world was stunned, and Maxwell took it personally.\n\nI went through these racial injustices when I was a kid and to hear our current president at a rally in Huntsville, Alabama, where I'm from, and to see the amount of people in this city that supported him and showed him love was shell-shocking for me.\n\nThe next day, he addressed his teammates, the staff at Oakland and the club's ownership personnel and outlined his intentions.\n\nI told them what I was going to do, gave them my reasoning, how this is something for me to do, to stand up for the people that don't have the spotlight shining on them.\n\nAhead of the game against the Texas Rangers that Saturday, Maxwell took the knee. He immediately experienced a rush of conflicting emotions, I was heavy hearted; I was nervous. I was almost kind of refreshed. I felt like there was a weight lifted off my shoulders, for hiding what's been going on in my life and to my own people.\n\nMaxwell is congratulated in the dugout after hitting a two-run home run in 2017.\n\nHe knew there might be consequences, but he wasn't prepared for the intensity, or the malice.\n\nThere was a lot more in volume than I anticipated, and it was pretty remarkable, honestly.\n\nI got numerous death threats for not only myself, but the rest of my family. I had people want to burn my house down, people calling me the N-word, people threatening to hang me and my family. I had a couple of people call my mom 'N-word lover.' I mean, you name it.\n\nMaxwell struggled to cope with the backlash. At the end of the season, he found himself without the support of his teammates; he was alone.\n\nOutside of saying 'we support you,' there was no substantial support. The team said: 'It's your choice', we're behind you.' They gave me the freedom to do it, they didn't object, he added.\n\nBut down the road, there was no additional support. They knew I was getting death threats, they knew I was having a rough time. There was no psychological support, nobody reached out, nobody checked in.\n\nCNN reached out to the A's for comment but has not received a response to Maxwell's assertions.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'Field of Dreams...

Deferred': 100 years on from the Negro Leagues 02:59\n\nMaxwell says he became depressed and paranoid and his condition reached a nadir when he pulled a gun on a food delivery driver at his front door in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\nNobody was hurt and he described it as a misunderstanding, but later that evening around a dozen police officers showed up at his door and arrested him on a felony charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and a misdemeanor charge of disorderly conduct with a weapon.\n\nPolice bodycam footage showed him being escorted out of his residence, shirtless and barefoot. He plead guilty to the lesser charge, according to the Arizona Republic, after the state dropped the felony charge, when it agreed that Maxwell didn't point the gun at the driver, as police originally alleged. He was sentenced to two years probation.\n\nIn the following season, Maxwell's form deteriorated. He was cut from the Oakland team, but he still loved baseball and he wasn't ready to walk away from the game.\n\nMaxwell was cut from the Oakland team after his form began suffering.\n\nIn the absence of interest from any other Major League team, his salvation came from just over the border, in Mexico.\n\nIn 2019, Maxwell lined up for Acereros de Monclova, a team that had never before won a league title.\n\nThey believed that I could lead their team to a championship for the first time ever, he said.\n\nAnd they believed I'd be a leader, not only for their team but their city. I respected that and I gave it a shot.\n\nWhat unfolded over the next few months reaffirmed his love of the game and breathed new life into Maxwell's career.\n\nIt wasn't political. It wasn't, you know, people trying to kill me. They just appreciated me coming down there and giving everything that I had. It was amazing for me.\n\nMaxwell smashed 24 home runs, leading Monclova to their first ever league championship, and in that moment of triumph, he was able to reflect on the tortured journey that had led him there.\n\nI've never been so happy before. It's probably the best thing that I've ever done on the baseball field. To see my teammates, from all over the world, come together and fight for one team in one city was a beautiful and emotional thing.\n\nMaxwell's success over the border caught the eye once again of MLB and in July he was signed by the New York Mets on a minor league deal.\n\nOn November 2 -- the eve of the US election -- he was re-signed to the Mets and invited to the major league team for spring training next year. Just a few days later, the man whose hateful rhetoric inspired Maxwell to take a knee, lost his bid to remain in the White House.\n\nMaxwell described hearing the news that former Vice President Joe Biden had passed the threshold of 270 electoral college votes as a good feeling, a relief. It was awesome.\n\nMaxwell told CNN that he felt another four years of Trump would have led to significantly more deaths of African American people and the possibility of martial law. He says he'd have considered staying in Mexico if Trump had won a second term.\n\nThe result was a breath of fresh air for me and my family. Our country came out and set a record for the amount of voters in one election and I'm glad people took a stand for humanity and for the betterment of our country. Character does matter; treating people with respect does matter.\n\nJUST WATCHED Sports stars react to US protests over George Floyd's death Replay More Videos ...

And three years after Maxwell had taken a knee on the baseball field, other players found the courage to do the same.\n\nMaxwell says that he understands why it took them so long, explaining how vulnerable African American players can sometimes feel in the league.\n\nWe make up a very, very small amount in Major League Baseball, including coaches. And so it makes it very hard to speak out. We're outnumbered in there.\n\nYou try to mind your P's and Q's, to stay in the game and keep your job and keep a good image. I just feel like people were afraid to take the same stance, added Maxwell.\n\nOnce, he was the outlier, but now he's grateful not to be baseball's only protester. Now people are realizing how big of a deal this really is. And it makes me feel happy because we're doing something about it. Smaller or big, there is a change coming in the game that we play.\n\nMaxwell isn't naïve enough to think that the world's problems can be solved with a few more players taking a knee or even a different president in The White House.\n\nHe knows how much more work is still to be done. As he put it bluntly, I still get these nasty looks and comments when I take my mother to dinner.\n\nBut as he prepares to hopefully play Major League Baseball again next season, he is at least feeling more optimistic about the future. I feel joyful about it, he said.\n\nYou know, I feel progressive about it, and I feel confident in the change to come.
Davos, Switzerland (CNN) President Donald Trump attacked climate activists as perennial prophets of doom on Tuesday while addressing the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Switzerland, where the agenda is focused on tackling the climate crisis.\n\nTrump's remarks underscored the chasm between his denialist view of climate change and the overwhelming scientific consensus driving the rest of the developed world to action. Speaking shortly after the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg accused world leaders of not taking action, Trump rejected calls for urgent action and encouraged the world to instead embrace optimism.\n\nTo embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse, Trump said.\n\nThey are the errors of yesterday's fortune tellers and we have them and I have them and they want to see us do badly, but we don't let that happen, he added.\n\nRead More

(CNN) —\n\nAt a row of computers, the team sits, ultrafocused, fingers flying over their keyboards.\n\nThe video game Counter-Strike plays out on their monitors as they communicate over headsets, engaged in a fierce competition at Moscow's IgroMir Expo, Russia's largest computer and video game convention.\n\nBut this is not your average group of gamers. The slogan on their black jackets reads We've got time to kill.\n\nWith an average age of 67, the Silver Snipers from Stockholm, Sweden, are the oldest esports team in the world.\n\nWe want to win, so we have to train a lot, said team member Inger Grotteblad, 66, nicknamed Trigger Finger. But she doesn't mind. The team is so close to each other. We know each other very well.\n\nSilver Snipers team member Inger Grotteblad, 66.\n\nSponsored by tech company Lenovo, the five Silver Snipers travel across Europe for Counter-Strike tournaments, playing against teams from around the globe. They train in Stockholm with their coach, 38-year-old Tommy Potti Ingemarsson, a 10-time Counter-Strike world champion.\n\nLast fall's world tour, their first, also included stops in Paris and Finland. Grotteblad hopes the team can score invitations to upcoming competitions in South America.\n\nEsports is a lovely community to be in, Grotteblad said, adding that before she started playing, she thought it was young guys sitting at home, playing games all night long.\n\nBut she and the team found something unexpected: a welcoming community and a loyal legion of fans to cheer them on.\n\nIt's very lovely … because you could be treated like 'go away,'  she said. Instead, they are opening their arms for us and saying, 'Oh, you're so cool!' My grandsons say, 'You are the coolest grandmother in the world!' \n\nThe esports community is just one benefit for these senior gamers. The social engagement with each other is good for their health, too. Grotteblad's has formed a close friendship with teammate Monica Idenfors, 62, nicknamed Teen Slayer.\n\nIt might sound simple, but happiness and fun are proven to have measurable impacts on our health and longevity. One study found that older people were up to 35% less likely to die during the five-year research period if they reported feeling happy, excited and content on a typical day.\n\nOn top of that, concentrating on the game keeps their minds active. The brain forms new neural connections, an ability known as neuroplasticity, that could help slow some of the mental effects of aging.\n\nThe brain can improve itself by being challenged, said Dr. Adam Gazzaley, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco, where his team explores the way our brains interact with video games, even building games that are designed to target certain areas of the brain.\n\nThe basic idea is to use a video game that engages a player in an immersive way, which we think is critical, and challenging them appropriately to their ability, he said. Then, using an algorithm designed by his team, we can activate selective brain networks through this experience and because the brain is plastic, including the brain of seniors, improve the function over time.\n\nThe Silver Snipers prepare to compete in Russia.\n\nWhen it comes to the older population in his gaming studies, Gazzaley has noticed a heightened level of enthusiasm. In our experience, it makes them excited and optimistic that they can engage in technology – and get good at it.\n\nWith the Silver Snipers, Grotteblad has noticed a personal change, too.\n\nI keep my brain alert, she said. It's a big difference. I keep my hands very, very alert too, because you have to be rapid in your movements with your hands. You have to coordinate what you're doing without thinking what you're doing.\n\nStill, moderation is important when it comes to video games.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThese [games] are designed to be really enjoyable and sticky, Gazzaley said. Human nature, in many ways, is to find something you enjoy and just keep doing it, but I do believe you have to fight against those habit-forming activities and find diversity. Moderation is the main thing.\n\nFor the Silver Snipers, it's all about creating a balance while improving focus, keeping their brains active, being social and having fun; in many ways, they are gaming their way to longer lives.\n\nWhen I look in the mirror, I see all the wrinkles, Grotteblad said, but I don't feel old. I feel like I've always been. Sometimes, I can feel like I'm 25 when I'm laughing too much!
(CNN) — From the sinking city of Venice to the mass bleaching of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, climate change is drastically impacting some of the world's most treasured heritage sites.\n\nTo date, over 1,000 bucket-list locations have earned a spot on UNESCO's World Heritage list on account of their outstanding universal value to humanity.\n\nBut, if the world continues to warm -- driven predominately by human activity through greenhouse gas emissions -- many of these landmarks may lose some of those outstanding values or even cease to exist at all.\n\nPerhaps the starkest example is Greenland's impressive Ilulissat Icefjord, a World Heritage site where the Sermeq Kujalleq glacier is literally melting before our eyes , partly because of global warming.\n\nIcebergs that broke off from the Sermeq Kujalleq glacier in Ilulissat, Greenland. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nVirtually every World Heritage site has some level of threat from climate change, said Adam Markham, deputy director of the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a science advocacy NGO based in the United States.\n\nAt some locations the threat is obvious and imminent.\n\nYellowstone National Park in the US, for example, is experiencing shorter winters with less snowfall, warmer rivers, shrinking lakes and wetlands, and longer fire seasons, according to a joint report by the United Nations Environment Programme, UNESCO and the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\nYellowstone contains half of the globe's known geothermal features, and is home to an array of wildlife including grizzly bears, wolves and bison. Wyoming Office of Tourism\n\nScientists estimate that nearly half of the wetlands in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem could be lost, and more frequent fires will likely lead to its dense forest becoming a more open woodland, over time.\n\nElsewhere, El Nño events are warming waters around the Galápagos Islands off the coast of Ecuador and disrupting food supplies on which many Galápagos species rely.\n\nRising sea levels and higher waves during storms are threatening to topple the mysterious moai statues on remote Rapa Nui -- also known as Easter Island -- in the southeastern Pacific Ocean.\n\nl e v a r t\n\n'Fastest growing threat'\n\nOne in four natural World Heritage sites is highly threatened by climate change, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) global assessment of 241 natural sites.\n\nThis trend doubled from 2014 to 2017, according to the report, making climate change the fastest growing threat.\n\nRising sea temperatures have affected coral reefs, such as the Aldabra Atoll in the Indian Ocean, the Belize Barrier Reef in the Atlantic and the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, in recent years.\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, marine heat waves caused by climate change killed about half of the corals on the Great Barrier Reef, along with many others around the world.\n\nA turtle swims over bleached coral at Heron Island on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016. caitlin seaview survey\n\nAnd if climate change doesn't slow down, IUCN predicts more sites will likely suffer in the near future.\n\nMechtild Rossler, director of the UNESCO World Heritage Centre, said they have been continuously monitoring the effects of climate change on heritage.\n\nIf we cannot protect those sites from these threats -- and they have multiple threats -- how will the future look? she told CNN.\n\nThe (World Heritage) Convention says you have to identify those unique sites and transmit it to future generations. If we have nothing left to transmit, this is a dramatic situation.\n\nRelated content These are 2018's additions for the UNESCO World Heritage List\n\nCan we save them?\n\nOne solution could be to develop a climate vulnerability index, explained Markham. This would enable countries managing heritage sites to better understand, monitor and address the risk of climate change.\n\nRossler stressed the need for strategies to adapt to extreme weather events and extreme environments, often tapping into knowledge and traditions of local communities.\n\nFor example, in the fragile environment of World Heritage-listed Serra de Tramuntana, in Mallorca, where water resources are scarce, people have successfully revived traditional watering systems, she explained.\n\nIf a site is well managed the chances that it addresses climate change better is high, said Rossler.\n\nl e v a r t\n\nBut Markham concedes that it might not be possible to protect every site, particularly in less developed parts of the world.\n\nWhile Markham is optimistic that heritage site managers are considering how to deal with climate change, he is not convinced that national governments are taking the actions needed to slow it down.\n\nWith climate change it always comes back to meeting the Paris Agreement goal — that is limiting global warming to significantly less than two degrees, he said.\n\nWe're not on track to do that right now unfortunately, Markham added.

She was a founding member of Major League Soccer in 1996 and served as vice president of corporate marketing for MLS for six years. She has also been the US representative on FIFA's Committee for Women's Football and the FIFA Women's World Cup. Carter was most recently the president of Soccer United Marketing, where she managed the business operations for MLS' commercial subsidiary. The views expressed here are solely the author's.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nSince the first day I walked onto the soccer field, when I was 7 years old, I have been questioned and doubted.\n\nI was asked: Do you have what it takes to play this sport? Are you tall enough to be a goalkeeper? Are you quick enough? Is your skin thick enough for you to take a loss and bounce back stronger?\n\nPHOTO: Chris Trotman/Getty Images North America/Getty Images/MLS Kathy Carter\n\nAt every stage, I heard questions – some spoken aloud, some whispered – about me, my talent, my body, my character. This line of questioning starts at a young age for girls. Unfortunately, it doesn't end when we leave the soccer field, or as we become adults. Just the opposite, in fact. For women, it becomes our norm as we enter the workplace. Soccer gave me the confidence to work through the added pressure, prove the doubters wrong, and resolve to clear a smoother path for future generations of women.\n\nI was fortunate to have played for supportive coaches and with tremendous teammates. Not every young woman is so lucky. My dad was one of my first coaches; he did this job with a how to book in his hands and baseball cleats on his feet. In high school, I was named an All-American, and I went on to start for a nationally ranked team at the College of William and Mary.\n\nWhen I was finishing my final college season in 1990, there was no professional pathway for female players in the United States. No pro leagues to join, no National Women's Soccer League to aspire to, and no post-collegiate female players to look up to. So I continued to play in amateur adult leagues. My career as a soccer player came to an end not because I wanted it to, but because there was no option for women to make a career out of playing the best sport in the world here at home.\n\nI didn't always know my future was in soccer, but what I did know was that I loved the game. Then, good fortune struck when a friend from an opposing team introduced me to members of the 1994 World Cup Organizing Committee and I was given a shot to make the game my profession. I've never looked back.\n\nI'm very proud of my playing career and my career as an executive in the game. But I have news for anyone reading this: The doubting questions have never stopped. As I made the transition from player to executive, the questions just changed.\n\nWould men take a woman as president of US Soccer seriously? Would people listen to her? Could she lead such a large and high-stakes organization?\n\nI've answered these questions in business and plan to do so in a new role: I am now running for another leadership position in soccer, that of president of the US Soccer Federation. Before I began this effort, my journey was, like most people's, outside the glaring lights. Now that I'm in the race, even though I bring both soccer and relevant business experience to the table, questions abound.\n\nDoes she have enough soccer experience? Is her business experience the right kind? Is she her own person? Has she done enough as a woman in the game?\n\nIn the international soccer community, out of FIFA's 211 member associations, there are only a few female leaders. In the United States, there are several women serving as leaders of their respective sports, but it is not nearly enough.\n\nKids dream of representing our country on the global stage as players, coaches, referees, executives or administrators. I want to show them, especially young girls, that any of these options are within their grasp.\n\nIf elected, I'll be the first female president of US Soccer, but I'll fight for all the things any good leader wants, confronting challenges, such as rebounding from the failure of our men's national team to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup and remedying our confusing youth soccer landscape. I'm optimistic about the future because the American soccer community is talented, committed and ready to deeply assess what's wrong and work together – plus our women's national team is heading to France in 2019 to defend our world championship. It is a time of change and we must focus on unity and collaboration to drive progress.\n\nThis work starts with changing the federation's culture, prioritizing improvements in youth soccer, growing the adult game, building a new technical department to support all our national teams, and going all-in on the women's game.\n\nI know the doubts I've faced throughout my career are faced by many women – most women. I know because a lot of them tell me. Like them, I have responded the only way I know how: I've worked harder to be more prepared, to see every angle, to avoid every error possible. I've learned through successes and yes, sometimes through failures, the importance of listening, working constructively, setting ambitious goals, and helping everyone succeed together.\n\nInside me is still the 5-foot-5 goalkeeper about whom no one ever said at first glance, Wow, she's going to be great. I had to earn everything I got and I am extremely proud of that.\n\nI'm also proud of the female teammates I've had in business, another lesson from the game. Throughout my career, I've mentored, supported and counseled hundreds of young women building their own careers in sports. Today, these women are part of a growing network of successful women who are rising through the ranks of professional sports leagues, front offices, sports apparel companies, TV networks and sports marketing agencies. And, I have benefited from their wisdom, support, hard work and professionalism.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAmong the things that excite me most about the possibility of leading US Soccer is the opportunity to address diversity and equality head on. I want treatment of our girls and women to be equal across the sport and from top to bottom – from pay to training staff to field conditions and beyond.\n\nI want to take all that I've learned from my own experiences and from these female teammates and use it to invest in helping all our national teams continue to inspire the country and the world.

The Hasty Pudding Theatricals announced Thursday it would allow women into its cast for the first time. On the same day, actress Mila Kunis was honored as the group's 68th Woman of the Year.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nHarvard's famed Hasty Pudding Theatricals student theater troupe will allow women to be cast in productions for the first time since it began staging student-written theater 174 years ago.\n\nThe famously irreverent troupe, which claims to be the oldest theater troupe in the United States and the third-oldest in the world, made the announcement Thursday during its annual Woman of the Year celebration, which honored the actress Mila Kunis.\n\nWhile women have been allowed to participate in the group behind the scenes, only men have performed on stage until now. The announcement, made by Hasty Pudding Theatricals President Amira T. Weeks, was met with loud applause and cheers from the crowd gathered.\n\nWith no further fanfare, the graduate board of the Hasty Pudding Institute has determined that, commencing with the 2019 Hasty Pudding Show, that Hasty Pudding welcomes women to audition for roles in the show, Weeks read in a letter from the graduate board.\n\nThe Hasty Pudding Institute was founded in 1795 as a social club and boasts five US Presidents among its members, according to the group's website.\n\nThe Theatricals began performing in 1844, often lampooning politics and current affairs through burlesque-influenced skits. With men performing all the roles, the annual performances became known for their use of drag. Each show also ends with an all-male kick line, according to the group's site.\n\nHasty Pudding had come under fire for excluding women on stage. A recent Boston Globe column encouraged Kunis to reconsider accepting the Woman of the Year award since the group did not allow women to perform.\n\nPHOTO: Kris Snibbe/Harvard University Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year Mila Kunis enjoys a parade in her honor.\n\nHow they can continue to do so, especially now, when women in Hollywood and their allies are on a crusade against sexism and harassment, is unfathomable, columnist Yvonne Abraham wrote.\n\nIn a news conference during Thursday's Woman of the Year festivities, Kunis said she wouldn't be here if the change had not been made.\n\nIt wasn't a stipulation, it was just something that to me was very important, she said. To clarify, this is something this program has always wanted to do. It has nothing to do with me or today. It is simply something that was going to happen inevitably.
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump had been trying for weeks to get Georgia's secretary of state on the phone.\n\nAghast at the thought he lost a state Republicans have held for decades, and desperate to reverse the result, the President insisted to his advisers he could persuade the state's top election official to validate his false claims of voter fraud -- if only he could speak with him directly.\n\nSo, for more than a month, operators at the White House tried reaching Brad Raffensperger. Eighteen attempted calls came into his Atlanta office from the White House switchboard in the weeks after the November 3 election.\n\nTrump was making simultaneous efforts in other states he lost, inviting Republican state lawmakers from Pennsylvania and Michigan to the White House and placing phone calls to the GOP governors of Arizona and Georgia. Each time, Trump made similarly unfounded claims about voter fraud and inquired what could be done about it, according to people familiar with the conversations. And each time, his powers of salesmanship failed to convince anyone to change their states' election results,\n\nStill, Trump remained adamant he could talk his way out of a loss, one person familiar with the matter said. And he continued to insist on getting Raffensperger on the line.\n\nHe finally did on Saturday, to explosive results.\n\nThe nearly 60-minute conversation , audio of which leaked a day later, provided a bleak window into the mind of a commander-in-chief consumed by conspiracy theories and enraged by loss.\n\nAs his pliant aides listened and contributed their thoughts, Trump devolved into vague threats of criminal prosecution and expressions of political regret. Like he has in nearly every conversation since he lost the election, Trump voiced disbelief at the reality he will no longer be president in a matter of weeks.\n\nIt's just not possible to have lost Georgia. It's not possible, he said on the call. When I heard it was close, I said there's no way.\n\nNeither Trump nor the White House has commented on the call, though Trump's allies have accused Raffensperger of deception for leaking it.\n\nTwo months after Election Day, Trump remains as devoured by his loss as ever. He has mostly ignored the spike in coronavirus cases and the spreading damage from a massive Russian hack. He has watched as tensions ratchet up with Iran, but spends far more time discussing his attempts to overthrow the election results than he does on looming national security threats, according to White House officials.\n\nTrump's mood has darkened in recent weeks as he continues to be fed a daily diet of conspiracy theories about the election, a White House adviser involved in the election challenges told CNN's Jim Acosta.\n\nHe got worse as more people said something went wrong with the election, the adviser said.\n\nTrump's presence has become so unpleasant that several aides said they were actively avoiding any interaction with the President.\n\nGhost town\n\nDespite Trump's efforts to stay in power, the West Wing is becoming more like a ghost town. Several senior staffers have departed in recent days and more are expected to do so soon as officials line up their next jobs. The few senior staff who are left have sought to distance themselves from Trump's efforts out of fear of possible legal exposure.\n\nSome senior aides, including Hope Hicks, are spending less time at the White House than previously. And Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, was headed to Saudi Arabia early this week for a ceremony marking the end of the Gulf crisis involving Qatar rather than remaining in Washington.\n\nNo one wants to be around anymore, one official said. It's a dark place.\n\nWhite House counsel Pat Cipollone was not on the call with Raffensperger over the weekend, and wasn't aware it was taking place, according to a person familiar with the situation. Legal experts have said Trump could have potentially violated the state's election fraud law by asking Raffensperger to find him more votes.\n\nCipollone's influence in the White House has waned in recent weeks as he has argued internally that Trump's efforts to overturn the election results, mostly driven by conspiracy theories, are futile. He joins other White House officials who have seen their roles as presidential advisers diminish rapidly as Trump remains solely focused on the election results.\n\nHis daily schedules have evolved into self-parody, with no events listed and only a brief blurb -- dictated personally by the President, according to one person familiar with the matter -- detailing his activities.\n\nPresident Trump will work from early in the morning until late in the evening. He will make many calls and have many meetings, read his schedule for Monday, before noting what time he would leave the White House for a rally in Georgia -- an event Trump has been waffling on holding for weeks, and again threatened to cancel after his fateful call with Raffensperger on Saturday, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nTrump has been irritated with basically everyone who works for him, people familiar with the matter said, though has focused his ire recently on chief of staff Mark Meadows and Vice President Mike Pence, claiming neither man is fighting hard enough for him as he attempts to subvert democracy. Meadows joined Trump's call on Saturday and later tweeted his support of Republican lawmakers who will challenge the Electoral College results on Wednesday -- efforts that have not prevented the President from loudly complaining about him, according to people who have heard his gripes.\n\nPence finds himself in a more precarious position: as president of the Senate, he will preside over the Electoral College tally on Wednesday. Before Christmas, Trump took intense interest in his role, believing Pence could somehow reverse or prevent Biden from being certified the winner. Even as Pence explained his role was merely ceremonial, Trump seemed taken with the idea.\n\nTrump offered tacit approval for the lawsuit filed by his Republican ally Rep. Louie Gohmert pressuring Pence into overturning the election results, and was later disappointed to learn his own Justice Department was asking a judge to reject the suit, according to a person familiar with the matter. Trump and Pence discussed the matter at the end of last week.\n\nTrump for weeks has told associates that he does not believe Pence is fighting hard enough for him. That frustration is partly what led Pence's chief of staff to issue a statement Saturday night saying he welcomed efforts in Congress to raise objections to the Electoral College, though several noted it seemed carefully worded and did not say he supported the objections outright.\n\nDwindling crew\n\nJUST WATCHED Election law analyst on Trump phone call: It could be a crime Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Election law analyst on Trump phone call: It could be a crime 02:47\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has turned toward whomever will entertain his conspiracies -- including trade adviser Peter Navarro, who suggested on television recently the date of the inauguration could be pushed back, contradicting the Constitution.\n\nHe has been adding lawyers so abruptly that it's difficult for some aides to keep up with who is representing him at any given time. Several senior officials were unaware Cleta Mitchell, a prominent Republican attorney, was working with him until she surfaced on Trump's call with Raffensperger. Neither, apparently, did her law firm, Foley & Lardner, which issued a statement afterward saying it was concerned about her role on the call and are working to understand her involvement more thoroughly.\n\nThis week, Trump is again set to spend his days engulfed in last-ditch efforts to overturn the will of voters. Before a rally for two Republican Senate candidates in Georgia on Monday, Trump declared he would use his time to explain why he didn't lose the state's presidential election. As Republican lawmakers stage a futile attempt to delay certification of the Electoral College on Wednesday, Trump will address a rally of his supporters on the Ellipse near the White House.\n\nWhen all of those efforts inevitably fall short, few close to the President believe he will stop. Despite losing dozens of court challenges, Trump remains ever-hopeful that new cases will arise lending credibility to his false claims, people around him said. As even some staunch allies begin distancing themselves, Trump is lashing out.\n\nThe Surrender Caucus within the Republican Party will go down in infamy as weak and ineffective guardians of our Nation, who were willing to accept the certification of fraudulent presidential numbers! he tweeted Monday after top allies in the Senate -- including Sen. Tom Cotton -- said they would not support efforts to delay certification of the Electoral College.\n\nWith the end of his term nearing, Trump has continued to discuss ways of interrupting -- or at least counter-programing -- President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20. Few aides expect Trump to attend the scaled-down event, which Biden's team has said will feature a virtual parade instead of the traditional procession down Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nTrump himself hasn't made his intentions known, though while in Florida recently, asked others whether he should go.
(CNN) The Wisconsin pharmacist arrested last week after allegedly removing vials of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine from cold storage is a conspiracy theorist who believes the vaccine could harm people, police say.\n\nPharmacist Steven Brandenburg, 46, is accused of intentionally leaving out 57 vials, prompting hospital officials to sequester most of the doses because they thought the vaccine was rendered ineffective.\n\nIn a probable cause statement obtained by CNN affiliate WTMJ , authorities say Brandenburg admitted to investigators he believed in conspiracy theories and believed the COVID-19 vaccine was not safe for people and could harm them and change their DNA.\n\nBrandenburg, arrested Thursday, attended a preliminary hearing on his case by video call Monday. He was later released on a signature bond.\n\nBrandenburg removed a storage container with 57 vaccine vials at the Aurora Medical Center in Grafton on December 24 and 25, according to police.\n\nA pharmacy tech found the vials in the early hours of December 26 and put them back in a refrigerator, the president of Aurora Health Care Medical Group, Dr. Jeff Bahr, told reporters Thursday.\n\nHospital officials used 57 of the 570 doses to vaccinate people, he said.\n\nGrafton Police Department Detective Sgt. Eric Sutherland said in his statement that Brandenburg recklessly endangered the lives of those people by possibly compromising the efficacy of the vaccine.\n\nBut in the virtual hearing held Monday, Ozaukee County District Attorney Adam Gerol said extensive testing needs to be conducted on the doses that weren't used for vaccinations to determine whether Brandenburg's actions had in fact reduced their efficacy.\n\nIt's unknown how much time it will take, Gerol said. Fortunately, we have them such that they -- some of them or all of them -- can be returned to Moderna for the testing.\n\nIn a news release Monday, police said that Brandenburg had been charged in Ozaukee County Circuit Court.\n\nOn Tuesday police issued a clarification saying prosecutors are awaiting additional information from investigators prior to filing official criminal charges against Brandenburg. Criminal charges were requested against Brandenburg for damage to property and recklessly endangering safety, according to an updated news release from the Grafton Police Department.\n\nBut if testing finds the vaccines are or were still effective, prosecutors could pursue a less serious charge of attempted criminal damage to property instead, Gerol said.\n\nOzaukee County Circuit Court Judge Paul Malloy scheduled the next court date for January 19.\n\nBrandenburg didn't speak except to say he had no questions about the conditions of his bail: surrendering his firearms and not having any contact with Aurora Health Care Medical Group or any of his former coworkers.\n\nGrafton Police Sgt. Patrick Brock told CNN that Brandenburg was released on bond that requires him to pay $10,000 if he fails to show up for court.\n\nCNN reached out to Brandenburg's attorney, Jason Baltz, who issued a no comment on behalf of his client.\n\nThe pharmacist used to work at Aurora Medical Center in Grafton, north of Milwaukee.\n\nAccording to police, the hospital pharmacist allegedly provided public safety officials at Aurora Medical Center in Grafton with a written statement last week saying he intentionally removed the vials, knowing that if they were not properly stored, the doses would be ineffective.\n\nBahr told reporters that after the vials were found December 26, based on information available they determined the vaccine was still able to be administered, given the 12-hour period of viability after removal from refrigeration.\n\nBut during the course of an internal investigation, the former employee said the vaccines were removed for a period of time in the overnight hours of December 24 and 25.\n\nBahr said 57 vaccinations that were given Saturday are either less effective or ineffective, based on the new information provided by the pharmacist.\n\nHospital officials said last week Brandenburg was no longer employed there.\n\nThe vials' removal from refrigeration at the medical center just north of Milwaukee, and the subsequent need to discard many of them, means more than 500 doses were lost, Advocate Aurora Health has said.\n\nHospital officials are working with Moderna and the Food and Drug Administration to figure out a strategy for those who received the 57 doses.\n\nModerna says its vaccine generally must be stored at temperatures below what a refrigerator can provide. But it can also last 30 days in normal refrigeration , allowing hospitals and pharmacies flexibility for storage and distribution.\n\nThe hospital system has not said how much time elapsed from when the vials were removed from the refrigerator to when they were discovered.
Pence formalized his views in a letter to lawmakers, declaring he has no unilateral authority to decide presidential contests and could not change the results of the election.\n\nIt is my considered judgement that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not, he wrote.\n\nHe ended his letter: So Help Me God.\n\nIt was the final word from Pence before he presided over a joint session of Congress to tally the Electoral College votes. The session was interrupted when a violent pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol , forcing a lockdown and Pence's evacuation from the building.\n\nAmid the chaos, Trump began tweeting his rage at Pence.\n\nMike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, he tweeted.\n\nHe made only passing reference to the mobs of his supporters storming the Capitol building, saying to support our Capitol Police and Stay peaceful! But he did not denounce the violence.\n\nPence, tweeting from an undisclosed location after being evacuated, was more forceful.\n\nThe violence and destruction taking place at the US Capitol Must Stop and it Must Stop Now. Anyone involved must respect Law Enforcement officers and immediately leave the building, he wrote.\n\nPence had conveyed his views to the President in a meeting on Tuesday, sources familiar with the conversation told CNN. But Trump, consumed with conspiracies and unsound legal advice, hasn't listened. And afterward, he unleashed his rage on a man who has thus far successfully avoided that fate.\n\nI hope Mike is going to do the right thing, Trump said at a rally on the Ellipse midday Wednesday. If Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election.\n\nIf he doesn't, he added later, that will be a sad day for our country.\n\nEven after Pence had released his statement, Trump said he hoped his vice president would ignore the stupid people and submit to his arm-twisting.\n\nIt's an excruciating position for Trump's loyal lieutenant, who has his own political ambitions that, for now, appear to run opposite to his constitutional responsibilities. Pence has stuck by Trump through myriad scandals, including equivocal statements on White supremacy and his impeachment. He has sought to defend and bolster Trump with skeptical foreign allies and traditional Republican groups. His fealty has earned him scorn but -- until now -- helped him avoid Trump's wrath.\n\nEven advisers closely aligned with Trump describe the coming assault against Pence as despicable.\n\nPence arrived on Capitol Hill at around 1 p.m. ET to preside over the joint session of Congress that will formalize President-elect Joe Biden's victory over Trump . As president of the Senate, his role is purely ceremonial: he will open envelopes, present them to tellers and announce the winner at the end.\n\nIt's a duty he's tried, unsuccessfully, to explain to Trump over several meetings stretching hours, beginning in the middle of last month. During a final huddle in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Pence again made clear that his powers do not allow him to block certification of Biden's win.\n\nBut Trump either heard something different or decided to ignore what Pence said. He released a statement late in the evening saying he and his vice president were in total agreement that he has the power to decertify votes.\n\nAnd on Wednesday morning, Trump made the false claim on Twitter that Pence has the power to reject states' certification, delaying the process and ultimately giving him the win.\n\nDo it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage! Trump wrote.\n\nLater, at the rally of his supporters where he railed against weak Republicans and complained about explosions of bullsh*t, Trump continued pressing Pence, describing a recent conversation with his vice president.\n\nI just spoke to Mike. I said, 'Mike, that doesn't take courage. What takes courage is to do nothing,'  he said.\n\nA senior White House official, whose views are closely aligned with Trump's, told CNN what the President is doing to Pence in their final days in office is shameful. This official noted how Pence has stuck by the President even amid the Access Hollywood scandal only to witness him turn on him at the very end.\n\nPence, meanwhile, is bracing himself for Wednesday's proceedings and has accepted that a rough few days are ahead of him, people familiar with his thinking tell CNN.\n\nHe has mulled ways to signal his support for the President while carrying out his pro forma role by referencing Trump's concerns about voter fraud during the debate before certification, according to people familiar with the matter. But after lengthy meetings with the Senate parliamentarian, the White House counsel's office and other experts, Pence was left to conclude he cannot impede the final result.\n\nAlthough Pence attempted to soften the blow for Trump by carefully laying out what he can expect from him on Capitol Hill, the President has offered his own theories that appear based on advice he's received from an increasingly fringe group of lawyers and advisers, including personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, conservative lawyer John Eastman and trade adviser Peter Navarro.\n\nTrump's principal wish is for Pence to delay the certification further by refusing states' electoral slates, hoping to end up back in the courts.\n\nLet them sue, some of Trump's advisers have told him.\n\nThe President hopes by creating chaos and lending credence to his false claims the election was rife with fraud, he can at least depart office with his supporters believing he was the rightful winner whose victory was stolen.\n\nPeople around Pence say he has no plans to carry out Trump's orders. As a result, the President has lashed out at one of his most loyal aides with increasing fervor.\n\nPrivately, Trump's criticism has been even blunter than his public entreaties, sources said. The President has told people he saved Pence's career by selecting him as vice president and that Pence would be nothing without Trump.\n\nStill, Pence and people around him all believe there is nothing he can do, one person close to him said.\n\nFew Trump staffers said they were surprised by the President's turn on Pence, since he has shown a willingness to attack other loyal officials, though many were privately critical.\n\nNo one has been more loyal than (Pence), one official said. Trump turns on everyone in the end.

Instead, it was the year of Netflix\n\nDetail of a mans hand scrolling through Netflix on an Apple iPad Pro, taken on March 6, 2020. (Photo by Phil Barker/Future Publishing via Getty Images)\n\n(CNN Business) —\n\nWhat's the price of censoring one episode of a Netflix show in Saudi Arabia?\n\nThough Netflix has not released specifics on the number of subscribers in the country, the recent controversy over its removal of an episode of comedian Hasan Minhaj's show Patriot Act is throwing a sharp spotlight on how media and tech companies balance artistic freedom against local laws, and their business.\n\nLast week Netflix pulled the episode for viewers in Saudi Arabia after officials there complained to Netflix that the episode, first posted in October, violated an article of the country's anti-cyber crime law.\n\nNetflix said in a statement that it supports artistic freedom and only removed the episode for Saudi viewers because of the valid legal request.\n\nIt doesn't mean we agree with these laws, a spokesperson told CNN.\n\nNetflix is focused on expanding Internationally, pouring money into original content from around the world made in local languages. It's already available in every country and region around the world except China, Syria, Crimea and North Korea.\n\nSaudi Arabia is a relatively new country for Netflix, as the company only expanded there three years ago. But Guy Bisson, a London-based media industry analyst and research director with Ampere Analysis, told CNN Business that the region in general is an important area for streaming video.\n\nThe Middle East is going to be one of the big focus markets for that local production because it's clearly a potentially lucrative and large market for them, Bisson said.\n\nNetflix said Saudi Arabia cited Article 6 of its anti-cyber crimes law, which states that production, preparation, transmission, or storage of material impinging on public order, religious values, public morals, and privacy, through the information network or computers is a crime, according to the Financial Times, which first broke the story.\n\nBut it's not clear yet which aspect of the law Minhaj's show broke. Minhaj spent considerable time criticizing Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman and the government's handling of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and questioned whether Saudi Arabia, which contains most of Islam's holiest sites, properly represented Muslim values.\n\nWhat makes this different is that it's not immediately obvious why it breaches the particular law they said it does, and it's obviously a political issue as well — and that's a slightly different matter, Bisson said.\n\nNetflix is not the first tech company to run up against local laws and customs as it tries to expand globally.\n\nGoogle, for instance, has recently come under fire for a secret project to build a censored search engine that could provide the company a way to appease Chinese regulators and get back into the Chinese market. And like Netflix's recent situation, Google has removed some content, publicizing some data about which countries have requested it remove content and the general reason why in a transparency report. Netflix does not post a transparency report.\n\nAnd Netflix already complies with certain regulations in other countries. New Zealand, for example, banned a documentary about suicide called The Bridge from being shown outside of film festivals. The documentary is not available on Netflix in New Zealand, though it is available in other countries.\n\nSome countries are even using laws to keep that production local — another regulation with which Netflix and other media companies will have to contend. EU lawmakers recently voted to require that video-on-demand services ensure at least 30% of their available content is European-made.\n\nMary Ann Halford, a former 21st Century Fox executive who worked on that company's international operations, told CNN Business that Netflix had little choice but to take down the Patriot Act episode.\n\nIf Netflix had taken it down across the world then that would be a major issue. I don't think Netflix had much legal room in this particular situation, said Halford, who now works as an adviser at OC&C Strategy Consultants.\n\nHalford said the only way Netflix could effect change in Saudi Arabia is by staying in the market. The sacrifice of one episode in the country might be worth it to keep the rest of Minhaj's show online there, she said.\n\nThey could risk being shut down in Saudi Arabia, and I don't think doing that advances Netflix's interest, Halford said. One of [the United States'] greatest exports is American culture, so I don't know why we'd want to stop doing that. And listen, this comedian will still be seen.\n\nIndeed, as Minhaj himself tweeted on Wednesday, it's likely far more people now know about the censored episode and his show than before the incident.
Story highlights The first African bobsled team to qualify for the Olympics They're former track stars\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThree Nigerian-American women are making history – and their Olympic dreams come true – by being the first ever African bobsled team to qualify for the Olympics.\n\nThe team will also be the first Nigerian athletes to compete at a Winter Olympics, when they appear at the PyeongChang games, which begin February 9.\n\nSeun Adigun, Ngozi Onwumere and Akuoma Omeoga are the force behind the team, which officially qualified for the games in November last year.\n\nWhen people see us, they're like 'oh you guys are all the same!' We get along so well, but between the three of us there's so much versatility, Omeoga told CNN.\n\nAdigun, the driver and founder of the team, describes herself as the critical, analytical one, whereas Omwumere is more laid back, and Omeoga meets them in the middle.\n\nBut they all have one thing in common: they are all former track and field stars.\n\nTrack-to-ice\n\nPHOTO: @bsfnigeria/Instagram The team celebrating.\n\nThey had successes. Omwmuere competed in the All-African games, and Adigun made it to the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, where she competed in the 100-meter hurdles.\n\nIn 2015, Olympic dreams called Adigun back, this time, to uncharted territory: sliding on ice at speeds up to 90 miles an hour.\n\nI started bobsled at 28 years old. It's not that I wasn't able to start earlier. I didn't have a clue about it, Adigun said.\n\nAt the time, the sport was trying to grow and attract former track athletes. Team USA recruited Adigun, who grew up in the US, and she became a brakewoman for a year.\n\nNot long after, she had a conversation with Nigeria's bobsled federation.\n\nThey told me there's an opportunity for me to help change what it means to be a bobsled athlete for the continent of Africa, and in the sport itself. The humanitarian in me knew that this was something that I had to do, Adigun said.\n\nA year later, she enlisted friends Onwumere and Omeoga as her brakewomen to form a bobsled team from scratch.\n\nShe kidnapped us. That's the story, Omeoga said.\n\nYeah! Held captive! Onwumere chimed.\n\nBut they all felt it was the right time to do something big for their country, and continent.\n\nNigerian roots\n\nNigerian bobsled team: Ngozi Onwumere, Seun Adigun and Akuoma Omeoga.\n\nWhen they're not on the road traveling to wintery destinations, they reside in Houston, Texas. But to all three, Nigeria has always been home.\n\nBeing Nigerian was always something that was definitely prominent in my childhood, as it is as much as in adulthood. That was the first culture that I've ever known, Omeoga said.\n\nIn April 2017, the trio had a major homecoming to promote the winter sport in the country, and show Nigerians what bobsled is and how they too can train for a cold-weather sport, even if they live in a warm-weather place.\n\nAdigun has a special tool for teaching when not on the ice. It's a wooden sled that she calls the Mayflower.\n\nI built [it] when I was a brakeman in the US. So, when I decided to start the Nigerian team it just became the bobsled 101 tool. We spend a lot of time doing reps on the Mayflower, on turf or track surfaces, Adigun said.\n\nThe journey so far has been a great ride. The rides themselves? Perhaps a little different than envisioned.\n\nAdigun admits the driver's seat is more comfortable, unless you crash.\n\nYou know, when you crash, there's kind of a different ride. But just like with anything that's new there's no real blueprint, you know there's going to be phases and stages where you might run into some walls, Adigun said.\n\nBut overall, the experience has been positive.\n\nThis journey has taught me that self-improvement is on a continuum. Even when we get to the Olympics, it's still like, What happens next? And that's what life is about, just always wanting to improve, Onwumere said.\n\nAdigun doesn't want to be seen as the new kids on the block.\n\nWe want to be able to be something that people can really be able to be proud of.

(Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe lawyers for former Trump campaign adviser Rick Gates showed a hint as to why they'd like to quit his case Wednesday: They don't agree with Gates.\n\nIrreconcilable differences have developed with the client which make our effective representation of the client impossible, Gates' trial attorneys Shan Wu, Walter Mack and Annemarie McAvoy wrote in a filing submitted to federal court last Thursday, which was unsealed Wednesday.\n\nThe lawyers told the court they couldn't provide more details about their specific reasons because that could breach the privileged attorney-client relationship. They also said revealing more details could prejudice possible future jurors against Gates and are potentially embarrassing.\n\nThe development Wednesday does little to clear up the mystery about Gates' fractured legal representation. Gates and the attorneys appeared in court Wednesday for about an hour.\n\nThe hearing was closed to the public, and Gates and his trial team were mum on what happened. The trial team's proposed departure from the case comes after lawyers who've worked for Gates behind the scenes visited special counsel Robert Mueller's office several times, suggesting an ongoing negotiation between the prosecutors and the criminal defendant.\n\nThose lawyers, from the law firm Sidley Austin, have yet to tell the court they're representing Gates, nor make any other public statements about him.\n\nGates has pleaded not guilty to eight criminal charges, including money laundering. Aside from having two potential legal teams, Gates could also run into financial troubles to fund his defense. Some of the charges he faces mean the government could seize millions of dollars from him. And the federal court previously acknowledged he fell short of the $5 million in assets needed to secure his bail.\n\nThe pending departure of Gates' trial attorneys marks the third time he's had a change in counsel. Previously, Gates had a lawyer from private law firm, with whom he cut ties just before his indictment. At his first court appearance, Gates was represented by a federal public defender, before Mack, Wu and McAvoy stepped in.

Hill: I just do what I think is right\n\nDemocratic Congressional candidate Katie Hill speaks to supporters at her election night party in California's 25th Congressional district on November 6, 2018 in Santa Clarita, California.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nWhen Katie Hill opened the heavy wooden door to her new congressional office in the Longworth House Office Building, one feeling smacked her in the gut.\n\nWell, this doesn't feel like me, recalled the freshman congresswoman from California's 25th District.\n\nSo yeah, this very formal place being my home base does feel strange, she added. I don't want to become more formal. That's not on the table.\n\nHill argues her life doesn't allow her to embrace any of the formal trappings of Washington. Raised in suburban Los Angeles, she prefers sneakers to heels. She's a Democrat and the daughter of a Republican police officer and survived a sexual assault. Socially conscious, she married a man but identifies as bisexual.\n\nThe thrust of her career has been in non-profits, as an advocate for the homeless. She also embraces the sexist criticism, known as resting bitch face, about a serious woman (like her) not smiling while thinking.\n\nThis isn't the sort of resume or life story that typically precedes a seat in Congress, but that's just fine with Hill and the voters who elected her. An unconventional woman, the 31-year-old joins the 116th Congress, the most diverse legislature in history by many measures — gender, race and sexual orientation.\n\nRefusing to change is part of the internal feedback loop in Hill's first days in Washington.\n\nSometimes in the middle of an unreal day, you just really need to hug your mom.\n\n\n\nWe're about to be sworn in. Let's do this. pic.twitter.com/8zmyMbgvb9 — Rep. Katie Hill (@RepKatieHill) January 3, 2019\n\nA grassroots candidate\n\nHill won with an insurgent campaign spurred by the 2016 election. She channeled her anger at the victory of President Donald Trump by taking aim at her congressman, Rep. Steve Knight, who voted with fellow House Republicans in May 2017 to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Who is going to run against him? Hill typed out on her social media accounts. A friend said, Why not you?\n\nWhy not, thought Hill.\n\nA year and a half later, Hill flipped the suburban Los Angeles district for Democrats. The first-time candidate had started her grassroots campaign out of a rented apartment backed by a hoodie-wearing millennial staff, chain-sipping La Croix sparkling water. The team raised more than $8 million without taking a cent in corporate or special interest money.\n\nHill won over voters as a progressive advocate for affordable housing while offering a pragmatic willingness to work across party lines for her purple district. Trying to fit into Washington is not why Hill was elected nor does it sit anywhere on her agenda.\n\nPlaying nice isn't really something that's in my vocabulary, she said. I just do what I think is right.\n\nDemanding to be heard\n\nThat philosophy may sound quaint, even naive, for Washington, but Hill believes that's the shared sentiment among the incoming freshmen congressional class.\n\nA record-setting 127 women were elected to the 116th Congress, the majority of whom are Democrats. More African Americans, Latinos and LGBTQ members now serve in Congress. The legislature also saw its median age drop by approximately a decade with its newly elected members.\n\nPHOTO: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images Katie Hill laughs as Nancy Pelosi's granddaughter reacts to votes for Pelosi to become Speaker of the House.\n\nHill is notable for her youth as well as being California's first openly bisexual woman elected to Congress. But it's the sheer size of the freshman class, at 92 new members with 46 flipped seats in the 2018 midterm election, that's politically powerful to her.\n\nTraditionally, new legislators have been expected to wait their turn while more seasoned members drove the agenda. But this time, and in this age, the newbies are demanding their voices be heard.\n\nI think we have enough power and enough strength in numbers and enough of a strong mandate from voters that we're going to be able to continue to stay true to the things that we ran on, said Hill, who was elected to the Democratic House leadership team as one of two new members representing freshmen.\n\nPHOTO: Win McNamee/Getty Images Katie Hill, right, poses with other members of the newly elected Democratic House Leadership team in November.\n\nThe result, she hopes, will be in them governing differently.\n\nA new agenda and attitude\n\nTop of Hill's agenda is focusing on a more equitable system, from health care to taxes to housing. Hill believes the biggest problem with Washington has been the billionaire class being controlled by special interest donors and ignoring the needs of the politically powerless.\n\nWe are regular, middle class people, said Hill, the now third-youngest member of Congress (behind Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Iowa's Abby Finkenauer.)\n\nWe're young. We look like and speak like the people that we're there to represent. We're not people who came up through the political process. The majority of us are first-time candidates. We're not stuck in the old way of doing things, she said.\n\nThis Freshman class is larger, younger, and more diverse than ever before and that's not a coincidence – it's a call to action.\n\n\n\nYesterday @JoeNeguse and I were elected to be the Co-Representatives to Leadership for this historic class and we are so ready to get to work. pic.twitter.com/GZv3FUElNe — Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) November 29, 2018\n\nHill spoke to CNN as she made the flight to Washington from Burbank, California, inviting us to chronicle her journey from candidate to congresswoman-elect to swearing in.\n\nA millennial, Hill embraces the sharing philosophy of her generation via social media and speaks easily with reporters as cameras roll. She's shared on Twitter and Facebook her personal stories about surviving sexual assault and an unplanned pregnancy that ended in a miscarriage. In her unconventional political ads, she went rock climbing.\n\nAs Hill checked in for the 6:45 a.m. flight, she remarked, I've never lived outside of California or traveled with so many bags. For the record, there were three suitcases.\n\nShe wore athletic clothing for the flight, noticing then, under the bright fluorescent lights of the ticket counter, that her black pants were covered in her dog's white hair. Oh well, she said, as she walked towards airport security. Her goal, she said, is to demystify Congress by bringing her voters with her on this journey and through her entire term, dog hair and all.\n\nI think what I, and many of the other freshmen have, what's kind of unique, is this sort of ability to relate to people in a different way.\n\nI left my house in SoCal and it was 37 degrees, landed in DC and it's more than 50 degrees here! What a warm welcome! ☀️\n\n\n\nCan't believe inauguration is this week — I'm so ready to get to work. 💪🏼 pic.twitter.com/UV28nRQPFO — Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) December 29, 2018\n\nIt's why on Hill's Twitter feed she's posted frequent updates on her first impressions of Washington during new member orientation, known as Congress Camp. She talked about what committees she hoped to join to best represent her district, a sprawling community with suburban middle-class families and lower-income desert communities, and doesn't plan on slowing down the tweets.\n\n'There's going to be fights'\n\nHill signed the lease at her new home – a small, no frills, two-bedroom apartment that gives off a corporate, temporary housing sensibility. It's there she caught up with her roommate and fellow freshman, Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois. Nearly the same age, the congresswomen initially give off a bubbly vibe of moving into a college dorm.\n\nYou can only have tough dinner table conversations if you first get the dinner table! 😂\n\n\n\n@LUnderwood630 is the best Ikea partner I could imagine — the true test of roommate compatibility! (And maybe our negotiation skills too...) pic.twitter.com/knACssVjXF — Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) December 30, 2018\n\nBut as Underwood talked, it became apparent that both carried the weight of their new elected jobs.\n\nI think it's going to be hard, said Underwood, who also flipped her district, defeating a Republican male incumbent. She is now the youngest black woman to ever serve in Congress. We don't walk in and everything automatically changes.\n\nI would imagine there will be confrontations, said Hill. There's going to be fights between the old guard and the new one. But I feel very optimistic that the existing leadership all want us to be part of this process. They recognize the change that's happening, and they're trying to include us.\n\nPHOTO: Kyung Lah/CNN The nameplate for Rep. Katie Hill outside her office on Capitol Hill.\n\nOn inauguration morning, a crush of cameras greeted Hill, swarming around her as she tried to enter the Capitol to be sworn in.\n\nIt feels good. It feels like we can finally get to work, she said.\n\nShe stepped into the US Capitol through the south door entrance and disappeared into the tunnel. Her cross-country journey had ended but her new role as Congresswoman Katie Hill had just begun.

Yet her career went well beyond that, from her brilliant performance in the movie Ordinary People to her influence as a co-founder of MTM with then-husband Grant Tinker, a TV production powerhouse that produced not only Mary Tyler Moore but many signature programs, including St. Elsewhere, Hill Street Blues and multiple spinoffs from her program, such as Lou Grant and Rhoda.\n\nTinker, the former NBC chairman, died in November, and the loss of both of them in such short order almost feels like the end of a TV era.\n\nHaving started as a dancer – and been featured solely for her legs as the secretary whose face was never seen in the 1950s show Richard Diamond, Private Detective – Moore had to overcome skepticism at the time that a beautiful actress (someone who could famously turn the world on with her smile, as the song went) could also be funny. Her series, moreover, marked a breakthrough in terms of depicting a working woman, one who was single, dated but devoted to her career.\n\nPhotos: Remembering Mary Tyler Moore PHOTO: Bettmann/Getty Images Actress Mary Tyler Moore, whose 1970s TV show helped usher in a new era for women on television, died Wednesday, January 25, her longtime representative Mara Buxbaum said. Moore was 80 years old. The Mary Tyler Moore Show debuted in 1970 and starred the actress as Mary Richards, a single career woman at a Minneapolis TV station. The series was hailed as the first modern woman's sitcom. Photos: Remembering Mary Tyler Moore PHOTO: CBS/Getty Images Moore came to fame in The Dick Van Dyke Show, a sitcom that ran from 1961-1966.

Prev Next\n\nShe did everything so naturally and so gracefully, Reiner said of Moore in a 2015 PBS special, calling her the Grace Kelly of comedians.\n\nMoore's career actually hit a fallow period after The Dick Van Dyke Show, before Van Dyke featured her in a variety special that helped trigger interest in her among network executives.\n\nThe Mary Tyler Moore Show followed in 1970, quickly becoming one of the most popular series on television. While Moore was surrounded by a one-for-the-ages cast, she more than held her own, including what many consider one of the greatest sitcom episodes ever, where Moore's character – after admonishing her co-workers for joking about it – breaks into uncontrollable laughter during a funeral for Chuckles the Clown.\n\nMoore continued to work regularly – in television and on stage – after those shows, while earning plaudits for her work as an advocate for various causes, including diabetes research.\n\nThe memories that linger, though, will for most stem from the glow she brought to the screen in the 1960s and '70s. And thanks to those shows, that hat she tossed skyward during the credits of her eponymous series will never come down.
(CNN) Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will win the Nevada caucuses, according to a CNN projection, showing the power of his organization and amplifying his argument that he can broaden his appeal across the Democratic electorate based on the results from the most diverse state in Democrats' nominating contest thus far.\n\nThough former Vice President Joe Biden appeared to have the lead in polls as late as January, Sanders made an enormous organizing push beginning in the middle of last year, putting some 250 paid staffers on the ground in the Silver State. His campaign also harnessed their grassroots fundraising machine to build roots within the state's large Latino community, advertising in Spanish not only on television, radio and social media, but through ads on music streaming services like Pandora and Spotify.\n\nTaking the stage in San Antonio, Sanders introduced his wife Jane as the next first lady of the United States. He touted the multigenerational, multi-racial coalition that his campaign built in Nevada, giving his campaign a fresh burst of momentum after his win in New Hampshire and his strong showing in Iowa.\n\nIn Nevada, and in New Hampshire and in Iowa -- what we showed is that our volunteers are prepared to knock on hundreds and hundreds of thousands of doors, Sanders said. That no campaign has a grassroots movement like we do, which is another reason why we're going to win this election.\n\n(President Donald) Trump and his friends think they are going to win this election, Sanders continued. They think they're going to win this election by dividing our people up, based on the color of their skin, or where they were born, or their religion or their sexual orientation. We are going to win because we are doing exactly the opposite. We're bringing our people together.\n\nEarly entrance polls in Nevada showed Sanders winning Latino voters by 54%, some 40 percentage points ahead of the next candidate, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg . Sanders also won among white voters; Biden led among black voters in those early snapshots of the electorate.\n\nThe fervent support among younger voters for Sanders was evident in the Nevada results. Among the state's voters under the age of 30 -- who only made up 17% of the electorate -- some 66% of them favored the Vermont senator. Biden led among caucusgoers over 65, with around a quarter supporting the former vice president. Around 1 in 5 went for Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and 1 in 8 for Buttigieg, Sanders and businessman Tom Steyer each. Around 1 in 10 caucused for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\n\nSanders also won 44% of non-white voters, according to entrance polls, a blow to Biden -- who had claimed that minority voters are the base that would power him to the Democratic nomination.\n\nSome wondered whether Sanders would face headwinds among the considerable number of union members in Nevada after tensions flared between the powerful Culinary Union -- which represents 66,000 hotel and casino workers -- and Sanders supporters, because of the Culinary Union's opposition to Sanders' Medicare for All plan. The union decided not to endorse a candidate.\n\nThe Culinary Union posted flyers throughout Las Vegas underscoring that Sanders' plans would force them to give up the excellent health care benefits they fought for. That led to a backlash among some Sanders supporters online. In the end, it does not appear to have been a major factor in the election.\n\nAmong Nevada voters, the overriding concern was supporting a candidate who could beat Trump. On the issues, health care was the top concern and 63% of voters said they supported a government run health care plan like the one Sanders has proposed.\n\nSanders' win was also particularly notable given the ideological split within the Nevada electorate: 30% described themselves as very liberal, 35% said they were somewhat liberal and 31% said they were moderate in entrance polls.\n\nOther Democrats fall short\n\nIn an aggressive shift in his strategy, Buttigieg targeted Sanders at length during his speech in Nevada, asking voters to consider whether the senator would be the strongest nominee even though he said they celebrate many of the same ideals.\n\nBefore we rush to nominate Sen. Sanders in our one shot to take on this President, let us take a sober look at what is at stake for our party, for our values, Buttigieg said. There is so much on the line, and one thing we know for sure is that we absolutely must defeat Donald Trump and everything he represents.\n\nButtigieg pointed to Sanders' embrace of Medicare for All as a major liability for Democrats heading into November, saying, I believe we can defeat Trump and deliver for the American people by empowering the American people to make their own health care choices with Medicare for all who want it.\n\nSen. Sanders believes in taking away that choice, removing people from having the option of a private plan and replacing it with a public plan whether you want it or not.\n\nIn Nevada, Buttigieg was under intense pressure to show he could appeal to minority voters as polls have consistently shown him with scant, if any, support from African Americans and Latinos.\n\nThe Nevada results do not appear to have moved the needle much on that front. But Buttigieg, who placed first in Iowa and a close second in New Hampshire, thanked his Nevada supporters for making this a great day for our campaign.\n\nBiden, pointing to the diversity of Nevada as evidence that it would be a better fit for his campaign than Iowa and New Hampshire, had hoped for a comeback in the Silver State after his fourth and fifth place finishes in the first two states. But he still fell short -- even after heavy campaigning in the past week -- underscoring the uncertainty among Democratic voters over the former vice president's stamina against Trump.\n\nBiden told CNN in an interview on Friday that he would consider a first or second place finish in Nevada to be a win.\n\nOn Saturday, the former vice president, who seemed poised for a stronger finish than in Iowa and New Hampshire, offered his thanks to his labor supporters in Nevada. As he prepared to speak Saturday afternoon, a man in the audience yelled, The Comeback Kid -- a phrase coined by Bill Clinton when he finished second in New Hampshire in 1992.\n\nWell you got it! Biden yelled back.\n\nI don't know the final results yet, but I feel really good, said Biden, who took the stage at a time when he was a distant second to Sanders in very early results. The press is ready to declare people dead quickly. But we're alive, we're coming back and we're going to win.\n\nWarren also made a vigorous push this week in Nevada, seeking a last-minute surge after she led the charge against former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg in Wednesday night's Las Vegas debate. (Bloomberg is not competing in the state).\n\nWarren did not have the kind of finish her campaign hoped for after her strong debate performance, but she sought to project optimism about the upcoming contests when she appeared late Saturday in Seattle, offering her congratulations to Sanders and focusing her fire on Bloomberg.\n\nThank you for keeping me in the fight, Warren said, noting that her campaign has raised $9 million over three days. We have a lot of states to go. Right now I can feel the momentum, so let's stay in this fight.\n\nShe zeroed in on Bloomberg and the hundreds of millions of dollars he has spent, describing him as a threat that is coming our way.\n\nThis election is not for sale. We are going to make this election about Democracy, about you, she said.\n\nWarren's strong debate performance helped her campaign cruise past its original fundraising goal, raising some $14 million over the past week. That money was a much-needed lifeline for the Warren campaign. The latest reports to the Federal Election Commission showed that she spent twice what she raised in January. Her campaign took out a $3 million line of credit to avoid running out of money.\n\nSteyer made an enormous investment in Nevada, ultimately plowing $15.5 million into television ads -- far outpacing Sanders, who was a distant second in spending with about $2 million. Despite the exorbitant amount of money that Steyer spent in Nevada, it does not appear to have bought him much in the state.\n\nKlobuchar had hoped the momentum she'd built over the first two contests would continue in Nevada.\n\nEntrance polls showed that both Buttigieg and Klobuchar did well among late-deciding voters who made their decision over the past month. Sanders far outpaced the others among voters who decided earlier than a month ago.\n\nAppearing in her home state of Minnesota, which does not vote until Super Tuesday, Klobuchar was the first candidate to take the stage Saturday afternoon.\n\nShe said that she had once again exceeded expectations, a claim that did not trend with the actual results that have been reported so far.\n\nThey're counting the votes, but as usual, I think we have exceeded expectations, Klobuchar said at her campaign headquarters in Minneapolis. I always note that a lot of people didn't even think that I would still be standing at this point.\n\nEarlier Saturday, Klobuchar told reporters at her caucus kickoff event insider her Las Vegas office that her campaign will be viable no matter what.\n\nWe're already running ads in Super Tuesday states, she said. We're headed to South Carolina for the debate and there we go.\n\nHow Sanders won Nevada\n\nSanders' victory in Nevada was a credit not only to his organization and outreach in minority communities, but also the way he has transformed his 2016 upstart candidacy to the formidable operation of a front-runner.\n\nFour years ago, Sanders was viewed as the renegade candidate of the progressive fringe as he challenged Hillary Clinton, who defeated the Vermont senator in the Nevada caucuses but was drawn into a long and protracted race with a rival few had taken seriously.\n\nWith the benefit of experience, reams of voter data and an unmatched ability to raise money from small-dollar donors, Sanders has built a very different campaign this time -- one that increasingly seems to be convincing Democratic voters that he will be able to take on Trump.\n\nOne of the most striking facets of the Nevada entrance polls was that Sanders won convincingly within an electorate where nearly two-thirds said beating Trump was more important than choosing a candidate who shared their views.\n\nIt showed that Sanders is increasingly persuading Democrats that he can defeat Trump by galvanizing working class voters who feel left behind in the Trump economy and bringing new voters into the process.\n\nChanging the perception of Sanders has been a deliberate effort by his campaign since early 2019. Instead of simply holding rallies where he gave long, stem-winding speeches, he held more intimate events in the early states and spent much more time questioning voters about their economic struggles.\n\nAt the same time, he continues to burnish his appeal as an outsider willing to take on the Washington establishment, including those in his own party.\n\nSanders has fired up his supporters by promising to take on a lengthy list of powerful interests, from the pharmaceutical industry to the military industrial complex to the crooks on Wall Street.\n\nHe has also cast his campaign as one that will drive revolutionary change in the area of economic justice, emphasizing polices like raising the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour, forgiving student loan debt, providing free college, reforming what he calls a broken and racist criminal justice system, and making universal health care a human right.\n\nIn minority communities, Sanders' campaign also made a very deliberate effort to connect with voters by sharing his family's immigrant story. Sanders often talks on the trail about how his father came to the United States at the age of 17 without any money and minimal English skills, but was able to make a living through determination and hard work.\n\nHe has portrayed the Trump administration's actions on immigration as cruel, immoral and heartless, casting the President as a racist and a xenophobe, while promising to reverse Trump's policies as soon as he takes office.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Saturday.
(CNN Business) —\n\nThe Federal Reserve sent another clear signal Wednesday that it won't be moving quickly to raise interest rates in 2019.\n\nDespite earlier commitments to steadily lift rates above their historic lows, discussions among policymakers at their last meeting in December showed growing wariness amid signs of a weakening global economy, according to minutes of the Fed's December meeting.\n\nMembers of the bank's interest rate-setting committee judged the the appropriate extent and timing of future policy firming [is] less clear than earlier, amid a host of economic uncertainties, according to the minutes.\n\nThe US economy remains healthy, producing one of the strongest months of job gains in the last decade in December as employers added 312,000 jobs. But market volatility has increased, with investors concerned about softening in Asia because of President Donald Trump's trade war and continued instability in Washington. Trump and congressional Democrats have been unable to move toward a resolution of the government shutdown.\n\nAlthough Fed officials repeated their credo that the path of interest rates isn't on a preset course, they notably added that neither the pace nor the ultimate endpoint of future rate increases was known.\n\nThe Fed has so far penciled in two rate hikes in 2019, but Chairman Jerome Powell said in remarks in Atlanta last Friday that the central bank is ready to change course significantly if necessary.\n\nIn recent months, the US central bank has emphasized decisions on future rate hikes would depend on incoming data on the economy – a point policymakers echoed during their December meeting by suggesting they would change their policy outlook if they saw financial conditions tighten further or possible risks to financial stability.\n\nThe committee could afford to be patient about future policy firming, the Fed noted in its minutes as the stock market stays volatile, economic growth weakens and inflation concerns remain muted.\n\nOne unexpected twist that may affect the Fed's ability to gauge the economy is the shutdown, which will limit the data coming in from the Commerce Department. The central bank uses a number of metrics to assess the health of the US economy both from the private and public sector.\n\nWhile having the full complement of government data available would be beneficial, the Federal Reserve's staff assessment of economic conditions takes into account a wide range of information from government and private-sector sources, as well as readings on financial and international developments, and staff continue to provide a detailed economic picture for policymakers, a Fed spokesman told CNN.\n\nSeveral participants of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-setting body, noted at the December meeting that it was critical for the Fed to determine how risks to the economy might unfold and to what extent they would affect the economy.\n\nThe Fed raised rates for the fourth time in 2018 at the meeting. Central bankers unanimously agreed to lift the federal funds rate, which influences the cost of mortgages, credit cards and other borrowing, to a range of 2.25% to 2.5%.\n\nA few participants at the December meeting favored keeping rates steady with no signs of inflation picking up, arguing that the Fed had some latitude to wait and see how the data would develop amid the recent rise in financial market volatility and increased uncertainty about the global economic growth outlook.\n\nAt a press conference following the rate decision, Powell spoke directly to the number of uncertainties facing the Fed.\n\nWhat kind of year will 2019 be? We know that the economy may not be as kind to our forecasts next year as it was this year. History attests that unforeseen events as the year unfolds may buffet the economy and call for more than a slight change from policy projections released today.\n\nPowell echoed a similar message onstage at the American Economic Association last Friday, saying With the muted inflation readings that we've seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves.\n\nFed officials have begun in recent months to debate how to communicate to the public a shift toward a more data-dependent approach. Some officials suggested it might be appropriate in future meetings to remove forward guidance entirely, according to the minutes.\n\nCNN's Alison Kosik contributed to this report.

Yet her career went well beyond that, from her brilliant performance in the movie Ordinary People to her influence as a co-founder of MTM with then-husband Grant Tinker, a TV production powerhouse that produced not only Mary Tyler Moore but many signature programs, including St. Elsewhere, Hill Street Blues and multiple spinoffs from her program, such as Lou Grant and Rhoda.\n\nTinker, the former NBC chairman, died in November, and the loss of both of them in such short order almost feels like the end of a TV era.\n\nHaving started as a dancer – and been featured solely for her legs as the secretary whose face was never seen in the 1950s show Richard Diamond, Private Detective – Moore had to overcome skepticism at the time that a beautiful actress (someone who could famously turn the world on with her smile, as the song went) could also be funny. Her series, moreover, marked a breakthrough in terms of depicting a working woman, one who was single, dated but devoted to her career.\n\nPhotos: Remembering Mary Tyler Moore PHOTO: Bettmann/Getty Images Actress Mary Tyler Moore, whose 1970s TV show helped usher in a new era for women on television, died Wednesday, January 25, her longtime representative Mara Buxbaum said. Moore was 80 years old. The Mary Tyler Moore Show debuted in 1970 and starred the actress as Mary Richards, a single career woman at a Minneapolis TV station. The series was hailed as the first modern woman's sitcom. Photos: Remembering Mary Tyler Moore PHOTO: CBS/Getty Images Moore came to fame in The Dick Van Dyke Show, a sitcom that ran from 1961-1966.

Prev Next\n\nShe did everything so naturally and so gracefully, Reiner said of Moore in a 2015 PBS special, calling her the Grace Kelly of comedians.\n\nMoore's career actually hit a fallow period after The Dick Van Dyke Show, before Van Dyke featured her in a variety special that helped trigger interest in her among network executives.\n\nThe Mary Tyler Moore Show followed in 1970, quickly becoming one of the most popular series on television. While Moore was surrounded by a one-for-the-ages cast, she more than held her own, including what many consider one of the greatest sitcom episodes ever, where Moore's character – after admonishing her co-workers for joking about it – breaks into uncontrollable laughter during a funeral for Chuckles the Clown.\n\nMoore continued to work regularly – in television and on stage – after those shows, while earning plaudits for her work as an advocate for various causes, including diabetes research.\n\nThe memories that linger, though, will for most stem from the glow she brought to the screen in the 1960s and '70s. And thanks to those shows, that hat she tossed skyward during the credits of her eponymous series will never come down.

Cardinals attend the religious mass 'Pro Eligendo Romano Pontifice' at Saint Peter's Basilica in the Vatican, Vatican City, 12 March 2013. The Catholic Church's 115 cardinal electors are taking part in a mass in St. Peter's Basilica on 12 March ahead of entering the conclave for a papal election that observers say has no clear favourite. The Pro Eligendo Romano Pontefice ('For the Election of the Roman Pontiff') mass is presided by Angelo Sodano, the elderly dean of the College of Cardinals, and is also open to non-voting cardinals - those aged more than 80. The next pope will take over a Church beset by infighting, scandal and dwindling support, particularly in the West.\n\nWhile you're in Rome, take in the night view at St. Peter's Basilica of St. Peter. It's in Vatican City, which is technically a tiny, separate country that's completely surrounded by the much larger city of Rome.\n\nGerman Bishops take part in the opening mass at the German Bishops' Conference on September 25, 2018 in the cathedral in Fulda, western Germany. - Germany's Catholic Church is due on September 25, 2018 to confess and apologise for thousands of cases of sexual abuse against children, part of a global scandal heaping pressure on the Vatican. It will release the latest in a series of reports on sexual crimes and cover-ups spanning decades that has shaken the largest Christian Church, from Europe to the United States, South America and Australia. (Photo by Arne Dedert / dpa / AFP) / Germany OUT (Photo credit should read ARNE DEDERT/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nPope Francis (L) speaks speaks with the Archbishop of Washington Cardinal Donald Wuerl at the end of a midday prayer with US bishops at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington, DC, on September 23, 2015 on the second day of his visit to the US.

Pope Benedict XVI's successor is being chosen by the College of Cardinals in Conclave in the Sistine Chapel. The 115 cardinal-electors, meeting in strict secrecy, will need to reach a two-thirds-plus-one vote majority to elect the 266th Pontiff. (Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nPope Francis bluntly criticized Catholic bishops in the US for their approach to the church's sexual abuse crisis, saying that their finger-pointing, abuses of power and playing the victim or the scold have undermined the church's credibility.\n\nThe church's credibility has been seriously undercut and diminished by these sins and crimes, the Pope said of the abuse of children by Catholic clergy, but even more by the efforts made to deny or conceal them.\n\nFrancis also said the bishops' disunity and blame-shifting have led to mistrust and pain among the church's followers.\n\nGod's faithful people and the Church's mission continue to suffer greatly as a result of abuses of power and conscience and sexual abuse, and the poor way that they were handled, as well as the pain of seeing an episcopate (body of bishops) lacking in unity and concentrated more on pointing fingers than than on seeking paths of reconciliation.\n\nThe Pope's eight-page letter to the American bishops is a mix of spiritual encouragement and blunt criticism. He urges the bishops to root their response to the abuse crisis in Scripture, and makes clear that their actions thus far have been far from ideal.\n\nHe urged the bishops to abandon a modus operandi of disparaging, discrediting, playing the victim or the scold in our relationships, and instead to make room for the gentle breeze that the Gospel alone can offer.\n\nLet us try to break the vicious circle of recrimination, undercutting and discrediting, he continued.\n\nWe will do this if we can stop projecting onto others our own confusion and discontent, which are obstacles to unity, and dare to come together, on our knees, before the Lord…\n\nWhile he did not propose specific solutions, Francis said that combating the culture of abuse, the loss of credibility, the resulting bewilderment and confusion, and the discrediting of our mission demands a renewed and decisive approach to resolving conflicts.\n\nThe Pope's letter was sent to Catholic bishops secluded this week at Mundelein Seminary in Illinois for a spiritual retreat, which was suggested by the Pope himself in September as a necessary step toward responding in the spirit of the Gospel to the crisis of credibility you are experiencing as a Church.\n\nAbout 250 bishops are attending the retreat, which ends January 8, according to a spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nAt Mundeline Seminary in Chicago on retreat with US bishops.

Adoro te devote, latens Deitas pic.twitter.com/kVtjOpYXOJ — Thomas Wenski (@ThomasWenski) January 3, 2019\n\nFrancis said he wanted to join the bishops but couldn't because of logistical reasons. Instead, he sent Capuchin Friar Father Raniero Cantalamessa, the preacher to the papal household. No ordinary business will be conducted during the retreat, according to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nFrancis' letter comes in the wake of a devastating year for American Catholics. A prominent cardinal resigned in disgrace, grand jurors accused hundreds of Catholic clerics of secretly abusing children and a former Vatican ambassador urged the Pope himself to step down.\n\nAnd the clergy sex abuse scandal shows no signs of abating, with a federal investigation and probes in at least 12 states and the District of Columbia in the works.\n\nThe Pope has convened a meeting of bishops from around the world in Rome February 21-24, saying he wants the church to tackle the scandal together.\n\nBut first, Francis said he wants the American bishops to pray and think about the abuse crisis, before they figure out the next steps forward.\n\nCredibility, Francis said, cannot be regained by issuing stern decrees or by simply creating new committees of improving flow charts, as if we were in charge of a department of human resources.\n\nThat approach, according to the Pope, risks reducing everything to an organization problem.\n\nBut the church's loss of credibility has also raised painful questions about the way we relate to one another, he said.\n\nClearly, a living fabric has come undone, and we, live weavers, are called to repair it.\n\n00:10 - Source: CNN This video is no longer available This video is no longer available. We apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nThe repairs the Pope suggests require a new approach to management, but also a change in our mindset, our way of praying, our handling of power and money, our exercise of authority and our way of relating to one another and the world.\n\nAny approach to the abuse crisis that does not blend spiritual insights with pragmatic steps will be doomed from the start, Francis said.\n\nWithout both, everything we do risks being tainted by self-referentiality, self-preservation and defensiveness.\n\nCardinal Daniel DiNardo, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said in a brief statement that the bishops carry with us these days the pain and hope of all who may feel let down by the Church.
Special Event Joint Committees Deliver Opening Statements at Congressional Hearing on Firestone Recall Aired September 6, 2000 - 1:41 p.m. ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. LOU WATERS, CNN ANCHOR: We are covering the testimony about to be heard up on Capitol Hill before two House subcommittees. Opening statements are now being heard in the committee room. John Dingell from Michigan has the floor. Let's listen. (JOINED IN PROGRESS) REP. JOHN DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN: ... Bridgestone/Firestone announced August 9 as the second largest tire recall ever. It is surpassed only by Firestone's recall of 14.5 million tires in 1978. The recall in 1978 lead to hearings where this committee disclosed many of the same problems that are involved with the recall today. Then, like now, tread belt separations on Firestone tires were involved in accidents causing serious injury and death. Then, like now, many of Firestone's problems related to its client in Decatur, Illinois. The recent recall came about only after Ford Motor Company, whose vehicles were equipped with many of the recall tires, was given access to Firestone's claims data in late July, and was able to link 46 deaths and a large number of claims to accidents involving three 15- inch models of Firestone tires: ATX, ATXII and Wilderness AT. Since August 9, the number of fatalities attributed to these tires has grown to 88, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Time, then, is of the essence. I do note that after my letter of August 11, Firestone agreed to speed up its recall by reimbursing consumers who had replaced their tires with those of a competitor. More is riding on this hearing, however, than the reputations of Firestone and Ford. Countless Americans are on the road today picking up their kids, driving to work, and the last thing that should worry them is the quality and the soundness of their tires. It is unconscionable that so many have been placed in this kind of situation. Today, almost one full month after the recall was announced, neither Firestone nor NHTSA, the government agency responsible for tire safety, has been able to identify why these tires are failing and why serious accidents are occurring. Consumers, therefore, have justifiably expressed a great deal of concern for their safety and for that of their loved ones, as well as a lot of frustration about the way this story has unfolded. Every day there seems to be some new disclosure, fostering apprehension that Firestone may not yet have control of the problem. The concern was compounded by a recent full-page ad placed by Firestone in major countries -- in major papers around the country assuring consumers that it acted appropriately but acknowledging it does not know what's causing the tires to fail. In order to restore public confidence, Firestone must identify the root cause of its failure problem, and quickly and fully disclose their findings. Consumers can also take little comfort from Firestone's explanation of why it took so long to identify the Firestone failure problem. According to Firestone, the problem eluded them because manufacturers never properly analyzed data and personnel claims to identify defects or problems with tires. They say the university of claims data is simply too small. But a staff examination of the records, revealed since 1995 Firestone had reports on more than 1,600 lawsuits, property claims and personal injury claims involving their recalled tires. I must say I find it curious that Firestone did not regard 1,600 claims as significant when it took only 21 claims for State Farm Insurance Company to decide that a potential problem existed. Records available to the committee also indicate that some in Firestone, in apparent contradiction of its statements to committee staff and others, analyzed their claims dated 1998. These Firestone analyses show that the claims were especially high for ATX tires, and the claims were highest for tires produced at the Decatur, Illinois, plant. Contrary to Firestone's other assertions, at least one other American tire company, Goodyear, says it routinely looks at all its customer data, including claims data, to identify defect or failure trends with its tires. Whatever else we learn at the hearing today, we hope that we will find that all involved will find the need for more open and detail communication regarding these critical products and how they perform in the field. If it is industry practice not to share claims with automakers, then it is time for that practice to change, by statute or otherwise. Had the Houston television station not run the story that we've seen today, perhaps we would not be discussing these matters. As to NHTSA, we need to know that its resources are adequate; that it can effectively perform its important safety work. If budget cuts and other restrictions placed on that agency prevent it from protecting the public, then this committee should seriously look at increasing the budget and freeing the agency from constraints. It is also entirely appropriate at a time like this to evaluate whether NHTSA's statutory authority is sufficient, and I trust we will hear about this as we go forward. Again, Mr. Chairman, I thank you and Chairman Upton for holding this hearing, and I look forward to the testimony of the witnesses. WATERS: John Dingell, whose Michigan district includes Ford headquarters. Ed Garsten up there in Detroit. Ed, I understand you talked to Mr. Dingell recently? ED GARSTEN, CNN DETROIT BUREAU CHIEF: I did, indeed, Lou, last week. In fact, I sat in his townhouse, which is roughly one mile from the world -- Ford world headquarters, and I asked him, I said, you know, how can you be impartial in this when Ford is in your district? He said, my concern is for safety of all motorists, I'm not a defender of Ford. Although you might have noticed, Lou, I don't think that I heard the word Ford or Ford Motor Company... WATERS: You did not, no, you did not. GARSTEN: ... in his entire statement. And he has said all along, and he said flatly to us, that he puts the blame squarely on the part of Bridgestone/Firestone and on the NHTSA for the problem here with the tires. WATERS: And he mentioned NHTSA and their regulatory power and maybe might have to be enhanced by legislative action of some sort. Do you expect that that might be the case? GARSTEN: Well, that may be the major outcropping of this whole investigation aside, of course, from finding out, perhaps, why this all happened. But they certainly -- the agency certainly either didn't feel that it wanted to act or that it should act, or just didn't do anything, got the data and either didn't analyze it or act on it properly in this. So you may very well find that this becomes an agency with a lot more power. Now, you also have to remember, Lou, that this is an agency that got its new administrator only a couple of weeks ago, so it's in a period of transition at this point still. WATERS: And there'll be a lot of answers: I don't know or we didn't have to know and there was no regulation suggesting that a report had to be made about this, that or the other thing? GARSTEN: Sure. And if no one points it out, if no one tells NHTSA that, hey, we've got a big problem here, we need you to act, lots of times they won't. They've got all sorts of cases and you have to remember, too, that NHTSA is also quite dependent on reports from motorists. This is their lifeblood. They can't act on something if they don't know about it. They may say that this problem is underreported by consumers and it just didn't seem like there was a trend here at all that they needed to act on. WATERS: All right, Ed Garsten up there in Detroit. And now in the committee room, the chairman of the subcommittee on oversight investigation, the Republican from Michigan, Fred Upton has the floor. (JOINED IN PROGRESS) REP. FRED UPTON (R), MICHIGAN: ... to ask tough questions of the witnesses to further illuminate what can be gleaned from the information with hopes of what we do here today can help save lives tomorrow. I would like to note that I'm not happy to learn that Secretary Slater apparently has refused to participate in this hearing today despite him being just down the street. As secretary of transportation, it is his responsibility to oversee NHTSA's role in the life and safety for Americans traveling on Americans' highways. This is the people's business, and if he can be with Cokie Roberts on the Sunday talk shows, he certainly ought to be here before Republicans and Democrats searching for the truth on a workday. I want to thank Chairman Tauzin for his efforts in holding this joint subcommittee today, and Chairman Bliley as well. I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses and the answers to our questions. And I yield back the balance of my time. REP. BILLY TAUZIN (R-LA), CHAIRMAN, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, TRADE AND CONSUMER PROTECTION SUBCOMMITTEE: Thank very much the gentleman. And the chair now yields to the designated minority representative of the Oversight and Investigations Committee, the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Stupak. REP. BART STUPAK (D), MICHIGAN: Thank you. Mr. Chairman, and thank you for holding this very important hearing. I hope it is the first of several to look into the tire safety issue. Twenty-two years ago, this committee held four days of hearing on the first incident of tread belt separation in radial tires. The tire was the Firestone 500, a radial developed for passenger vehicles. Although the 500 had a very high rate of failure at the time of the hearings -- there were 15 deaths and 16 injuries, ultimately 41 deaths resulted -- in contrast, there are already 88 fatalities attributed to the tread belt separation in the Firestone ATX series of tires we are looking at today, and the number continues to grow. The reason: This tire's placed on a sport utility vehicle, a vehicle which has a tendency to roll over when a tire fails. The tire failure is one of the top three most serious vehicle safety defects we've ever seen in this country. It is surpassed only by the deaths and injuries that resulted from the Ford Pinto rear-mounted gas tank and a GMC pickup externally mounted gas tank. Unfortunately, many things have not changed since 1978. Firestone, then as now, has found no manufacturing or design defect, but blames the consumer for every single failure. Firestone alleges that consumers drive too fast, under-inflate their tires, drive in hot climates, overload the vehicle, and don't do proper maintenance Then, as now, Firestone Decatur plant showed up as a source of an unusual amount of failing tires. Then, as now, Firestone cannot explain why other brands of tires don't have the same failure rate. Then, as now, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, NHTSA, standards for tire strength were and are grossly inadequate. In fact, they have not changed those standards since 1968, long before there were steel-belted radials and the popular sport utility vehicles. There are a few new wrinkles. This time, the tires are found mainly on one company's vehicle: the Ford Explorer SUV and light trucks. And Firestone has two new factors to blame: hot climates, which stress its tires, and high ozone, which degrades its tires. The other change is that Ford, until recently, had agreed that -- with Firestone, that there was nothing wrong with the tires. Ford made these statements despite receiving more and more complaints from their dealers who were wondering why only Firestone tires failed. Mr. Chairman, we're going to hear a lot today about Firestone didn't know there was a problem, Ford didn't know there was a problem, NHTSA didn't know there was a problem until a Houston television station told them there was. The documents the committee has received, along with the news reports, indicate that all these parties knew a great deal more in 1998 and 1999 about tire failures than the Houston television station did. They just ignored it. We also are going to hear from a number of witnesses that the number of failures was so small that no one could have been expected to pay attention. Yes, the numbers begin small, but because the propensity of the SUVs to rollover when a tire fails, the cost in deaths and injuries was inordinately high and increasingly at an alarming rate. Both Ford and Firestone should have known and should have watched this particular vehicle more closely. With less than 6,000 vehicles in the entire country of Saudi Arabia, there were 18 accidents in Saudi Arabia, including seven fatalities in 1999. The U.S. had four. And there was another large group in Venezuela. Despite what anyone says about the conditions in all these countries, one fact remains: Other tires under same conditions did not fail. That should have alert everyone. It alerted the State Farm Insurance Company, it alerted the Center for Auto Safety. Unfortunately Ford, Firestone and NHTSA failed to act. Mr. Chairman, if we cannot depend on Ford and Firestone to tell us what happened, the American consumers are tired of hearing Firestone blame its customers for the problems found in their tires. American consumers are tired of hearing Ford blame Firestone. Consumers don't want to go out and buy four tires and ask the dealer to throw in a vehicle; they buy a vehicle and the tires are part of that vehicle. Today I'm going to ask Firestone and Ford to join with me in calling for and cooperating with an independent review of these tire failures worldwide to determine the cause of the failure and to propose solutions and report back to this committee and the public by the end of the year. In the meantime, I believe the recall should be widened to include all 15- and 16-inch Firestone tires, as has been done in Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. We here in the United States deserve to be treated no differently than people in other parts of the world. We deserve an answer to the many questions that will be raised here today. I'm afraid that Firestone, Ford and NHTSA can't find the answers. Let's join together to call for and support a fully independent review of this situation so that we can find the answers. The public deserves an answer, this committee deserves an answer, and most of all, the families of the 88 people who've lost their lives deserve an answer. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. TAUZIN: I thank the gentleman. The chair is pleased now to welcome the vice chairman of the Telecommunications, Trade and Consumer Protection Subcommittee, the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Oxley, for an opening statement. REP. MICHAEL G. OXLEY (R), OHIO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We are here for a hearing on the most serious of issues: highway safety. Every day, drivers rely on their vehicles and tires to carry them to destinations a mile or hundreds of miles away. They want to get where they're going and back safely. And the encouraging fact is that fatality rates have fallen in relation to vehicle miles traveled. Today we confront something out of the ordinary: a proportionally high number of accidents, some of them tragically fatal, principally involving Ford Explorers and Firestone tires. So the job of the two subcommittees here today to make sure that drivers and their families feel secure. My hope is that the Commerce Committee will be able to look at the Firestone recall situation in the detail it deserves. What caused these accidents? Was there a trend that could have been identified much earlier? What needs to be done in response? There will be questions about engineering, product quality and data review today. A full review of highway safety should eventually take driving behavior into account as well. The challenge for these subcommittees is to dig beneath the headlines of the last month and the events of the past few years because if the answer is too easy, the question probably wasn't good enough. I extend a welcome to our witnesses, and I particularly note the presence of Ford President Jacques Nasser, and the CEO of Bridgestone/Firestone, Mr. Ono. You can't write the history of the automotive industry without the names of Ford and Firestone and the advances from the Model T to the cars of the new millennium that they have been part of. The first thing that I'm looking for is assurances that every driver is being protected. Suspect tires must be replaced now. Tire manufacturers are boosting production to help fill the current shortfall, and the exchange terms for consumers should be hassle-free. The replacement program must also be fair nationwide. Vehicle owners in states with relatively low accident rates, like Ohio, have the same right to new tires as people who live in states where there have been more incidents. Experts are already at work trying to determine what caused the problem and whether it is a single cause or many. Why? is one question. When? is another. Why weren't any trends detected earlier? I find it remarkable that NHTSA did not follow up on findings made by a researcher for the nation's largest auto insurer, State Farm, all the way back in 1998. Recalls of this magnitude inevitably prompt a review of regulations and practices. I suspect that there will be heightened cooperation within the automotive and tire industries from now on. The regulatory question to ask is whether agency resources have been put in the right place, and whether regulators are focusing their attention on the most important issues. We should also resolve to do the most good for the consumer, by putting agendas aside and responding on the basis of the facts as they emerge. I was disturbed to find a web site called, quote, The Firestone Tire Recall Legal Information Center, end quote. This seemed to be more devoted to finding cases for trial lawyers than for providing assistance to consumers. There will be some hard questioning today, and properly so. The Commerce Committee has a long tradition of oversight in the public interest. We must put safety first. I look forward to our witnesses and the questioning that will follow. And I yield back. WATERS: Congressional hearing getting under way up on Capitol Hill with opening statements by members of two subcommittees. We're expecting to hear from witnesses who you've seen shots of along the way here. They include Sue Bailey, who is the administrator of NHTSA, the new administrator of NHTSA, the Bridgestone/Firestone CEO, Masatoshi Ono and the Ford CEO, Jacques Nasser. We'll also be hearing from a spokesman for State Farm and the Center for Auto Safety this afternoon.

Vertical University's highest campus will be at 4,600 meters (15,091ft), halfway up Kanchenjunga, the third tallest peak in the world. To finish construction of all the campuses Vertical University needs to secure funding. Its main source of money is via crowdfunding.\n\nIts lowest campus is situated in the wetlands of the Koshi Tappu wildlife reserve, a birdwatcher's paradise.\n\nEventually, Vertical University hopes to consist of six different campuses, all in different climatic zones, to teach students about Nepal's various landscapes. Here, the Kurule Tenupa campus is under construction.\n\nVertical University often puts on cinema nights for rural communities, showing films that aim to raise environmental awareness. Here they showed a documentary on pangolins in Yangshila.\n\nStudents learn about pangolins, a critically endangered species in Nepal, due to a combination of poaching, illegal trade and loss of habitat.\n\nA group of students take part in an exercise about forest interrelations in the Pragati Chowk learning ground, Yangshila.\n\nWithin the learning grounds, Vertical University aims to teach 195 place-based modules, such as the water cycle or wetland filtration.\n\nSo far, Vertical University has protected 300 acres of land in the form of 33 learning grounds. This benefits endangered species such as pangolins, snow leopards and red pandas.\n\nVertical University aims to sensitize students to the environmental challenges surrounding them. They believe a direct, sensorial form of learning is more impactful and engaging than typical rote learning.\n\nNepal's diverse habitats are home to a vast range of animals, from elephants and rhinos, to tigers and snow leopards.\n\nSome farmers teach the use of medicinal plants to the next generation. Here a farmer holds the medicinal plant ghodtapre, traditionally used to treat skin irritation.\n\nVertical University's curriculum is based on indigenous knowledge, and its professors are local farmers, herders and fisherman.\n\nGanga Limbu (front) is a youth fellow for Vertical University. Since beginning work for the project three years ago, she has been trained in conservation, filming, computing and design.\n\nVertical University, an education project in rural Nepal, was set up in 2015, with the aim of teaching students about nature and biodiversity.\n\nStory highlights Vertical University aims to educate kids in rural Nepal Project also looking to preserve environment Students pursue outdoor learning to teach them about surroundings\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThree years ago, Ganga Limbu could see little future beyond her hometown in eastern Nepal.\n\nOne of eight siblings brought up in the rural, mountainous district of Dhankuta, Limbu was the only member of her family to finish secondary school. Yet her thirst for learning was cut short as she was unable to afford further education.\n\nHer options appeared limited to getting married, like her two sisters, or following her five brothers into agriculture and truck driving. Neither route appealed to her.\n\nIt was then that Limbu heard about Vertical University, a crowdfunded education project set up in 2015 to equip people like her with the skills to conserve the natural habitat and native species of eastern Nepal.\n\nPHOTO: Courtesy KTK-Belt Ganga Limbu on a visit to the future site of a Vertical University campus.\n\nThe initiative was looking for youth fellows to help lead the project. Limbu, aged 21 at the time, applied.\n\nHer determination was clear from the moment she met Priyanka Bista, co-founder of KTK-Belt, the non-profit that runs Vertical University. During an interview, Bista asked her what she wanted to learn. AutoCAD, Limbu replied – referring to the computer-aided design software.\n\nI was amazed that this girl from the village had the kind of ambition to learn about computers, Bista says.\n\nJust two years on, Limbu leads video production for the project, has cataloged hundreds of plant species using a GIS mapping software, learned to speak English, and secured a scholarship to complete a university degree.\n\nNow I am independent, I am self-confident, I am hard-working, Limbu says defiantly.\n\nBreaking societal barriers\n\nSchool attendance in rural Nepal is lower than in cities. Just 61% of children born in the countryside have attended secondary school compared to 71% of urban children, according to 2016 survey data from Nepal's Ministry of Health.\n\nRajeev Goyal, who founded KTK-Belt with Bista, says such statistics are the result of an education system that offers little practical agricultural learning – despite rural families making up 81% of the population.\n\nHowever, Dr Hari Lamsal, a government spokesperson on education and joint secretary at Nepal's Ministry of Science and Technology, told CNN in an email that the country aims to provide education that is both practical and relevant for all students. There are examples of successful schools in both urban and rural Nepal, he added.\n\nPHOTO: Courtesy KTK-Belt Nepal may look like a small country on a map, especially when compared to its neighbors China and India, but it covers six climatic zones ranging between 220ft and 28,000ft above sea level. PHOTO: DIPTENDU DUTTA/AFP/Getty Images Vertical University -- an education project that aims to teach rural students about biodiversity and the environment around them -- is designing six university campuses to be situated in each climatic zone, from Nepal's tropical plains to the Himalayas (pictured). PHOTO: Courtesy KTK-Belt These are nothing like typical university campuses. Each design embodies sustainability and actively works to safeguard the surrounding ecosystem. In Koshi Tappu (220ft above sea level), the campus architecture is responsive to flash flooding, a major issue in the plains. PHOTO: Courtesy KTK-Belt The Yangshila campus (590ft to 6390ft) has been designed to have vertical gardens and seed banks to help secure food supply when there are landslides. Vertical University has already piloted the outdoor education program with sixth graders in Yangshila, taking students out of school a day a week to teach them about the water cycle, recycling and other issues.

PHOTO: Courtesy KTK-Belt The Thudam campus (12,460ft) will be portable and move with yak herders, providing the necessary support for them to cultivate medicinal plants. PHOTO: Courtesy KTK-Belt In Lelep (15,091ft) and within view of the world's third tallest peak, Kanchenjunga, the campus will generate data about what is happening to glaciers and demonstrate how to confront glacial lake outburst floods. Vertical University estimates that all campuses will completed within three to five years, costing between $1.5 and $2 million. The project is dependent on crowdfunding. Prev Next\n\nThrough Vertical University, Goyal hopes to encourage more rural students to stay in school by introducing a type of informal, outdoor education that will develop skills they can apply to their everyday circumstances.\n\nIn Nepal, there are six different climatic zones, for which Vertical University plans to have a corresponding campus. These will stretch from wetlands just 67m (220ft) above sea level to a facility at 15,091ft, in the shadow of Kanchenjunga, the world's third highest peak.\n\nSo far, the KTK-Belt team has completed the Tamur campus in the village of Kurule-Tenupa (which focuses on the tropical and subtropical zone between 980ft to 5,250ft above sea level), and is currently raising money to build an ornithology campus in the Koshi Tappu wildlife reserve (220ft above sea level). By 2021, the aim is to have completed all six campuses.\n\nThe project also works with various state schools located in the tropical foothills of Yangshila, conducting lessons outdoors a day a week on subjects such as the water cycle and plant taxonomy.\n\nSchools in Singapore, England, New Zealand and Canada have trialed similar outdoor learning initiatives, with some success. Hartley Banack, a lecturer in outdoor learning at the University of British Columbia, Canada, explains that the method can help improve the health and well-being of students, while making the learning process more memorable, and – most importantly – connecting children with their surrounding environment.\n\nPHOTO: Courtesy KTK-Belt Students birdwatching during the outdoor education program\n\nEnvironment under threat\n\nIn Nepal, understanding the landscape is vital.\n\nNatural resources are the basis of almost 90% of the population's livelihoods and represent 40% of GDP, according to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). But the UNDP also suggests that unsustainable development is endangering these resources.\n\nDue to building and road construction, Nepal lost 24.5% of its forest cover – around 1.2 million hectares – between 1990 and 2005, according to data gathered by Mongabay, an environmental science and conservation news service.\n\nThe harm is not only physical – indigenous knowledge on plants and species that has been passed down through generations is also in danger. Vertical University aims to preserve this expertise by employing local farmers, herders and fishermen as teachers.\n\nPHOTO: Courtesy KTK-Belt Local farmers are employed as teachers\n\nEighty-six-percent of Vertical University's staff belong to indigenous minorities and work in the villages they are from, according to KTK Belt's latest annual report in 2016.\n\nThese local people may lack formal education, but they have deep, inter-generational knowledge about their landscapes, says Goyal.\n\nThrough Vertical University they are able to share this wisdom. Now, kids who love their own landscape, who love trees, who love birds, are starting to think twice about development, says Bista.\n\nTake Limbu, for example. I grew up playing in the forest, listening to the sounds of birds and the river, watching varieties of natural flowers and colors, she says. But while at school, there was no interaction between students and the environment.\n\nEven though we were surrounded by nature, we didn't know the importance of it, she says.\n\nThanks to the opportunity to study, that has all begun to change.
(CNN) It's been a deadly year, and that's not just due to Covid-19 .\n\nDespite less activity outside with the closing of businesses and schools, 2020 saw a dramatic increase in homicides.\n\nBetween January and October, there was a 29% increase in homicides compared to the same timeframe in 2019, according to a November report from the National Commission on Covid-19 and Criminal Justice . As of December 27, some of America's largest cities saw dramatic increases as well, including Chicago (55%), New York (41%) and Los Angeles (30%).\n\nThe increase was due to a number of factors, criminology experts told CNN. The pandemic closed schools and businesses, leading to unemployment. This meant children and unemployed adults were stuck at home, which led to skyrocketing stress and anxiety levels, especially in lower-income homes.\n\nThe virus also changed the way police officers do their jobs -- because of illness and social distancing -- which in turn led to fewer officers on the streets in areas that needed crime prevention the most.\n\nI think Covid was the straw that broke the camel's back, said Eddie Bocanegra, senior director of Readi Chicago , a program that looks to aid those most affected by gun violence.\n\nIt's almost like these communities were just having their heads above the water, and then Covid hit and they just sunk, Bocanegra said.\n\nAside from homicides, other violent crimes -- aggravated and gun assaults -- spiked in the spring in summer as well. Aggravated assaults increased by 15% in the summer and 13% in the fall, while gun assaults increased by 15% and 16%, according to the report.\n\nNo connection between summer protests and homicide spike, experts say\n\nWhile homicides increased, nonviolent crimes -- burglaries, larcenies and drug offenses -- decreased because many businesses were closed and there were fewer people on the streets, the report said.\n\nHomicides began spiking in late May and early June, according to the report. This was the same time the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis sparked nationwide protests over the deaths of Black people at the hands of police.\n\nHowever, the report said the connection, if any, between the social unrest and heightened violence remains uncertain.\n\nRichard Rosenfeld, criminologist at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, told CNN the same neighborhoods that witness police violence are the same ones where the uptick in crime is concentrated. Those communities have never had a strong or positive relationship with police so it leads people to take legal matters into their own hands, he said.\n\nWe've got two forces at work. We've got the pandemic and social unrest around police violence, the combination of the two major factors form a deadly combination. That explains the abruptness and timing of the increase and the sheer magnitude of the increase (in homicides), Rosenfeld said.\n\nWhat's missing from the assumption connecting the protests and homicide spike is good hard evidence, Rosenfeld said.\n\nIn other words, protesters were not committing the crimes, he said.\n\nBocanegra, the Chicago program director, told CNN there were protests in the suburbs, but those areas did not see an increase in homicides.\n\nThose that are driving the violence, they were struggling even moreso pre-Covid, he said.\n\nGovernment needs to approach violence like Covid, experts say\n\nThe pandemic shed new light on how to combat increased violence in cities, experts told CNN.\n\nFor one, the coordination of local, state and federal governments to mitigate the spread of the virus was one not seen before in the US -- and criminal justice experts say that same approach needs to be applied to the issue of violence.\n\nViolence is symptom of the unrest and inequities we've seen for decades in our communities. We're not going to change that overnight, we need to come up with a 10- to 20-year plan, Bocanegra said. Unless we're able to think about the future generations ... we're going to continue having these conversations 20 to 30 years from now.\n\nJens Ludwig, who runs the University of the Chicago's Crime Lab, told CNN gun violence and mental health data for those between 18 and 24 go hand-in-hand.\n\nSo, if you look at the gun violence problem. That's usually concentrated among young people say, 18 to 24. If you look at the CDC data on mental health ... people 18 to 24 are showing signs of anxiety, depression, increased in substance use in response to the pandemic and trying to deal with the pandemic, he said.\n\nBocanegra said he's hopeful the country and his city of Chicago will be able to take the lessons learned from Covid-19 and apply them to gun violence. He told CNN he does wonder why there hasn't been such a response in the past.\n\nIs it because Covid didn't discriminate based on gender, creed or class? Or is it because most gun issues impact Black and Brown people and people with mental health issues? he said. Who determines what lives are worth more than others?\n\nGoing into 2021, Rosenfeld said previous years will provide guidance into the months ahead. In 2015, there was a 11% increase in homicides nationwide after the protests sparked by Ferguson that spilled over into 2016.\n\nWe may be in for an increase in homicides going into the next year, he said.
Leading Palestinian spokeswoman Ashrawi resigns from Cabinet\n\nAshrawi\n\nAugust 6, 1998\n\nWeb posted at: 6:19 a.m. EDT (1019 GMT)\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank (CNN) -- Leading Palestinian negotiator and spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi has resigned from the Palestinian Cabinet.\n\nHer decision comes just one day after Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat named her tourism minister in a new Cabinet.\n\nAshrawi was higher education minister in the previous Palestinian Cabinet, whose resignation Arafat announced in June following months of pressure from legislators angry over alleged corruption and mismanagement in the executive.\n\nArafat named his new team on Wednesday but stunned legislators by keeping ministers they had wanted fired from an expanded cabinet that included 10 additional ministers.\n\nI believe when people called for change they didn't ask for additions. They asked for change in the...status quo, but what we see now is maintaining what existed (and) adding people to it, Ashrawi told Reuters on Wednesday after the reshuffle.\n\nAshrawi made a name for herself worldwide as the spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation to the historic Arab-Israeli peace talks launched in Madrid in 1991. Ever since, she has been a leading voice of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.

BROWN/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n(CNN Business) —\n\nChipotle, eager to promote itself as a healthy choice, tweaked its menu to fit with trendy diet plans.\n\nBeginning Wednesday, the Mexican food chain will begin offering Lifestyle Bowls, a new collection of meals that fit into paleo, ketogenic and Whole30 diets.\n\nThese first-to-category, diet-driven menu offerings are helping those who have committed to living a healthier lifestyle by making it easy to order delicious bowls that only contain the real ingredients permitted by certain diet regimens, the company said in a statement.\n\nThe new bowls can be ordered on Chipotle's (CMG) app or online. The items consist of ingredients already on the menu, so walk-in eaters can also order the bowls.\n\nThe diet bowls include:\n\nWhole30 Salad Bowl: Romaine lettuce, carnitas, fajita veggies, tomato salsa and guacamole\n\nPaleo Salad Bowl: Romaine lettuce, barbacoa, fajita veggies, green salsa and guacamole\n\nKeto Salad Bowl: Romaine lettuce, carnitas, red salsa, cheese and guacamole\n\nDouble Protein Bowl: White rice, black beans, chicken (full portion), steak (full portion), red salsa, romaine lettuce and sour cream\n\nAll three of these diets follow strict rules and are growing in popularity.\n\nThe ketogenic diet includes low-carb, high-fat foods that force the body into a state of ketosis — when you burn fat, instead of carbohydrates, for energy. Whole30 cuts out sugar, grains, dairy and legumes for 30 days, and paleo is modeled after eating habits in the paleolithic era.\n\nThe move toward diet food is another step in Chipotle's reinvention, as it works to recover from a series of health scares at its restaurants.\n\nThe new bowls are latest change under CEO Brian Niccol, the former head of Taco Bell, who has turned the restaurant around after a number of people got sick during multiple outbreaks of foodborne illness in recent years. The most serious was an E. coli outbreak in 2015 that sickened 60 customers in 14 states.\n\nIn 2018 the company closed 2,000 locations to retrain staff on food safety.\n\nChipotle stock skyrocketed 40% last year and is one of the top-10 performers in the S&P 500 since Niccol joined. He also started testing a slew of new items, like milkshakes, beefed up its digital offerings and launched a new advertising campaign.
What Biden and Trump's interviews reveal about their target audiences\n\nWith Trump out of office, how often will he be fact-checked?\n\nThis is what prompted The New York Times to reach out to Gov. Cuomo's second accuser\n\nNEW YORK, NY - JULY 23: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo speaks during the daily media briefing at the Office of the Governor of the State of New York on July 23, 2020 in New York City. The Governor said the state liquor authority has suspended 27 bar and restaurant alcohol licenses for violations of social distancing rules as public officials try to keep the coronavirus outbreak under control.

Under the cloud of a partial federal government shutdown, Pelosi reclaimed her former title as speaker and her fellow Democrats took control of the House of Representatives for the second time in eight years. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN Business) —\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the Reliable Sources newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.\n\nSoon after Nancy Pelosi took control of the House, she issued an official invitation to President Trump to deliver the State of the Union on January 29. But her letter to Trump began this way: The Constitution established the legislative, executive and judicial branches as co-equal branches of government, to be a check and balance on each other.\n\nSuffice to say, Paul Ryan's letter didn't say any of that last year.\n\nAll week long, Pelosi has been signaling to Trump – and to the public – that things will be very different now. When asked, in an interview with the NYT, if she considers herself Mr. Trump's equal, she replied, The Constitution does.\n\nSheryl Gay Stolberg's story also noted that Pelosi is marking her return to power with a string of events, including a women's tea, a dinner at the Italian Embassy featuring the singer Tony Bennett and a town hall-style meeting, televised on MSNBC. That town hall with Joy Reid will air Friday at 10 p.m. ET…\n\nPower shift\n\nThursday's news coverage captured the importance of the change. NBC at 6:30: Power shift. CBS: Government divided. ABC: New balance of power.\n\nThe world changed today for President Trump, Anderson Cooper said at 8. For the first time since taking office, Trump is facing the prospect of real, extensive and wide-ranging scrutiny from the opposition party led by a highly disciplined adversary…\n\nTrump's stunt\n\nOne day after the midterm election, Trump stole Pelosi's thunder with a 90-minute presser. Here's a second attempt, Eliana Johnson tweeted during the press briefing that wasn't a briefing on Thursday.\n\nLet's be clear: Press secretary Sarah Sanders misled the press corps when she tweeted at 4:07 that there would be a briefing at 4:10. She shouldn't have said that.\n\nYou're welcome here anytime, Mr. President, a reporter said as Trump walked in the briefing room for the first time.\n\nThe event was newsworthy – Trump defended his decision to force a partial government shutdown and encouraged several border patrol union officials to make remarks. Vox's Dara Lind summed up the message from the union this way: It's okay if our agents don't get paid on time, as long as we get the wall.\n\nBut it was not a press briefing, as advertised. It was a human long-form version of a presidential tweet, Hallie Jackson said on MSNBC.\n\nTrump evidently is not confident enough to take questions from the press corps right now. It's not a press briefing if you don't take questions, CNN's Kaitlan Collins said right afterward…\n\nWhen should Trump events be shown live?\n\nKatie Pellico emails: While CNN and Fox News kept Trump's surprise trip to the podium running live, MSNBC cut away. Nicolle Wallace's show explained in a tweet, If the President makes a new announcement or takes questions, we will return to the briefing. He didn't.\n\nSo which cable channel had the right approach? This has been an issue ever since inauguration weekend, when Sean Spicer came to the briefing room and condemned the press corps. CNN didn't carry his rant live that day. Oliver Darcy will have more on this issue on Friday…\n\nHow about a 10 minute delay for POTUS?\n\nA reader named Mark emails: No radio show takes callers without the old '7 second delay' to dump the caller or 'bleep' the caller. Trump desperately needs a 10 minute delay. Record the press scrum, then edit it down to salient points (if any), or just report that the POTUS went off half-cocked (again) with B.S. & lies.\n\nFOR THE RECORD, PART ONE\n\n– Jake Tapper tweeted: It remains absolutely stunning that POTUS yesterday said 'the reason Russia was in Afghanistan was because terrorists were going into Russia.

But the legislation is expected to be dead on arrival in the Senate. So the partial shutdown continues.\n\nThis standoff was summed up by two quotes on Thursday. Pelosi, speaking on the Hill, said We're not doing a wall. Does anybody have any doubt that we are not doing a wall? And VP Mike Pence, speaking to Tucker Carlson on Fox, said Bottom line, if there's no wall, there's no deal.\n\nU.S. NATIONAL DEBT REACHES NEW HIGH UNDER TRUMP\n\nThat's what one of the banners on CNN said on Thursday.

Hill: I just do what I think is right\n\nDemocratic Congressional candidate Katie Hill speaks to supporters at her election night party in California's 25th Congressional district on November 6, 2018 in Santa Clarita, California.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nWhen Katie Hill opened the heavy wooden door to her new congressional office in the Longworth House Office Building, one feeling smacked her in the gut.\n\nWell, this doesn't feel like me, recalled the freshman congresswoman from California's 25th District.\n\nSo yeah, this very formal place being my home base does feel strange, she added. I don't want to become more formal. That's not on the table.\n\nHill argues her life doesn't allow her to embrace any of the formal trappings of Washington. Raised in suburban Los Angeles, she prefers sneakers to heels. She's a Democrat and the daughter of a Republican police officer and survived a sexual assault. Socially conscious, she married a man but identifies as bisexual.\n\nThe thrust of her career has been in non-profits, as an advocate for the homeless. She also embraces the sexist criticism, known as resting bitch face, about a serious woman (like her) not smiling while thinking.\n\nThis isn't the sort of resume or life story that typically precedes a seat in Congress, but that's just fine with Hill and the voters who elected her. An unconventional woman, the 31-year-old joins the 116th Congress, the most diverse legislature in history by many measures — gender, race and sexual orientation.\n\nRefusing to change is part of the internal feedback loop in Hill's first days in Washington.\n\nSometimes in the middle of an unreal day, you just really need to hug your mom.\n\n\n\nWe're about to be sworn in. Let's do this. pic.twitter.com/8zmyMbgvb9 — Rep. Katie Hill (@RepKatieHill) January 3, 2019\n\nA grassroots candidate\n\nHill won with an insurgent campaign spurred by the 2016 election. She channeled her anger at the victory of President Donald Trump by taking aim at her congressman, Rep. Steve Knight, who voted with fellow House Republicans in May 2017 to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Who is going to run against him? Hill typed out on her social media accounts. A friend said, Why not you?\n\nWhy not, thought Hill.\n\nA year and a half later, Hill flipped the suburban Los Angeles district for Democrats. The first-time candidate had started her grassroots campaign out of a rented apartment backed by a hoodie-wearing millennial staff, chain-sipping La Croix sparkling water. The team raised more than $8 million without taking a cent in corporate or special interest money.\n\nHill won over voters as a progressive advocate for affordable housing while offering a pragmatic willingness to work across party lines for her purple district. Trying to fit into Washington is not why Hill was elected nor does it sit anywhere on her agenda.\n\nPlaying nice isn't really something that's in my vocabulary, she said. I just do what I think is right.\n\nDemanding to be heard\n\nThat philosophy may sound quaint, even naive, for Washington, but Hill believes that's the shared sentiment among the incoming freshmen congressional class.\n\nA record-setting 127 women were elected to the 116th Congress, the majority of whom are Democrats. More African Americans, Latinos and LGBTQ members now serve in Congress. The legislature also saw its median age drop by approximately a decade with its newly elected members.\n\nPHOTO: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images Katie Hill laughs as Nancy Pelosi's granddaughter reacts to votes for Pelosi to become Speaker of the House.\n\nHill is notable for her youth as well as being California's first openly bisexual woman elected to Congress. But it's the sheer size of the freshman class, at 92 new members with 46 flipped seats in the 2018 midterm election, that's politically powerful to her.\n\nTraditionally, new legislators have been expected to wait their turn while more seasoned members drove the agenda. But this time, and in this age, the newbies are demanding their voices be heard.\n\nI think we have enough power and enough strength in numbers and enough of a strong mandate from voters that we're going to be able to continue to stay true to the things that we ran on, said Hill, who was elected to the Democratic House leadership team as one of two new members representing freshmen.\n\nPHOTO: Win McNamee/Getty Images Katie Hill, right, poses with other members of the newly elected Democratic House Leadership team in November.\n\nThe result, she hopes, will be in them governing differently.\n\nA new agenda and attitude\n\nTop of Hill's agenda is focusing on a more equitable system, from health care to taxes to housing. Hill believes the biggest problem with Washington has been the billionaire class being controlled by special interest donors and ignoring the needs of the politically powerless.\n\nWe are regular, middle class people, said Hill, the now third-youngest member of Congress (behind Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Iowa's Abby Finkenauer.)\n\nWe're young. We look like and speak like the people that we're there to represent. We're not people who came up through the political process. The majority of us are first-time candidates. We're not stuck in the old way of doing things, she said.\n\nThis Freshman class is larger, younger, and more diverse than ever before and that's not a coincidence – it's a call to action.\n\n\n\nYesterday @JoeNeguse and I were elected to be the Co-Representatives to Leadership for this historic class and we are so ready to get to work. pic.twitter.com/GZv3FUElNe — Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) November 29, 2018\n\nHill spoke to CNN as she made the flight to Washington from Burbank, California, inviting us to chronicle her journey from candidate to congresswoman-elect to swearing in.\n\nA millennial, Hill embraces the sharing philosophy of her generation via social media and speaks easily with reporters as cameras roll. She's shared on Twitter and Facebook her personal stories about surviving sexual assault and an unplanned pregnancy that ended in a miscarriage. In her unconventional political ads, she went rock climbing.\n\nAs Hill checked in for the 6:45 a.m. flight, she remarked, I've never lived outside of California or traveled with so many bags. For the record, there were three suitcases.\n\nShe wore athletic clothing for the flight, noticing then, under the bright fluorescent lights of the ticket counter, that her black pants were covered in her dog's white hair. Oh well, she said, as she walked towards airport security. Her goal, she said, is to demystify Congress by bringing her voters with her on this journey and through her entire term, dog hair and all.\n\nI think what I, and many of the other freshmen have, what's kind of unique, is this sort of ability to relate to people in a different way.\n\nI left my house in SoCal and it was 37 degrees, landed in DC and it's more than 50 degrees here! What a warm welcome! ☀️\n\n\n\nCan't believe inauguration is this week — I'm so ready to get to work. 💪🏼 pic.twitter.com/UV28nRQPFO — Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) December 29, 2018\n\nIt's why on Hill's Twitter feed she's posted frequent updates on her first impressions of Washington during new member orientation, known as Congress Camp. She talked about what committees she hoped to join to best represent her district, a sprawling community with suburban middle-class families and lower-income desert communities, and doesn't plan on slowing down the tweets.\n\n'There's going to be fights'\n\nHill signed the lease at her new home – a small, no frills, two-bedroom apartment that gives off a corporate, temporary housing sensibility. It's there she caught up with her roommate and fellow freshman, Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois. Nearly the same age, the congresswomen initially give off a bubbly vibe of moving into a college dorm.\n\nYou can only have tough dinner table conversations if you first get the dinner table! 😂\n\n\n\n@LUnderwood630 is the best Ikea partner I could imagine — the true test of roommate compatibility! (And maybe our negotiation skills too...) pic.twitter.com/knACssVjXF — Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) December 30, 2018\n\nBut as Underwood talked, it became apparent that both carried the weight of their new elected jobs.\n\nI think it's going to be hard, said Underwood, who also flipped her district, defeating a Republican male incumbent. She is now the youngest black woman to ever serve in Congress. We don't walk in and everything automatically changes.\n\nI would imagine there will be confrontations, said Hill. There's going to be fights between the old guard and the new one. But I feel very optimistic that the existing leadership all want us to be part of this process. They recognize the change that's happening, and they're trying to include us.\n\nPHOTO: Kyung Lah/CNN The nameplate for Rep. Katie Hill outside her office on Capitol Hill.\n\nOn inauguration morning, a crush of cameras greeted Hill, swarming around her as she tried to enter the Capitol to be sworn in.\n\nIt feels good. It feels like we can finally get to work, she said.\n\nShe stepped into the US Capitol through the south door entrance and disappeared into the tunnel. Her cross-country journey had ended but her new role as Congresswoman Katie Hill had just begun.
Twenty million Indians just got a 50% break on their taxes.\n\nThe country's annual budget, rolled out Wednesday by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, slashes the tax rate from 10% to 5% on income between 250,000 rupees ($3,700) and 500,000 rupees ($7,400).\n\nThe change means that the roughly 20 million Indians with incomes within that bracket will see their tax liability halved next year. Indians earning less than 250,000 rupees do not pay income tax.\n\nIndians with larger incomes will also enjoy the tax break, saving 12,500 rupees ($185) each. But they will still face higher rates on income earned above 500,000 rupees. For example, the tax rate on income above 1 million rupees ($14,800) is 30%.\n\nThe Indian government hopes the concession will convince more people to pay taxes and widen the country's shockingly small tax base. Less than 2% of the country's 1.3 billion citizens pay any income tax at all.\n\nThe tax cut will be paid for with a 10% surcharge on income between 5 million rupees ($74,000) and 10 million rupees ($148,000).\n\nRelated: India's tax dodgers still hiding hundreds of billions\n\nWe are largely a tax non-compliant society, Jaitley said Wednesday. The predominance of cash in our economy makes it possible for people to evade taxes.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi launched a dramatic effort last year to reduce India's reliance on cash. In November, he shocked the country by suddenly scrapping all 500 and 1,000 rupee notes.\n\nThe move instantly made 86% of India's cash worthless and sparked chaos around the country, hitting several key sectors of the economy and dramatically slowing India's stellar growth rate.\n\nRelated: 50 days of pain after India trashed its cash\n\nThe government has stuck to its guns, saying the effort will reduce corruption and tax evasion. Jaitley described it as a bold and decisive measure in his budget speech.\n\nFor several decades, tax evasion for many had become a way of life, the finance minister said. This has bred a parallel economy that is unacceptable in an inclusive society.
Tokyo (CNN) Japan may enter a state of emergency this week as the country grapples with soaring coronavirus cases, a number of which have been linked to a new, potentially more infectious variant.\n\nSpeaking at a New Year press conference Monday, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said an emergency declaration was being considered, and would apply to Tokyo and the three neighboring prefectures of Chiba, Saitama and Kanagawa. The governors of all four regions have all urged Suga to do so already, as cases rise.\n\nlf necessary, we won't hesitate to dispatch the medical staff from Self Defense Force, Suga added, saying the government will support medical facilities to ensure they are not overwhelmed.\n\nSuga did not say when the government would make a decision, or what restrictions could be enacted. Japan's first state of emergency, declared last spring, relatively early in the pandemic, lasted more than a month, and saw schools and non-essential businesses closed.\n\nJapanese authorities are currently limited in their powers to punish those who breach restrictions, even in a state of emergency, something Suga's government is reportedly planning to change to enable local governments to force compliance.
(CNN) —\n\nSen. Kamala Harris' unique biography and unlikely political ascent might have been summed up best by a political strategist who incorrectly predicted her defeat in the 2010 California attorney general's race.\n\nThere was no way I could win, Harris writes in her new memoir, recalling the strategist's stinging words, because I was 'a woman running for attorney general, a woman who is a minority, a woman who is a minority who is anti-death penalty who is DA of wacky San Francisco.' Old stereotypes die hard.\n\nHarris did win that race (barely) and is now poised for another steep and daunting climb – this time a potential quest for the Democratic presidential nomination in what might become the most diverse and seasoned field of presidential candidates in the party's history.\n\nIn a twist of fate, what one strategist viewed as her vulnerabilities – her gender, her race and the interrogation skills she developed as a prosecutor – may now be what sets her apart in the 2020 crowd.\n\nThe California senator's memoir publishing Tuesday, The Truths We Hold, lays the groundwork by chronicling Harris' journey as the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica who grew up with a stroller-eye view of the civil rights movement and was educated in the black intellectual circles of Oakland and Berkeley in the 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nThe book is a rallying cry against what Harris views as the un-American policies of the Trump administration, alongside her set of policy alternatives. She casts herself as a champion for everyday Americans against the powerful, and she is unsparing in her disdain for the policies of President Donald Trump. She notes that after her own victory speech in 2016, she watched the returns with her husband in a state of shock, eating an entire family-size bag of classic Doritos. Didn't share a single chip.\n\nI did know this: one campaign was over but another was about to begin, Harris writes. This time, a battle for the soul of our nation.\n\nIn the years since, she continues, we've seen an administration align itself with white supremacists at home and cozy up to dictators abroad; rip babies from their mothers' arms in grotesque violation of their human rights; give corporations and the wealthy huge tax cuts while ignoring the middle class; derail our fight against climate change; sabotage health care and imperil a woman's right to control her own body; all while lashing out at seemingly everything and everyone, including the very idea of a free and independent press. We're better than this.\n\nThe memoir is also her most personal account to date of her exploration of her own heritage, her path to becoming a progressive prosecutor and her brushes with sexism as a woman in the male-dominated spheres of law and politics.\n\nShe will launch a media blitz Tuesday with appearances on ABC's Good Morning America and The View, followed by a late night interview later this week with CBS' Stephen Colbert and a series of talks about her book in Washington D.C., New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Her announcement about a presidential run is expected toward the end of this month.\n\nFor many years in California, Harris recoiled from questions about her personal life, which helped establish her image as a disciplined and cautious politician. Her first book, Smart on Crime, reflected that private veneer with its narrow focus on policy, drawing from her experience prosecuting crimes that ranged from child sexual assault to homicide in Alameda County and San Francisco.\n\nIn the new book, Harris delves far more deeply into her upbringing by a single mother who was determined to see that she and her sister Maya would grow into confident, proud black women. A mother, Harris writes, who taught them to be tough and rarely offered praise for behavior or achievements that were expected.\n\nHarris stitches together touchstones from her childhood – like her mother's pride in finally saving enough money to buy a home when Harris was in high school – with stories about her work as California's attorney general pursuing predatory lenders and holding out for a larger settlement from the big banks after the foreclosure crisis.\n\nNoting her self-doubt during that period as California held out for what ultimately became a $20 billion settlement, Harris recalled a tart message from then-Gov. Jerry Brown – I hope you know what you're doing – as well as a tense meeting with top officials at the big banks who seemed to be under the misimpression that I could be bullied into submission, she writes.\n\nIn one dramatic moment, she describes how she engaged in a shouting match with Jamie Dimon, the chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase.\n\nI was tired of feeling caged, of talking through lawyers and other intermediaries in endless obfuscation, Harris writes of her decision to call Dimon directly. I took off my earrings (the Oakland in me) and picked up the receiver.\n\n 'You're trying to steal from my shareholders!' he yelled, almost as soon as he heard my voice. I gave it right back, Harris writes.\n\n 'Your shareholders? Your shareholders? My shareholders are the homeowners of California! You come and see them. Talk to them about who got robbed.' It stayed at that level for a while. We were like dogs in a fight. A member of my senior team later recalled thinking, 'This was either a really good or a colossally bad idea.'  (The settlement was reached two weeks later).\n\nIn a series of stories, Harris explains how the people she met as a prosecutor, and later as attorney general, steered her agenda in the Senate toward criminal justice revisions, legal protections for immigrants, boosting wages for the middle class and advocating for universal health care and for lowering the cost of prescription drugs.\n\nShe notes a career high point in performing gay weddings in California after the Supreme Court struck down Proposition 8, the 2008 California ballot measure that prohibited marriages for same-sex couples. (Like Brown, who served as attorney general before her, Harris refused to defend Proposition 8 in the courts).\n\nWalking out of the Supreme Court after watching oral arguments in the case, Harris notes that day underscored her rationale for becoming a lawyer: It was in the courtroom, I believed, that you could translate that passion into action and precedent and law.\n\nThe most interesting passages of the book often tie back to Harris' family heritage and the values instilled in her by her mother, who separated from Harris' father when she was young.\n\nHarris describes her focus on immigration as a senator – including her efforts to drill Trump officials like former Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly on protections for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and children crossing the border – as being shaped by watching her mother's experience of being a target as an immigrant in America.\n\nI saw it, and it made me mad, Harris writes. I have too many memories of my brilliant mother, a breast cancer researcher who migrated from India to go to graduate school, being treated as though she were dumb because of her accent. Memories of her being followed around a department store with suspicion, because surely a brown-skinned woman like her couldn't afford the dress or the blouse she had chosen.\n\nAt times, Harris reveals a more vulnerable side that she rarely shows in public. She notes, for example, her shock and horror when she failed the California Bar on her first try, and how she almost didn't notice that her now-husband was proposing marriage because she was so caught up in what she calls the balancing act of the working woman.\n\nShe describes her nervousness changing into jeans and Chuck Taylors before she was introduced to her stepson and stepdaughter. She explains the Momala descriptor on her Twitter handle as the name she and the kids settled on because of their dislike of the word stepmom.\n\nThere are also relatable moments when she describes her anguish at missing sports matches and family milestones as she tried to balance her home life with her job in Washington.\n\nFor now, she writes that her centering ritual is the tradition of a Sunday gathering of friends and family.\n\nAs long as I'm making Sunday family dinner, she writes, I know I'm in control of my life.
(CNN) Planeloads of Americans fleeing the fast-moving coronavirus outbreak in China are arriving at military bases across the United States this week on what could be the final chartered flights.\n\nThe outbreak has infected 28,000 people and killed more than 560 in China , where it started in December in Wuhan city. Outside mainland China, it's raced across continents, infecting more than 250 people in more than 25 countries and territories.\n\nIn the US, there are now 12 confirmed cases -- the latest one reported Wednesday in Wisconsin.\n\n350 passengers taken to two bases\n\nEvacuations of Americans from Wuhan started last month as one flight landed at a base in California with nearly 200 Americans aboard.\n\nOn Wednesday, two more flights out of Wuhan arrived in California carrying a total of 350 passengers. Both planes landed at Travis Air Force Base -- between San Francisco and Sacramento -- where they were greeted with sack lunches, drinks, fruit and toys for the children on board.\n\nOf those, 178 passengers from one plane stayed at Travis while the other plane refueled before taking the others to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego.\n\nTwo more evacuation flights are scheduled to arrive from Wuhan later this week -- one headed to Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, and the other to Eppley Airfield in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nPatients in Texas will be quarantined through February 29 at two hotels on the base, military officials there said. Patients in Nebraska will be quarantined and monitored at Camp Ashland, a National Guard facility about 30 southwest of Omaha, Nebraska Medicine and University of Nebraska Medical Center said in a statement.\n\nA man makes an announcement aboard the evacuation flight that US citizens were on Wednesday.\n\nIt's unclear when those flights will arrive in the United States. Both had yet to leave China on Thursday morning, according to public health officials.\n\nThe flight bound for Omaha could arrive within the next 24 to 36 hours, officials in Omaha said. The flight headed for San Antonio -- which will transit through Travis Air Force Base -- could arrive on Friday. But officials cautioned that timing was subject to change.\n\nStaff in Omaha are expecting around 70 people while San Antonio is prepared for as many as 250, officials said.\n\nThe evacuees were not known to be sick as of Thursday morning, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials said. Their health will be monitored and checked repeatedly during their journeys, and if any show symptoms upon arriving or during the quarantine, they'll be taken to area hospitals for isolation and treatment.\n\nThis week's flights will likely be the last ones. The State Department does not anticipate chartering any planes after this week, an official said.\n\nAbout 1,000 Americans live in Wuhan, and priority on chartered flights was given to US citizens at a higher risk of contracting coronavirus if they stay in the city, the State Department has said.\n\nFour evacuees are being evaluated in San Diego\n\nAfter landing at Miramar on Wednesday, four evacuees, including a child, were taken to hospitals for evaluation after the CDC said they had a cough or a fever. Officials said they were tested for coronavirus, and the results could be ready as early as Saturday morning.\n\nThe evacuees included a 4-year-old girl and her father, who were taken to Rady Children's Hospital, Dr. John Bradley, medical director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the hospital, said Thursday. The child is asymptomatic while the father has a cough, he added.\n\nThe little girl is so bored, Bradley said, she's done with one coloring book already and is looking for more.\n\nTwo adults were taken to UC San Diego Health, according to Dr. Francesca Torriani, program director of infection prevention. They had mild coughs, Torriani said, and are not related.\n\nIf coronavirus is ruled out, the patients will be returned to MCAS Miramar to complete the 14-day quarantine. If tests come back positive, officials will consult with the CDC and local public health officials about next steps.\n\nPassengers placed on quarantine\n\nThe CDC is placing passengers arriving from Wuhan under a 14-day quarantine.\n\nPassengers aboard the first chartered flight on January 29 included diplomats and their families. It landed at the March Air Reserve Base in Southern California, and the passengers are under a 14-day quarantine\n\nBefore the quarantine, everyone aboard the chartered flights is screened for symptoms before departure and is subjected to additional screenings and monitoring aboard the flight and after landing, the State Department said.\n\nThe same applies to Americans arriving on regular passenger flights. US citizens returning from China on commercial flights are being rerouted to one of 11 airports that can handle extra health screenings. Those passengers may be subject to quarantine, according to new federal rules that went into effect Sunday.\n\nThe 11 airports -- Honolulu, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle-Tacoma, Chicago O'Hare, Atlanta, Dallas, Detroit, Newark, Washington's Dulles and John F. Kennedy International -- are locations where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has the capability to conduct medical screening.

She strides under a spotlight to the ring—graceful, radiant, powerful.\n\nTaut muscles line her frame. She is larger than life, a superhero in glittery spandex.\n\nSoon, she is a blur of dropkicks and arm drags.\n\nIt is Saturday night, a third of the way into the Reality of Wrestling TV taping in front of around 150 fans. Hyan is the white knight charged with ousting the villain. She is the challenger in a Diamonds Championship match against Kayla Lynn. She is part circus performer, part prizefighter.\n\nBefore she steps out to take this role, she's calm until the last second.\n\nRight before I get out, that's when it all hits me and I get all the butterflies, Hyan told Bleacher Report.\n\nAnd then she soaks up the electricity of the moment, something she cherishes, something she craves.\n\nVideo Play Button Videos you might like\n\nIt's the best feeling in the world. It's an addictive feeling. To go out to your music, your crowd at your home promotion, Hyan said. And I think, 'This is where I belong.' Once you get out there, you're just like, 'This is my element. This is what I do.\n\nAgainst Lynn, she absorbs a glut of punishment.\n\nHer foe hangs upside down in the corner and chokes her. A German suplex sends Hyan's head and shoulders smashing into the mat.\n\nCredit: Jeremy Kendrick\n\nTrapped in a cross armbreaker, she taps out, her story ending in defeat on this night before fans, clearly unsatisfied with the brevity of the match, chant We want Hyan! We want Hyan!\n\nIn a matter of hours, she will trade in her ring gear for slacks and a blouse. She will have to revert to being a Geico employee, marching down a management track, not the road to championship glory. She will take phone calls, not suffer suplexes.\n\nIn that world, when her fellow insurance agents find out what she does outside of the office, surprise and confusion usually follow.\n\nSome people don't get it. They ask, 'What weight class are you in?' Hyan said. They say, 'I don't see you that way. You seem really nice.'\n\nCredit: Jeremy Kendrick\n\nYou can't blame them. It's not every day that you find out the person you share a cubicle with spends their nights and weekends crashing into the canvas. It's not commonplace to realize your mellow, diplomatic co-worker hungers for the violence and theater born inside a wrestling ring.\n\nBut that's the case for the Geico staff at the company's Katy, Texas, office.\n\nThey work alongside Hyaneyoung Olvera. They work with a woman who dreams of WWE stardom.\n\nAt Geico, every time you meet a group of people, you have to do your fun facts. Everyone tells me 'Do your fun fact! Do your fun fact!' Hyan said.\n\nAnd hers is more interesting than most. She can tell them she's been training to be a pro wrestler since she was in college. She can recount the time she appeared on WWE Raw, tell them about her tryout with pro wrestling's biggest company or share what lessons WWE Hall of Famer Booker T has passed down to her.\n\nThe Grind, the Gym\n\nBooker T's name juts out from the World Gym Arena's brick wall in bold, red letters. Muggy Texas air lingers in the packed parking lot.\n\nInside, rows of folding chairs surround a wrestling ring like a mock audience. Construction equipment beeps in the distance. Wrestling students practice hammerlocks in gym clothes.\n\nThis is the home of Booker T's school and independent promotion Reality of Wrestling. This is where Hyan cultivates her dream of becoming a WWE Superstar.\n\nPhoto by the author\n\nHyan drives over an hour from Katy to Texas City to get there. She treks from her day job to this arena, racking up hundreds of miles a week. Wrestling training has been as hard on her car as it has been on her body.\n\nIt destroys my gas, she laughed.\n\nIt's a journey she's appreciative of, though. Yes, it's hot and humid, and yes, Houston-area traffic can be hellish, but she's doing what she loves. Plus, she has a sense of perspective.\n\nI used to complain about it when we first moved down here [from Clear Lake to Texas City]. Then I read Daniel Bryan's book, and he talks about Brian Kendrick driving from to San Marcos to San Antonio to train with Shawn Michaels, Hyan said. I really can't complain. It could be a lot worse.\n\nShe was still a University of Houston student when she caught a local wrestling show that sparked a life change. A fantasy camp at Booker T's Reality of Wrestling school and promotion soon followed, and Hyan was hooked.\n\nI loved it. I need to do this, she told herself during that sampling of the wrestling life.\n\nThe 20-year-old squirreled away enough money for wrestling school tuition and was soon getting bruised, sore and drained inside a wrestling ring time and time again.\n\nPhoto by the author\n\nOn this Wednesday night, Booker T shuffled around the building in sandals, jet-lagged from a trip with WWE to Europe. He saw his promotion running smoothly, the setup for the upcoming No Limits show to his liking.\n\nThat's how I like to see it, he said with a satisfied smile.\n\nHyan, meanwhile, worked with Gino, one of ROW's top stars. As wrestlers of various experience levels worked on hammerlocks and lockups on the padded floor, Gino and Hyan engaged in a mini-match in the ring.\n\nThe Latin Heartthrob flipped her onto the canvas, and she returned the favor.\n\nFlesh drummed against the mat. The ring shook and echoed with each crash. The process repeated.\n\nHyan noted there aren't as many seasoned women as there are men at ROW. So, she often mixes it up with the guys, grinding it out between the ropes with bigger, stronger sparring partners. The roster's males aren't critical enough for her liking at times, though.\n\nSometimes, they aren't as straight-forward. They're not harsh enough, Hyan said of the men.\n\nPhoto by the author\n\nBefore and after tangling with the likes of Gino, Hyan and her ROW peers have to pay their dues by way of cleaning the arena floor, setting up the ring and putting out folding chairs. It's the unglamorous side of the wrestling dream. These kinds of chores are a must for everyone.\n\nIf you think you ranked out of it, you'll be humbled, Hyan explained. No one's exempt.\n\nHyan has grown to understand this part of the equation over time.\n\nShe entered what seemed like a play land of sorts only to find out how grueling it is. Repetition comes before fame. Paydays of $50 come before checks one can live on.\n\nBooker T has seen her realize that. She's in a better position from a mental perspective knowing it's not going to be easy, not going to be all fun and games all the time. And there's going to be a lot of work, he said.\n\nHer growth has been good. It could have been a lot better, though. It could have been a lot faster, Booker T said. She had a couple of bumps in the road as far as not wanting to do the work.\n\nTwo Selves\n\nFor a good number of independent wrestlers, work has a double meaning.\n\nThere is the work one puts into pushing past all the dreamers and making it in the big leagues. And there's the work one does to pay the bills, to finance the wrestling half of one's life.\n\nWhen Hyan heads from one to the other, a transformation occurs. She must slip out of the skin she wears as a Geico employee and step into that of a pro wrestler.\n\nAt her day job, she's tactful, quiet, a friendly co-worker. I'm a pretty reserved person in my normal life. Things just roll off me, she explained.\n\nThen the lights go up at a wrestling show, and she's suddenly a fierce warrior looking to kick people's heads in. She's competitive at work, she admits, but nothing like her wrestler self.\n\nI like to be the best. And I like people to tell me I'm the best. I'm not show-offy like I am in the ring, Hyan said. I'm a lot more aggressive in the ring than I am in my normal life.\n\nTo make that switch, she has to psych herself up.\n\nBefore I go out, I will look at my opponent and start getting mad at them, for it to come easier for me, Hyan said.\n\nIt's not going from a mellow claims adjuster to an action hero of sorts that's the difficult part of her double life; it's the limited supply of time.\n\nHyan works four 10-hour shifts a week for the insurance company. When she's done and makes the trek across the Houston metropolitan area to the gym, there's usually no one left to work with. And her schedule sometimes forces her to leave wrestling opportunities on the table.\n\nWrestling is obviously my dream. It's hard giving it everything I have sometimes. Or having to sacrifice wrestling for work, she said.\n\nI can't really do Sunday shows. Or do Friday shows like other people can.\n\nShould she get a gig outside of Houston, she has to make sure everything at Geico is accounted for. I really have to talk to my managers and try to fix it all. I have to really plan ahead to make sure everything's taken care of at work, Hyan said. My vacation time gets eaten up.\n\nEven so, she is looking to venture farther from home to advance her career.\n\nI've been making more of an effort to get out of Texas and the South. Texas wrestling is huge, but I'm trying to branch out and make more of a name for myself, she explained.\n\nAt times, her worlds have crossed over. Her fellow Geico employees have come to see her perform in the ring. Everybody thinks it's pretty cool. Everybody's really supportive, she said.\n\nShe says, though, they jokingly tell her, 'We only want to go if you win.\n\nWhen WWE invited her to its marquee TV show last August, that rule didn't apply. Both her Geico teammates and the ROW locker room watched as Hyan dipped her toes in the WWE water.\n\nA Taste of WWE\n\nNia Jax is the Raw women's division's resident monster. She dwarfs the majority of her competition. Her matches often feature her flinging around rivals as if she's hoisting a garbage bag into a dumpster.\n\nAs summer was ending in 2016, WWE booked Jax to beat up a string of tomato cans to highlight her destructive ways.\n\nWhen Raw came to Houston on August 29, Hyan played one of Jax's victims. But at first, she wasn't sure if she'd get any airtime. As she waited backstage in the catering area, she saw that producers chose a jobber opponent for Braun Strowman. She didn't think the show would feature two of these one-sided matches.\n\nI guess they're not going to use me. Let me have some catering then, she told herself. I literally just finished eating some pie when they said, 'We're going to use you. Get in your gear.'\n\nHyan donned a red outfit that would look at home in a Mortal Kombat video game, and she stepped out to take her scripted beating. The powerhouse throttled the Houston native. Jax grabbed Hyan by the hair and helicoptered her across the ring.\n\nJax made quite the impression on the Houstonian. No one's ever hit me as hard as she did, Hyan recalled.\n\nPlaying the enhancement talent that night didn't bother Hyan.\n\nI knew what it was, what my role was. Booker always says, 'Know your role, play your part and do the best you can in that role.' She followed her mentor's advice. And he gave her his seal of approval.\n\nShe did everything right in that match, Booker T said.\n\nPunishment at Jax's hands aside, Hyan loved being in front of the massive crowd and being a part of pro wrestling's biggest company. It's addicting. It's very addicting. I thought, 'I have to do this again,' she said.\n\nIn February, WWE invited her for a tryout at its Performance Center in Orlando, Florida.\n\nShe instantly took notice of her competition. WWE invited a variety of potential prospects from indy wrestlers like Hyan to fashion models.\n\nWhen I first got there, I was super-intimidated by the all the models. They're models...and they're really pretty, Hyan said.\n\nThat was until it came time to do wrestling drills. The rolls, the rope-running, the wrestling moves were straight from her training in Houston. The intimidation dissipated.\n\nThis is my house. This is what I do, she told herself.\n\nAfter a day of weight training and workouts, officials had everyone dart between the ropes again and again until their limbs softened under them. You're running around every ring, and you're just dying, she remembered.\n\nCredit: WWE.com\n\nShe felt good about how it all went down. I didn't leave there with any regrets, she said.\n\nWhile she was there, officials mentioned the possibility of signing her to be a part of the women's tournament set for July 13 and 14—the inaugural Mae Young Classic.\n\nThat would be a career-changer. The recent cruiserweight and United Kingdom tournaments have turned little-known wrestlers into stars. There is no exposure like that offered under the WWE umbrella.\n\nBut whether she gets that call or not, she will forge ahead, dreaming big.\n\nWhether it's as part of that tourney, as a prospect in WWE's developmental system or as signee to a group like SHIMMER or Lucha Underground, Hyan is ready to flourish. I've grown. I've gotten a lot better than where I was. I'm confident in my abilities. I feel like I can hold my own with anybody, regardless of who they are, she said.\n\nHyan wrestles in an era that is both highly competitive and filled with opportunities for women.\n\nWomen's wrestling is soaring. WWE has embraced it in recent years, showcasing its female stars like never before, breaking ground and changing the game as a result.\n\nBooker T sees that up close each week when he does color commentary for Raw.\n\nI look at the girls on the roster today, and all of them are different in some aspect. But the one thing that's the same about all of them: They can all work like crazy. The performance is all different, but the work is all at a top, top level.\n\nBooker T made it clear Hyan has ample potential, and that she has a unique look that will help her succeed, but he also noted there are no guarantees.\n\nShe can definitely make it to the next level, but it's going to take some work—a lot of work. She has to know it's not going to be an overnight process. That's just not the way it is, Booker T said, You got to be about the work to be a star.\n\nBooker T should know. Aside from his experience as a WWE world champ, he's helped guide others to the sports entertainment giant. Former NFL defensive lineman Brennan Williams and Ember Moon, both NXT performers, trained with him in Houston.\n\nHyan strives to be next. She wants badly to return to the Raw stage.\n\nSomething tells me it's going to happen, she said with a smile.\n\nHyan (@_Hyaneyoung) is an independent wrestler who can regularly be seen at Reality of Wrestling shows in Texas City.

Bernard Looney is CEO of BP. Christiana Figueres was the former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) from 2010 to 2016 and was responsible for overseeing delivery of the landmark Paris Agreement on climate change. She is now co-founder of Global Optimism, a bestselling author and co-presenter of the climate change podcast, Outrage + Optimism. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own.\n\nWe may look to be strange bedfellows -- a global leader on climate change and the chief executive of a multinational oil company -- but we share two characteristics that the world needs more than ever: stubborn optimism and a fierce commitment to inclusivity.\n\nBoth are qualities that five years ago, at the end of 2015, enabled the world to come together in Paris and find a way forward on climate change. The Paris Agreement commits countries to reducing their carbon output, keeping global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, with efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees.\n\nNow we begin the second year of the most decisive decade in history, where concrete action is crucial to meeting the goals of the landmark agreement. Since Paris, well over 100 countries have pledged to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner. This means only emitting as much as can be balanced through absorption -- for example, by forests, peat bogs, mangroves, soil and seaweed forests -- and will require massive reductions in the emissions currently being released into the atmosphere.\n\nWith Joe Biden's inauguration as US president this month, and the expectation that the United States will rejoin the Paris Agreement, countries planning to make dramatic reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions make up almost two-thirds of the world's current emissions and 50% of global gross domestic product.\n\nArguably, the Paris Agreement has had an equally powerful effect on companies as it has on countries. In just the past 12 months, over 1,000 companies have set themselves net-zero targets. And these are not small companies. According to the Prince's Responsible Business network, 45% of FTSE 100 companies are now committed to net zero by 2050 or sooner.\n\nIf anything, companies are outpacing governments in embracing the Paris goals -- which is exactly what the world needs. Governments regulate and incentivize, but actually cutting emissions largely falls on others to implement. Companies have to do much of that -- and society has a stake in helping them. How can we accelerate that change further and faster?\n\nIf you are a job seeker, look beyond companies that haven't published clear plans for reducing carbon emissions and apply for positions at firms that are genuinely committed to making a difference -- not just ones that are already green, but companies committed to making themselves greener by aiming for net zero.\n\nIf you are an investor who wants to allocate capital responsibly, deploy it in green companies. But also use it to back the corporations looking to shift from brown to green. Support those driving real carbon cuts and implementing climate-resilient strategies.\n\nGovernments that want to achieve their net-zero ambitions while creating conditions that allow today's green companies to thrive, must find ways to make every company -- big and small -- want to be a green company.\n\nIn 2015, when countries came together in Paris, the vital lesson we all learned was that we can only move forward when we hold everyone's ability to play their part in equal regard. The agreement creates a common framework for action -- for richer and poorer countries alike -- while recognizing their different circumstances and needs. Achieving the Paris goals will take action from everyone -- not just countries, but companies, local governments and even individuals. On the road to the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference, COP26, in Glasgow in November, this lesson is paramount.\n\nBig, established companies in high-emissions sectors such as energy, transport and heavy industry have an important part to play. These companies, acting with the highest levels of integrity -- and with the backing of governments, investors and society -- have the scale and capabilities that are necessary to enable rapid and substantial reductions in emissions.\n\nLast year BP announced an ambition to be a net-zero company by 2050 and to help the world get to net zero. It also set out a new strategy for the 111-year-old company -- with aims to increase low-carbon investment 10-fold, cut oil and gas production by 40% and reduce emissions by 35% to 40% -- all by 2030. It's a bold step in the right direction.\n\nEngaging companies with the most carbon to cut is vital to meeting climate goals. They need to be part of the transition to lower and no-carbon solutions if there is to be any chance of meeting the promise of the Paris Agreement. More and more companies are looking to play their part, and the world's expectations that they will do so are high.\n\nEmbracing decarbonization as an opportunity, not a burden, has spurred many large companies to commit to achieving net-zero emissions as rapidly as they can -- for some, this is by 2040 or sooner , while other sectors are harder to abate and will need more time to do so. It's in everyone's interests to increase momentum until we can no longer count the companies involved.\n\nWith the opportunity to achieve 1.5 degrees under threat, we must keep the door to participation wide open. The world needs everyone working together on this crucial cause -- and fast.
Balance of Power Close\n\nThe party with the most seats in the Senate controls the Senate leadership. The balance of power shows which party has the most seats currently, how many seats are up for election this year (including contests with incumbents and open races), and how many each party has won on election night, according to CNN projections.
The Mood of the Voter As the race begins in earnest, the public is wary, worried -- and waiting (TIME, September 15, 1980) -- Disenchanted, but not apathetic. Caring about issues, although much more concerned about character. Longing for a strong person to trust, but fearful of strength lacking sound judgment. Leery of weakness, but edgy about brashness. All too mindful of the disappointments of the past, but seeking hope in the future. Leaning toward one man, but often out of desperation and a sense of disdain for the others. Uncommitted. Unpredictable. As the 1980 presidential campaign swings into full stride, the American voter is displaying a show-me attitude as perhaps never before: wary, worried and waiting to see how the candidates perform. This unwontedly watchful and volatile electorate has already turned the race into a highly personal, potentially nasty, intensely competitive -- and, yes, exciting -- contest. The voters who could give Republican Challenger Ronald Reagan a lead as high as 28% over President Jimmy Carter in July and then snatch it all away in August can hardly be regarded as the rock- ribbed supporters of party and candidates that flourished in days of yore. And if the Reagan rise was giddy and the Carter comeback startling, the gadfly persistence of Independent John Anderson adds even more bite and confusion. He blithely dismisses Reagan as irrelevant -- a product of the '20s -- and accuses Carter of abandoning his autobiographical guery of Why Not the Best? for a current claim of I'm not the worst. With such a tight contest now taking shape, Anderson and his appeal to the disgruntled of both parties could prove to be the decisive difference in a few key states and swing the election, most likely to Reagan. The latest public opinion poll conducted for TIME by Yankelovich, Skelly and White discloses just how close the race is once again. Carter and Reagan are deadlocked at 39% each, while Anderson's support is 15% -- precisely the level set by the League of Women Voters for him to qualify as a viable candidate and therefore earn a third spot in its crucial opening debate, set tentatively for Sept. 21 in Baltimore. Carter, who insists on meeting Reagan first without Anderson, still threatened last week not to appear if the Congressman was included. The league's directs were to meet this week to examine the range of recent poll results and decide whether or not to invite Anderson. For so early in the campaign, a surprisingly low 7% of registered voters claim to be undecided about whom they now favor. (The study was based on a national sample of 1,644 registered voters interviewed between Aug. 26 and 28. The sampling error is thus plus or minus 3% and 4.5% when comparing present trend readings with previous TIME studies.) Still, the survey discloses just how shaky those current preferences are. Fully 55% say they are not personally interested or excited about any of the candidates. Only 11% report genuine enthusiasm for Reagan; a mere 9% feel that way about Carter and 6% about Anderson. In fact, much of the support given their preferred candidates is based on voters' opposition to the others, the choices are essentially anti votes. Thus 43% of the voters who prefer Reagan say they do so because they are really voting against Carter. Similarly, 34% of Carter's supporters say their choice is based on opposition to Reagan, while a hefty 61% of Anderson's followers admit that they are motivated by being against Carter and Reagan. Though Carter and Reagan are even up in the race, the poll discloses areas of serious slippage for Reagan in important areas. For one thing, 59% of those preferring Carter claim they do so out of a positive feeling for him: they like his experience, and consider him safer in foreign affairs. Only 48% of Reagan's followers feel a similar sense of confidence in their choice's ability to get things done and to answer the need for a change. At the same time, Reagan's rating on abilities regarded as important by voters has declined. In TIME's last survey in May, 49% of those sampled agreed that Reagan was a leader you can trust, while 42% believe that now. Reagan was then considered acceptable as a President by 64%; the current figure is 54%. Voter confidence in Reagan's ability to handle the economy has dropped from an impressive 75% to 66%, and his perceived competency in foreign affairs has slipped from 72% to 63%. The Californian still worries voters on a basic level: 54% of those surveyed feel that he often does not get his facts straight, and 48% fret that he may be trigger happy. Despite these declines, Reagan still scores higher than Carter in such voter-valued categories as standing up to the Soviets, keeping our defenses strong, getting the hostages out of Iran and making Americans feel good about themselves. On other matters, voters cannot see a major difference between Carter and Reagan on such matters as who could find more jobs for the unemployed, provided moral leadership, cut back U.S. dependence on foreign oil, or avoid making too many campaign promises. Geographically, there has been a significant shift in Carter's 1980 popularity in the South. Among white Southern Protestants, Reagan leads by 48% to 39%, indicating he has made inroads among the potentially influential evangelical and fundamentalist voters who supported Carter in 1976. THis leaves Carter with a statistically insignificant 1% lead in his home territory. Reagan commands a 10% margin in the West, while Carter barely stays ahead in the Northeast and Midwest. This time the survey was deepened to poll more thoroughly in the nation's key industrial states (Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York). The aim was to detect any notable shifts in the blue-collar vote. Large-scale defections from the Democratic Party helped both Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon win the presidency and today seem vital to Reagan's prospects. So far, no real switch has been found. Carter leads by 10 percentage points among blue-collar workers, setting these states up as some of the key battleground between now and November. The survey pinpoints one group of voters still posing a considerable problem for Carter: the former followers of Senator Edward Kennedy. Despite the efforts at the Democratic national Convention to patch up the party's deep rift and Kennedy's later pledges of support for Carter, the Senator's followers now split three ways on what they intend to do: 39% say they will back Carter; 28% prefer Anderson; a surprising 22% are so disaffected that they say they will jump over the wall and vote for Reagan. That degree of party defection could cripple the Carter candidacy. The mood could well be, however, just a passing stage of postconvention blues. While the Kennedy problem lingers for Carter, the Anderson difference so confidently proclaimed by the earnest and stubborn Congressman from Illinois has not really faded either. If Anderson were to drop out, 37% of his present share of the voters say they would switch to Carter, 28% would go to Reagan and 26% claim they would not vote at all. With Anderson out, Carter narrowly leads Reagan in the nationwide popular vote, 44.5% to 43%. However, the sampling did not examine just how Anderson has scored 20% or higher in key states, such as New york, California and Massachusetts. One of the most dramatic findings of the survey came from a more indirect probing of voter sentiment -- and it looks potentially helpful to Carter. In the survey's state of the nation indicator, which measures how people feel about the way things are going in the country in general and how much confidence they have in the future, voters are becoming increasingly optimistic. While only 11% took a positive view of the nation's well-being in May, 21% are upbeat now. As the incumbent, Carter would presumably benefit from any continued upsurge in optimism, which seems centered on a belief that the economy may be revving up again. While nearly all the polls have found that the economy ranks first as an issue, well ahead of foreign affairs, the TIME study finds that, surprisingly, neither has much impact on voter preferences for the presidential candidates. Many polls reveal the voters are thoroughly confused when asked to make judgments about the candidates on most issues; the election seems much more likely to turn on personality than on policy, notes TIME National Political Correspondent John Stacks. One intriguing but as yet unexplained phenomenon that might be linked to issues is Yankelovich's discovery that 10% more women prefer Carter than Reagan. This is balanced, however, by Reagan's 10% edge among men. The vacillations in the polls make most opinion analysts and political scientists leery about how the current campaigns and their various pitches will affect the voters. Traditionally, of course, a majority of postwar voters have turned to the Democratic candidates during a time of economic recession or depression on the theory that the party of F.D.R. is more likely to use Government tools to check the decline. But now a Democratic President is presiding over high inflation and a recession. Simultaneously, Government intervention in the economy has become more suspect. Observes M.I.T. Political Scientist Thomas Ferguson: The signals coming down to the voters are incredibly mixed. There is an enormous amount of confusion even in the political parties. There is turmoil at all sectors of the electorate. Appearing on a panel of pollsters convened in Washington by the American Political Science Association, Warren Mitofsky of CBS News's election and survey unit contended that the issues carry little weight with voters intent on examining the character of the candidates. Said he: We are really seeing a loss of respect for our system of selecting our elective officials. This disenchantment with the candidates is causing voters to look at the personalities rather than the issues. In a moment of rare introspection for a presidential candidate, Anderson last week talked at length to TIME Correspondent Eileen Shields during a flight from Detroit to Washington about the dilemma posed by the nature of the politician process in 1980. I have a fundamental conflict in my thinking that troubles me deeply, he said. I know if I want to please a crowd I repeat, just as Reagan does, the tried-and-true crowd-pleasers over and over again. But I am really going to repeat in my prayers every night the hope that I can resist the temptation. You know, when Carter and Reagan are so vulnerable it is hard to resist the temptation. But I don't think that is what the campaign should be about -- or what the country wants. I can't in the end really sell myself to the country if I am just going around knocking those two. I've got to have something fresh, constructive and different to offer, and it is hard. It is so hard to stay off that other kick, particularly when Reagan shoots four out of five toes as he has done the last couple of weeks. I am not contemptuous of applause. I want people to listen. I want them to respond. I want to inspire them. But I would hope that I have a higher calling than to simply play to the lowest common denominator. Still, conceded Anderson, we are like performers. You're up and you're down. Sometimes you think of something and it inspires you and sometimes you look at your watch and you are not so inspired. More than the other candidates. Anderson can move an audience with his oratory one day, only to turn off his next crowd with a ponderous and even pontificating style of delivery. The President and the former Governor seem far less concerned about resisting the temptation that worries Anderson; they have been zapping each other with increasing zing almost daily. The attacks are deliberate. Reagan is the best standup performer in politics today says John Sears, the campaign manager whom Reagan fired last February. But the fact remains that Reagan's position in the polls is derived from what people think of Carter. Thus the central issue for Reagan's campaign will be to denigrate Carter's record. Despite his speaking skills, Reagan has of course, been too busy trying to explain away a series of bloopers either to maintain a consistent attack on Carter's performance or to attract attention to the Republican policies that he has proposed. Not only has Reagan fallen into uttering such needlessly provocative comments as advocating official governmental contacts with Taiwan, praising the Viet Nam War as a noble cause, suggesting that Darwinism be countered by teaching the biblical story of creation as well, and terming the current recession a severe depression, but his own advisers have jumped readily into the ensuing fray, like a Greek chorus of mourners, to concede in most cases that Reagan was wrong. Says Dean Burch, the senior adviser to Bush: There is a possibility that the caricature of Reagan will become a reality. We have to guard against it. While some of the impulsive Reaganisms may have pleased his more conservative supporters, they feed the doubts about his judgment that bother other voters. Thus the tense staff is trying to set up fail-safe systems to protect Reagan against Reagan. his aides are more carefully reviewing every speech text for pitfalls and insisting that the Governor just stick with the typed pages. In addition, an outside heavyweight adviser -- last week it was James Lynn, who headed Gerald Ford's Office of Management and Budget -- will ride shotgun on the campaign planes to help Reagan. The staff itself, however, remains a problem: it is still far too disorganized. Says an old Reagan friend: Ron doesn't know how to be tough with people. Sometimes he tolerates so-so performances. More emphasis and money will go into Reagan's paid TV commercials. The budget was pegged last week at about $15 million, up $1 million from original plans, and seven spots (three five-minute and four 30-second plugs) have begun to be aired. They are slotted within, before or after such well-watched family shows as The Waltons, Guiding Light, Angie and ABC Friday Night Movie. On TV, Reagan's delivery is warm, low key and artfully staged to project an air of sincerity. Contends Peter Dailey, Reagan's TV ad producer: The camera can look into the soul. In Reagan's case, that's a big asset. While he has talked repeatedly about the need for the U.S. to regain nuclear superiority over the Soviet Union, prompting Carter to accuse him of announcing that he would start an arms race, Reagan's TV pitch will be milder. Seated in an easy chair, he says disarmingly. To preserve our peace and freedom, we must maintain a margin of safety -- not numerical superiority . . . but a balance. The basic Reagan geographical strategy remains unchanged. His aides estimate his firm base in the West will produce about 150 electoral votes. East of the Mississippi, such states as Indiana, New Hampshire, Vermont and Virginia are seen as reasonably safe, giving him another 30 votes, just 90 short of election. Even if Carter should hold the Deep South, which is far from certain, Reagan will look for his victory margin in five targeted states: Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Texas and Florida. They have 121 electoral votes, and if Reagan can win just the largest three, he should wind up in the Oval Office. Thus nearly 40% of his currently scheduled campaign time (49 days of travel and 95 major appearances) will be devoted to these five states. At the moment, Reagan's aides consider his home state, California, safe enough to be downplayed a bit. New York looks fairly solid for Carter, but with the President being increasingly whittled away there by Anderson, the Californian may step up his efforts to win the state's 41 electoral votes. Anderson's prospects of taking more votes from Carter in New York will be strengthened if, as expected, he gets a place on the state's Liberal Party ballot. As for the Carter staff, it has been astonished by its candidate's catch-up last week: That Reagan is doing our work for us.' Other advisers are more cautious. Campaign Manager Robert Strauss professes to be worried that Carter's rally will generate overconfidence. Says he: I don't think Reagan necessarily is dumb. I don't think he is going to get us into atomic warfare. I don't think he is evil. He's a very likable, attractive man. But Strauss pinpoints Carter's re-election strategy: to portray Reagan as simplistic and not equipped to be President. Proud of his presidential performance, Carter intends to play up his record. Still, the President's main theme will be to attack Reagan. Sums up Hamilton Jordan, Carter's chief strategist: We can have a philosophical discussion about all the issues that face the American people, but the fact is the American people face a choice: Jimmy Carter or Ronald Reagan. Strauss long ago correctly guessed that Reagan's advisers would limit his public appearances. Says Strauss: They're going to try to show just a little bit of leg, but not enough to get him into trouble. By contrast, Carter will join the rough-and- tumble exchange of town meetings and press interviews, where he has invariably been at his best. Contends Strauss: The public likes very much to see the President in the flesh, nonstructured and nonpackaged. He likes it too. The Carter television campaign will stress his heavy responsibilities as President and portray him as being deeply concerned about the particular problems of unemployed blue-collar workers and older people. To tape his commercials, Carter has slipped quietly into a suburban Alexandria, Va., home to chat with eight housewives in a backyard. He has eluded the press to go to a construction site in Maryland to listen to workers, and he has visited a senior citizens' center in the District of Columbia. So far, the Carter travel schedule is much more flexible than Reagan's; stops are generally set for only a week or two in advance. He expects to travel just two or three days a week, holding just one major event a day -- appearances timed of maximum free TV news coverage. To cut costs, he intends to avoid overnight trips as much as possible and has asked campaign aides to double up in hotels or stay with friends while on trips. Geographically, the Carter advisers place great emphasis on the President's need to hold the South, where in 1976 he electoral votes. The Democrats know they must also win some states that Carter lost to Gerald Ford in 1976, including Michigan, Connecticut, Iowa and New Mexico. Differing with Reagan's assessment, they now see new hope of mounting a serious challenge in California, where Carter Pollster Pat Caddell has the President trailing by only eight points. Similarly, Carter will work hard in Texas, where he sees possibilities. The Carter advisers are counting on Vice President Walter Mondale to shepherd unhappy Kennedy supporters back into the Democratic fold. One recruit about to sign up: Robert Kennedy Jr., now a law student at the University of Virginia Law School. Mondale is also busily holding unity meetings to strengthen the old Democratic coalition that many experts feel will grudgingly regroup as Nov. 4 and the prospect of a Ronald Reagan presidency loom ever closer. As for John Anderson, the Carter tactic is to ignore him publicly and try to downgrade his importance. Privately, however, the White House is deeply worried about the Congressman's threat. In 1976 Eugene McCarthy, running independently, won just 1% of the vote, but the Carterites insist that was enough to tip Maine, Iowa, Oklahoma and Oregon into Ford's column. Carter desperately wants to keep Anderson out of the first debate because of the invaluable exposure it would give him. Indeed Carter's men have even suggested that the League of Women Voters hold a five-way first debate, including Libertarian Candidate Ed Clark and the Citizen's Party's Barry Commoner, to take some of the play away from Anderson. But the league turned down the proposal. The President's strategists concede that they have been boxed in by Reagan and Anderson on the debate issue; they fear public wrath if the President ducks a first debate with the other two. Anderson's chances of at least finishing the race brightened considerably last week. His cash-short campaign got relief when the Federal Election Commission ruled that he will be eligible for federal funds if he winds up with 5% or more of the votes. Although how much he could get will depend on how well he draws on Election Day, Anderson now plans to borrow $5 million, raising his anticipated war chest to $15 million. (Candidates who do not qualify for total federal funding are allowed to raise private funds to cover the difference between their eventual government grant and the full subsidy of $29.4 million.) For all the candidates, last week was a time to put the varied theories of their strategists to the test. Determined to nominate the Old Confederacy once again, Carter perspired in shirtsleeves amid some 25,000 Labor Day picnickers in a dusty, red-dirt park in Tuscumbia, Ala. He strummed all the Southern heart-strings he plays so lovingly. He enjoyed the music of Country Stars Charlie Daniels and Larry Gatlin, and shared the stage with former Alabama Governor George Wallace. He told how he had toured the Gettysburg battlefield with his friends Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin, and how it reminded him that we Southerners believe in the nobility of courage on the battlefield, and because we understand the cost of war, we also believe in the nobility of peace. Carter's not so subtle point: he has worked for arms control, while Reagan encourages an arms race. Well aware that a dozen Ku Klux Klan members were watching in silent, white-sheeted protest some 20 yds. away, Carter drew rebel applause with a deft putdown. These people in white sheets do not understand our region and what it's been through, he said. They do not understand that the South and all of America must move forward. Noting that the Klan had burned a cross in the town the night before, Carter said softly: The One who was crucified taught us to have faith, to hope, not to hate, but to love one another. A few hours later, Carter was the genial host at a far different kind of picnic: a shindig on the South Lawn of the White house for some 800 labor leaders and their wives. Desperately in need of labor support, Carter last week was rewarded with the endorsement of the diminished but still influential AFL-CIO. Yet Carter's most symbolic act of the week was a visit to Independence, Mo., where he held a town meeting in Truman High School and smiled at signs that said: HARRY WOULD LOVE JIMMY and JIMMY CARTER, THE TRUMAN OF THE '80s. He visited the Truman Library, placed red roses on Truman's grave and paid an eight- minute call on ailing Bess Truman, the former President's 95- year-old widow. When I take a step that's not very popular, Carter said at the town meeting, I think of the unpopularity that Harry Truman had to suffer before he was finally vindicated. Reagan, meanwhile, was making a strong pitch for ethnic votes in a Labor Day setting redolent of America's heritage. In New Jersey's Liberty Park, he shed coat and tie to speak before a backdrop containing the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island and the skyline of lower Manhattan. Scarlet-clad Korean girls sang God Bless America; an Irish war-pipe band in kilts played martial music from the homeland of Reagan's ancestors; and Polish dancers stepped out gracefully in their peasant regalia. Reagan's main coup was to present Stanislaw Walesa, 64, the father of the leader of the workers' protest in Poland, to the cheering crowd. Walesa, who lives in Jersey City, is not a U.S. citizen and has no political preferences. No matter. He helped Reagan by joining in a chorus of God Bless America. Reagan candidly proclaimed his reason for opeing this phase of his campaign in Hudson County, N.J. I'm here because it's the home of Democrats, he said. In this great country there are millions of Democrats as unhappy as we are with the way things are going. Honoring the generations of immigrants, Reagan, in top oratical form, once again evoked the words of a Democratic President by putting a twist on Jack Kennedy line: They didn't ask what this country could do for them, but what they could do for them, but what they could do to make this refuge the greatest home of freedom in history. But today a President of the U.S. would have us believe that dream is over, or at least in need of change. Reagan flew on to Detroit, traditional site of Labor day speeches by Democratic candidates, and visited nearby Allen Park to grill sausages in the backyard of Emil Petri, a steelworker (and a Republican) who had invited over 20 neighbors to meet the candidate. Many of the guests were laid-off autoworkers and steelworkers, the kind of blue-collar Democrats Reagan hopes to lure away from Carter. So far, so good, and then, once again, Reagan botched it. At the Michigan state Fair, he launched another attack on Carter and went too far. Now, I'm happy to be here, he said, while he (Carter) is opening his campaign down in the city that gave birth to and is the parent body of the Ku Klux Klan. Thud. By linking the President with the Klan, Reagan not only outraged Carter's supporters but offended no less than seven Souther Governors, who fired off wires protesting that Reagan had insulted the South. The President promptly jumped on the blunder: I resent very deeply what Ronald Reagan said about the South and about Alabama and about Tuscumbia. Anybody who resorts to slurs and to innuendo against a whole region based on a false statement and a false premise is not doing the South or our nation a good service. Indeed, Reagan had compounded his mistake by getting his facts wrong; Tuscumbia is merely the headquarters of a branch of the Klan. Reagan apologized by telephone to Alabama Governor Forrest (Fob) James, and once again his aides sheepishly tried to explain that their boss had not really meant what he said. All three candidates also paid homage last week to the Jewish vote that could prove critical in such states as New York, Florida and Illinois. The three pledged such rousing and unqualified devotion and support for Israel in speeches to B'nai B'rith in Washington that they all received standing ovations. Reagan's pitch was the most pointed. He assailed Carter for the failure of the U.S. to veto a U.N. resolution condemning Israeli expansionism, charged that the Carter-negotiated Camp David documents contained ambiguities that have now brought negotiations to a dangerous impasse and drew his most fervent applause by declaring that Jerusalem is now and will continue to be one city, undivided, with continuing free access for all. In turn, Carter stoutly defended his Middle East policy, noting last week's announcement that Sadat and Begin had agreed tko resume talks, and declared: There will not be one policy for an election year and another after the election. The same policy that led to Camp David and an uninterrupted supply of American economic and military aid to Israel will continue as long as I am President. But he admitted: I cannot assure you we will always agree with every position taken by the government of Israel. The tone of an increasingly acrimoniously campaign rose in pitch again as Reagan assailed Carter in the strongest terms so far. He cited recent news stories about a newly developed technique for shielding aircraft and other weapons against detection by enemy radar. Before a cheering audience of businessmen in Jacksonville, Reagan claimed this had been the most tightly classified, most highly secret weapons information since the Manhattan Project. Disclosure normally would be illegal, he said. But he charged that the breach of secrecy was blessed and sanctioned by the Carter Administration itself clearly for the sole political purpose of aiding Mr. Carter's troubled campaign. As a result, the Soviet Union has been handed a ten-year head start on developing ways to counter this type of ultrasophisticated weapons system. Defense Secretary Harold Brown angrily denied that the leaks about the defense technique were politically motivated. Responding to the Reagan blast, Press Secretary Jody Powell declared: Any implication that the President or Secretary of Defense acted in a manner which damaged the security of this country is wrong and not responsible and goes beyond the acceptable grounds of political partisanship. Governor Reagan doesn't know what he's talking about. With each candidate so eagerly on the attack so early, the 1980 presidential campaign could swing on a single event in such a volatile year. If held, the debates could turn the trick- perhaps even the very first one. But the candidates are all anxiously looking over their shoulders, wondering when lightning might strike. The Reaganites talk nervously, and sarcastically, of an October surprise, some international event that Carter will be able to exploit as the incumbent. As skirmishes ended and the battle was joined last week, Mondale summed up the long struggle to come succinctly, laconically and with a touch of world-weary realism. Six weeks and 200,000 miles to go, he said. And all of it uphill for every man in the race. By Ed Magnuson. Reported by Christopher Ogden/Washington and Laurence L. Barrett/Washington.

While Moore was surrounded by a one-for-the-ages cast, she more than held her own, including what many consider one of the greatest sitcom episodes ever, where Moore's character – after admonishing her co-workers for joking about it – breaks into uncontrollable laughter during a funeral for Chuckles the Clown.\n\nMoore continued to work regularly – in television and on stage – after those shows, while earning plaudits for her work as an advocate for various causes, including diabetes research.\n\nThe memories that linger, though, will for most stem from the glow she brought to the screen in the 1960s and '70s. And thanks to those shows, that hat she tossed skyward during the credits of her eponymous series will never come down.
Whenever someone asks me which car they should buy I almost always tell them to consider a Kia. Kia makes great looking, high-quality cars and SUVs that are enjoyable to drive and loaded with lots more features than you'd expect for the money.\n\nAnd people always look at me like I just recommended they eat a spoonful of caterpillars.\n\nUm, no, they'll say. I just... can't.\n\nKia has been enjoying rising sales, but its image as a budget carmaker for those who simply can't afford more has been hard to shake. Even a very nice luxury car like Kia's Cadenza hasn't been able to really do the job.\n\nPerhaps the Kia Stinger, a sharp-looking performance sedan just unveiled ahead of the Detroit Auto Show, will finally push Hyundai's Korean sister brand into the spotlight it deserves. The Stinger might not sell in huge numbers, but that's not really the point.\n\nRelated: Small SUVs take over LA Auto Show\n\nThe Stinger is expected to change minds, especially here in America, a Kia spokesman said. Kia has not yet announced the price, but it's expected to go on sale late this year.\n\nThe car is a rarity these days, a rear-wheel drive sedan. (An all-wheel-drive option will be available.)\n\nIt's a European-style performance car -- it was designed in Germany -- but Kia isn't claiming that it'll beat everything else on the road. It's supposed to offer a blend of performance and refinement, the sort of car you'd enjoy taking on a long drive but that won't leave you drained at the end of it.\n\nThe Stinger has nothing to do with being the first to arrive at the destination, Gregory Guillaume, chief designer, Kia Motors Europe, said in a statement. This car is all about the journey.\n\nThe car's two engine options are powerful, but not shocking by modern standards. The base car will have a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that can produce as much as 255 horsepower. The more expensive Kia Stinger GT will have a 3.3-liter twin turbo V6 capable of producing 365 horsepower.\n\nRelated: Why your SUV needs winter tires\n\nMost cars sold today are front-wheel-drive. That means engine power goes to the front wheels, which pull the car along while also turning and steering. In rear-wheel-drive cars, the back wheels push the car along the road and the front wheels just steer. That strict separation of duties -- power at one end, steering at the other -- can give the driver a greater sense of feedback and control, making the car more exciting to drive.\n\nThe Stinger will also be available with all-wheel-drive, but the all-wheel-drive system is tuned to deliver more power to the back wheels than the front. The all-wheel-drive system also uses torque vectoring, which sends more power to a wheel on one side or the other to help push the car through a turn.\n\nWhile it does have the profile of a sedan, the Stinger is, technically speaking, a hatchback. The entire rear window area lifts up revealing a cargo area that goes straight into the passenger cabin.\n\nThe Stinger will go on sale by the end of this year. Pricing hasn't been announced yet but the vehicle's cost is expected to start from roughly $35,000 to $45,000.
You've probably seen them everywhere on social media: Selfies of your friends turned into cartoonish portraits.\n\nChinese app Meitu -- which has gained popularity in the U.S. within the past two weeks -- adds colorful, caricature-like features, such as bigger eyes, tear drops and accessories like feathers and flowers, to photos.\n\nBut now the app has now found itself in hot water. It's collecting information about you for advertising purposes.\n\nIf you have an iPhone, the free app is tracking location and mobile carrier information, your IP address and generates a unique identifier to track you. It also quietly shares Android users' IMEIs, the unique code that identifies individual devices, and sends that data back to servers in China.\n\nMeitu asks for some of these permissions -- but not all -- at the time of download.\n\nRelated: Why the U.S. needs a Smokey Bear of cybersecurity\n\nHowever, security researchers say this method isn't much different than what many apps already do. The process is similar to how you're currently tracked by ads around the web.\n\nIn this case, Meitu's developers wrote a piece of code into the app, so advertisers could see who is using it and what they're viewing.\n\nMost of the sketchy things being reported in Meitu are [of] the numerous ad trackers baked into the software, which can generate revenue for the software authors, forensic expert Jonathan Zdziarski told CNNTech. It's a rather widespread problem among mobile apps and not just on any one platform.\n\nAlthough Meitu says it doesn't sell user data, other apps that collect similar information might. It's possible to change what type of data you give to apps through App Permissions in Settings on Android and in under Privacy on iOS.\n\nRelated: 14 cool tech products worthy of your attention\n\nWe've come to accept ad and analytics trackers in our mobile apps, Zdziarski said. Now, it's turning into 'crapware' that delivers a dozen or more trackers in the form of something cute the user wants to use.\n\nBecause Meitu is headquartered in China, many of the tracking and push services from marketplaces such as Apple App Store and Google Play are blocked. As a workaround, Meitu works with in-house experts and a third-party company to track and collect data securely, the company said. It eventually has plans to move its servers outside of China.\n\nAd trackers found in OS and Android apps can often create headaches for users behind the scenes. For example, they run in the background of smartphones and often drain batteries.\n\nIt's also difficult to tell if an app has a tracker without looking at the code. Verify.ly is one service that highlights security issues, the code and how apps connect with other services. It intends to help people have a better understanding of how data is collected and used.
Bill Kostroun/Associated Press\n\nBuffalo Bills wide receiver Sammy Watkins has taken a look at his bank account and apparently wants to add a few extra zeroes for himself and all NFL players.\n\nWe gotta get paid more I'm pretty sure 2014 class will change the market, Watkins tweeted Sunday.\n\nHeading into his fourth NFL season, Watkins will hit unrestricted free agency next offseason. The Bills declined his fifth-year player option on his rookie contract in May.\n\nWatkins will have to see a major uptick in performance next season if he hopes to change any type of financial market. He recorded 28 receptions for 430 yards and two touchdowns in 2016, missing half of the campaign due to injury.\n\nThe former Clemson standout has been oft-injured and inconsistent during each of his three NFL seasons. He's yet to record more than 1,047 yards receiving or catch more than 65 passes. While the Bills have had issues at quarterback, Watkins has not been the star playmaker the team hoped.\n\nWatkins is also recovering from surgery on his foot that's expected to keep him off the field until at least training camp. However, quarterback Tyrod Taylor told Jay Skurski of the Buffalo News he likes what he sees from the receiver:\n\nI would say just his maturation process has definitely sped up. He's older in the league. He knows what it takes. He knows where he wants to get and he's working toward that. Even down to eating right and putting the right things in his body. You can just tell his attention to detail each day has definitely been different than years past that I've been around him.\n\nVideo Play Button Videos you might like\n\nHe's always been a hard worker, but you can definitely tell he's out there with the right mindset and with a positive attitude trying to help the guys that are around him as well as questioning the quarterbacks and just trying to pick our brains. Just trying to get as much of the playbook down now in the learning process so when he comes back he can come out and react to it at full speed.\n\nAs for Watkins' assertion that players need to be paid more, well that's probably not going to happen. Guarantees may continue seeing an uptick relative to their predecessors, but the actual money given to players on a yearly basis will not change significantly.\n\nThe league's collective bargaining agreement guaranteed players receive a certain percentage of league revenue. No draft class of players is going to change that.
(CNN) —\n\nDays after an investigation found no evidence to support a claim of inappropriate behavior made against Ryan Seacrest by a former colleague, the long-time host has written about the experience in an op-ed.\n\nIn a column published late Monday by The Hollywood Reporter, Seacrest called being accused of misconduct gut-wrenching.\n\nTo have my workplace conduct questioned was gut-wrenching. I've always aimed to treat all of my colleagues with honesty, respect, kindness, and compassion, Seacrest wrote. Yet, I knew, regardless of the confidence I had that there was no merit to the allegations, my name would likely soon appear on the lists of those suspected of despicable words and deeds.\n\nIn November, Seacrest wrote, he received a letter from an attorney representing a stylist who accused him of mistreating her when they worked together at E! more than a decade ago. Seacrest publicly denied the claim. According to a spokesperson for E!, an independent investigation launched by the network cleared him of any wrongdoing last week.\n\nSeacrest, who hosted E! News from 2006 - 2012 and is currently the co-host of Live with Kelly and Ryan, acknowledged that the allegation against him surfaced during an unprecedented public reckoning by women in our industry and beyond, courageously coming forward to share their stories, many of them heartbreaking. These women sought to bring attention to the systemic gender inequality that has occurred for decades. I was – and am – amazed at their bravery.\n\nI absolutely want to be part of the change, the progress, that is coming. I did not want to be a postscript of evidence of its cause, he added.\n\nSeacrest also called for swift and fair reviews in cases of workplace misconduct.\n\nWe are taught early on that it's essential to see all sides, to give everyone a chance to explain and to check for exculpatory evidence that may have been missed, Seacrest wrote. At a time when improper interactions between men and women, particularly in the workplace, are part of a national conversation, we must find a way to ensure that everyone – the public, private and public institutions, accusers and alleged accused – is given the opportunity for a swift and fair review.
Hong Kong (CNN) Sitting alongside Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, World Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was effusive in his praise of the country's response to the coronavirus crisis.\n\nWe appreciate the seriousness with which China is taking this outbreak, especially the commitment from top leadership, and the transparency they have demonstrated, Tedros said , in comments that would berepeatedly quoted inChina's state media for weeks.\n\nThis was in late January, after Xi had taken control of the situation due to local officials' apparent failure to contain the outbreak to Hubei province.\n\nAs the two men met in the Chinese capital, the number of cases was rising, and revelations were emerging that officials in Hubei province and Wuhan -- the city where the virus was first detected -- had sought to downplay and control news about the virus , even threatening medical whistleblowers with arrest\n\nDays later, the WHO declared a global public health emergency, and once again Tedros praised Beijing's response.\n\nWhile China did act quickly following Xi's intervention, placing several major cities on lockdown and pouring resources into the battle against the virus, it has maintained tight control over information about the virus and efforts to control its spread have veered on the side of draconian\n\nThe WHO's praise of China's response have led critics to question the relationship between the two entities. The UN agency relied on funding and the cooperation of members to function, giving wealthy member states like China considerable influence. Perhaps one of the most overt examples of China's sway over the WHO is its success in blocking Taiwan's access to the body, a position that could have very real consequences for the Taiwanese people if the virus takes hold there.\n\nThe WHO's position regarding China has also renewed a longstanding debate about whether the WHO, founded 72 years ago, is sufficiently independent to allow it to fulfill its purpose.\n\nA spokesman for the WHO directed CNN to comments made by Tedros China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to questions regarding Beijing's relationship with the WHO.A spokesman for the WHO directed CNN to comments made by Tedros this week , when he again praised China for making us safer.\n\nI know there is a lot of pressure on WHO when we appreciate what China is doing but because of pressure we should not fail to tell the truth, the WHO director said. We don't say anything to appease anyone. It's because it's the truth.\n\nTedros added that we are giving qualified recognition and actually my call is, please, let's recognize as a world, as a globe what China is doing and help them and show solidarity.\n\nMixing health and politics\n\nThe WHO was founded in 1948 under the auspices of the still infant United Nations (UN), with a mandate to coordinate international health policy, particularly on infectious disease. Since then it has had many successes , chief among them the eradication of smallpox and a 99% reduction in polio cases, as well as work against chronic disease and tackling tobacco usage.\n\nTedros became the latest WHO director general to But in its seven-decade history, the WHO has rarely been without its critics . They argue that it is overly bureaucratic, bizarrely structured, too dependent on a handful of major donors, and often hamstrung by political concerns. Following his election in 2017, Ethiopian politicianTedros became the latest WHO director general to promise large-scale reforms\n\nThe first African to hold his position, Tedros took over following the WHO's self-acknowledged poor response to the 2013-2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. The WHO took five months to declare a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) over Ebola, a delay that undoubtedly contributed to the unprecedented scale of the outbreak, according to one academic assessment.\n\nThe failure was blamed in part on the WHO's cumbersome and complex bureaucracy -- it is made up of six regional offices which are only loosely controlled by headquarters in Geneva. Other factors blamed for the Ebola failure include an overstretched and underfunded surveillance team, and political pressure from West African governments unwilling to take the economic hit caused by a PHEIC declaration.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, a WHO spokesperson said that as a result of the lessons learned from West Africa, WHO established the new Health Emergencies Programme , which was a profound change, adding operational capabilities to WHO's traditional technical and normative roles.\n\nThe program is designed to bring speed and predictability to WHO's emergency work, the spokesperson said. It brings all of WHO's work in emergencies together with a common structure across headquarters and all regional offices in order to optimize coordination, operations and information flow.\n\nTedros Adhanom, Director General of the World Health Organization, attends a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People, on January 28, 2020 in Beijing, China.\n\nBut while Ebola may have highlighted some issues, experts had been sounding the alarm for years. In a 2014 report , former WHO consultant Charles Clift wrote that most observers -- including many former insiders -- agreed that the organization is too politicized, too bureaucratic, too dominated by medical staff seeking medical solutions to what are often social and economic problems, too timid in approaching controversial issues, too overstretched and too slow to adapt to change.\n\nThe WHO is both a technical agency and a policy-making body, Clift wrote. The excessive intrusion of political considerations in its technical work can damage its authority and credibility as a standard-bearer for health.\n\nThe WHO relies in part on data provided by member states, filtered through regional organizations -- a structure that was blamed for the delays in declaring Ebola an emergency.\n\nWith a government like China's, with a historical aversion to transparency and sensitivity to international criticism, that can be a problem.\n\nJUST WATCHED In Ebola outbreak, fear hinders treatment efforts Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH In Ebola outbreak, fear hinders treatment efforts 02:26\n\nTaiwan in the dark\n\nIt is on the issue of Taiwan that Beijing's political sway at the WHO is most clear.\n\nIn an impassioned speech last year before the World Health Assembly (WHA), the organization's annual meeting in Geneva, Luke Browne, the youthful health minister of the Caribbean nation of St. Vincent, demanded that Taiwan be allowed a seat at the table.\n\nThere is simply no principled basis why Taiwan should not be here ... the only reason that it is not here now is because the government in Beijing does not like the current government in Taiwan, Browne said.\n\nDespite Browne's speech, and the intervention by several other member states, from Belize and Haiti in the Caribbean to the African kingdom of Eswatini and the tiny Pacific nation of Nauru, the proposal to include Taiwan was swiftly struck off the agenda, as it has been every year since 2016.\n\nTaiwan is a self-governing democratic island of 23.7 million people off the coast of China. It has never been ruled by the government of the People's Republic, but is claimed by the authorities in Beijing as part of their territory. Beijing blocks Taiwan from participating in many international organizations unless it does so in a way that conforms to the one China principle, such as calling itself Chinese Taipei in the Olympics\n\nBeijing's exclusion of the island from international organizations does not usually have global ramifications. Health is one area, however, where an effective international response requires that all governments be equally connected and informed.\n\n.@WHO, what's wrong with you? First you called us Taiwan, China, then you changed to Taipei. You misreported the confirmed cases, & now you call us Taipei & Environs. Look! Taiwan is #Taiwan & not any part of the #PRC. JW — 外交部 Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ROC (Taiwan) 🇹🇼 (@MOFA_Taiwan) February 6, 2020\n\nTaiwan's exclusion from the WHO leaves its population vulnerable during this crisis -- a lack of direct and timely channels to the WHO have already resulted in inaccurate reporting of cases in Taiwan, said Natasha Kassam, an expert on China, Taiwan and diplomacy at Australia's Lowy Institute. Taiwanese authorities have complained about the lack of access to WHO data and assistance.\n\nSimilar concerns were raised during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, when Taiwanese scientists complained they were stonewalled by WHO officials, who told them to ask authorities in China for data about the disease.\n\nThe issue has global ramifications: Kassam pointed out that around 50 million foreign travelers pass through Taiwan's largest airport every year, with an expectation that Taiwan would be receiving WHO advice on any public health issue.\n\nTaiwan's healthcare system has been consistently ranked one of the best in the world -- and at a time like this, every country should put politics aside to focus on containing the virus, Kassam said.\n\nAs coronavirus cases were reported in Taiwan -- which has major business and cultural links with China no matter the discord politically -- the WHO couldn't even settle on what to call the island. Speaking to reporters last month , a spokesman used the bizarre construction of China, Taiwan; while a February 4 report flipped it and listed Taiwan, China, but got the number of cases wrong, relying on data from Beijing not Taipei. Subsequent reports have since dropped the term Taiwan altogether, instead including Taipei and environs in a list of affected cities in China.\n\nWhen he addressed the WHA last year, Browne predicted just this type of confusion, saying we all know that the PRC does not exercise control and authority over Taiwan and cannot be reasonably expected to represent it here.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the WHO said that we are collaborating closely with Taiwanese authorities through the International Health Regulations (IHR) mechanism in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nWHO has received vital information from Taiwanese authorities and will be reporting back through established channels, the spokesperson said. WHO works with Taiwanese health officials, following established procedures, to facilitate fast and effective response, including through the IHR.\n\nThe spokesperson added that with regard to the current outbreak, 'we have Taiwanese experts involved in all of our consultations -- the clinical networks, laboratory networks, and others -- so they're fully engaged and fully aware of all of the developments in the expert networks.\n\nTrapped in the middle\n\nJust as Beijing's sway at the United Nations means that Taiwan is likely never to regain its seat there, the WHO is unlikely to reverse course on this issue until Beijing does. While Taiwan's allies have spoken out in favor of it since the coronavirus outbreak began, China has far more diplomatic clout that it can bring to bear.\n\nAnd this is the fundamental problem with the WHO: it cannot treat member states equally because they are not equal. During the Cold War , it was the United States that was seen as having too much influence, leading the Soviet Union and its allies to walk out from 1949 to 1956. The US retains major sway due to its position as one of the largest individual funders of the WHO, as do other major economies such as Japan and the United Kingdom, and private donors like the Gates Foundation. While it has not historically been a major funder, the WHO has praised China's growing contribution to global health initiatives.\n\nBeyond financial issues, the WHO is also directly controlled by its member states, who nominate and elect the organization's director general and set its agenda. This means the WHO cannot afford, politically or financially, to antagonize countries like the US or China that wield outsized influence over other nations.\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus speaks during a press conference following a WHO Emergency committee to discuss whether the Coronavirus, the SARS-like virus, outbreak that began in China constitutes an international health emergency, on January 30, 2020 in Geneva.\n\nIf Tedros wants WHO to stay informed about what's happening in China and influence how the country handles the epidemic, he cannot afford to antagonize the notoriously touchy Chinese government -- even though it is clear the country has been less than fully transparent about the outbreak's early stages, and perhaps still is, Kai Kupferschmidt wrote in the journal Science this week\n\nIndeed, had Tedros done so, there would likely have been a raft of articles criticizing the WHO for needlessly offending China at a time of crisis and hamstringing its own ability to operate.\n\nThomas Abraham, an associate professor at Hong Kong University Journalism and Media Studies Center and former WHO consultant, sums it up well: The WHO, and China too, is in a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation.
(CNN) -- Maybe it was the sound of the wind cutting through the wire. Perhaps he caught a small vibration with his keen eyes. Or it could have been a slight difference in the air's smell.\n\nWhatever it was, when Sarge noticed that his Marine Corps handler, Fred Dorr, was creeping down the wrong path in the Vietnam jungle, the German shepherd did something he'd never done out in the field: He looked at Dorr and barked, before taking a seat.\n\nWhen he sat down, I knew there was a trip wire. I was one step away from it, remembered Dorr, who with his dog in 1969 was walking point, leading the way for a dozen soldiers. Had the hidden explosive device been tripped, It would have gotten half of us.\n\nMore than 40 years later, the gratitude and love Dorr, 59, feels for the dog he served with is as strong as ever. And it's for this reason that Dorr, president of the Vietnam Dog Handler Association, drove from his Yoakum, Texas, home to be in Southern California this week.\n\nAbout 200 Vietnam War dog handlers, who were trained to read and communicate with their canine partners, have gathered for a reunion. And on Saturday they'll join an expected several thousand others for the 10th anniversary rededication of the War Dog Memorial at the March Air Reserve Base in Riverside.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, more than 4,000 dogs served in various positions, said Michael Lemish, a military dog historian and author of Forever Forward: K-9 Operations in Vietnam.\n\nThe scout dogs, such as Sarge, walked with their handlers ahead of patrols -- making them the first target for ambushes or hidden explosives. There were also sentry dogs who guarded bases, tracker dogs who followed the trail of enemies and mine and booby trap dogs who sniffed out dangers hidden beneath the ground.\n\nThe Viet Cong placed a bounty on the dogs because they were so effective, Lemish said. All told, he estimated the K-9 teams averted more than 10,000 casualties. But at the end of the war, only about 200 dogs came home. The rest who had survived were either euthanized or turned over to the South Vietnamese -- left behind, a surplus of war.\n\nThey were treated as obsolete equipment. And if you were a handler, you couldn't see them that way, said Jack Kowall, 61, who keeps a framed picture of himself and Eric, the black lab and shepherd mix he worked with, atop his desk in Marietta, Georgia. When that's your dog, that's your dog. He sees you in danger, he's going to respond. Unconditional love -- it's all for you. You can't help but love him.\n\nOn patrols, Kowall used hand motions to speak to Eric. In turn, the animal spoke back through his movements. His ears would shoot up and turn in the direction of suspicious noise. The hair on his back would stand up if danger was close. If he wanted Kowall to stop moving, he'd look back at him.\n\nOff-duty, Eric was playful. He liked to have his neck scratched and would roll around on the ground. The 110-pound dog would cuddle up to Kowall at night when they were out in the field, and he'd eat out of his handler's helmet. Whenever Kowall could, he'd give his closest friend steak.\n\nThe men who'd walk behind the pair on missions were always different. But a scout handler and his dog were a constant, as the duo bounced between different assignments.\n\nWhen Jeffrey Bennett, founder and former CEO of Nature's Recipe pet foods, first learned about the dogs who'd served and the fate of so many of them, he set out to teach others. Based on about three years of research, he co-produced the documentary War Dogs: America's Forgotten Heroes, which first aired 11 years ago on the Discovery Channel.\n\nDonations earned through this film allowed Bennett, now president of the War Dog Memorial, to commission three monuments, sculptures featuring a German shepherd and his handler.\n\nThe first one was unveiled at the March Field Air Museum in Riverside. A second was installed at Fort Benning, Georgia. The third remains in storage, Bennett said. The original goal to place it in Washington beside the Vietnam Veterans Memorial or at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia remains an elusive dream.\n\nDogs have long served with the U.S. military, said Lemish, who also wrote War Dogs: A History of Loyalty and Heroism. During World War I, the dogs borrowed from the French and British worked as messengers and assisted the Red Cross by finding the wounded on battlefields, he said. The American K-9 corps, Lemish said, really began during World War II, when, among other tasks, thousands of dogs donated by civilians patrolled shorelines.\n\nBack then, dogs sent abroad were retrained and returned to civilian life, but that practice had changed by the time U.S. forces entered Vietnam, Lemish said. Later, galvanized by the attention earned through the documentary, Vietnam War dog handlers began to call for change.\n\nJohnny Mayo, 60, hadn't spoken to another dog handler in 30 years when he showed up in Washington for his first reunion in 2000. But as he talked to the 250 others in attendance, he realized the power of what they shared.\n\nYou go through the war, and you always remember the bond you have, the bond with the dog, said Mayo, whose dog Kelly once yanked him up a bank from a rice paddy, out of the way of mortar fire. On that first trip to the [Vietnam Veterans Memorial] wall, it was a reunion with the spirits of our dogs.\n\nLater, Mayo, of Lexington, South Carolina, would go on to write his own book and establish a traveling exhibit to pay tribute to the dogs who'd served.\n\nWashington also took notice. In November 2000, President Clinton signed into law legislation that established a military working dog adoption program. Now the dogs working in Iraq and Afghanistan will have a chance to find comfortable homes when they return from war.\n\nFor Dorr, of the Vietnam Dog Handler Association, this has been a blessing. He said leaving his partner Sarge behind, all those decades ago, haunted him.\n\nA lot of us [handlers] suffered PTSD, he said, referring to post-traumatic stress disorder. It's like leaving your kid back there.\n\nBut he now has Bluma, the war dog he adopted from Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. The German shepherd, who has hip problems, looks uncannily like Sarge, he said, and having him around is a source of comfort.\n\nI'm taking care of an old vet, Dorr said, and he's taking care of me.
Flaxseed is rich in two natural appetite suppressants: omega-3 fats and fiber. Fiber from flaxseed can keep us satisfied and full, without contributing any calories.\n\nSpinach is a source of thylakoids, which have been associated with levels of leptin, the hormone that signals you to stop eating.\n\nIts high water content makes soup a food low in energy (calorie) density. That means you can fill up on a big portion without consuming a lot of calories.\n\nAdding red chili pepper to an appetizer significantly reduced the total amount of calories and carbohydrates consumed at lunch, according to one study.\n\nAvocados are an excellent source of heart-healthy fats, and fat fills us up fast, which can be beneficial in controlling hunger.\n\nGreek and Icelandic yogurts are thicker and creamier than regular yogurt. But it's the added protein that keeps us feeling full.\n\nStory highlights Cutting calories simply doesn't lead to long-term weight loss or health gains The only people who don't seem to appreciate this are people who have never dieted The act of dieting causes physiological changes that make it hard to continue\n\nDiets do not work.\n\nThe scientific evidence is clear as can be that cutting calories simply doesn't lead to long-term weight loss or health gains.\n\nWe suspect most dieters have realized this by now too. And yet, here they are again, setting the same weight loss goal this year that they set last year.\n\nThe only people who don't seem to appreciate this are people who have never dieted. It's particularly hard for them to believe because it doesn't square with their own eating experiences.\n\nTake Nicky, for instance. She eats sensibly much of the time, with some junk food here and there, but it doesn't really seem to affect her weight. She's not a dieter. She is Naturally Thin Nicky, and it's not surprising that she believes what she sees with her own eyes and feels in her own body. Nevertheless, Nicky has it wrong.\n\nThe long, strange history of dieting fads\n\nWe are researchers who have been studying why diets fail for a long time. We have seen that diet failure is the norm. We have also studied the stigma that heavy people face, and witnessed the blame game that happens when dieters can't keep the weight off. From a scientific perspective, we understand that dieting sets up an unfair fight. But many Nickys we've encountered – on the street, in the audience when we give talks, and even fellow scientists – get confused when we say dieting doesn't work, because it doesn't square with their own observations.\n\nAn unfair fight\n\nNicky thinks she's thin because of the way she eats, but actually, genetics play a huge role in making her thin. Nicky gets all the credit though, because people see the way she eats and they can't see her genes.\n\nMany heavy people wouldn't be lean like Nicky even if they ate the same foods in the same quantities. Their bodies are able to run on fewer calories than Nicky's, which sounds like a good thing (and would be great if you found yourself in a famine).\n\nHowever, it actually means that after eating the same foods and using that energy to run the systems of their body, they have more calories left over to store as fat than Nicky does. So to actually lose weight, they have to eat less food than Nicky. And then, once they've been dieting a while, their metabolism changes so that they need to eat even less than that to keep losing weight.\n\nIt's not just Nicky's genetically given metabolism that makes her think dieting must work. Nicky, as a non-dieter, finds it really easy to ignore that bowl of Hershey's Kisses on her co-worker's desk. But for dieters, it's like those Kisses are jumping up and down saying Eat me! Dieting causes neurological changes that make you more likely to notice food than before dieting, and once you notice it, these changes make it hard to stop thinking about it. Nicky might forget those chocolates are there, but dieters won't.\n\nWhy so many people regain weight after dieting\n\nIn fact, dieters like them even more than before. This is because other diet-induced neurological changes make food not only taste better, but also cause food to give a bigger rush of the reward hormone dopamine. That's the same hormone that is released when addicts use their drug of choice. Nicky doesn't get that kind of rush from food.\n\nAnd besides, Nicky is full from lunch. Here again, dieters face an uphill battle because dieting has also changed their hormones. Their levels of the so-called satiety hormone leptin go down, which means that now it takes even more food than before to make them feel full. They felt hungry on their diets all along, but now feel even hungrier than before. Even Nicky's regular non-diet lunch wouldn't make dieters full at this point.\n\nWhere's your willpower?\n\nPeople see Nicky and are impressed with her great self-control, or willpower. But should it really be considered self-control to avoid eating a food when you aren't hungry? Is it self-control when you avoid eating a food because you don't notice it, like it or receive a rush of reward from it?\n\nAnyone could resist the food under those circumstances. And even though Nicky doesn't really need willpower in this situation, if she did need it, it would function quite well because she's not dieting. On top of everything else, dieting disrupts cognition, especially executive function, which is the process that helps with self-control. So dieters have less willpower right when they need more willpower. And non-dieters have plenty, even though they don't need any.\n\nAnd of course, even if Nicky were to eat those tempting foods, her metabolism would burn up more of those calories than a dieter's metabolism.\n\nSex and other myths about weight loss\n\nSo Nicky is mistakenly being given credit for succeeding at a job that is not only easy for her, but easier than the job dieters face.\n\nThe cruel irony is that after someone has been dieting for some time, changes happen that make it hard to succeed at dieting in the long run. It is physically possible, and a small minority of dieters do manage to keep weight off for several years. But not without a demoralizing and all-encompassing battle with their physiology the entire time.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nIt's easy to see why dieters usually regain the weight they lose on their New Year's resolution diet, and we have the following suggestions for when that happens: If you are a Nicky, remember the self-denial these dieters have subjected themselves to and how little they were eating while you treated yourself to decadent desserts. Be impressed with their efforts, and grateful that you don't have to attempt it.\n\nIf you are a dieter, remind yourself that you aren't weak, but that you were in an unfair fight that very few win. Change your focus to improving your health with exercise (which doesn't require weight loss), and resolve to choose a different New Year's resolution next year.\n\nTraci Mann is a professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota and author of Secrets from the Eating Lab.

Drink lots of water or hot tea to help keep your airways clear. Try to avoid sweetened beverages such as sports drinks and juices.\n\nFruits and vegetables are some of the best sources of vitamins A, C and E, particularly useful in building immunity.\n\nGarlic contains allicin, a compound that can help fight infection and bacteria, dietitian Alissa Rumsey says.\n\nFatty fish, such as salmon and tuna, contain omega-3 fatty acids, which help control inflammation in your body, dietitian Maxine Yeung says.\n\nYogurt is a natural source of probiotics, also known as good bacteria that live in your gut. Studies have linked good gut health to boosting immunity, better sleep and good digestion.\n\nThe bone broth in chicken soup contains collagen, which can help boost your immune system, in addition to amino acids and nutrients that help prevent inflammation.\n\nStory highlights Coughing is your body's way of expelling an irritant To eliminate the cough, help your body rid itself of the invader\n\n(CNN) —\n\nIs a cough making your life miserable? Don't blame your body; coughing is the only way your lungs can expel an irritant. The key is to figure what's causing it and then to get your lungs the help they need.\n\nA cough that appears suddenly is usually triggered by an infectious disease, such as cold or flu.\n\nA majority of coughs actually resolve with just rest and home remedies, said Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist, an internist at the Emory Clinic in Atlanta. So that's the place to start unless there are warning signs of something more serious.\n\nRed flags include coughing up blood-tinged phlegm, a great deal of phlegm or phlegm that is turning thicker and darker; fever; shortness of breath; and wheezing.\n\nThose are all signs that the cause more likely to be a bacterial than viral infection, such as bronchitis or pneumonia, or perhaps an underlying medical condition, Bergquist said. But without those signs, it's usually OK to try home remedies for a few days.\n\nHome remedies for cough\n\nStaying hydrated is the best thing you can do for a cough. Liquids thin out the mucus, making it less irritating to the throat and easier for the lungs to expel. Steam from a hot shower can do the same. Saline or salt water drops or spray are another option to moisten the nasal passages and thin mucus.\n\nAdding a cool-mist humidifier, also known as a vaporizer, to your or your child's room can improve the air's moisture content, helping hydrate the lungs, but be sure to clean it daily. (Hot-water vaporizers aren't recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics because of the risk of scalding or burns).\n\nOther popular home remedies include tea, chicken soup and honey, whether eaten alone or added to drinks.\n\nChicken soup has a lot of value if you're sick in general, Bergquist said. The warmth and spices open up the sinuses. For coughs, hot liquids ease the throat, and honey is quite effective. Studies have compared honey with some of the over-the-counter cough medicines and found it works just as well.\n\nBut keep honey away from any infant. Honey can lead to infant botulism because of a baby's immature digestive system. By age 1, their bowels have matured enough that they can eat honey safely.\n\nYour cough should improve over a few days, with mucus looking lighter and thinner, Bergquist said. If that doesn't happen, it might be time to check with a doctor.\n\nOver-the-counter options\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration and the American Academy of Pediatrics point to studies showing that many parents are ignoring guidelines and mixing too many over-the-counter cough and cold medications, thus overdosing their children.\n\nThe FDA clearly recommends no OTC meds for children under 2 and no codeine-based medications for children under 12. The American Academy of Pediatrics recently changed its guidance to recommend no OTC medications for children under 4, warning adults to carefully measure the dosages.\n\nAt any age, the only over-the-counter cough remedy Bergquist recommends are cough drops, and then only when a child is old enough not to choke on them, about 4 years old.\n\nSucking on drops can soothe and moisten the throat, and versions with menthol could have a tiny numbing effect on that annoying tickle. Other over-the-counter remedies, Bergquist said, are not particularly effective.\n\nI typically skip to prescription medication that will work directly on the cough reflex or the part of the central nervous system where the brain processes the cough, she said. I find those are the ones that really work.\n\nA chronic cough\n\nWhat if your cough is more of a dry, hacking one that has lasted a few weeks? Chronic cough can have many causes, and you and your doctor may need to play detective.\n\nMedications\n\nCertain prescription medications can trigger coughing. A typical culprit is a class of medication used to treat high blood pressure and kidney damage from diabetes. Studies say these ACE inhibitors can cause coughing in up to a third of patients; they include such medications as enalapril (Vasotec), captopril (Capoten) and lisinopril (Zestril, Prinivil).\n\nThis ACE cough can start immediately or even months after beginning the medication, and it is typically dry and unproductive. The only treatment is to stop the ACE inhibitor, but it might take months for the cough to resolve.\n\nOther medications that may cause a chronic cough are inhaled corticosteroids, used by many asthma and allergy sufferers, a diabetes drug called sitagliptin and some antibiotics.\n\nEnvironmental causes\n\nChemicals or other irritants in the environment can also produce an ongoing cough, especially if you are allergic to that trigger. Cigarette smoking is an obvious offender, as are dust, mold and pollen. If your chronic cough is due to an allergy, medications to treat it may improve your symptoms.\n\nDigestive reasons\n\nHow can your digestive system cause you to cough? It happens when the acid from your stomach splashes up into your esophagus, irritating both your esophagus and the larynx, or voice box. That condition is called gastroesophageal reflux, or GERD. Oddly enough, you don't have to have a burning sensation or other signs of reflux for this to happen.\n\nAcid reflux is one of those silent causes of cough that is common and underdiagnosed, Bergquist said. But it needs to be addressed, because it can lead to Barrett's esophagus.\n\nBarrett's esophagus is a condition in which the cells of your esophagus, the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach, are so damaged by stomach acid that they change into tissue similar to that of the intestine. It can lead to a rare form of cancer called esophageal adenocarcinoma.\n\nSerious health issues\n\nAlthough rare, coughing can also be a warning sign of a serious health issue. Coughing up blood can be a sign of something serious, such as lung cancer or an infectious disease such as tuberculosis. Usually, there will be significant accompanying symptoms, such as weight loss, fatigue, weakness, bone pain, loss of appetite and night sweats.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nWith any of these red flags, it's important to see a doctor as soon as possible. For dry coughs that occur without other worrisome symptoms, Bergquist said, the duration of the cough is a good measure of when to worry and not worry.\n\nIf it's a dry cough and not productive, no phlegm, you're not short of breath and have no fever, it's OK to wait a bit to see if it resolves, she said. But if the dry cough continues past six weeks, you should see a doctor to figure out a cause and to eliminate the unexpected, such as lung tumors or other serious issues.

Hill: I just do what I think is right\n\nDemocratic Congressional candidate Katie Hill speaks to supporters at her election night party in California's 25th Congressional district on November 6, 2018 in Santa Clarita, California.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nWhen Katie Hill opened the heavy wooden door to her new congressional office in the Longworth House Office Building, one feeling smacked her in the gut.\n\nWell, this doesn't feel like me, recalled the freshman congresswoman from California's 25th District.\n\nSo yeah, this very formal place being my home base does feel strange, she added. I don't want to become more formal. That's not on the table.\n\nHill argues her life doesn't allow her to embrace any of the formal trappings of Washington. Raised in suburban Los Angeles, she prefers sneakers to heels. She's a Democrat and the daughter of a Republican police officer and survived a sexual assault. Socially conscious, she married a man but identifies as bisexual.\n\nThe thrust of her career has been in non-profits, as an advocate for the homeless. She also embraces the sexist criticism, known as resting bitch face, about a serious woman (like her) not smiling while thinking.\n\nThis isn't the sort of resume or life story that typically precedes a seat in Congress, but that's just fine with Hill and the voters who elected her. An unconventional woman, the 31-year-old joins the 116th Congress, the most diverse legislature in history by many measures — gender, race and sexual orientation.\n\nRefusing to change is part of the internal feedback loop in Hill's first days in Washington.\n\nSometimes in the middle of an unreal day, you just really need to hug your mom.\n\n\n\nWe're about to be sworn in. Let's do this. pic.twitter.com/8zmyMbgvb9 — Rep. Katie Hill (@RepKatieHill) January 3, 2019\n\nA grassroots candidate\n\nHill won with an insurgent campaign spurred by the 2016 election. She channeled her anger at the victory of President Donald Trump by taking aim at her congressman, Rep. Steve Knight, who voted with fellow House Republicans in May 2017 to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Who is going to run against him? Hill typed out on her social media accounts. A friend said, Why not you?\n\nWhy not, thought Hill.\n\nA year and a half later, Hill flipped the suburban Los Angeles district for Democrats. The first-time candidate had started her grassroots campaign out of a rented apartment backed by a hoodie-wearing millennial staff, chain-sipping La Croix sparkling water. The team raised more than $8 million without taking a cent in corporate or special interest money.\n\nHill won over voters as a progressive advocate for affordable housing while offering a pragmatic willingness to work across party lines for her purple district. Trying to fit into Washington is not why Hill was elected nor does it sit anywhere on her agenda.\n\nPlaying nice isn't really something that's in my vocabulary, she said. I just do what I think is right.\n\nDemanding to be heard\n\nThat philosophy may sound quaint, even naive, for Washington, but Hill believes that's the shared sentiment among the incoming freshmen congressional class.\n\nA record-setting 127 women were elected to the 116th Congress, the majority of whom are Democrats. More African Americans, Latinos and LGBTQ members now serve in Congress. The legislature also saw its median age drop by approximately a decade with its newly elected members.\n\nPHOTO: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images Katie Hill laughs as Nancy Pelosi's granddaughter reacts to votes for Pelosi to become Speaker of the House.\n\nHill is notable for her youth as well as being California's first openly bisexual woman elected to Congress. But it's the sheer size of the freshman class, at 92 new members with 46 flipped seats in the 2018 midterm election, that's politically powerful to her.\n\nTraditionally, new legislators have been expected to wait their turn while more seasoned members drove the agenda. But this time, and in this age, the newbies are demanding their voices be heard.\n\nI think we have enough power and enough strength in numbers and enough of a strong mandate from voters that we're going to be able to continue to stay true to the things that we ran on, said Hill, who was elected to the Democratic House leadership team as one of two new members representing freshmen.\n\nPHOTO: Win McNamee/Getty Images Katie Hill, right, poses with other members of the newly elected Democratic House Leadership team in November.\n\nThe result, she hopes, will be in them governing differently.\n\nA new agenda and attitude\n\nTop of Hill's agenda is focusing on a more equitable system, from health care to taxes to housing. Hill believes the biggest problem with Washington has been the billionaire class being controlled by special interest donors and ignoring the needs of the politically powerless.\n\nWe are regular, middle class people, said Hill, the now third-youngest member of Congress (behind Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Iowa's Abby Finkenauer.)\n\nWe're young. We look like and speak like the people that we're there to represent. We're not people who came up through the political process. The majority of us are first-time candidates. We're not stuck in the old way of doing things, she said.\n\nThis Freshman class is larger, younger, and more diverse than ever before and that's not a coincidence – it's a call to action.\n\n\n\nYesterday @JoeNeguse and I were elected to be the Co-Representatives to Leadership for this historic class and we are so ready to get to work. pic.twitter.com/GZv3FUElNe — Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) November 29, 2018\n\nHill spoke to CNN as she made the flight to Washington from Burbank, California, inviting us to chronicle her journey from candidate to congresswoman-elect to swearing in.\n\nA millennial, Hill embraces the sharing philosophy of her generation via social media and speaks easily with reporters as cameras roll. She's shared on Twitter and Facebook her personal stories about surviving sexual assault and an unplanned pregnancy that ended in a miscarriage. In her unconventional political ads, she went rock climbing.\n\nAs Hill checked in for the 6:45 a.m. flight, she remarked, I've never lived outside of California or traveled with so many bags. For the record, there were three suitcases.\n\nShe wore athletic clothing for the flight, noticing then, under the bright fluorescent lights of the ticket counter, that her black pants were covered in her dog's white hair. Oh well, she said, as she walked towards airport security. Her goal, she said, is to demystify Congress by bringing her voters with her on this journey and through her entire term, dog hair and all.\n\nI think what I, and many of the other freshmen have, what's kind of unique, is this sort of ability to relate to people in a different way.\n\nI left my house in SoCal and it was 37 degrees, landed in DC and it's more than 50 degrees here! What a warm welcome! ☀️\n\n\n\nCan't believe inauguration is this week — I'm so ready to get to work. 💪🏼 pic.twitter.com/UV28nRQPFO — Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) December 29, 2018\n\nIt's why on Hill's Twitter feed she's posted frequent updates on her first impressions of Washington during new member orientation, known as Congress Camp. She talked about what committees she hoped to join to best represent her district, a sprawling community with suburban middle-class families and lower-income desert communities, and doesn't plan on slowing down the tweets.\n\n'There's going to be fights'\n\nHill signed the lease at her new home – a small, no frills, two-bedroom apartment that gives off a corporate, temporary housing sensibility. It's there she caught up with her roommate and fellow freshman, Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois. Nearly the same age, the congresswomen initially give off a bubbly vibe of moving into a college dorm.\n\nYou can only have tough dinner table conversations if you first get the dinner table! 😂\n\n\n\n@LUnderwood630 is the best Ikea partner I could imagine — the true test of roommate compatibility! (And maybe our negotiation skills too...) pic.twitter.com/knACssVjXF — Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) December 30, 2018\n\nBut as Underwood talked, it became apparent that both carried the weight of their new elected jobs.\n\nI think it's going to be hard, said Underwood, who also flipped her district, defeating a Republican male incumbent. She is now the youngest black woman to ever serve in Congress. We don't walk in and everything automatically changes.\n\nI would imagine there will be confrontations, said Hill. There's going to be fights between the old guard and the new one. But I feel very optimistic that the existing leadership all want us to be part of this process. They recognize the change that's happening, and they're trying to include us.\n\nPHOTO: Kyung Lah/CNN The nameplate for Rep. Katie Hill outside her office on Capitol Hill.\n\nOn inauguration morning, a crush of cameras greeted Hill, swarming around her as she tried to enter the Capitol to be sworn in.\n\nIt feels good. It feels like we can finally get to work, she said.\n\nShe stepped into the US Capitol through the south door entrance and disappeared into the tunnel. Her cross-country journey had ended but her new role as Congresswoman Katie Hill had just begun.
(CNN) — Southwest Airlines has joined other major US carriers in banning emotional support animals.\n\nEffective March 1, the airline will no longer transport emotional support animals, according to a policy announced Monday. Trained service dogs will still be allowed.\n\nA new Department of Transportation regulation went into effect on January 11 that says airlines aren't required to treat emotional support animals as service animals.\n\nDelta, United, Alaska, JetBlue and American Airlines have already announced that they will no longer allow emotional support animals.\n\nThe animals are prescribed by mental health professionals to provide comfort and support, but unlike service animals, emotional support animals are not required to have training in specific tasks.\n\nThe DOT rule, announced in December, defines a service animal as a dog trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of a qualified individual with a disability.\n\nSouthwest customers traveling with trained service dogs must now fill out a Department of Transportation form pertaining to the animal's health, behavior and training. This form is a new requirement for many US airlines.\n\nWe applaud the Department of Transportation's recent ruling that allows us to make these important changes to address numerous concerns raised by the public and airline employees regarding the transport of untrained animals in the cabins of aircraft, said Steve Goldberg, Southwest Airlines senior vice president of operations and hospitality.\n\nRelated content Should emotional support animals be allowed on board airplanes?\n\nDelta, United Airlines, Alaska Airlines and JetBlue all stopped taking new reservations involving emotional support animals on January 11, 2021. Most travel with the animals will be completed by the end of February.\n\nAmerican Airlines says existing bookings for emotional support animals will be honored only through the end of January. Animals that previously traveled as emotional support animals may travel as carry-on or cargo pets, American Airlines said.\n\nConcern that passengers were fraudulently passing off their pets as the more loosely defined and fee-free category of emotional support animals is part of what prompted airlines to ask the DOT to review this issue.\n\nThe DOT rule was also prompted by an increase in service animal complaints from passengers with disabilities, misbehavior by emotional support animals, a lack of clarity around the definition of service animal and disruptions caused by requests to transport unusual species of animals onboard aircraft, according to the DOT.

Elizabeth Warren arrived in Iowa on Friday evening and, through four events over a little more than 24 hours, quickly made clear that even as her presidential campaign evolves, she is poised to rise or fall with the same brand of wonky populism that took her from the classroom to Capitol Hill.\n\nIn speeches to packed rooms from the state's western border with Nebraska to its capital in Des Moines, Warren spent the weekend demanding structural change in Washington, where the partial government shutdown is entering its third week. She wants to strengthen our unions, our workers and our consumers while breaking the hold of an army of lobbyists occupying the capital, as she describes it, under the banners of big corporations.\n\nRELATED: Elizabeth Warren in Iowa: 'I am not a person of color'\n\nEven during her occasional strolls in the policy weeds, Warren, who has set the tone for her remarks so far by opening them with the story of her mother's struggle to find a minimum wage job to help save their house after Warren's father suffered a debilitating heart attack, keeps up a low fury. When her microphone cut out at the opening event in Council Bluffs, Warren didn't yell because, even in a room of 300 (with 200 more outside) she didn't have to.\n\nThere are too many people who get their power from turning working people against working people, the Massachusetts Democrat said a day later in Storm Lake during a riff on long-stalled talks over comprehensive immigration revisions. A few hours earlier, in Sioux City, she declared, Washington keeps working great for those with money, but not for anyone else. We need to call this out for what it is: It is corruption, pure and simple.\n\nIf Warren has strong feelings about ethanol, an important issue for Iowa voters and favorite means for out-of-state candidates to pander to them, she hasn't yet let on. Warren has also steered clear of some national progressive hits, like Medicare-for-all, which she hasn't mentioned through her first few stops.\n\nAsked on Saturday why the Democratic left's signature policy proposal had not gotten a mention through two events, Warren demurred.\n\nNo one's raised it, she said. But I have had a chance to talk about Medicaid, partly because I think we've had a national conversation about health care, and I think it's been enormously valuable.\n\nThe issue was indeed a winner for Democrats running during the 2018 midterm elections. In her opening foray, Warren has seemed content to continue on that path, advocating for Medicaid not just as a program for the poor but also as one that benefits seniors and Americans suffering from mental illness, while assailing the shameful behavior of insurance companies. On Saturday night, she won hearty applause when she called health care a basic human right.\n\nBut if Warren has appeared entirely self-assured in diving into the policy positions that she has been crusading for in Washington for years – All right! she cheered when an audience member in Sioux City began asking about internet regulations – her tone has changed when faced with questions about the 2016 election, a kind of riddle that she and so many other Democrats are still struggling to unwind.\n\nAsked how she planned to prevent a repeat of the undemocratic behavior between the DNC and Hillary's campaign in 2016 against Sen. Sanders, Warren told supporters in Des Moines, I'm not relitigating 2016, before pivoting to call all Democrats running for president to disavow super PACs, saying, I think that all of the Democratic candidates, whoever they turn out to be, should link arms and say our primary is not for sale to billionaires.\n\nIn a gaggle with reporters at her Council Bluffs rally on Friday, she bypassed a question about the comparisons being drawn between her campaign and Hillary Clinton's four years ago.\n\nYou know, look – I'd never run for public office before I got into the Senate race in Massachusetts, Warren responded. I was pulled into this because I have watched how America's middle class has been hollowed out. I am in this fight for working families. I'm going to stay focused on that all the way through.\n\nLike her colleague and ideological ally Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent whose decision to enter the 2016 presidential campaign was partly a reaction to Warren's decision to sit it out, the Massachusetts senator seems least at ease when political conversation turns personal. But hers is a distinct challenge, and a lonely one during this period when Warren stands as the lone, high-profile female presidential candidate.\n\nShe has already been faced with a story focused on whether she risked being viewed as too unlikable, gamely parlaying it into a fundraising tool. Many Democrats seized on the same report, determined to lay down a marker to ensure that Warren and the other women likely to run – so many of them politically and personally distinct from Clinton in so many ways – be spared a very similar treatment.\n\nOutside Warren's debut event on Friday night, Natalie Wertz, 29, who was waiting for the candidate with a friend – both of them having purchased pink T-shirts emblazoned with Warren's de facto slogan, Nevertheless, she persisted – spoke confidently of Warren's potential as a candidate.\n\nNeither woman had heard about the likability flap, though Wertz smilingly proclaimed Warren a very likable person.\n\nBut her decision in 2020, Wertz said, would turn on more concrete questions.\n\nAs a lower middle class American, budget and finances sometimes – living paycheck to paycheck is very hard, she said. And it's a toxic world that has set us into this cycle of vicious debt. I think that Warren has great ideas about how to get us out of that.\n\nCNN's Carolyn Sung and DJ Judd contributed to this report.
New Delhi (CNN) Two women in the southern Indian state of Kerala made history Wednesday, defying religious conservatives to enter the Sabarimala Temple, one of Hinduism's holiest sites.\n\nThe pair, aged 42 and 44, became the first women to access the shrine after the country's Supreme Court overturned a centuries-old ban on women aged 10 to 50 from entering the temple in September last year, ruling it to be discriminatory and arguing that women should be able to pray at the place of their choice.\n\nThe two women made the long, uphill trek to the famous golden-roofed temple accompanied by plainclothes police officers, arriving at the site at approximately 3:45 a.m. Wednesday, Kerala police told CNN.\n\nWomen raise their hands to take a pledge to fight gender discrimination as they form part of a hundreds kilometer long women's wall in Thiruvananthapuram, in the southern Indian state of Kerala.\n\nThe temple was later closed for one hour to allow priests time to purify the site following the visit by the women.\n\nThe Sabarimala shrine, which is thought to be more than 800 years old, is considered the spiritual home of Lord Ayyappa, a Hindu god of growth. Proponents of the ban on women of menstrual age argue that since Ayyappa is considered celibate, allowing impure women into the temple would be disrespectful.\n\nRead More

I wake up without a resolution.\n\nThis is how every brain works. It diligently perseverates over worst-case scenarios, like an anxious new parent. It's just trying to keep us safe and usually does a great job at it.\n\nBut that same vigilant hardwiring also makes it too easy to worry about the wrong things. It clouds our thinking with fear of outcomes that will never come to pass or aren't nearly as bad as we let ourselves imagine. That's the type of worry the writer Erma Bombeck equated to a rocking chair: It gives you something to do but never gets you anywhere.\n\nAnd all that useless worry is detrimental to our overall mental and physical well-being. It can misinform decision-making, raise stress levels, keep us up at night and erode our happiness.\n\nFor some, anxiety and worry are so toxic and burdensome that medication and/or therapy is needed to fully function. What worries you, John Locke wrote, masters you.\n\nSo learning how to better separate the good worry, which protects us, from the useless worry, which harms us, is a vital life skill.\n\nConsider the following simple exercise to increase your insight into how much you worry needlessly. It's an experiment I did for years with the goal of better identifying and reducing my rocking chair fretting while better harnessing the useful kind of worry.\n\n'Top 10 Worries'\n\nBegin by writing down all the major things you're currently worried about. It's not pleasant to ruminate on them, but the fact is that your brain is constantly thinking about them anyway. Just because a worry is subconscious doesn't shield you from its negative effects.\n\nI suggest two rules for making the list. First, try to make the time frame for whether they will happen just six months. That limits you to concrete and quantifiable worries. You may have general anxiety thoughts like I think something bad is going to happen or worries over the next year – or four – but for the purposes of this experiment, limit your worries to those outcomes resolved in the next 180 days.\n\nSecond, keep the number at 10. If you have more than that, pick the biggest ones. If you have fewer than 10, good for you, but challenge yourself to go deeper and find other worries of which you may be less aware.\n\nSome of your 10 worries will be big, others small or even trivial. Some you may feel you have no control over while some you do. Don't worry about their seriousness or ranking them; just capture what's causing you any anticipatory fear.\n\nThen, take your final list of 10, put it somewhere private and make a note in your calendar to check in on those worries in six months.\n\nWhen time is up, record how many on the list came to fruition. Create a new Top 10 Worries list, and check those in another six months. Repeat the experiment until you have a better understanding of how often the things you worry about don't happen. And for those concerns that do come to fruition, you may see the needlessness of some of those worries, as well.\n\nMy score: 60% baseless worry\n\nI performed this Top 10 Worries exercise many times over the course of five years. Of my 100 total worries, 60 didn't happen. That's a lot of needless attention, and I could have used that time in better ways.\n\nHere is what I also learned: That percentage of wasted worry went down as the experiment went on. In other words, more of the things I worried about actually happened.\n\nDuring the first few rounds, about 80% of my worries were as illusory as my college class nightmare. But over the course of the experiment, I more accurately anticipated bad outcomes because I got better at not worrying over what was highly unlikely (and not because my life got increasingly unlucky over those years).\n\nIt also became harder to make lists of 10 over time, because the experiment itself was reducing worry.\n\nEven more edifying was that of the 40 worries that did occur, most of them fell into two categories: Either they happened but didn't seem nearly as bad as I worried they would be (such as needing to dip into savings), or they happened but there was nothing I could have done to prevent them (such as whether a friend broke up with his significant other).\n\nBoth of those worry types, even though they made the leap to reality, were also pointless.\n\nThe idea that some circumstances we call bad can, over time, turn out favorable is a Taoist philosophy I've written about before. Sometimes, there is a big upside to what seemed bad (such as a horrible breakup that leads to finding your true love). And the wisdom of knowing the difference between the things you can and can't change is famously covered by the words of pastor Reinhold Niebuhr's Serenity Prayer. Recognizing those two kinds of needless worries is just as helpful as learning that we too often worry about fiction.\n\nLooking back at my 100 worries, if I take away what never happened, what wasn't so bad and what was out of my control, all that remained were a handful of worries that seemed useful. Some came true, some remained negative, and some I could have done more to change the outcome (e.g. not getting a particular job offer or opportunity I wanted).\n\nBy clearing your mind of needless worry, you can hone in on the real concerns you might be able stop. And even if you can't stop them, there's value in occupying your mind with action over fear. As actress Angela Lansbury put it, better to be busy than to be busy worrying.\n\nWhat, me worry?\n\nOne thing life taught ye was how stupid it was to worry about things ye didnay know for sure, things that might no even happen, nay point in worrying about them, wrote the Scottish novelist and playwright James Kelman.\n\nYou may need to teach yourself the same lesson, and tracking your worries can be an effective way to do it. It could be more helpful to you to make your list longer or shorter than 10, or to have a longer or shorter time frame than six months, but make it quantifiable so you can be a bit scientific about it.\n\nSubscribe to this column Don't miss another Wisdom Project column by subscribing here.\n\nConvincing yourself that you worry too much about unlikely outcomes or about things beyond your control is one way to retrain your brain to worry less and worry smarter.\n\nI concluded my personal experiment, and it didn't free me from all worry, of course. But I worry less often and about fewer things.\n\nNow, when a worry starts to brew in my mental cauldron, I take a hard look at whether it's just fictional preparedness, whether there may be something good that could come if it does happen and whether I can do anything to prevent it.\n\nIf the answer is yes to any of them, I can more easily leave that rocking chair empty.
Julio Cortez/AP\n\nThe final vote to acquit President Trump may be delayed until next week, according to GOP and Democratic sources.\n\nAt this point, it seems unlikely that a final vote to acquit Trump will occur tonight, but things remain extremely fluid.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is considering offering a resolution that would structure the final stages of the trial, which could include a final vote as late as Wednesday of next week. This could change because a source familiar says the White House is pushing for a final vote Tuesday — the same day as the State of the Union.\n\nAsked when the final vote would be, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin said: Wednesday of next week. That's what McConnell is proposing.\n\nThe resolution may set up a process that would allow senators to speak about their views on the floor in an open session. Senators who have not spoken on the floor for days are eager to get a chance to speak.\n\nMore on the trial schedule: There's serious discussion that the Senate will NOT be in session this weekend and the chamber would return Monday to finish up the process, which would include closing arguments from both sides.\n\nThis could and is designed — at least in part — to spur talks between McConnell and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.
John Raoux/Associated Press\n\nFormer NFL wide receiver Mohamed Massaquoi revealed in a video for the Players' Tribune that he had to have his left hand amputated following an ATV accident in April 2017.\n\nDoctors originally tried to save the hand after the incident, but Massaquoi said that over the days and weeks following the accident he had to have all of his fingers removed, until only his thumb remained. His thumb was able to be saved, and he now wears a prosthetic hand that has replaced his other four fingers.\n\nIn the video, Massaquoi described the accident while he was riding his ATV with friends:\n\nMaking a turn—I take the turn too sharply. And before I know it, my ATV loses control. The next thing I feel is something just feels like an explosion just went off in my hand. I'm in shock, so I don't feel it. But I'm very aware of what's going on, just because there's blood everywhere.\n\nWhat I'm seeing and what my friends are seeing are completely different—they're seeing what actually happened, I'm seeing what I think happened. I'm thinking that I just broke my hand. My friend, on the other hand, thinks my hand just went through a meat grinder.\n\nHe also spoke about going from a profession as an NFL wide receiver for which his hands were his most important asset, to adjusting to life without his left hand. He then touched on his emotional recovery process after losing his hand and the perspective it gave him:\n\nIt's a part of me that will never come back, so there's no way that I can deny it. So one of the best quotes that I had was, whenever you're dealing with some type of trauma, give yourself a chance to actually feel it, deal with it, so that you can move on from it. I went through denial, I went through fear of what was going to come, and it just gives you a perspective of how precious life is, how fast things can change. You go from joy-riding to being in a helicopter to find out your hand is going to be amputated.\n\nVideo Play Button Videos you might like\n\nMassaquoi, 31, spent four seasons in the NFL with the Cleveland Browns (2009-12), registering 118 receptions for 1,745 yards and seven touchdowns. He attempted to make the team for both the New York Jets and Jacksonville Jaguars before the 2013 season but was cut from both organizations in training camp.\n\nNow, Massaquoi is just thankful for the things he still has in his life.\n\nI guess when I look at my hand, I'm just thankful, he noted. I'm thankful for the process. I'm thankful for the little things in life. I'm thankful for family, for friendship, thankful for real things.
Lynne Sladky/Associated Press\n\nLong before the first batter stepped into the box at the start of his tenure as the 10th commissioner in baseball history, Rob Manfred threw out his own first pitch: Chief among his priorities would be to captivate the next generation of sports fans in a way that he was captivated when his parents took him to Yankee Stadium for the first time in 1968.\n\nHe watched his hero Mickey Mantle hit a home run from both sides of the plate that August day in 1968 and has kept his passion for the sport ever since.\n\nBorn in Rome, New York, Manfred is a graduate of Cornell's School of Labor and Industrial Relations and Harvard Law School. As he entered his third season in charge, the 58-year-old commissioner sat down with Bleacher Report last month in a suite at the Detroit Tigers' Joker Marchant Stadium in Lakeland, Florida, for a wide-ranging conversation on the place of the game in today's sports landscape, and where it's headed on the eve of Opening Day:\n\nBleacher Report: Under your watch, MLB surpassed a record $10 billion in revenues last year, the Cubs ended the most storied drought in professional sports, the 2016 World Series television ratings were at their highest since 2004, and you've signed a new Basic Agreement guaranteeing labor peace for another five years. Do you figure, aw hell, maybe I should just retire while I'm on top?\n\nCommissioner Rob Manfred: [Chuckling] No. We had a nice 2016 but we ... think the momentum we built last year can carry over into '17. We think we learned some things about compelling storylines that we can sell to people. We did some nice things that you didn't mention over the winter: We finally got deals done so that in all but three markets, we're going to have in-market streaming of our games. We think that's important in terms of reaching younger fans. So we're really looking ahead, not back.\n\nB/R: Early on you stated one of your main missions would be connecting with young baseball fans. How much do you feel you've accomplished, and how far do you have to go?\n\nVideo Play Button Videos you might like\n\nRM: I do think we've seen real progress. It varies market by market. I was talking with the Toronto people last week, you go and look in Toronto at the fan mix in the ballpark and we do great up there in terms of younger people. Same thing's true in San Francisco. Another area where we're seeing progress, we have nine million opens a day on At Bat (MLB's smartphone app), and the demographic of those opens does not look like our traditional broadcast audiences. It essentially averages around 30 years old. ... Everything we're doing,everythingwe're doing, is focused on making sure that we pass the game on to the next generation.\n\nTom Szczerbowski/Getty Images\n\nSo what does that involve? We're looking hard at the game on the field, making sure that we try to eliminate dead time. We're trying to use technology—At Bat, in-market streaming—to try to make sure that we capture younger fans. Our clubs are doing a fantastic job of looking at the ticket product that they're selling. A lot of them have ... areas within the stadium where you can stand up, more of a bar-type atmosphere, all designed to attract young people into the stadium. And ... our youth participation numbers are on the uptick. ... And that's a long-term investment in the future of the game.\n\nB/R: In what ways is connecting with the younger fans still a challenge?\n\nRM: The biggest challenge is time commitment. Look, ours is a three-hour game. That's what it is. Convincing a generation with generally shorter attention spans that they should make this investment is a challenge, and I think it's a challenge that we're up to. That's one of the reasons we're looking at the way the game's played on the field. That's one of the reasons we're looking at different types of technology that can be interwoven in broadcasts of games to make them move in a way that's more consonant with the way that young people like to be entertained.\n\nB/R: Individual players from other sports, especially the NBA, have become rock stars. Mike Trout is rarely seen outside of Anaheim. Not to pick on him specifically, but he doesn't participate in the World Baseball Classic or the Home Run Derby. How big of a challenge is it to market the game to a young audience when not everybody appears to be all-in?\n\nRM: I don't put it on the players as much. I take it as our responsibility to convince them that in addition to the 162 times they go out there in a 183-day season it's worth investing additional time with us to market the game. It is a challenge because of the nature of our schedule. [But] it is incumbent upon those of us that run the business of baseball to convince these young players that it's worth it not only in terms of growing our game but, frankly, to growing their own brands.\n\nB/R: In the Open Endorse list of 100 top athlete endorsers in 2016, only one baseball player made the top 50: David Ortiz was 42nd, Buster Posey 51st, Robinson Cano 54th and Miguel Cabrera 56th. How important is it to you to have your players out there attached to different brands?\n\nRM: It's important to me. The single biggest [endorsement deal] we did in the offseason is the deal we made with Under Armour (10 years, beginning in 2020, for the company to supply uniforms). We had lots of options in terms of what we were going to do with our on-field [gear]. And we made lots of decisions. And they all relate to the topic you've raised.\n\nNorm Hall/Getty Images\n\nThe first decision we made was there was going to be more prominence in the branding on the front of the uniform, No. 1. Once we made that decision, No. 2 was easy, right: You want a more recognizable consumer brand. I would argue that Under Armour is one of the top two for sure, right, consumer brands that's recognizable with your athletes. No. 3, we found Under Armour to be particularly appealing because it skews young. That was really important to us. And fourth, we really made a bet on [Under Armour CEO] Kevin Plank. His enthusiasm, his willingness to make marketing a priority in the relationship and the job he's done with the Under Armour athletes we felt would help address some of the challenges that you raise.\n\nB/R: It's difficult to market without a partner today, isn't it?\n\nRM: That's true. And it is an association of a brand you're trying to build, a particular athlete, with a recognizable consumer brand. And it's not just the association. They're taking that athlete for their own purposes and they're putting their money, their marketing muscle, behind that athlete as well. And it's something we've lacked in this sport.\n\nB/R: It's the old, It's all about the shoes.\n\nRM: Exactly. Sneakers are a more direct carryover to the market, but you know what? The right marks on the right shoes on the baseball field can make a difference.\n\nB/R: The world is changing so quickly, are there paths you started to head down when you first took over this job that you abandoned for new strategies already?\n\nRM: I think that it's an inexact science, but the trick is this: not to quit on anything too soon. All of this takes time. It's an investment. There were certain things we tried in the youth space where we decided we wanted to go a different direction. For example, in the beginning, we were more focused on MLB as a brand in the youth participation spaces. I think today we're more interested in MLB as a good partner to great youth organizations where we get some synergy together.\n\nWe are more interested in marketing the sport around events as opposed to marketing it through traditional advertising than we were at the beginning. Great example of that, we think we got more bang for what we spent on the Fort Bragg event (last July 3, the Braves and Marlins played the first MLB game on an active military base in Fort Bragg, N.C.) than any amount of advertising we could have purchased. And we'll have some more coming this year (the MLB Little League Classic between the Cardinals and Pirates on Aug. 20 in Williamsport, Pennsylvania).\n\nStreeter Lecka/Getty Images\n\nB/R: Where does engaging on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook stand now in growing the game, and where do you see it going over the next couple of years in terms of reaching your desired audience?\n\nRM: At Bat and our captive platforms were such a success that for awhile, strategically, we tended to have our best stuff only on our platforms. I think in the past couple of years you've seen a real change. We have big partnerships with Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook. We're doing more and more on social media because that's where people are and we understand that. It's where that demographic that we're looking to hook lives, and we need to live where they live.\n\nB/R: On the heels of an emotional Cubs World Series win, coupled with the high television ratings, combined with the NFL's declining ratings in 2016, is there a window right now through which to steer MLB's momentum?\n\nRM: I look at the Cubs and Indians not as a one-time event. I look at it more as a demonstration of the fundamental strength of our game. It's something we should aspire to every year. Some of it is beyond your control because you're going to get whatever matchups the competition produces. But there are things beyond matchups that you can learn from something like the Cubs and Indians.\n\nThe storylines out of that were compelling. I think if we work hard when our postseason teams begin to coalesce, there are storylines out there. We just have to find them and make people aware of them. Are they all going to be as big as the Cubs breaking the curse? Of course not. But they can make our postseason, our product, more compelling.\n\nB/R: You've talked about the need to create more action, and certainly the numbers support your desire. In the 2016 regular season, a record 30.2 percent of all plate appearances failed to produce a fair ball, instead ending in a strikeout, walk or hit batter. How much are you alarmed by this and where does adjusting the strike zone up stand?\n\nRM: It's not about whether or not we should change the game. The game has changed. The question is, should we be more like other professional sports and more actively manage that change to produce the kind of product we want to have out there on the field. Me? I'm one for active management of that change. I think it's really important for us to look at.\n\nStrike zones, great example of it. Years ago, we thought when the strike zone was higher on the knee that the low pitch wasn't getting called. We moved it to the hollow of the knee to try to get the umpires to call that. Interesting thing happens: Technology gets laid on top of that, our umpire force starts to turn over, they all get used to being evaluated and all of a sudden, they're actually calling it where we told them to call it. You can't blame the umpires on this. They're doing exactly what we told them, and the technology told them that they were doing what we told them to do. The problem with that pitch is, it's tough to hit. So the question becomes do you make an adjustment? And honestly, if we moved it from the hollow of the knee up to where it was before, I think modern civilization is going to survive.\n\nCharles Rex Arbogast/Associated Press\n\nB/R: You do?\n\nRM: I am quite a believer that the game will survive, nothing's going to change it. Those sorts of changes are necessary to respond to the organic change that goes on in the game. Remember, the organic change is not managed in any central way. It happens as a result of 30 GMs and 30 managers doing everything they can to win one more game. That doesn't necessarily produce the best product on the field.\n\nB/R: In a way, could what seems like one of baseball's strengths, the grouchy purist, be a negative?\n\nRM: I always have been a quantitatively driven decision-maker. So when we think about what we're doing on the field, we have one really good guidepost, and that is, what do our fans think? We do quantitative research, we do focus groups, we read, we listen, and you can find the sweet spot of what fans want and change the game in response to that and get away with it without a lot of controversy. Best single example in recent memory: instant replay. People wanted us to use technology to get calls right, and even though there are some downsides, right—it takes time, it does take some of the human element out of it—overwhelmingly, people agree it's made the game better. You get there by listening to the fans.\n\nB/R: Where is replay in relation to where you'd like it to be?\n\nRM: We were actually faster last year than we were the year before. Faster's better. Less dead time is always better. We don't have many of them, but there are three- and four-minute replays. You know, there's an argument that if you can't decide in a couple of minutes...\n\nB/R: Go with the umpire's call.\n\nRM: That's right. Me personally, I'd like to see some action in those two areas because, again, dead time, there's really no argument that it's a good thing for anybody.\n\nB/R: How about doing away with the four-pitch intentional walk?\n\nRM: That's a symbolic change. It's not going to alter anyone's perception of the pace of the game overall. But you know what? If you can change it and people say, They're being responsive to our [desires], that's a good thing, even if it's a little good thing.\n\nB/R: Early in your tenure, you floated the ideas of outlawing the shift and limiting the number of relievers a manager can use in an inning. Where are you today on those ideas? Have you jumped off of them?\n\nRM: I took a lot of heat on the shifts early on. The fact of the matter is, what has happened since I made those remarks suggests that I might have been right. Because the number of shifts has increased exponentially and it has changed the game. There's absolutely no doubt in my mind that it's exacerbated some of the fundamental trends, particularly for certain types of hitters, in strikeouts and home runs. Because if you have nowhere to hit it, one of two things happen: You strike out or you hit a home run. ... Arguably at the beginning some teams had an advantage because they shifted and others didn't. What I'd argue to you about shifts, everybody's doing it now, it's just changing the game with no competitive advantage, so let's just get rid of them, you know?\n\nDead-time changes truly do not affect the competitive character of the game in a meaningful way. So I'm gung-ho on those. Mound visits, time for instant replay.\n\nVaughn Ridley/Getty Images\n\nRelief pitchers? That's even further down the spectrum. You are changing the way the game is played on the field. It's not just dead time. But I do think it's one that, while it shouldn't be at the top of the list because it affects competitive issues, has to stay on the table. We have to keep those issues on the table until we're satisfied that we're presenting a fast-paced, action-filled product that's consistent with the history and traditions of the game.\n\nB/R: Would you really put a man on second base to start extra innings? What's next, ghost runners?\n\nRM: Biggest picture: We've got three kinds of changes that we make in the rules. The first are the dead-time changes. The second are ones that can affect the way the game is played, and they're usually directed at action in the game—the strike zone would be one of those—and there's a third category that would be things like World Baseball Classic pitch counts and the runners-on-base-in-extra-innings rule that we're using only in the lowest of the minor leagues.\n\n[That last category] serves a specific purpose in a specific event. WBC pitch limits prevent overuse of pitchers too early in the season. In the developmental leagues, most of those games, it's hot, there's not many people there, they're developmental. They're not commercial products. So the idea of playing 18 innings and having a shortstop finish as the pitcher, what's the developmental purpose of that? We don't really expect we're going to move that to Major League Baseball, but it serves a purpose there.\n\nI'm in favor of it for a second reason: You do it, you might learn something. You watch what happens and maybe you get an idea. Maybe it's not that idea but you get another derivative idea that you can't take to the big leagues. I think people misunderstand what our intention is there.\n\nB/R: Regarding your management style, you've been very open-minded, and where other leaders may freak out over the small stuff, you seem to welcome public debate as you work through various processes. Have you always been that way?\n\nRM: That's a product of where I came from. When you work in labor relations for a long part of your career you have to embrace the idea that an exchange of ideas can produce creative solutions. I prefer people to disagree with me because I really don't think I'm smart enough to know what all the answers are and I think the back and forth ... we have a lot of it in our office, strong personalities, big intellects, good ideas—I think that back and forth has produced better strategies and tactics for us than if I sat in my office and decided we're doing those 10 things and that's the end of it.\n\nJonathan Daniel/Getty Images\n\nB/R: The Black Lives Matter movement has made quite an impact nationally. In baseball, diverse hires in managing and general managing remains a struggle. Dusty Baker (Nationals), Dave Roberts (Dodgers) and Rick Renteria (White Sox) are the only three minority managers. What's your evaluation as things stand today?\n\nRM: Thirty jobs at any particular point in time is a tough snapshot to judge any institution against. Our biggest single focus is on developing young African-American players here in the United States to promote our diversity.\n\nBig picture, our diversity is pretty good, right? Latinos. But I understand that the focus generally is on African-Americans. The first round [of the draft] the last five years has been 20 percent African-American, and almost every one of those kids that were African-American had some touch point with one of our programs. The RBI program, the Urban Youth Academies, the Elite Development Academies, we're trying to hit all the areas in which we can encourage development among the African-American community. We feel that that will work its way through the system. It's not just the players that wind up on the field. People end up in front office jobs, people become managers, so we're working hard at the long-term so we're not out there scrambling to figure out if we have at least one minority manager among the 30. We feel it's a long-term issue.\n\nB/R: Where do you see the game going next? International games, we already have. International teams?\n\nRM: International teams should be an aspiration for our future. Who knows what it's going to look like in the future, but today there are certain geographic limitations. But even within those geographic limitations certainly there are places within North America, Central America that would be possible for us to play on a regular basis. In reality, New York to London is not that much further than New York to the West Coast.\n\nB/R: What's the best part of being commissioner?\n\nRM: Where we're sitting right now (in a suite overlooking the field at Joker Marchant Stadium in Lakeland). When they let me go to ballparks, when I have time, that's absolutely the best. You get to see the green grass, you get to see your fans, you get to interact with those fans and you get to see the greatest game in the world.\n\nB/R: You worked in the commissioner's office for so long before taking charge, is there anything that has surprised you about the job?\n\nRM: People pay more attention to what you say than I thought. I know they pay attention to the game. The game's actually interesting, I don't find me to be that interesting. But I am realistic enough to understand it's not about me, it's about the fact that I'm speaking for the game and people care so deeply about the game that they're watching to make sure that you do the right thing. And I feel a real responsibility to try to do the right thing as a result.\n\nB/R: When did you first realize that?\n\nRM: It was the very first interview I did. I talked about the shifts. I got tons of emails, I got papers, papers with footnotes, scholarly papers explaining to me why I was wrong. I'll tell you another example: This whole thing about putting the runner on in extra innings. We never announced it, and the amount of ink that has been spilled, that's an example again of how deeply people care what you're doing with the game.\n\nB/R: What's your most treasured baseball moment from before you worked in the game?\n\nRM: That's easy. My first game was in August of 1968 at Yankee Stadium. I was 10. My parents drove—I have an older sister and a younger brother. The five of us came down from upstate New York. Stayed in Elmsford in a Howard Johnson's, went to Yankee Stadium, and the Yankees lost to the Twins 3-2 but Mickey Mantle hit two solo home runs. I was a big Mickey Mantle fan. We went back the next day. That was Mel Stottlemyre's best year; I think he won 21 games that year, had a great ERA. He started against the Twins and he gave up [seven] runs in the first two innings. They got beat 11 to something [11-2]. We saw them lose twice but it was a great experience.\n\nB/R: Coming out of spring training, it's always prediction time. What do you predict will be the biggest change in the game by the time you are finished serving as commissioner?\n\nRM: I hope that the biggest change in the game is that people are saying that Major League Baseball owns the next generation. That is what I aspire to, everything we're trying to do is about that, and I hope I have enough time and enough help to get that done.\n\nScott Miller covers Major League Baseball as a national columnist for Bleacher Report.

(CNN) Georgians elected Jon Ossoff to the US Senate, CNN projected Wednesday, giving the Democratic Party control of Congress and the White House for the first time in a decade and delivering a stark repudiation of President Donald Trump as he tried to overturn his own loss.\n\nOssoff's victory and that of fellow Georgia Democrat the Rev. Raphael Warnock flip the Senate, giving President-elect Joe Biden the power to potentially enact sweeping, liberal legislation and push through Cabinet nominations without Republican support. The Senate's party split will be 50-50 with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris breaking tie votes.\n\nWarnock, the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, and Ossoff will respectively be the first Black and Jewish senators to represent Georgia.\n\nAt this moment of crisis, as Covid-19 continues to ravage our state and our country, when hundreds of thousands have lost their lives, millions have lost livelihoods, Georgia families are having difficulty putting food on the table -- fearing foreclosure or eviction, having difficulty making ends meet -- let's unite now to beat this virus and rush economic relief to the people of our state and to the American people, Ossoff said earlier Wednesday ahead of CNN's projection.\n\nAfter no Georgia US Senate candidate received 50% of the vote in November, the races turned to two runoffs with control of the Senate at stake. While Ossoff and Warnock ran on a unity ticket, Trump refused to concede his own loss, sparking a fight within the Republican Party and disenchanting some of his supporters, who believed his false claims that the vote was rigged.\n\nTrump's ongoing onslaught against the Republican officials in charge of the elections pressured the two GOP senators, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, to make a choice: Join the President in seeking to overturn the democratic outcome or risk losing Trump supporters.\n\nDespite three recounts and no evidence of widespread fraud, Loeffler and Perdue decided to join the President in supporting an objection to Congress' certification of the Electoral College's results on Wednesday in a final, deluded display of devotion to Trump supporters.\n\nI'm obviously disappointed, said Eric Tanenblatt, a longtime Georgia Republican strategist. Clearly the distractions and sideshows impacted the outcome.\n\nProgressives are already looking at how Democrats should use their newfound power, advocating for the Senate to go nuclear and eliminate the filibuster, which requires that most legislation obtain 60 votes to advance, in order to pass a more ambitious agenda. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York dodged a question on Wednesday on whether his caucus will lower the threshold to a simple majority vote, saying it is united in wanting big, bold change and would discuss the best ways to get that done.\n\nHe said that one of the first bills he'd like to pass as Senate majority leader would provide $2,000 stimulus checks to help Americans suffering from the coronavirus pandemic, which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, recently blocked despite President Donald Trump's support for enhanced aid. Democratic senators, who have been in the minority for six years, are now evaluating how to wield their gavels across various committees to address the health and economic crises.\n\nGeorgia's voters delivered a resounding message yesterday: they want action on the crises we face and they want it right now, said Biden in a statement. On Covid-19, on economic relief, on climate, on racial justice, on voting rights and so much more.\n\nSchumer will have a minuscule margin for error balancing the priorities of the left and the politically vulnerable.\n\nDemocrats acknowledged the intraparty fight to come. Maine independent Sen. Angus King, who caucuses with the Democrats, told CNN that he is very reluctant to eliminate the filibuster but looks forward to changing the rules to disincentivize its abuse.\n\nMontana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, a moderate who faces a 2024 election in his red state, said on Wednesday that he hoped the filibuster would remain to encourage bipartisanship.\n\nBipartisan legislation tends to stand the test of time, said Tester.\n\nBut the left wants Schumer to get rid of it so that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, and the Senate can pass their long-awaited wish list. Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley tweeted on Wednesday that the movement to end cash bail, abolish Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and support Black lives organized to deliver Congress and the White House. It's time we deliver for them, she said.\n\nA Democratic-led Senate could also confirm Biden's nominees without Republican support, allowing the new administration to go bolder in its Cabinet picks and begin to overhaul the conservatives' massive gains on the judicial bench over the past four years.\n\nBiden plans to pick federal Judge Merrick Garland for attorney general, creating a vacancy on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. If McConnell were in charge of the Senate, the Biden administration might've gone with someone like former Alabama Democratic Sen. Doug Jones to avoid the Kentucky Republican's influence over that critical judicial vacancy.\n\nObviously, with Democratic control [of the Senate], the ability of Joe Biden to move nominations forward will be easier, said Schumer.\n\nPerdue and Loeffler entered the Senate runoffs with some advantages. Loeffler, one of the richest members of Congress, spent tens of millions on her race, while Perdue, a first-term senator and former Fortune 500 CEO, has earned over 88,000 more votes than the 33-year-old Ossoff two months ago.\n\nWarnock and Ossoff campaigned on ending the coronavirus crisis, which has infected more than 20.8 million Americans and killed at least 354,000, in order to reopen the economy. They pushed for debt-free public college and a new Voting Rights Act. And they attacked the Republican senators for their multimillion-dollar stock transactions during the pandemic, alleging that they profited off it. The senators have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nBut Loeffler's and Perdue's campaigns were quickly subsumed by Trump's attacks on the Democratic outcome. Trump recently appeared to pressure Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on a private call, urging him to find enough votes to reverse his loss in Georgia, a state that every GOP presidential candidate had won since 1996. Raffensperger, a Republican, refused.\n\nPerdue and Loeffler attempted to sidestep the intraparty fight by focusing their remarks on their Democratic opponents.\n\nPerdue's closing message was littered with attacks, saying in a minute-long video that if Republicans lose, undocumented immigrants will vote, Americans' private health insurance will be taken away, and Democrats will pack the Supreme Court and defund the police.\n\nWe win Georgia, we save America, said Perdue to the camera.\n\nBut Warnock and Ossoff countered that they would demilitarize rather than defund the police, create a legal pathway for undocumented immigrants and support a public option to decrease the number of uninsured. Neither Democratic candidate has advocated adding justices to the court.\n\nKelly Loeffler spends tens of millions of dollars to scare you, said Warnock in an ad. She's trying to make you afraid of me because she's afraid of you. Afraid that you understand how she's used her position in the Senate to enrich herself and others like her. Afraid that you'll realize that we can do better.\n\nNow, Democrats will confront the question of how far they will go following the Trump administration. They spent Wednesday celebrating their quick reversal of fortune after being so long out of power.\n\nI think we're going to do big things, said Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. I think that the overwhelming number of Democrats are pointing in the same direction on all of this. Some faster than others, but all in the same direction.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.
Source: CNN\n\nThe Iowa Democratic Party has released updated vote numbers and a new national delegate estimate after completing their review of 95 precincts which campaigns had flagged as potentially inaccurate.\n\nWith these updates in place, Pete Buttigieg holds a 0.1% lead over Bernie Sanders in the state delegate equivalent count, which determines the winner of the Iowa caucuses. That margin is unchanged from the previously announced results.\n\nIf there are no requests to recanvass or recount, Buttigieg would be the winner of the Iowa caucuses. According to the Iowa Democratic Party, he will claim 14 delegates. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will receive 12, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren will get eight, former Vice President Joe Biden will receive six, and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar will get one.\n\nThe party said it has revised 55 precinct reports -- 3% of precincts -- after campaigns had raised some reports of inconsistencies following Monday's caucuses.\n\nThe reviews come after campaigns for Buttigieg, Sanders and Warren submitted their respective evidence of inconsistencies to the Iowa Democratic Party.\n\nChaos engulfed the Iowa caucuses last week, with issues arising from a faulty app, an overwhelmed call-in line and lack of clarity from the party delaying the official release of the results from the Hawkeye State, leading some top Democrats to call for the state to lose its first in the nominating calendar position.\n\nThat chaos has allowed both Buttigieg and Sanders to claim victory, and helped obscure less than strong performances by candidates like Biden.\n\nIowa Democratic Party Chair Troy Price told reporters Friday that the mistakes made during the Iowa caucuses were categorically unacceptable, but dodged most questions about the issues surrounding the mistakes by saying they will be made public through the course of the (independent) investigation that the party plans to undertake.\n\nAt the heart of the issue is whether the party can correct obvious mistakes that are made on worksheets that precinct chairs fill out across the state during the Iowa caucuses. The worksheets, which the party noted are legal documents, are meant to show the work that each caucus volunteer did on caucus night, but campaigns have flagged mistakes made on those worksheets.\n\nOfficials from the party said on Sunday they cannot alter the data written on the signed caucus math worksheet, a party aide told reporters on Sunday.\n\nWe cannot go back and change results because it would be us changing the data, changing the information provided from each of the precincts, the aide said.\n\nThe Iowa Democratic Party cannot go in and make changes, one aide added.\n\nWe follow the math worksheets and we are obligated to report what is given to us, said another aide.\n\nNo campaigns have currently called for a full recanvass of all nearly 1,700 caucus sites in Iowa, though Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir told CNN Sunday night the Sanders campaign plans to ask for a partial recanvass of the results on Monday.\n\nYou can expect us to be asking the Iowa Democratic Party for a recanvass of the discrepancies that we have identified and found tor them. We'll be searching for and identifying even more. It's been handled incompetently from our perspective, and we'll be asking them to take a look at some of these obvious discrepancies that have affected our count and I think after it is all said and done, it should be the case that we have the same number of national delegates as Pete Buttigieg, Shakir said.\n\nBut you can expect some action from the Sanders campaign tomorrow, he said.\n\nButtigieg has signaled that he's not inclined to call for a recanvass and said on Friday that he would leave it to the party to decide on what is necessary.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Sunday.

(Photo by Rich Polk/Getty Images for Politicon )\n\n(CNN Business) —\n\nSusan Zirinsky, a 46-year veteran of CBS News and the top producer of the 48 Hours newsmagazine, is about to become the first woman to run the network's news division.\n\nCBS News president David Rhodes is stepping down in March. Zirinsky will succeed him.\n\nStaffers were thrilled about Zirinsky's promotion. When I heard the news last night, I was doing the happy dance, Gayle King said on CBS This Morning Monday morning.\n\nKing likened CBS News to a ship, not sinking – but taking on water – and I feel that she is somebody who can right the ship. Because she gets us. She knows us. And by us I mean this organization.\n\nKing's co-host Norah O'Donnell agreed, calling Zirinsky a great journalist and producer. A new day is on the horizon, O'Donnell said.\n\nJoe Ianniello, the interim CEO of CBS, announced the news on Sunday night after CNN Business began to inquire about the imminent change.\n\nIanniello said Rhodes has decided the time is right to move on to new opportunities.\n\nRhodes' contract was set to expire in February, and there had been widespread speculation within the news division about his future, as CBS is cleaning house after the scandals that have plagued the news division, the network and its parent company recently.\n\nPHOTO: Ben Gabbe/Getty Images Susan Zirinsky will run CBS' news division.\n\nRatings woes have also been a major topic of conversation within CBS, although those difficulties are nothing new for the network's newscasts.\n\nRhodes will remain in the CBS fold as an adviser, the network said.\n\nI'm grateful to David for his 8 years with the Company, during which time he led CBS News with integrity and editorial rigor and launched CBSN, Ianniello wrote in an internal memo, referencing the company's digital news streaming network.\n\nIanniello described Zirinsky as a widely respected and trusted colleague.\n\nIndeed, Zirinsky, known as Z within the news division, is a popular figure, having worked in various roles there since 1972. She worked her way up at CBS and covered everything from Watergate to the Tiananmen Square uprising to royal weddings.\n\nYou may think of her as Holly Hunter from 'Broadcast News,' but she is so much more, Ianniello wrote, in a nod to the fact that Zirinsky inspired the Broadcast News character portrayed by Hunter. She was also a consultant on the film.\n\nI have been honored to work closely throughout my career with great CBS News journalists, Zirinsky said in a statement. This may be a new role, but the mission is the same: deliver quality, in-depth journalism and engaging storytelling. CBS News has an incredible legacy to build on. The public's interest today for news and information is intense, and CBS News is uniquely positioned to expand its reach.\n\nZirinsky will also have the title of senior executive producer — a sign that she will be closely involved in show production.\n\nBeing a producer is my oxygen and the core of who I am, Zirinksy told the Los Angeles Times in an interview about her promotion. I've got to manage money and contracts, but management people will be there for me. My whole approach is as a producer and that's what will differentiate us.\n\nCBS did not immediately name a replacement for her at 48 Hours.\n\nThe network has been upended by sexual misconduct scandals since late 2017, when CBS This Morning co-host Charlie Rose was fired one day after the Washington Post published sexual harassment allegations.\n\nRhodes found himself in an unenviable position, reporting to CBS CEO Les Moonves, who was the subject of rumors about his own behavior.\n\nThe New Yorker's Ronan Farrow published the first of two stories about allegations against Moonves in July 2018.\n\nMoonves admitted to some regrets, but denied any instances of nonconsensual sex. The CBS board commenced an investigation and pushed Moonves out in September. Ianniello has been running the company on an interim basis ever since.\n\nWithin days of Moonves' departure, Rhodes fired 60 Minutes executive producer Jeff Fager, a close ally of Moonves. Fager was accused of sending a menacing text message to a CBS reporter who was covering his uncertain future.\n\n60 Minutes still doesn't have a replacement executive producer.\n\nOther CBS News programs are also in flux. The morning show is without a top producer. Zirinsky will have to immediately turn her attention to those programs.\n\nRhodes, a former Fox News and Bloomberg executive, has been the president of CBS News since 2011. He emphasized a hard news direction for the division despite commercial pressures.\n\nIn a memo to staffers Sunday night, he did not signal what's next for him. But he wrote of his pride in the news division, saying we've proven our Real News commitment throughout. Our global news report is strong. And so are our people. I couldn't be prouder of our work together during these extraordinary times.
(CNN) —\n\nMaryland lawmakers approved a bill that lets rape victims impregnated during an attack ask a judge to end their assailants' parental rights.\n\nThe Rape Survivor Family Protection Act unanimously passed both chambers of the General Assembly last week. It allows a victim to ask a court to terminate a rapist's parental rights, even if the attacker hasn't been convicted of the crime, as long as there's clear and convincing evidence of guilt.\n\nGov. Larry Hogan indicated in his state of the state address that he would sign the bill.\n\nNo rapist should be allowed to maintain parental rights and no victim should be forced to interact with her attacker, Hogan said during the address last week. I commend you for finally passing the Rape Survivor Family Protection Act, and I will sign it into law the moment it reaches my desk.\n\nKathleen M. Dumais of the House of Delegates has fought for the legislation to be passed since 2007.\n\nIt has taken a long time to get this through and it's not a slam dunk, but It gives women access to the courts in these absolutely awful cases, says Dumais. There are not a lot of women in this situation, but I'm very pleased that those that are now have an avenue in that did not exist before.\n\nPrior to this legislation, women who had been raped and decided to keep the baby had to get consent from their rapists in order to give up the baby for adoption, or if they decided to raise the child their rapist could fight them for custody rights.\n\nThere were even cases where these men would use it as a bargaining chip to avoid criminal prosecution, said Dumais. They would agree to give up their parental rights if the woman agreed not to press charges.\n\nIt's going to be an amazing thing to see that our clients get through these cases, and we'll be able to do something to help, said Lisae Jordan, director of the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault.\n\nUntil the bill's passage, Maryland was one of only a handful of states that still allow rapists to have parental rights. The others are New Mexico, Wyoming, North Dakota, Minnesota, Mississippi and Alabama. Mississippi currently has a bill being considered that if passed would make it possible to take away those rights.\n\nA problematic barrier\n\nForty-three other states and the District of Columbia have legislation that offers at least some protection to prevent rape victims from facing their attackers over parental rights; eight of those laws were just adopted in 2016.\n\nBut these legislative protections vary greatly. In 20 states and Washington, D.C., a rape conviction is required before a victim can request termination of parental rights.\n\nFor advocates, this is a problematic barrier, since the majority of sexual assaults don't even make it to prosecution, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2010, just 36% of the nearly 300,000 annual average rape or sexual assault victimizations were reported to police, the bureau reports. Even when you look at both reported and unreported rapes during that time period, roughly 12% of victimizations resulted in arrests.\n\nThat means in nearly half the states that have legislation meant to prevent rapists from claiming parental rights, a victim is still vulnerable to having to face her attacker if there wasn't a conviction in her case – and that's if she reported it and if it was prosecuted.\n\nCNN's Gabriela Milan, Mercedes Leguizamon, Breeanna Hare and Lisa Rose contributed to this report.

A new study pinpoints key brain regions that activate when someone sticks to a political belief One expert offers advice on how to challenge someone's political views -- without fighting\n\n(CNN) —\n\nA new study holds clues as to why we get so passionate about politics.\n\nWhen your political views are challenged, the brain becomes active in regions associated with personal identity, threat response and emotions, according to the study.\n\nWe think it's because political beliefs are important to our identity, to our sense of who we are. They are part of our social selves as well and can define who we spend time with and how they relate to us, said Jonas Kaplan, assistant research professor of psychology at the University of Southern California's Brain and Creativity Institute, who was lead author of the study.\n\nWhen the brain considers something to be part of itself, whether it's a body part or a belief, then it protects it in the same way, he said.\n\nNow, the researchers hope that their findings could shed light on how to talk politics without provoking a brawl.\n\nHow politics makes us emotional\n\nThe study, published in the journal Scientific Reports last month, involved 40 healthy adults who identified themselves as politically liberal.\n\nThey were asked to read eight political statements that aligned with their beliefs, such as Abortion should be legal and Taxes on the wealthy should generally be increased. They also were asked to read eight nonpolitical statements, such as Taking a daily multivitamin improves one's health and A college education generally improves a person's economic prospects.\n\nAfter reading each statement, each participant was shown evidence challenging the statement. While they were reading the statements and counter-evidence, their brains were scanned in a functional MRI machine.\n\nThen, the participants completed questionnaires intended to gauge just how strongly they agreed with each statement they had seen.\n\nAfter examining the brain scans, the researchers found that when the participants were presented with evidence that challenged the political statements they agreed with, increased activity occurred in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and decreased activity in the orbitofrontal cortex.\n\nThe dorsomedial prefrontal cortex is associated with emotion regulation and the orbitofrontal cortex with cognitive flexibility, Kaplan said.\n\nThese are two regions we didn't specifically predict would play a role in our study, so we interpret them with some degree of caution, he said.\n\nWhen presented with counter-evidence, we found that people who showed more amygdala activity while being challenged were less likely to change their minds, Kaplan said.\n\nThe amygdala is a part of the brain associated with emotion, fear and anxiety.\n\nThe study finding suggests that increased amygdala activity may be associated with increased skepticism of the counter-evidence and could be an important neural signal that a person is less likely to be persuaded.\n\nPHOTO: Brain andCreativity Institute/USC The amygdala -- the two almond-shaped areas hugging the center of the brain near the front -- tends to become active when people stick to their political beliefs, according to the new study.\n\nAdditionally, the researchers found that participants were significantly more likely to be persuaded to change their beliefs when provided with counter-evidence for the nonpolitical statements than for the political statements.\n\nPHOTO: Brain andCreativity Institute/USC This chart shows how likely participants in the study were willing to reconsider their political beliefs compared with nonpolitical beliefs, with 0 being the least likely. Participants were more likely to adjust nonpolitical beliefs than political ones.\n\nMore research is needed to attempt to replicate the study findings in a group of conservatives or less strongly committed liberals, Kaplan said.\n\nThere are also several ways in which political beliefs differ from nonpolitical beliefs, and from this study alone, we weren't able to explore them all to understand what is the real basis for the differences we found, he said. For example, this group of people, chosen for their strong political beliefs, probably had more existing knowledge about the political topics we challenged compared with the nonpolitical topics.\n\nKaplan hopes further research could shed light on how to effectively challenge a political view without triggering an emotional response, he said.\n\nTips for talking politics\n\nThe new study is in line with prior research that also has showed how challenges to political beliefs are associated with emotional responses from the brain, said Drew Westen, a professor of psychology and psychiatry at Emory University in Atlanta and author of The Political Brain. He was not involved in the new study.\n\nIn order to effectively challenge someone's political views without triggering an emotional response, Westen said, your counterargument should do two things: solve the problem at the root of the political belief and address the values attached to the belief.\n\nThe last thing to do is to try to argue someone out of a belief when they're strongly committed to it emotionally, because what makes it so strong is the emotion attached to it, not the facts or arguments that support it, Westen said.\n\nIn addition, you solve the problem for them, he said. You are addressing what their problem is, and when you do that, you don't have to fight with them about what the facts are, because you're going to change them.\n\nConsider abortion, a hot topic that was included in the new study. Westen used the example of someone who is for abortion rights talking to someone with anti-abortion views to explain how to identify, address and empathize with someone's values to challenge beliefs.\n\nThe key is to identify the other person's values, even if they differ from your own.\n\nWords like 'reproductive health' sound like you're discounting their moral concerns and seeing this as just a medical issue. You don't want to come from a medical perspective, he said. If you instead say, 'You know, I just don't like the idea of the government telling a woman or a couple when they should or shouldn't start their family.' … Now you're activating two completely different neural networks than you've activated before: one about government interference in our private lives and the other about families.\n\nHe added, it also makes this a man's issue and not just a woman's issue, so men feel, correctly, like they have skin in the game, too.\n\nIf you want to end a conversation before it gets heated, simply agree to disagree, Daniel Post Senning, an etiquette expert from the Emily Post Institute, said in November.\n\nYou are also not obligated to have these conversations, Senning said. If you are willing to cede the last word or acknowledge that your opinions may differ, it's very hard to argue with that.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nNow that neuroscientists better understand how the brain responds emotionally to political beliefs, it's equally important to study what happens in the brain when you might be persuaded to change your beliefs, Kaplan said.\n\nWhile it makes sense to defend the beliefs that are important to us, it's also crucial that we are able to change them when it's appropriate to do so, he said.
(CNN) A new Chinese coronavirus, a cousin of the SARS virus, has infected hundreds since the outbreak began in Wuhan , China, in December. Scientist Leo Poon, who first decoded the virus, thinks it likely started in an animal and spread to humans.\n\nWhat we know is it causes pneumonia and then doesn't respond to antibiotic treatment, which is not surprising, but then in terms of mortality, SARS kills 10% of the individuals, Poon, a virologist at the School of Public Health at The University of Hong Kong, said.\n\nIt's not clear how deadly the Wuhan coronavirus will be, but fatality rates are currently lower than both MERS and SARS. Experts stress that it will change as the outbreak develops.\n\nThe World Health Organization offered guidance to countries on how they can prepare for it, including how to monitor for the sick and how to treat patients. Here's what you should know about coronaviruses.\n\nWhat is a coronavirus?\n\n. In rare cases, they are what scientists call zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans, according to the Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that are common among animalsIn rare cases, they are what scientists call zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nCoronavirus symptoms\n\nThe viruses can make people sick, usually with a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness , similar to a common cold. Coronavirus symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, possibly a headache and maybe a fever, which can last for a couple of days.\n\nFor those with a weakened immune system, the elderly and the very young, there's a chance the virus could cause a lower, and much more serious, respiratory tract illness like a pneumonia or bronchitis.\n\nThere are a handful of human coronaviruses that are known to be deadly.\n\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome , also known as the MERS virus, was first reported in the Middle East in 2012 and also causes respiratory problems, but those symptoms are much more severe. Three to four out of every 10 patients infected with MERS died, according to the CDC.\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome, also known as SARS, is the other coronavirus that can cause more severe symptoms. First identified in the Guangdong province in southern China, according to the WHO , it causes respiratory problems but can also cause diarrhea, fatigue, shortness of breath, respiratory distress and kidney failure. Depending on the patient's age, the death rate with SARS ranged from 0-50% of the cases, with older people being the most vulnerable.\n\nThe Wuhan coronavirus is currently thought to be more mild than SARS and MERS and takes longer to develop symptoms. Patients to date have typically experienced a mild cough for a week followed by shortness of breath, causing them to visit the hospital, explains Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at the University of Oxford. So far, around 15% to 20% of cases have become severe, requiring, for example, ventilation in the hospital.\n\nHow it spreads\n\nViruses can spread from human contact with animals. Scientists think MERS started in camels, according to the WHO. With SARS, scientists suspected civet cats were to blame. Officials do not yet know what animal may have caused the current outbreak in Wuhan.\n\nWhen it comes to human-to-human transmission of the viruses, often it happens when someone comes into contact with an infected person's secretions, such as droplets in a cough.\n\nHuman-to-human transmission has been confirmed for the Wuhan coronavirus, but experts are now trying to understand who is transmitting it most, who is at most risk and whether transmission is occurring mostly in hospitals or in the community. SARS and MERS were largely transmitted inside hospitals, Horby said. Some people are also considered to be superspreaders.\n\nWho is affected?\n\nMERS, SARS and the Wuhan coronavirus appear to cause more severe disease in older people, though uncertainty remains around the latest outbreak. Of the cases of Wuhan coronavirus reported so far, none are yet confirmed to be among children, Horby said. The average age is people 40 or over, he said.\n\nCoronavirus treatment\n\nThere is no specific treatment, but research is underway. Most of the time, symptoms will go away on their own and experts advise seeking care early. If symptoms feel worse than a standard cold, see your doctor.\n\nDoctors can relieve symptoms by prescribing a pain or fever medication. The CDC says a room humidifier or a hot shower can help with a sore throat or cough.\n\nDrink plenty of fluids, get rest and sleep as much as possible.\n\nShould you worry about the Wuhan coronavirus?\n\nThe Wuhan coronavirus fatality rate is lower than for SARS and MERS, but still comparable to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, explains Neil Ferguson, professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College London.\n\nIt is a significant concern, globally, Ferguson says, noting that we don't fully understand the severity.\n\nFerguson believes the fatality rate is likely to be lower due to an iceberg of milder cases we are yet to find, but he highlights that novel viruses spread much faster through a population.\n\nHow can you can prevent it?\n\nYou may be able to reduce your risk of infection by avoiding people who are sick. Try to avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Wash your hands often with soap and water and for at least 20 seconds.\n\nAwareness is key. If you are sick and have reason to believe it may be the Wuhan coronavirus due to travel to the region or coming into contact with someone who has been there, you should let a health care provider know and seek treatment early.\n\nCover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze, and disinfect the objects and surfaces you touch.\n\nIf traveling to China, be aware of symptoms and avoid live animal markets, which is where the latest outbreak began in Wuhan.\n\nCoronavirus and pregnancy\n\nIn pregnant women, the more severe versions of MERS and SARS coronaviruses can be serious. There are cases in which a woman infected with MERS had a stillbirth, a 2014 study showed.\n\nSARS-associated illnesses were linked to cases of spontaneous abortion, maternal death and critical maternal illness, a 2004 study found\n\nCoronavirus and cats, dogs and other animals\n\nPets can catch coronaviruses and the infections can become severe. Sometimes the viruses can lead to deadly diseases. One can cause feline infectious peritonitis in cats and something called a pantropic canine coronavirus can infect cats and dogs, according to a 2011 study.\n\nCats can catch SARS, but none of the infected cats developed symptoms, according to the study. The feline coronavirus typically is asymptomatic, but can cause mild diarrhea. Feline infectious peritonitis , or FIP, can cause flu-like symptoms for a cat, but can also be more serious for cats and can cause organ failure, but it is not contagious and will not spread from animal to animal or person to person.\n\nThese particular dog and cat viruses don't seem to spread to humans.
Rep. Himes: Congress in the thrall of the NRA
Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n\nMoments ago, Chief Justice John Roberts just shot down Sen. Rand Paul's question on the Senate floor because it named the alleged Ukraine whistleblower.\n\nSo is it a crime to out a government whistleblower? Turns out, the answer isn't as simple as it may seem. It depends on who does the unmasking, and the circumstances surrounding it.\n\nIt is true, no law explicitly prevents anyone, other than the inspector general and their staff, from revealing the name of a whistleblower. But that doesn't mean it's legal.\n\nAn outed government whistleblower could certainly lodge a complaint, and depending on the circumstances, it could result in criminal action. At the moment, there is significant debate over the question, since whistleblower protections are largely based on precedent and the current situation has entered some uncharted territory.\n\nYou can read more about this here.\n\nWatch the moment:
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) With the Lunar New Year round the corner, Chinese around the world are preparing to welcome the Year of the Dog.\n\nBut in Malaysia, where people of ethnic Chinese descent make up almost a quarter of the population, images of the dog have been omitted from Lunar New Year decorations and merchandise for fear of offending the country's Muslim majority.\n\nThe omission has raised hackles in the Chinese community and caused concern among Malaysians of all faiths, who see it as yet another symptom of the country's growing Islamic conservatism, driven by the government's flirtation with hardline Islamist policies and a cultural shift by religious students returning from the Middle East.\n\nSunway Pyramid, a busy shopping mall just outside the country's capital of Kuala Lumpur, is one of several major commercial hubs that has opted not to depict dogs, which are considered unclean by many Muslims, in its Lunar New Year decorations.\n\nBacklash\n\nSunway Pyramid decided not to display dogs because they wanted to be respectful to what they perceive as Muslim sensitivities, but it suffered for its decision.\n\nA communications officer for the mall said her company has been the target of a backlash on social media for its decision not to display contentious cultural emblems, with calls for a boycott of its mall.\n\nMs Tan, a 40-year-old Malaysian-Chinese shopkeeper in the mall, who declined to give her full name, said: This is a multiracial country, when they do something like that it shows disrespect to the Chinese race here.\n\nIf this is the case they should just make this only an Islamic country, but we have Buddhists, Hindus and other... (religions) as well here, she added.\n\nSeveral shops selling the customary red and gold new year decorations in Kuala Lumpur's Chinatown have kept those featuring dogs inside rather than on display out front.\n\nLast month, Reuters reported that Pavillion Mall, a shopping mall in the heart of Kuala Lumpur which gets about 3 million monthly visitors, also chose not to depict dogs in its decorations, citing religious and cultural sensitivities as a factor in their decision.\n\nEarlier this year, a hypermarket chain around the country was embroiled in controversy when it emerged that Lunar New Year t-shirts being sold there depicted 10 animals in the Chinese zodiac, but not the dog or the pig.\n\nIn Year of the Dog, Malaysian businesses play down dog decorations https://t.co/GoST5uZLGu\n\n\n\nMulticultural Malaysia has seen an increasing intolerance towards things considered insulting to Islam, & Muslim leaders have previously been vocal against dogs. pic.twitter.com/yHDfnOdKGl — Zurairi A.R. (@zurairi) January 23, 2018\n\nThe 2018 Lunar New Year isn't the only time that animals considered taboo in Islam have caused public furor. There were outcries when Malaysia in 2016 ordered eateries and fast food chains such as Auntie Anne's and A&W to change the name of dishes such as 'Pretzel Dog' and 'Coney Dog' to 'Pretzel Sausage' and 'Beef Coney' or 'Chicken Coney'.\n\nThe reason? The country's Islamic department said 'dog' would confuse Muslims.\n\nMalaysia's 30-million population is estimated to be 60% Malay Muslim, with prominent Chinese, Indian and other minorities.\n\nThough Islam is Malaysia's official religion and the country has Sharia courts for civil cases for Muslims, it is constitutionally secular.\n\nSecularism disappearing\n\nMaria Chin Abdullah, a prominent pro-democracy activist, says what's happening with the Lunar New Year decorations are just small signs of growing Islamic conservatism.\n\nThe secularism in our system that we enjoyed seems to be disappearing.\n\nAs evidence, Chin pointed to the increasing frequency with which Malay women now wear the tudung, (headscarf), the Arabisation of Malay vocabulary -- for example the word Eid being used for the Islamic religious holiday instead of the Malay Hari Raya Puasa, and books being banned for espousing moderate forms of Islam.\n\nAs the Year of the Dog approaches, some shops run by ethnic Chinese in Malaysia are keeping canine models inside instead of displaying them prominently to avoid causing offence in the Muslim-majority country.\n\nSchools have become less multi-racial and things are becoming scary, said Chin.\n\nMy own son will come back from school and tell me we can't touch dogs and ask why I'm not wearing a headscarf.\n\nOther critics have pointed to the presence in Malaysia of hardline Indian Muslim televangelist Zakir Naik. He is banned in the UK and his views have sparked a criminal investigation in his native India.\n\nLast year, Prime Minister Najib Razak's government confirmed it had given Naik permanent residency , a decision to which activists have mounted a legal challenge.\n\nIndian protesters hold placards as they shout slogans during a protest denouncing Islamic scholar Zakir Naik in New Delhi on July 18, 2016.\n\nNajib's support for more Islamist policies has grown since his ruling coalition lost the popular vote in the 2013 general election - its worst ever electoral performance - as he seeks to strengthen his hold on the ethnic Malay Muslim vote.\n\nMalaysia's evolution has raised alarm bells at the UN, which has urged the country to protect its tradition of tolerance from the rise of fundamentalism.\n\nI have heard worrying reports of attempts at Islamization spreading in many areas of society which could lead to cultural engineering, said UN human rights expert Karima Bennoune last year following a 10-day fact-finding mission to the country.\n\n'Conservatism is becoming worse'\n\nThe government, which is widely expected to win elections due before August, drew criticism last year for allowing the opposition Pan Malaysian Islamic Party to put forward a parliamentary bill calling for harsher punishments -- including more flogging - for moral crimes.\n\nMalaysia's nine sultans, the official guardians of Islam in Malaysia, last year issued a call f or religious harmony after what they described as excessive actions.\n\nAhmad Farouk Musa, founder of a moderate think-tank, Islamic Renaissance Front, is yet another who says Islamic conservatism is worsening.\n\nOne of the reasons is that Malaysia sends thousands of students to Saudi Arabia, where they are indoctrinated with hardline intolerant forms of Islam like Salafism and Wahhabism.\n\nThey bring back intolerant ideas, for example, a hatred of Shias. That never existed in Malaysia before, he added.\n\nBut there's another fundamental problem that dates back to the birth of the country - its race-based political system.\n\nParties set up on ethnic lines originated under the country's former colonial rulers, the British, who imported Chinese and Indian labor to Malaysia, largely keeping Malays in impoverished rural areas.\n\nDecorative dog figurines are seen for sale ahead of the Lunar New Year celebrations in Kuala Lumpur's Chinatown on January 26, 2018.\n\nAfter Malaysia won independence in 1957, its new leaders granted privileges to Malays, including cheaper land, easier access to tertiary education and preference for civil service jobs, to try to help them reach economic parity with the Chinese community.\n\nThis policy was strengthened in 1969 after Malay animosity over increasing Chinese economic and political power boiled over into a race riot in Kuala Lumpur in which scores of people, mostly Chinese, were killed.\n\nReformists argue the system has made Malays dependent on handouts and has bred demagoguery that thrives on religious and ethnic tension.
A man wears a mask while out on the street in Wuhan. Getty Images\n\nThe Wuhan coronavirus has sparked alarm around the world, but in Asia, it's also brought up memories of a deadly virus.\n\nTo many, the latest outbreak feels eerily similar to 2003, when severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) swept through the region, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing 774.\n\nBut while the Wuhan coronavirus and SARS are caused by a similar virus, they're not exactly the same. Here's how the two stack up.\n\nOrigin: Both the SARS and Wuhan outbreaks started in China -- and both are believed to have originated from wild animal markets.\n\nNumber of infections: More than 7,700 people worldwide have been infected with the Wuhan coronavirus since December. By comparison, there were 8,098 confirmed cases of SARS between November 2002 to July 2003.\n\nCases in China overtake SARS: It has taken less than two months to infect around 75% of the number infected by SARS over a nine month period. In China, the number of confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus has already exceeded the number infected by SARS in 2002 and 2003.\n\nNumber of deaths: 774 people died during the SARS outbreak, with the vast majority in mainland China and Hong Kong. This time, 170 people have died of the virus -- and so far, they have all been in mainland China.\n\nIdentifying the virus: One of the biggest differences between SARS and this current outbreak is how fast it was reported and how soon scientists were able to identify it. China informed the World Health Organization about the new virus on December 31, 2019, about three weeks after the first case was detected. The virus behind the outbreak was identified on January 7. Beijing was also able to identify the genome and informed other countries about it. Still, there are concerns that the scale of the problem may be far worse than the official figures let on.\n\nRead the full story here.
A version of this story appeared in the January 6 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday\n\n(CNN) The United States saw its deadliest 24 hours of the pandemic yesterday, with 3,770 Covid-19 deaths reported in a single day.\n\nThe country has been adding 1 million new infections every four to six days since late November, and the total US case count topped 21 million Tuesday. A record 131,100 people are currently hospitalized with coronavirus across the nation, according to the Covid Tracking Project.\n\nIt will likely get worse. Experts have said that holiday travel and gatherings could help fuel another surge of infections.\n\nIn California, officials say ICU units in at least two regions are filled to practical capacity. Some EMTs have had to wait with patients outside hospitals for hours because the facilities don't immediately have space to take them in.\n\nThe tragic toll of the pandemic is still mounting. According to new preliminary data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Covid-19 was likely the third leading cause of death in the country in 2020 after heart disease and cancer. The CDC estimated there had been between 316,252 and 431,792 excess deaths in 2020, with more than 300,000 of those directly attributable to the coronavirus.
Stan Van Gundy is running away from me.\n\nOK, not running.\n\nBut he is moving quickly across the parking lot of the Quest Multisport facility in Chicago, his forehead peppered by beads of sweat, strands of his thinning salt-and-pepper hair waving in the wind. (As always, his mustache is magnificent.)\n\nHe makes for a black Lincoln Navigator that just pulled up, almost like a getaway ride.\n\nStan could just be trying to get to the airport. Lots of coaches are right now, what with the NBA Draft Combine wrapping up and all.\n\nOr...\n\nHe could be fleeing, knowing the questions I have for him. After all, I have been trying to reach him the last few weeks, and Detroit's media reps say they've been telling him to call.\n\nAnd Stan has not called.\n\nI saw him earlier today. Maybe I should have asked him then. The timing just didn't feel right. He was occupied. I was distracted. We were at neighboring urinals.\n\nAnyway, here I am, chasing him across a parking lot. Do you have a minute for like two questions?\n\nVideo Play Button Videos you might like\n\nSorry, gotta run! he says. And then he's gone.\n\nCan't say I wasn't warned. His brother, Jeff, told me the week before, Yeah, he won't want to talk to you about that.\n\nThat being our investigation.\n\nThe subject: the fashion of NBA coaches.\n\nAt its core, one question: Why the hell do they all still wear suits?\n\nBaseball managers wear the same uniforms as their players. (Joe Maddon in a suit in the dugout? Not happening.)\n\nIn the NFL, where coaches once wore suits, now they wear team pullovers or polos—or, of course, hoodies with the sleeves chopped off. (I'd bet anything that if it was easier than the hoodie, Bill Belichick would go full-on baseball manager and coach in a football uniform.)\n\nYet the NBA coaches' dress code grows more strict: Only a few years ago, they were explicitly prohibited from wearing anything other than collared shirts under suit jackets.\n\nSo within these rigid requirements, do these men of sport feel truly free? Our core question is about more than clothing. It's about the very nature of identity.\n\nOK, not really.\n\n(Brian Konnick for B/R Mag)\n\nMainly, we just want to figure out whether coaches actually like wearing suits all the time—and, cutting to the chase, we want to answer the most important question of all: Who would be the basketball Belichick?\n\nThere are some obvious candidates. There's Stan—he just looks like he'd prefer a hoodie, or at least something other than a suit (though that's not exactly why I chased him).\n\nGregg Popovich, though, seems the most likely by a mile. His persona runs in almost perfect parallel to that of Belichick: the secretive genius leader of a dynasty, rarely giving the media much more than a hard time, unconcerned with silly things like image and fashion because he's too busy winning. Would he prefer to coach in a hoodie, too? (Could that have given the Spurs yet more magic this season?)\n\nIndeed, we did find basketball's Belichick.\n\nBut he's not Pop—and he was not easy to find.\n\nB/R Mag put in interview requests with virtually every NBA coach, a few international and college coaches, some NFL and college football coaches, and some baseball managers.\n\nVirtually all said requests were respectfully declined (or ignored).\n\nJeff Van Gundy's take on coaches' game attire can be summed up with one quote: It's just something you have to do, so you do it. Really, who cares?\n\nNobody thinks about wearing sweats or any of that kind of stuff, says Dallas head coach Rick Carlisle, who's also president of the National Basketball Coaches Association. That's just not how we do it.\n\nCould it really be that simple?\n\nCould it be that coaches have better things to do than return phone calls about their clothes?\n\nOr...\n\nCould it be a conspiracy?\n\nAs far back as Carlisle and former NBA Commissioner David Stern and anyone else can remember, coaches have been required to wear suits. It's become such a procedural part of our business, Carlisle says, that this is just, you know, part of the job description.\n\nTo Carlisle, this is all very beautiful. He goes on at length about Pat Riley and the late Chuck Daly, who wore all Armani and Hugo Boss back in the '80s and '90s. They really set the tone for coaches going forward, he says with reverence.\n\nIndeed, Riley's influence carries on even to the youngest generation. Take Earl Watson, the Phoenix Suns' head coach and, at 37, the second-youngest coach in the NBA. There is an entire Reddit thread dedicated to his fashion sense, calling him the best-dressed coach in the league. Riley—one of the many to decline our interview requests—was a role model for him, both in coaching and in fashion. [Riley] was tough, Watson says. His teams were tough. But then, he was so stylish. I thought that was a great mix.\n\nFor the past eight seasons, the league has made following its fashion rules quite easy for coaches. (Devilishly easy?) Through a partnership with American designer Joseph Abboud, each coach starts the season with 12 free, custom-tailored suits. (Total value: about $10,000.)\n\nAbboud will tell you Doc Rivers wears his clothes best. Jason Kidd, too. Also Brad Stevens and Quin Snyder.\n\nAbboud defers when asked who could use improvement, nor does he offer insight as to who might be Belichickian. However, every NBA coach is part of this deal, and they all love it, the designer says.\n\nHowever, in all of this there are holes.\n\nOne: Not all NBA coaches truly are part of the Abboud deal because Watson is not. He uses his own designer. (Women have way better fashion sense than men, he says of his designer. He won't reveal her name, though. I want to stay different. Stay away from my person.)\n\n(Brian Konnick for B/R Mag)\n\nTwo: Indeed, contrary to Carlisle's sweeping claim, somebody does think about wearing sweats or any of that kind of stuff. There does exist a basketball Belichick.\n\nHe is also Earl Watson.\n\nI would rather wear some Jordans and a sweatsuit, Watson says. If they ever changed the sideline to be like football, I would definitely be in a cool hoodie, like Belichick. So extreme. That'd be a cool look.\n\nHow can this be? How, one moment, can Watson speak of passion for great fashion, and the next, of the casualness—even the sloppiness—of Belichick and his hoodies? How can such opposing forces truly coexist within a single human being?\n\nThe secret is fashion. He grins. Sloppy is the new swagger.\n\nHe elaborates: Cut some sleeves off, layer something underneath. Like, the Kanye look. I would have to go straight Kanye style. All his collections.\n\nHere's the thing: Watson is not alone.\n\nB/R Mag did not find just one basketball Belichick.\n\nWe found at least four.\n\nThe first thing you notice at the NBA Draft Combine in Chicago is that no coach or executive wears a suit.\n\nWatson is in sneakers, jeans and a sweater. Sure, they're all Tom Ford. But sneakers, jeans and a sweater nonetheless.\n\nKentucky's John Calipari might be dressed most formally in black leather shoes, jeans, white dress shirt and black blazer. And he's not even an NBA coach. Larry Bird is in khakis and a blue button-down. Luke Walton, in jeans and basketball shoes. Tom Thibodeau, an untucked polo. Doc Rivers, track jacket and ballcap. Phil Jackson wears green slacks and a blazer, but also casual leather shoes—and when he sits and his slacks ride up, they reveal white basketball socks with an NBA logo.\n\nStan Van Gundy wears dress shoes, slacks, Dri-Fit polo shirt and blazer, all in black.\n\nConvenient coincidence? Grown men making personal decisions to go business-casual when relatively out of the public eye?\n\nOr...\n\nObvious evidence that everyone actually hates suits?\n\nEven Carlisle wears loose, light-blue dad jeans, sneakers and a pullover.\n\nComfort?\n\nOr a cry for help?\n\nAsk around, and at first the coaches say all the proper things. Wearing suits makes them look good. The suits feel good. They make the league look good.\n\nAsk a little more, and they remain loyal. These are just the rules, they say. The rules are meant to be followed, they say. They love the rules, they say.\n\nBut then, press on, ask the right questions, tug the heartstrings, and—after two, even three, even four minutes of questioning—all is exposed.\n\nConsider Walton. He wears jeans, black basketball shoes and a dark pullover. I prefer sweatpants and a T-shirt, he says. So this is dressed up for me.\n\nThe Lakers public relations office told me he didn't want to talk about this, not even for five minutes on the phone. Yet when approached at the combine and told of an investigation into NBA coaching fashion, he speaks freely.\n\nI have no fashion, Walton says. He explains: I was raised by hippies, so fashion never really was a big deal to me growing up. There was four of us boys. We physically had closets, but there weren't clothes in them. We had a laundry room, and everything was hanging in the laundry room, and it was all—whoever came in and grabbed whatever, that's what you wore that day.\n\nHe likes the Joseph Abboud deal. I like free stuff, he says. But he wears his suits as little as possible, traveling to the stadium in sweats, changing into the suit at the last possible moment and then changing immediately after addressing the media and the team following games. Imagining a world where NBA coaches are free, he says: I'd be there in sweatpants and a sweatshirt. And I wear a backwards hat a lot. So I'd wear that.\n\nIn the interest of journalistic due diligence, a note: Walton's answers, same as the answers from the following men, were given with chuckles, even outright laughter. They expressed no outward signs of distress. They passed no secret handwritten notes asking for help.\n\nBut.\n\nKings coach Dave Joerger says making the effort to pick out a suit is the worst part of my day because, At 6 o'clock before a 7 o'clock game, at home, the last thing in the world I want to do is try to figure out what matches what.\n\nWhen approached and told of the investigation, Doc Rivers laughs and says, I'm the wrong guy. He seems stunned to hear that Abboud thinks so highly of his fashion.\n\nWell, I have always loved clothes, he says. And they do make it so easy. All I have to do is know what colors I want.\n\nRivers even freely answers a question that gives so many others pause: Given the chance, who's the league's Belichick? Without hesitation: Oh, Thibodeau!\n\nAs in Tom Thibodeau, the Minnesota Timberwolves coach.\n\n(Brian Konnick for B/R Mag)\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause just look at him!\n\nWhat says Thibodeau?\n\nHe...laughs. That, he says, actually would be the most comfortable.\n\nAh, comfort. A far-off look strikes Thibodeau's bright blue eyes. He mentions college coaches, during their preseason games, all polos and Hawaiian shirts. That, he sighs, would be nice.\n\nAs though realizing the disloyal nature of that comment, Thibodeau mentions the suits and adds, The professionalism of that look is good for the game.\n\nA pause.\n\nBut, he goes on, in terms of being pragmatic—\n\nA pause.\n\nIt probably would be better to be in—\n\nAnother pause.\n\nThen, haltingly, yet dreamily: Maybe...you know...a sweatshirt.\n\nAnd regarding Doc: Though Thibodeau embraces the label of the NBA's potential Belichick, he says Doc would indeed join him. If he was taking a truth serum, he says, I think he'd rather have a hoodie on and just relax.\n\nThibodeau sighs again and smiles. That's the way you're used to coaching, really, he says, seeming liberated. The football coaches, I think, are way ahead.\n\nDespite these revelations, all these coaches insist they are happy in their suits.\n\nEven Watson cannot help but find something beautiful in the strict dress code. He spoke the most eloquently and at length about all of this, rhapsodizing for some 20-30 minutes about it all—some 10 times longer most of the rest.\n\nHe says: It's important to … let the kids know that, once upon a time, I grew up in Nikes and sweats, and grew up in the inner city. And you just evolve as a person. Evolution is beautiful.\n\n(Brian Konnick for B/R Mag)\n\nBut then, would it not be evolution, too, if coaches became free to go full Belichick? Would that not also push coaching fashion forward? Would it not also, perhaps, push all of us?\n\nOh, I would put the right people around me, Watson says. He pulls out his phone, shows a picture of himself in his travel wear, a fitted Nike track suit just oozing swag. Something like that, maybe. Do something creative, he says. Make it cool, figure out what fits. Again, maybe Kanye style.\n\nHe shrugs, holding his palms out to his sides, up to the sky. Suits it is, though, he says. You can never change that look.\n\nWere Rick Carlisle's earlier statements about NBA coaches' lack of interest in fashion simply over-generalizations made during a brief interview by a busy man likely with a million better things on his mind than answering questions about NBA coaches' clothes?\n\nOr.\n\nWere they intentionally devious deceits, calculated to preserve and advance a decades-long fashion narrative?\n\nIn the early '90s, Carlisle was one of the icon Chuck Daly's assistant coaches for the New Jersey Nets. Daly gave him several of his custom-tailored jackets. I didn't know what really nice clothing was until then, Carlisle says. And when I put this stuff on, I was like, Wow. This is like another world. The quality of material—it just drapes on your body. Instead of feeling like you are wearing the jacket, it feels like the jacket is wearing you.\n\nThen there's what he said about Don Nelson, aka Nellie, a coach in the Riley and Daly years. You might know him for holding claim to the most wins of any coach in NBA history. Carlisle describes how Nelson went another way with his fashion. Chunky, jarring sneakers. Fish ties. T-shirts instead of collared shirts. One time, T-shirt and tie.\n\nBut, Carlisle says, he always got back on course. … A couple of points in time in our history, things got a little loose, and so there was some nudging certain folks back on course, if you will.\n\nThere recently was one coach who dared to be different—but then he, too, may have been subjected to A Nudging.\n\nThat man wore not collared shirts beneath his jacket, but rather, mock turtlenecks.\n\nThen, in 2010, the NBA coaches' dress code reportedly underwent an overhaul. In the overhaul, the apparent Nudge: Coaches must wear collared shirts or traditional turtlenecks under their jackets.\n\nWhat goes unstated, but certainly seems loud and clear: Mock turtlenecks are forbidden.\n\nSimple clarification of the dress code's original intent—or nefarious targeting of a man who might have inspired others to think differently?\n\nThat coach even said, if they were going to take his mock turtlenecks away, he'd at least like the rule named after him.\n\nIt was not.\n\nThe NBA's official stance, as a league spokesman told B/R Mag: Yes, the dress code was updated, as we do from time to time to reflect current fashion and the like. However, it would be inaccurate to suggest the change was made as a result of anything specific any individual coach was wearing.\n\nOnly that coach knows the truth.\n\nBy sharing his story and taking a stand, he could well be the spark for a fashion revolution—if not by way of his fashion sense itself, then at least the spirit of it.\n\nHowever, he won't respond to our inquiries.\n\nThat man was at the combine, too—but when approached, he fled across the Quest Multisport parking lot.\n\nThat man was Stan Van Gundy.\n\nAdditional reporting by Yaron Weitzman.\n\nBrandon Sneed is a writer-at-large for B/R Mag and the author of Head in the Game: The Mental Engineering of the World's Elite Athletes (out now from Dey Street).

Case in point, Fox News Sunday moderator Chris Wallace anticipated this trickery by Sarah Sanders: We know that roughly nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is southern border.\n\nWallace interrupted: I know the statistic. I didn't know if you were going to use it, but I studied up on this. Do you know what those 4,000 people come where they are captured? Airports.\n\nSanders said not always, purposefully trying to confuse and scare people. Airports, Wallace emphasized. The State Department says there hasn't been any terrorists found coming across the southern border.\n\nThank you, Chris Wallace…\n\nFacts v. emotional appeal\n\nThe Wallace interview especially stood out because other Fox shows have been promoting faulty stats to stir up fear. But it's definitely not just about stats. I was reminded of this while watching Fox & Friends this weekend, with its numerous segments about violent crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. Emotions trump reason.\n\nAs Security analyst Adam Isacson was quoted saying in Sunday's WaPo: They are stuck on this wall thing because of its emotional appeal.\n\nFear-mongering in action\n\nTrump and his aides are knowingly lying in the service of their political goal, Frank Bruni said on Sunday's Reliable Sources when I highlighted the Sanders/Wallace exchange.\n\nIt reminded me of this Post story from a few days ago. Ellen Nakashima reported that the DOJ has acknowledged errors and deficiencies in a controversial report issued a year ago that implied a link between terrorism in the United States and immigration, but — for the second and final time — officials have declined to retract or correct the document.\n\nNew Trump campaign ad warns about drugs and gangs\n\nThe fear-mongering is evident in this new Trump 2020 ad. The ad began airing on CNN on Saturday, so I brought it up on Sunday's show. Drugs, terrorists, violent criminals and child traffickers trying to enter our country – but Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer care more about the radical left than keeping us safe, the ad claims. The consequences? Drug deaths. Violent murder. Gang violence. We must not allow it…\n\nPelosi to Nielsen: I don't believe your facts\n\nThat brings us back to the fight over facts. The other day the WSJ described a tense exchange between Pelosi and DHS secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, with Pelosi interrupting Nielsen's presentation to dispute DHS data. CNN's Boris Sanchez had details in this story on Saturday — he said Pelosi twice cut into Nielsen's presentations to dismiss DHS statistics on border security as inaccurate.\n\nPer a W.H. official, Pelosi told Nielsen I don't believe your facts. A Pelosi aide told CNN: In presentations made, they have repeatedly used statistics not supported by fact. They're trying to cast every single migrant as a terrorist or someone with a violent criminal history. The secretary has proven herself to not be credible on these issues.\n\n– Important CNN piece: Fact-checking the DHS border presentation\n\nWhere does Trump get his facts?\n\nOn State of the Union, Jake Tapper raised a related issue – the president's sketchy sources of information — in a very newsy interview with new acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Tapper pointed out that managing the flow of info to Trump has been an issue for the past two years. Mulvaney responded: The president gets the best information that's available. He just does.\n\nTapper brought up the concern in the context of Trump's recent expression of support for the Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan… I also brought up Trump's revisionist history on Reliable, with David Frum, who has said that POTUS straight-up spouted Russian propaganda. Frum's question: How did this particular piece of disinformation get into the president's head? That's something you can't report, we can only surmise.\n\nWill news coverage move the needle?\n\nNews coverage is showing the impacts of the partial government shutdown – will it make a difference? Will the personal stories and the pictures of long airport security lines influence the negotiations?\n\n→ Headline on CNN.com right now: This family thought their troubles were over. Then the government shutdown left them in limbo.\n\nFrum says Trump coverage should be even tougher\n\nWith Jill Abramson causing controversy for saying her former paper, the NYT, is anti-Trump, we had a very interesting conversation on Sunday's show about what it means to be anti-Trump. (Abramson declined our interview requests because her book comes out in a month.)\n\nI don't think we've been anti-Trump. I think we have been negative. And I think that's the only honest way to cover this presidency, NYT op-ed columnist Frank Bruni said.\n\nDavid Frum went even further: Relative to the truth, the prestige press in this country has a pro-Trump bias. Relative to the truth, Trump gets easier coverage than he deserves. Watch him make the case here…\n\nHow Fox talks about impeachment\n\nWe know how POTUS feels – you can't impeach somebody that's doing a great job. But how do his Fox fans talk about it? Here are three examples…\n\n– On Sunday's F&F, Pete Hegseth called NYT's David Leonhardt a fraud for writing a column that said The US has never had a president as demonstrably unfit for the office as Trump. And it's becoming clear that 2019 is likely to be dominated by a single question: What are we going to do about it? Hegseth didn't bother engaging with the core points of the column…\n\n– Jeanine Pirro to Rep. Rashida Tlaib: Show me where in the Constitution, Rashida, it says you can impeach a president because you hate him?\n\n– Jesse Watters: If you impeach Trump, you get President Pence. Now imagine what kind of judges HE'LL name to the Supreme Court. They'll make Kavanaugh look like Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nNOW, FROM RIGHT TO LEFT…\n\nWe led Sunday's show with the Democratic power shift and how Dems are covered by the press in the Trump age. This Bill Kristol tweet caught my eye: As a non-Democrat, I'm struck by how much the media seem obsessed by possible rifts among Democrats, narrow lines they'll have to walk, stray utterances of their backbenchers, etc, than by the rather more massive fact that we have a president and administration in total meltdown. Is that true? Three CNN political commentators, all Democrats, joined me in the A block…\n\n– Symone Sanders talked about the disconnect between pundits and the public. It's really important that folks go on the ground, and that we're talking to real people…\n\n– Karen Finney (in her first appearance as a CNNer!) emphasized the importance of language. We can't be afraid to call out things that are racist or sexist…\n\n– Dan Pfeiffer said Trump drives clicks for media outlets so Democrats will have to rely on alternatives, from podcasts like his own (Pod Save America) to Instagram live chats…\n\nInside Sherrod and Schultz's 2020 discussions\n\nConnie Schultz, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist and the better half of Democratic senator Sherrod Brown, told me they will decide in the next two months about whether he'll run for president. I appreciated how candid she was about the decision-making process… We also talked about the framing of the 2020 primary, how female candidates like Elizabeth Warren are described differently, and more… Video of our TV interview is up now, and CNN's Devan Cole has a recap…\n\nPLUS: The full interview is on our podcast… Listen via Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, TuneIn, or your favorite app…\n\nRead more of Sunday's Reliable Sources newsletter… And subscribe here to receive future editions in your inbox…\n\nFOR THE RECORD\n\nBy Katie Pellico:\n\n– Anne Helen Petersen diagnoses Millennials as the burnout generation… (BuzzFeed)\n\n– A Grindr harassment suit could change the legal landscape for tech — and free speech.

Twitter is giving its trolls a facelift.\n\nTwitter (TWTR) is ditching the iconic egg avatar that appears as a default profile picture in favor of a more generic image of a dark gray disembodied head on a light gray background.\n\nOr it could be an uneven power outlet. We're really not sure, to be honest.\n\nIn a blog post published Friday, Twitter said the redesign is intended to encourage new and existing users to upload profile pictures rather than stick with the quirky egg.\n\nBut the company also notes the egg has become associated with negative behavior from trolls who create accounts simply to harass other users.\n\nRelated: Twitter takes another swipe at easing 140 character limit\n\nThe redesign led to more than a few jokes on Twitter (where else?) that the company is painting over a symbol of harassment on the platform rather than actually tackling the harassment itself.\n\nTWITTER Those egg accounts that spew venomous insults all day-\n\nME You banned them?\n\nTWITTER -we made their avatars look like car headrests — Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) March 31, 2017\n\nIn fact, Twitter has introduced new measures to crack down on harassment in recent months, but the problem persists.\n\nWhile the default avatar change may be superficial, it does highlight yet another example of Twitter undoing its signature design features.\n\nTwitter has begun chipping away at its 140 character limit, ditched favorites for likes and moved away from a reverse chronological timeline to one that relies partly on an algorithm.\n\nWith its user numbers stalled around 300 million and its stock in the gutter, Twitter is fighting to be more intuitive and approachable for a mainstream audience.\n\nOne day, however, Twitter may look in the mirror and not even recognize its own avatar.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nLawyers working for former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort accidentally revealed on Tuesday the clearest public evidence of coordination between the campaign and Russians, adding new details to the murky mosaic of potential collusion in 2016 – including sharing polling data with an alleged Russian operative.\n\nThe explosive new information was buried in a court filing from Manafort's lawyers, though the portions about his contacts with a shadowy Russian during the campaign were meant to be redacted.\n\nBut the document was fully searchable, even the blacked-out parts, revealing fresh details about the core of the ongoing investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the latest disclosures and how they might fit into the existing puzzle.\n\nRelationship with Kilimnik\n\nClose watchers of the investigation have been intrigued by the still-developing role of Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian political consultant who worked closely with Manafort in Ukraine. They helped Moscow-friendly politicians get elected and hold onto power for nearly a decade.\n\nManafort and Kilimnik stayed in touch after their Ukrainian clients were ousted in 2014. They met twice in the United States during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to their own public statements. News reports have detailed their phone calls and emails in 2016, including one exchange where Manafort tried to use Kilimnik to reach a prominent Russian oligarch.\n\nBut Tuesday's filing revealed they had a third meeting, this time in the Spanish capital of Madrid. One redacted portion quoted Mueller's team: After being told that Mr. Kilimnik had traveled to Madrid on the same day that Mr. Manafort was in Madrid, Mr. Manafort 'acknowledged' that he and Mr. Kilimnik met while they were both in Madrid. A spokesman for Manafort sought to clarify the filing in a statement Tuesday night, saying that the third meeting happened in early 2017, after the election.\n\nThe growing list of Manafort-Kilimnik contacts could be relevant to the collusion question because, according to previous court filings from Mueller, the FBI has assessed that Kilimnik has ties to a Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016.\n\nMany of their contacts happened while the Russian government was aggressively meddling in the US election. Court filings said Kilimnik was affiliated with the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency that was responsible for hacking Democratic targets and orchestrating the WikiLeaks releases.\n\nCNN reported in February 2017 that Manafort was among a handful of senior Trump advisers who were in constant communication with suspected Russian operatives during the campaign. At the time, Manafort told CNN in a statement, that is 100% not true, at least as far as me.\n\nSharing campaign polls\n\nBeyond the fact that Manafort was in regular touch with Kilimnik, the unredacted court filings shed new light on the content of some of their conversations. For the first time, the public learned that Manafort shared polling data about the 2016 campaign with his Russian friend.\n\nIssues and communications related to Ukrainian political events simply were not at the forefront of Mr. Manafort's mind during the period at issue and it is not surprising at all that Mr. Manafort was unable to recall specific details prior to having his recollection refreshed, Manafort's lawyers wrote. The same is true with regard to the Government's allegation that Mr. Manafort lied about sharing polling data with Mr. Kilimnik related to the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThere aren't any additional details – all this tells us is that Mueller believes that Manafort fed polling data to Kilimnik, possibly even polls commissioned by the Trump campaign.\n\nPolling data is a key part of any modern political operation – presidential campaigns and outside groups like super PACs spend millions of dollars on polls. These numbers can drive decisions on messaging, where to campaign and advertising, both on television and in the digital space.\n\nTrump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale ran Trump's data team in 2016. They've publicly touted about how they used data to target voters.\n\nIt's possible Manafort innocuously gave the polls to Kilimnik because he is a political junkie and wanted to dig into the crosstabs. But there's also a possibility that Kilimnik, with his active ties to Russian intelligence, funneled the information to Russian agents to influence the election.\n\nThe primary suspect would be the troll farm in St. Petersburg that essentially acted as a pro-Trump super PAC and pumped out political propaganda to millions of Americans on social media during the 2016 race. These messages can be targeted to specific demographics based on polling data. There aren't any publicly known ties between Kilimnik and the troll farm.\n\nUkraine peace plan\n\nTuesday's filing also unintentionally disclosed that Manafort and Kilimnik discussed a Ukraine peace plan.\n\nAfter being shown documents, Mr. Manafort 'conceded' that he discussed or may have discussed a Ukraine peace plan with Mr. Kilimnik on more than one occasion, the filing said. The document was filed by Manafort's team, but this line appears to quote a past Mueller filing.\n\nThe filing revealed no details about what the Ukraine plan would entail. After Manafort's clients were ousted in 2014, Russian forced annexed Crimea and Kremlin-backed proxies invaded eastern Ukraine. Western nations condemned the moves and have applied economic sanctions against Moscow ever since. The diplomatic and military crisis is ongoing.\n\nThe news that Manafort was in talks with Kilimnik about a Ukraine peace plan is interesting, because it's not the first time the Ukraine conflict became an issue inside Trump's orbit.\n\nDuring the 2016 Republican National Convention, Trump campaign officials intervened to change language in the GOP platform about the Ukraine conflict. Their actions blocked a provision that called on the US to arm the Ukrainian government to fight the Russian proxies.\n\nAt the time, Manafort denied that the Trump campaign was involved. He also said he was not personally involved in any effort to change the platform and learned of it from news reports.\n\nThe Ukraine issue came up again shortly before Trump's inauguration.\n\nAn informal Ukraine peace plan was hatched at a January 2017 meeting between Trump's longtime attorney and fixer Michael Cohen, former Trump business partner Felix Sater and Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Artemenko. The proposal was seen by some as friendly to Moscow.\n\nCohen confirmed to CNN that the meeting took place but denied discussing Ukraine. In comments to other news organizations, Cohen acknowledged the so-called peace plan and said he delivered the proposal to the office of then-national security adviser Michael Flynn. The White House denied that anyone ever received any documents from Cohen about Ukraine.\n\nIt is not clear if this proposal was related in any way to the plan that Manafort discussed with Kilimnik. There aren't any publicly known ties between Artemenko and Kilimnik, though Kilimnik is an insider in Ukrainian political circles and has relationships with many lawmakers there. Artemenko has cooperated with Mueller and testified before the grand jury last summer.\n\nCNN's Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.
Story highlights Patients are more likely to die in the hospital on nights and weekends for a variety of health issues Despite improvements in survival rates, the gap persists for cardiac arrests in the hospital\n\n(CNN) —\n\nDoctors call it the weekend effect. Patients in the hospital are more likely to die off-hours – whether it's due to a brain bleed, a heart attack or a clot in the lungs.\n\nNew research on cardiac arrest in the hospital now asks: Has the weekend effect changed in recent years, as treatment has gotten better?\n\nWe know that survival trends have improved in past decade or so, said Dr. Uchenna Ofoma, assistant professor of medicine at Temple University and a critical care physician at Geisinger Health System in Danville, Pennsylvania. The question now becomes … what happens to the disparities? Has it remained the same? Is it narrowing?\n\nTen years after a 2008 study showed lower survival rates during nights and weekends for in-hospital cardiac arrest, Ofoma published a new study Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. The new study builds on that previous research, finding that treatment has indeed gotten better, but we haven't closed the nights-and-weekends gap.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2014, weekday survival jumped from 16% to 25.2%, while weekend and weeknight survival rose from 11.9% to 21.9%, according to the new study's risk-adjusted numbers.\n\nThere was no significant change in the gap between weekday and off-hours survival, the study said. About half of patients in the study – more than 150,000 patients from 470 US hospitals – experienced cardiac arrest off-hours.\n\nWeekend worrier\n\nWe're able to point out that the problem exists without really having great insight as to why, said Dr. Seth Goldstein, a pediatric surgical fellow at Johns Hopkins Hospital.\n\nThough not involved in the new study, Goldstein's own research found that children admitted to the hospital for common, urgent surgeries on weekends had a higher adjusted risk of death, blood transfusion and other complications.\n\nPerhaps hospitals are understaffed and doctors are fatigued during off-hours, Goldstein said. It could also be that patients who come to the hospital on nights and weekends are worse off to begin with, he added. For example, those might be times when people are more likely to drink and injure themselves, resulting in severe surgeries.\n\nSimilarly, in the new study, the patients whose hearts stopped off-hours could have been sicker in ways that weren't measured by the study, Ofoma and his colleagues wrote. Their cardiac arrests were also less likely to be witnessed by someone else in the hospital.\n\nThese patients were also more likely to flatline – which can't be treated with a shock to the heart. However, this still wouldn't completely explain the difference between the two survival rates, according to the 2008 study on cardiac arrest.\n\nThese patients are different from people who experience cardiac arrest or heart attacks outside of the hospital. For them, having someone witness the event – and better yet, having someone perform CPR or defibrillation – was a key predictor of survival, research shows. And time is of the essence: The longer it takes for an ambulance to get there, the worse the outcome.\n\nStill, these patients are more likely to die and less likely to get invasive cardiac procedures on weekends, according to one study.\n\nOfoma believes that there's a way to tackle the survival gap on nights and weekends: look at which hospitals have the smallest difference, and figure out what they're doing right.\n\nReady to go\n\nGoldstein believes that hospitals can close the gap by changing how they run – including more staffing and better ways of alerting doctors and nurses if their patients take a turn for the worst.\n\nThe number of patients that we're responsible for at any one time is higher during the less desirable shifts, Goldstein said.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nAnd it's not just doctors and nurses, he added. It is more difficult in a hospital to get laboratory values, x-rays done, EKGs performed (at night) than it is during the day.\n\nThe proof of principle, he said, are in fields like trauma and transplant surgery, which don't have the same day-night cycle as other fields.\n\nOne study of Pennsylvania's trauma system, for example, showed no weeknight or weekend effect.\n\nThey need to be ready to go, he said.

And that will change everything.\n\nTrump has sought to look on the bright side of divided control of government to date – insisting that maybe he will be able to make deals with the new Democratic majority in the House. It really could be a beautiful bipartisan situation, he said at a press conference the day after the 2018 election.\n\nBut the early returns are not promising. The federal government has been shut down for the past 12 days – and there's little reason to believe that will change at any point soon. Trump has dug in on his demand for $5 billion to fund construction of his border wall. Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, are equally dead-set on providing zero dollars for Trump's wall.\n\nAnd this is only the beginning. Starting today, Democrats in the House will make Trump's life a living hell. Efforts are already underway to bring a number of his Cabinet officials before Congress, to extricate his tax returns from his grip and to more deeply probe his business dealings both before and during his presidency.\n\nTrump, a political neophyte prior to the 2016 race, has never had to deal with this sort of opposition before. Sure, Democrats have never been willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. But he never really needed Democrats to do much of anything, either. The Republican majorities in the House and Senate ensured Trump got his tax cuts and two Supreme Court picks. There was no real political penalty for his total unwillingness and inability to work with Democrats.\n\nThose days are now over. Democrats can now do Trump real political damage using the official means of their House majority. While they may not be able to, say, force his tax returns into public view (the jury remains out on that), they can make sure the issue is front and center and create major distractions for a White House that has already shown it can distract itself very well, thank you very much.\n\nTrump claims to understand this, likely with his self-professed titanic intellect. To me, that's like when people who are about to have a baby say they are totally ready for it. As evidence, they point to their nursery being all set up, the Diaper Genie being up and running, and so on and so forth. Then the baby comes – and they realize, like every parent that has gone before them, that no amount of planning or bracing could fully prepare them for their new reality.\n\nThat's Trump and the new Democratic House majority.\n\nThe Point: Look out: It's going to be a mess.
(CNN) While former President Jimmy Carter is often remembered as a strait-laced figure, he embodied countercultural cool in 1976, when he was the Democratic presidential nominee. Jimmy Carter: Rock and Roll President, an engaging documentary that airs on CNN on January 3, takes us back to when this largely unknown governor from Georgia -- mocked as Jimmy Who? -- ran for the highest office in the land and defeated incumbent Gerald Ford.\n\nThroughout his political journey, some of the hippest musicians of the time kept flocking to support him.\n\nRockers and edgy country singer-songwriters like Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson have always been among some of his biggest fans. From the moment that Carter announced his presidential run, the Allman Brothers, among the most legendary bands from the era, played benefit concerts to raise money for his campaign. As U2's Bono reminisced during a speech featured in the documentary, He campaigned with the Allman Brothers. You got the feeling that if his hair was a little longer, he'd be in the Allman Brothers.\n\nWhen Carter first met Dylan, the meeting made the music icon feel uneasy, since he was as anti-establishment as they came, but Carter put my mind at ease by not talking down to me and showing me that he had sincere appreciation for the songs that I had written. Most important, Dylan realized then that Carter was a different kind of politician than most.\n\nCarter's friendship with Willie Nelson one that has endured through several decades. Nelson and singer Emmylou Harris visited Carter in the Oval Office in 1977.\n\nWhy would the rock-and-roll set flock to a man who, as president, is remembered today as being a micro-managing, straight-arrow engineer who failed to inspire or understand leadership?\n\nThe reason is that in his prime, Jimmy Carter was cool. He championed a kind of political populism that was extremely attractive to Americans disillusioned with Washington in the wake of Vietnam and Watergate. Sick and tired of elected officials who betrayed them, they found a refreshing change in Carter, a former peanut farmer who was seen as an anti-establishment outsider. As Bishop Michael Curry recalls in the documentary, We were coming out of the Watergate era and looking ...to be a country of integrity again.\n\nThe Imperial Presidency, as the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. famously described in his 1973 book of the same name, applied to those modern presidents who had expanded their executive powers beyond what was outlined in the Constitution. As a result, these presidents -- many of whom showed a willingness to move the nation in dangerous directions -- had become disconnected from voters.\n\nWhen Dolly Parton performed at a 1979 country music gala in Washington, DC, Carter and wife Rosalynn were in the front row.\n\nLyndon Johnson, younger Democrats complained, brought us deeper into the quagmire of Vietnam; Richard Nixon abused his power so that he could maintain it. The Allman Brothers' Chuck Leavell remembers thinking in the 1976 election, Isn't it time for someone with great integrity and dignity to take his office?\n\nIn contrast to President Donald Trump's populism, which has revolved around racial resentment, Twitter tirades and rally rhetoric attacking people and institutions that didn't support him, Carter hoped to bring the nation a stripped-down presidency, defined less by pomp and circumstance and more by tackling the difficult problems facing the nation.\n\nWhen Paul Simon sang American Tune at the inauguration in 1977, hitting the words, I'm all right, I'm just weary to my bones, he seemed to speak for many disaffected people who didn't believe that Carter could be anything better than Richard Nixon. When Aretha Franklin belted out God Bless America she tapped into the hope, buried deep in many Americans at the time, that this country could still reach its promise. Carter understood all of that and was determined to give them hope again.\n\nThough Carter's presidency has often been disparaged, he did deliver in many ways. As Jonathan Alter recounts in his new book, His Very Best: Jimmy Carter, a Life, President Carter was notable in that he was willing to tackle difficult policy challenges, from the environment and energy to peace in the Middle East, even if they were not politically smart issues to take on. He constantly burned bridges with his own coalition to take on issues\n\nHis presidency was also filled with symbolic gestures meant to show that a president could be sensitive to the limits of his own power. During his inauguration, Carter, along with his wife and daughter, stepped out of the limo and walked the streets as an elated crowd looked on. He did away with the Hail to the Chief anthem before public entrances and spoke on television wearing a cardigan sweater\n\nFrom the start, he didn't seek to put himself on a pedestal above those he was meant to lead. And this meant something at the time. For a people desperate for a new direction, it offered hope that politics could be different. He made the presidency so engaging that even bands like Crosby, Stills and Nash would show up at the White House just to have a chance to meet him, as the film recounts.\n\nJimmy Carter said of friend Johnny Cash: I was glad when he brought June Cash (left) down here to meet me. We always claimed that she was my cousin.\n\nOf course, in the end the presidency didn't work out as well as he had hoped . Carter, who was overwhelmed by the Iran Hostage Crisis and a flagging economy, ended up losing reelection. He backtracked on some of his populism, such as rejecting bolder proposals to use public spending to stimulate the economy or backing away from national health insurance (which caused an immense rift with liberal stalwart Senator Ted Kennedy), and gradually came to be seen as more establishment.\n\nBut it's worth looking back on those original years -- when rock and rollers, as well as country music mavericks -- saw something fresh and inspiring in Carter's political populism. He was one of the rare leaders who tried to make himself a little less important to benefit the overall health of our democracy. In recent years, the nation has been sold a brand of populism wielded by a deeply divisive president who abused his executive powers and did little to address the needs of average Americans.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAfter his presidency ended, Carter returned to the spirit that animated him in 1976. Rather than spending his time giving high-paid speeches or living in seclusion, Carter created the Carter Center, devoted to diplomatic initiatives, eradicating disease and promoting democracy. He has worked for Habitat for Humanity, building houses for those without economic means.\n\nThere has not been a president . . . who has done more since they left office . . . just the humanitarians that they have been to us as a nation and to the world, says country singer Trisha Yearwood, who along with her husband Garth Brooks has worked with the Carters on Habitat.\n\nIn other words, Carter has used his position as a platform for promoting social justice, defining a post-presidency that has been radically different from that of those who came before him.\n\nJimmy Carter showed us that populism isn't always a bad thing if it comes with integrity and a genuine concern for the nation's citizenry. We need that more than ever today after four years of chaos, instability and dysfunction
Passengers are seen on balconies of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, with thousands of people quarantined onboard due to fears of the new coronavirus, at the Daikoku Pier Cruise Terminal in Yokohama port on February 14. Photo by Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe US plan to evacuate Americans and their families from the Diamond Princess cruise ship appears, on its face, to be the case of a powerful government coming to the aide of its most vulnerable citizens.\n\nThousands of people have been stuck in their cabins under mandatory quarantine aboard the Diamond Princess, which is docked off the Japanese port city of Yokohama, since Feb. 3.\n\nWith 356 confirmed cases of coronavirus on board, 70 of which were announced Sunday, the ship has the largest concentration of novel coronavirus cases outside mainland China. On Feb. 19, the controversial quarantine period was set to finally end.\n\nBut on Saturday afternoon, the US embassy in Tokyo sent a notice to Americans on board the Diamond Princess laying out plans to evacuate nearly 400 Americans back home.\n\nOnce there, another 14 days of mandatory quarantine would begin, and anyone who chose not to get on the flight would have to wait another 14 days in Japan to ensure they were symptom-free before returning to the US.\n\nSome exhausted passengers aboard the ship are angry.\n\nOne reason the passengers are so upset is because, as early as last week, experts had been questioning the Japanese government's decision to quarantine people on the ship.\n\nI don't understand why they have to be kept on a ship, said Peter Hotez, of the Baylor College of Medicine. We're employing what I call 14th-century approaches and ethics to individuals with transmissible disease.\n\nWhat all of this may mean: The abrupt change in US policy led some to believe that Washington lost faith in the effectiveness of the Japanese response.\n\nEarlier this week, it emerged that some 1,000 crew on board the ship had not been kept in quarantine, eating meals together with masks off and working side by side.\n\nRead the full story here.

I was driving a brand-new Ford GT down a mountain road in Utah. Ford's $450,000 supercar is really a street-legal race car, but, set to Sport mode, it was composed and easy to drive on public highways.\n\nIt was hard to believe that, only a few hours earlier, I'd actually been kind of intimidated by it.\n\nThe GT has a crackling 647-horsepower turbocharged V6 engine mounted behind its two seats, serious seats that don't adjust a dozen ways, like so many these days. They only adjust one way: You can change the angle of the seat back. Otherwise, if you're not comfortable, you have to adjust the steering wheel and pedals.\n\nThe GT is so race car, the steering wheel isn't even wheel-shaped. It's rectangular, with most of its knobs and switches mounted there.\n\nEarlier that morning, I'd taken another Ford (F) GT, just like the one I was driving down that mountain, out on the track at Utah Motorsports Campus a few miles away.\n\nA Ford Performance Racing School instructor was at my side in the tight confines of the cabin. The seats were so close together we practically bumped shoulders at every turn.\n\nKeep your speed! Keep your speed! Keep your speed! he said like a mantra as I fought every instinct telling me to brake for those hard curves, or at least, for God's sake, lift my foot off the gas.\n\nBut in Track mode, with its body lowered almost to pebble-plowing level and its extendable wing high up over its back bumper, the GT ran through curve after curve without so much as an errant wiggle. And the steering wheel still provided a direct feel that reminded me, always, that I was, for better or worse, in charge.\n\nI hit the long front straight and pushed the gas down until it hit the floor. A hairpin turn at the far end came rushing toward the windshield as the digital speedometer ticked past 100 miles an hour, then past 119.\n\n119.4 ... 119.5 ... 119.6 ... 119.7 ...\n\nBrake, brake, brake! the instructor said.\n\nI hit the pedal hard. The Ford GT's giant brakes grabbed hold like a dog on the best damned bone ever. The rear wing flipped up to almost vertical, acting like a parachute to slow the car while grinding the back tires down into the pavement.\n\n2018 Mustang gets 10 gears, more power\n\nThe tires skittered a little and my torso pushed forward in the tight racing harness as the car slowed enough for me to steer left and rip around the apex of that sharp curve.\n\nAfter that I felt like, as long you weren't an irredeemable idiot, this car could do about anything.\n\nBut it's not perfect. The Ford GT was designed mostly to win races, not just for fun and certainly not for comfort.\n\nA lot of people -- I'm thinking particularly of older, wider people -- are going to have a hard time relaxing in its austere cabin. It's a lot like driving a pair of economy seats on Delta, only with less cushioning and no beverage service.\n\nAlso, the Ford GT's performance, when it comes to air conditioning, is wholly inadequate. It was only in the mid-60s in Grantsville, Utah, but the inside of the Ford GT quickly felt like a Manhattan taxicab in July.\n\nPart of the Ford GT's appeal, though, has to do with that other kind of coolness. And it has loads of that. This is a car that basically comes with its own velvet rope.\n\nNot just anybody can buy one. Only 1,000 are being made available, and prospective owners have had to apply.\n\nFor this kind of money, or even less, there are cars you could buy with similar performance but greater on-road comfort. And all you need to get one of those cars is money. So if your application didn't get accepted and you couldn't get a Ford GT, don't feel too bad.\n\nI mean, feel pretty bad, sure, but not too bad.
London (CNN) The UK's chief medical officers have defended a decision to delay second doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in order to prioritize first doses, saying it will protect as many vulnerable people as possible while the coronavirus is running rampant.\n\nThe new strategy, announced Wednesday by the head of the UK's medicines regulator MHRA, means that the interval between doses could be extended to up to 12 weeks, instead of the three weeks previously stipulated.\n\nIt has prompted a debate among experts, with the British Medical Association (BMA), a body representing UK doctors, criticizing the move to postpone appointments for the very vulnerable patients currently awaiting their second shots.\n\nThe Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been in use in the UK since early December, when the country became the first in the world to approve it, but supplies are limited.\n\nThe argument over the vaccination strategy comes as infection rates soar in much of the UK, thanks in part to a new, more infectious variant of the virus. Most of England is now under the toughest level of restrictions to try to limit the virus' spread.\n\nThis group of very elderly patients is at the highest risk of death if they contract Covid-19, which is why GPs are so concerned for them. It is grossly and patently unfair to tens of thousands of our most at-risk patients to now try to reschedule their appointments, Dr. Richard Vautrey, chair of the BMA General Practitioners Committee, said in a statement Thursday.\n\nThe Doctors' Association UK also raised real and grave concerns over the new vaccination strategy, warning Friday that it could undermine the National Health Service's patient consent process, as well as completely failing to follow the science.\n\nMeanwhile, Pfizer said it did not have data to demonstrate that just a single dose of its vaccine would provide protection against the disease after more than 21 days.\n\nPfizer and BioNTech's Phase 3 study for the Covid-19 vaccine was designed to evaluate the vaccine's safety and efficacy following a 2-dose schedule, separated by 21 days, Pfizer said in a statement on Thursday. There are no data to demonstrate that protection after the first dose is sustained after 21 days.\n\nBut the chief medical officers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland defended the move in a letter to healthcare professionals published Thursday, saying it was based on the balance of risks and benefits, and that the great majority of initial protection came from the first jab.\n\nThe second vaccine dose is likely to be very important for duration of protection, and at an appropriate dose interval may further increase vaccine efficacy, they said.\n\nIn the short term, the additional increase of vaccine efficacy from the second dose is likely to be modest; the great majority of the initial protection from clinical disease is after the first dose of vaccine.\n\n'Terrible impact' on emotional well-being\n\nThe BMA warned in its statement that the delay could have a terrible impact on the emotional well-being of vulnerable and at-risk patients.\n\nThe BMA believes these are patients that have already been promised, by the NHS and local clinicians, that they will receive a second dose of Pfizer vaccination next week; they have given their consent to receive it and, quite rightly, are expecting to have it, the BMA said.\n\nVautrey, the BMA chair, told CNN Friday that healthcare professionals were particularly concerned about the practicality of doing this so quickly, with little warning given to practitioners on the revised guidance.\n\nWe were only told in the last day that we are expected, next Monday, to re-change all of the appointments that we made for next week... it was simply not practical for our practice staff to do that in such a short space of time, Vautrey said.\n\nWe wanted the commitments that we made to our elderly patients to give their vaccine to be honored, certainly in the next few days.\n\nHelen Salisbury, a general practitioner in the English city of Oxford, told the BBC's Today program Friday that her practice had not as yet canceled existing second appointments next week. This was because, firstly, she had been unable to find any data on immunity after the first dose beyond the 21 days when the booster was given in trials, and secondly, because the practice wanted to protect its most vulnerable patients, the elderly, and maintain their trust in the vaccine.\n\nWhen you have started a patient on a course of treatment and you have said, this is what the plan is, here's one jab, please come back in three weeks, it's really important that you have the second jab to be fully protected -- and then to turn round five minutes later and say no, don't worry about that, you can have it in 12 weeks rather than three weeks -- I don't think that's good enough, actually, she said.\n\nIn their letter, the chief medical officers said they recognized the operational difficulties and potential distress involved in rescheduling second appointments at short notice.\n\nHowever, we are all conscious that for every 1,000 people boosted with a second dose of Covid-19 vaccine in January (who will as a result gain marginally on protection from severe disease), 1,000 new people can't have substantial initial protection which is in most cases likely to raise them from 0% protected to at least 70% protected, they said.\n\nPfizer said it had not evaluated different dosing schedules because the majority of trial participants received the second dose within the window specified in the study design.\n\nIn its open letter, the Doctors' Association UK wrote: Protection provided by the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine is considerably lower at 52.4% compared to 95% if two doses given three weeks apart.\n\nVautrey told CNN that greater assurances would be needed from both the UK chief medical officers and Pfizer in order to give healthcare professionals and patients confidence in the government's strategy.\n\nWe need Pfizer themselves to be confident that this new dosage regime is going to deliver effective coverage and protection to our patients, particularly our most vulnerable patients, Vautrey said.\n\nUK regulators have also advised giving the second dose of the newly approved Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, which is due to be rolled out from Monday, four to 12 weeks later.\n\nUS also considering spacing out jabs\n\nThe strategy of extending the interval between first and second vaccine doses is also under consideration in the United States, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci said Thursday.\n\nTwo vaccines have so far been approved for use in the US, the Pfizer/BioNTech shot and another made by Moderna, which requires a second dose 28 days later.\n\nI still think, if done properly, you can do a single dose, reserve doses for the second dose, and still get the job done, Fauci said on NBC's Today Show, but there's a lot of discussion about whether or not you want to spread out the initial vaccination by getting more people vaccinated on the first round.\n\nFauci said it could be debated either way, but a potential problem would be if a person didn't get the second dose in time and there was a lag period.\n\nHe said it was known from the clinical trials that the optimal time is to give it on one day and then for Moderna 28 days later and for Pfizer 21 days later, that's what the data tells us is the best way to do it.\n\nIf you want to stick with the data, that's how it should be done, he said, but you can make an argument, and some people are, about stretching out the doses by giving a single dose across the board and hoping you're going to get the second dose in time to give to individuals.\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson struck an optimistic note on vaccines in an address on New Year's Eve.\n\nWe have a hard struggle still ahead of us for weeks and months because we face a new variant of the disease that requires a new vigilance, he said.\n\nBut as the sun rises tomorrow on 2021, we have the certainty of those vaccines. I believe 2021 is, above all, the year when we will eventually do those everyday things that now seem lost in the past, bathed in a rosy glow of nostalgia -- going to the pub, concerts, theaters, restaurants, or simply holding hands with our loved ones in the normal way.
Washington (CNN) Pete Buttigieg ended his campaign for President Sunday night, concluding the White House bid that vaulted the once-unknown mayor from South Bend, Indiana, to a top presidential contender.\n\nButtigieg officially made the announcement during a hastily planned event on Sunday in South Bend, where the former mayor said today is a moment of truth... the truth is the path has narrowed to a close, for our candidacy, if not for our cause.\n\nSo we must recognize that at this point in the race the best way to keep faith with those goals and ideals is to step aside and help bring our party and our country together, Buttigieg said. So tonight, I am making the difficult decision to suspend my campaign for the presidency.\n\nButtigieg added: We have a responsibility to concede the effect of remaining in this race any further. Our goal has always been to help unify Americans to defeat Donald Trump and to win the era for our values.\n\nButtigieg's run was historic. He is the first openly gay man to launch a competitive campaign for president, and he broke barriers by becoming the first gay candidate to earn primary delegates for a major party's presidential nomination.\n\nAfter initial success in Iowa and New Hampshire, Buttigieg's campaign struggled to win over voters of color, a key base to the Democratic Party, which hurt his performance in Nevada and South Carolina, two states where Buttigieg finished significantly behind the race's frontrunners.\n\nButtigieg was scheduled to fly from Selma, Alabama, to Dallas, Texas, on Sunday, but during the flight he informed reporters that he would be flying back to his hometown of South Bend to make an announcement on the future of his campaign. That announcement, aides said, is that he is ending his run\n\nButtigieg made the decision on Sunday, aides said, after he struggled to compete in South Carolina's primary and had little path toward success on Super Tuesday.\n\nHe believes this is the right thing to do right now for our country and the country to heal this divided nation and defeat President Trump, the aide said.\n\nThe aide added: He decided that now was the time and, I think that is exactly why he is getting out. He believes this is the right thing to do.\n\nButtigieg did not endorse one of his former competitors on Sunday night, and instead used the moment to laud all of his competitors for demonstrating what public service can be.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden and Buttigieg have yet to connect but the two have traded voicemails today, a Biden aide tells CNN. A separate source familiar with the matter told CNN that there has been staff-level communication between the Buttigieg and Biden campaigns tonight, however.\n\nButtigieg ended his campaign with little-to-no path toward the nomination, a fact he acknowledged on Sunday.\n\nHe studied the math, a top Democrat familiar with the Buttigieg campaign said. He knew there wasn't a path forward.\n\nButtigieg signaled throughout the final weeks of his campaign that he was aware the race was coming to a close. As Buttigieg warned supporters against nominating Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and his inflexible, ideological revolution, his campaign released a memo days later worrying that Sanders could enjoy a seemingly insurmountable delegate lead after the Super Tuesday contests.\n\nIn the end, Buttigieg didn't make it to Super Tuesday.\n\nButtigieg's campaign, though, impressed a host of Democratic heavyweights, many of whom see the former mayor as a key figure in the future of the party. What comes next for the mayor remains unclear -- some top Democratic officials have speculated about a possible Cabinet position in a Democratic administration or another attempt at becoming the Democratic National Committee chairman, a job he ran for and lost in 2017.\n\nThat future was front of mind to the supporters in the audience in South Bend who began chanting 2024! 2024! 2024! after he ended his run.\n\nI know that as this campaign ends, there comes disappointment that we won't continue, Buttigieg said, nodding to his future. But I hope that everyone who has been part of this in any way knows that he campaign that you have built and the community that you have created is only the beginning of the change that we are going to make together.\n\nResults of the Iowa caucuses\n\nButtigieg takes the stage to address supporters during his caucus night watch party on February 03, 2020 in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nThe former mayor's top advisers believed that a win in Iowa would propel Buttigieg to turn in strong performances in New Hampshire and Nevada. That success, they believed, would be followed by a fundraising boost, allowing them to nationalize the campaign by the time Super Tuesday rolled around in early March.\n\nThat strategy, however, ran into several challenges. The results of the Iowa caucuses were repeatedly delayed due to mistakes by the state party, denying Buttigieg the ability to fully tout that he won more delegates out of the state than any other candidate.\n\nAnd one of Buttigieg's primary opponents, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar , delivered a strong debate performance before the New Hampshire primary and turned in a surprising third place finish in the state, possibly siphoning votes from the former mayor.\n\nAdding to Buttigieg's challenges was the presence of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the hundreds of millions the billionaire was spending. Bloomberg provided voters yet another alternative to consider, thwarting Buttigieg's attempt to coalesce moderate Democrats.\n\nButtigieg entered the 2020 race as a relative unknown, launching his exploratory committee from a windowless conference room in Washington, DC.\n\nThe case here is simple, Buttigieg said at the time. It is time for a new generation of leadership in our country.\n\nFor months, the candidate toiled in obscurity, one of nearly two-dozen Democrats running for the chance to take on President Donald Trump . But Buttigieg got his break when a CNN town hall in Austin, Texas, last March introduced Democratic voters to the young mayor, leading to a steady climb in polls and a significant boost to his fundraising.\n\nIt reminded me of early Obama and the shooting-fish-in-a-barrel phenomenon, Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia, Buttigieg's first congressional endorser, said at the time. Everyone I called (to ask for money) said yes.\n\nEarly momentum\n\nButtigieg speaks during the CNN Democratic Presidential Town Hall at SXSW at ACL Live at the Moody Theater in Austin, Tex., on March 10, 2019.\n\nButtigieg officially launched his campaign in April with an event that used his hometown -- South Bend -- as a character in his presidential pitch. His campaign picked the hollowed interior of the once bustling Studebaker plant as the site of his launch, a visual symbol of the struggles his city has faced.\n\nThere's a long way for us to go. Life here is far from perfect. But we've changed our trajectory and shown a path forward for communities like ours. And that's why I'm here today, Buttigieg said as rain audibly beat down on the steel roof above him and as the lectern in front of him visibly took on water.\n\nButtigieg raised more than $80 million during his 2020 run, including an impressive $25 million haul in the second quarter of 2019 that allowed the former mayor to invest heavily in Iowa, a state where he and his top aides believed his Midwestern roots, veteran status and focus on faith could build a broad coalition of support across the state.\n\nBut Buttigieg's fundraising success was not everlasting. The campaign entered February with just $6.6 million in the bank and they struggled to hit their goal of raising $13 million in the weeks leading up to Super Tuesday.\n\nPart of the problem was a decline of small dollar donors. The percentage of Buttigieg's fundraising from small dollar donors -- over time -- has fallen from 65% in early 2019 to just 29% in January, according to his financial filings.\n\nLack of support from black community\n\nSome of Buttigieg's early momentum was also stalled by persistent questions about his appeal to communities of color, an issue that was highlighted in June, when black South Bend resident Eric Logan was shot and killed by a police officer. The subsequent protests forced Buttigieg off the campaign trail for nearly a week, including skipping a key campaign event in South Carolina.\n\nMaybe the level of attention on this will help us do some good, a visibly emotional Buttigieg told reporters after a particularly contentious June town hall in South Bend over the police shooting. Because everybody has got to be a part of it. There is just no running away from it, not for me.\n\nAlthough Buttigieg often pushed back against progressive criticism by noting, should he win, he'd be the most progressive president in a generation, he offered voters a more moderate approach than Sanders. This was clearest on health care, where Buttigieg often touted his Medicare for all who want it plan, a more scaled back version that would provide a public option, but allow people to keep their private health insurance if they chose.\n\nAs the race dragged on, though, Buttigieg's central argument became that the Democratic Party should look to their past success and nominate a younger candidate from outside Washington, DC.\n\nWhen it comes to electability, every single time my party has won the presidency in the last 50 years, it's been with a candidate who was new on the national scene, hadn't spent a lot of time in Washington, and represented a new generation of leadership, Buttigieg often said.\n\nThe line morphed into a direct attack on former Vice President Joe Biden , who Buttigieg criticized repeatedly as a backward-looking candidate. He touted what Biden was able to accomplish during the Obama administration, but at a debate in New Hampshire added, those achievements were phenomenally important because they met the moment, but now we have to meet this moment, and this moment is different.\n\nI hear Vice President Biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new, Buttigieg said in Decorah, Iowa, days before the Iowa caucuses. But history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up is to look to the same Washington playbook and recycle the same arguments -- and expect that to work against a president like Donald Trump.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg participate in the Democratic debate in Des Moines, Iowa, on January 14.\n\nButtigieg also ran hard against Sanders at the end of his campaign, raising questions about the self-identified Democratic socialist and the impact that nominating a divisive candidate could do to down ballot races.\n\nIf you want to keep the House in Democratic hands, you might want to check with the people who actually turned the house blue, Buttigieg said at the South Carolina debate in February. Forty Democrats... They are running away from your platform as fast as they possibly can. I want to send those Democrats back to the United States House.\n\nAnd he attempted to warn Democrats after Sanders' victory in New Hampshire that the Vermont senator could be the prohibitive favorite after Super Tuesday.\n\nWe've got to wake up as a party, Buttigieg said during a January debate in Las Vegas. We could wake up two weeks from today, the day after Super Tuesday, and the only candidates left standing will be Bernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg, the two most polarizing figures on this stage.\n\nIt was that intense focus on Sanders that hinted at Buttigieg's inner thinking: Without taking down the race's frontrunner, Buttigieg's run would effectively end once the Vermont senator began to amass enough delegates to make it impossible for others to catch him.\n\nButtigieg made it clear to aides for weeks that he was not willing to run just for the sake of running.\n\nA senior Buttigieg aide told CNN in January -- before voting even began in Iowa -- that the mayor was not interested in sticking with a campaign that had no chance of winning.\n\nHe is not in the business of diddling around, the senior aide said in January. We are going big and we have got a lane to win. If that doesn't work out, there is no point in running.\n\nThis story is being updated.
(CNN) On Saturday, Montana Sen. Steve Daines was one of 11 Republicans who announced their plans to object to the Electoral College results during Wednesday's bicameral session of Congress. Twenty four hours later, the largest newspaper in his state absolutely eviscerated that decision.\n\nWe believe this entire episode to be one of the saddest in our country's political history, wrote the Billings Gazette editorial board in an editorial published Sunday . How unfortunate that you decided to play a leading role -- in support of the insupportable. ... This action, Senator, is political garbage disguised as statesmanship. It is beneath your office and should be beneath you.\n\nWhich is, well, tough. And while it won't change Daines' mind -- editorial boards have increasingly limited power to persuade either a politician or the public -- it's worth examining why the Gazette is so disappointed in Daines.\n\nThe key point of the editorial is that Daines (and the other Republican senators -- including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz -- who plan to object to the results) are basing their opposition to the Electoral College count not on hard evidence but on, as Paul Simon would say, hints and allegations.\n\nThe President and a few of his allies repeating endlessly his contentions of fraud with no evidence to back it up does not itself constitute evidence of anything. Now, the senators involved are using the 'allegations' in place of evidence.\n\nAnd indeed, in the joint statement put out by Daines, Cruz and the other senators, they never actually say that there are facts or proof that the election was anything but above-board.\n\nallegations of voter fraud, violations and lax enforcement of election law, and other voting irregularities. There's this (bolding is mine): The 2020 election, however, featured unprecedentedof voter fraud, violations and lax enforcement of election law, and other voting irregularities.\n\nAnd this: By any measure, the allegations of fraud and irregularities in the 2020 election exceed any in our lifetimes.\n\nAnd this: On January 6, it is incumbent on Congress to vote on whether to certify the 2020 election results. That vote is the lone constitutional power remaining to consider and force resolution of the multiple allegations of serious voter fraud.\n\nThe thing is: You can allege anything. But at some point, you have to provide some (any?) proof to back up the allegations. Especially when what is being alleged is so serious.\n\nAnd for Daines and the rest, the cupboard is decidedly bare when it comes to proof. Of the 60 lawsuits President Donald Trump and his legal team have filed about alleged irregularities in the 2020 election, they have won just one, according to The New York Times . Allegations of Trump votes being thrown away, dead people voting, non-citizens voting, Republican poll watchers being removed from voting places and other claims of fraud have all been repeatedly debunked not just by the media but also, in many cases, by Republican election officials in the states. (Georgia and Arizona, to name two.)\n\nThe plain fact is this: There's no there there. These allegations of some sort of major conspiracy to overturn the election are the product of Trump's imagination, a conservative media ecosystem that is more than willing to air these falsehoods in the never-ending chase for higher ratings and the members of Congress willing to play along.\n\nUnfortunately, we've come to expect that behavior from the President and his enablers. And even among many Republican elected officials in Washington.\n\nBut as the Billings Gazette notes, this isn't enabling without danger. When you support the President's debunked claims of election fraud, you actively undermine our political system for the sake of earning yourself some pats on the back from the GOP base.\n\nThis is so beyond the pale that it cannot be normalized or tacitly accepted by ignoring it, the editorial board concludes. Yes, yes it is.

(GREG BAKER/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nIf this is the cup I must take, I will drink with no regret.\n\nBenny Tai was defiant and emotional as he faced the court. Outside, he and his fellow defendants raised their fists and supporters displayed yellow umbrellas, the symbol of Hong Kong's beleaguered pro-democracy movement.\n\nThat movement is looking shakier than ever, as Tai and others begin the new year facing possible jail time – up to seven years in prison – for their roles in inspiring the 2014 Umbrella Movement, when tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the semi-autonomous Chinese city demanding elections free of Beijing's interference.\n\nSeveral thousand people – including former Umbrella leaders – took part in a traditional New Year's march Tuesday, warning of shrinking freedoms and issuing a call for greater democracy. They were joined by a small group of pro-independence demonstrators, some of whom said they faced harassment and intimidation ahead of the gathering.\n\nOn Wednesday, a spokesman for the Hong Kong government reiterated its zero tolerance on 'Hong Kong independence'.\n\nPolice and organizers estimated the crowd to be roughly half that of last year's march, which will be a concern for the pro-democracy camp as they face a difficult 2019. The prosecution of Tai and his co-defendants could pale in comparison to what some fear will happen if the Hong Kong government, under pressure from China, moves to pass a hugely controversial anti-sedition law.\n\nCritics say this could criminalize swathes of opposition figures, ranging from pro-democracy activists and separatists to religious minorities and media figures critical of Beijing.\n\nPHOTO: ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Baptist minister Chu Yiu-ming, 74, law professor Benny Tai, 54, and sociology professor Chan Kin-man, 59, shout slogans with supporters before entering the West Kowloon Magistrates Court in Hong Kong on November 19, 2018.\n\nTai, a mild-mannered Hong Kong University professor with a round clean-shaven face and thin-rimmed glasses, was a marginal political figure when, in January 2013, he proposed a civil disobedience campaign to pressure the government to introduce universal political suffrage — a long overdue promise of Hong Kong's de facto constitution known as the Basic Law.\n\nUnlikely icon\n\nJoined by fellow professor Chan Kin-man and Reverend Chu Yiu-ming, Tai launched Occupy Central with Love and Peace later that year, with a protest date set for October 2014.\n\nWe shall be like preachers communicating enthusiastically with different communities to convey universal values such as democracy, universal and equal suffrage, justice and righteousness, he said at the time, adding he hoped Hong Kongers will be willing to pay the price.\n\nHong Kongers were willing, and then some. In late September 2014, a student boycott movement led by Joshua Wong's Scholarism and the Hong Kong Federation of Students (HKFS) attempted to occupy Civic Square, a traditional protest venue outside Hong Kong's legislature. After police used pepper spray and later tear gas on the mostly teenaged protesters, thousands of outraged Hong Kongers took to the streets.\n\nThe demonstration spiraled from there, with pro-democracy protesters occupying main roads in parts of the city for months, shutting down traffic and defying police and counter-protesters' attempts to remove them.\n\nPolice were finally able to clear the last protesters in December 2014, after 79 days.\n\nPHOTO: Paula Bronstein/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images 2014's Umbrella Movement was a pivotal moment for Hong Kong's democracy movement.\n\nPyrrhic victories\n\nIf the Umbrella Movement was a high point for Hong Kong's democrats, it's been largely downhill from there.\n\nEven apparent opposition successes, such as those in September 2016 legislative elections, have turned out to be pyrrhic victories. Multiple lawmakers elected that year have since been turfed out of office on dubious legal grounds.\n\nWong, along with HKFS leaders Nathan Law and Alex Chow, was briefly jailed in 2017, and continues to face the threat of further prison time. Other activists have also faced court hearings, as analysts warned of a deliberate slow drip of prosecutions designed to sap the pro-democracy movement.\n\nRestrictions on political speech have grown, with the pro-independence Hong Kong National Party led by Andy Chan officially banned under public security laws, the first time these had been used against a political organization.\n\nIn the wake of that ban, Victor Mallet, a Financial Times journalist from Britain who had hosted a speech featuring Chan, had his application for a visa renewal rejected — a move which many saw as a blow against press freedom.\n\nPHOTO: ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Activists hold flags which read Hong Kong Independence and Hong Kong Is Not China during a gathering outside the government headquarters to mark the fourth anniversary of mass pro-democracy rallies, known as the Umbrella Movement, in Hong Kong on September 28, 2018.\n\nPolitical litmus tests are increasingly becoming the norm. The latest victim was Eddie Chu, who was recently barred from standing in a local poll because an election official ruled that he had defended independence as an option to Hong Kongers, even though he himself disavowed separatism. Bizarrely, Chu currently sits in the city's top legislature – raising questions over whether he can retain that position if deemed unsuitable to run for a more junior one, or if he will become the latest pro-democracy lawmaker ejected from office.\n\nThese repeated setbacks have had an impact on the broader opposition movement, and protest fatigue is also a factor in a city which has become famous for them. Numbers at anti-government demonstrations have fallen and many in the pro-democracy camp are seemingly at a loss on the way ahead in the face of an increasingly aggressive establishment.\n\nIn November, the opposition camp flunked a major test when its candidate failed by a wide margin to hang on to the legislative seat of Lau Siu-lai, who had herself been expelled in 2017. As a result pro-democracy lawmakers were unable to regain veto power in the city's legislature, a development which could clear the way for the government to introduce its controversial anti-sedition legislation.\n\nPHOTO: ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Protestors take part in a National Day pro-democracy rally in Hong Kong on October 1, 2018.\n\nWorrying future\n\nArticle 23 of the Basic Law instructs the local government to enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the Central People's Government … and to prohibit political organizations or bodies of the Region from establishing ties with foreign political organizations or bodies.\n\nAn attempt to implement such a law in 2003 drew half a million people onto the streets, demanding the resignation of Hong Kong's first Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa. He stepped down less than two years later. The protest is often pointed to as an example of the greater political freedoms which Hong Kongers enjoy compared to mainland Chinese.\n\nPHOTO: PETER PARKS/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Trams sit stranded as hundreds of thousands of people block the streets in a huge protest march against a controversial anti-subversion law known as Article 23 in Hong Kong in 2003.\n\nSince then, Article 23 has loomed over Hong Kong politics, either a bogeyman or a panacea depending on one's ideological bent. While the immediate effects of an anti-sedition law are likely overstated by its opponents (the police are probably not going to start rounding up pro-democracy legislators), it could have a major psychological and chilling effect in curbing a famously truculent body politic.\n\nSelf-censorship, while difficult to measure, is also seen as an increasing problem. As the cost of dissent has risen in Hong Kong, there are signs of a growing wariness among some sectors of society.\n\nIn November, two events featuring Chinese dissidents were called off amid apparent fears of repercussions from Beijing. One eventually went ahead after strong public pressure on the event venue to change course.\n\nPHOTO: ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Article 23 of Hong Kong's Basic Law, an anti-sedition clause, has long loomed over the city's politics.\n\nChu, the lawmaker barred in December from standing in a local poll, accused the government of moving the goalposts to intimidate people against speaking out, lest their comments be used against them one day.\n\nThe political logic … comes from the Cultural Revolution, where everyone had to be thought police, he added.\n\nIn his closing statement to the court in December, Tai said the Occupy movement was ultimately intended to pursue justice and he had no regrets about standing up for Hong Kong's future.\n\nThe purpose of civil disobedience is not to obstruct the public, but to arouse public concern to the injustice in society and to win sympathy from the public, he said.\n\nI am not afraid or ashamed of going to prison. If we were to be guilty, we will be guilty for daring to share hope at this difficult time in Hong Kong.\n\nThe court will hand down its verdict on April 9, 2019.
Financial turbulence and misgivings with the newspaper's parent company have brought the Los Angeles Times to the cusp of forming a union for the first time in its 136-year history.\n\nOn Thursday, newsroom employees will cast votes in an election held by the National Labor Relations Board, the culmination of a tense months-long organizing effort. In October, Times employees went public with their efforts, announcing in an unsigned letter that a majority of the newsroom had signed cards in support of representation by the NewsGuild-Communications Workers of America\n\nIt set the stage for yet more tension with the newspaper's owner, Tronc, formerly known as The Tribune Company, which has been vigorously opposed to the union. Times employees have grown anxious with major changes brought by the parent company.\n\nIn a statement, a Tronc spokesperson said the company urges every individual in the LA Times newsroom to get out and vote.\n\nWe believe that by working together, rather than through a third party, we can build on the LA Times' heritage and trust with readers, the spokesperson said. We remain committed to providing a productive and safe working environment for all employees, and will continue to act with the best interest of all of our employees in mind.\n\nRelated: Los Angeles Times names Forbes executive its top editor\n\nStanding up to Tronc are Times employees like Carolina Miranda, a culture writer at the paper and a member of the union's organizing committee.\n\nMiranda said conversations about forming a union began in late 2016 -- months after Tribune changed its name to Tronc and unveiled a buzzword-laden plan of action that was ridiculed throughout the industry.\n\nThe same year saw Tronc eliminate the newspaper's accrued vacation policy for many employees, including Miranda.\n\nYou see your benefits and pay eroded over time, and you feel powerless to do anything about it, Miranda told CNN in a phone interview.\n\nIn the letter released in October, the union's organizing committee called for better pay and protections from unilateral change by Tronc, among other things.\n\nFor months, Tronc's leaders have waged their own campaign to thwart the effort. That continued on the eve of the vote, with a Wednesday morning email sent by Lewis D'Vorkin, the newly appointed editor-in-chief, and Jim Kirk, a Tronc executive who since August has served as interim executive editor.\n\nIn the email, D'Vorkin and Kirk warned employees that the union will likely request dues every month, and said that it will offer no guarantee of better pay nor protection against layoffs.\n\nNow it is really a choice of every individual in this newsroom, they said in the email, which was provided to CNN. At stake is the culture of an institution that has served this community so well for more than 135 years. Take all the history into account when you make your decision on whether or not you want someone other than yourself representing you with our company.\n\nWe urge you to vote NO and keep the spirit of independence, the two said in closing.\n\nWhen reached by email, D'Vorkin and Kirk referred CNN to the Tronc spokesperson.\n\nBernie Lunzer, the president of the NewsGuild-CWA, said there was nothing new to Tronc's anti-union messaging.\n\nIt's pretty routine, Lunzer said. I don't see anything new or inspirational there.\n\nThe Times, the largest newspaper on the West Coast, has a stormy history with labor. In 1910, the newspaper's building was bombed by union organizers, killing 21 employees. The Otis-Chandler family, which owned the Times until it was acquired by Tribune in 2000, was staunchly anti-union.\n\nBut the paper's current owners spurred employees to take action. Tronc's change to the vacation policy was just one factor that motivated employees to organize. Another, Miranda said, was the managerial turnover at the paper. In August, the Times tapped Ross Levinsohn as its eighth publisher since 2000. Miranda herself has worked under four different publishers in three-and-a-half years at the paper.\n\nRelated: Los Angeles Times fires top editor, shakes up management team\n\nThere has also been the type of economic instability familiar to most newspapers, which have seen plunging print revenues give way to painful cutbacks. In 2015, the Times bid farewell to more than 80 reporters and editors who accepted buyouts. There was an additional round of buyouts last summer.\n\nWe're riding out this giant tsunami on a paddle board. That's what it feels like to be a journalist these days, Miranda said. Everyone goes to work with the specter of a layoff over their shoulders. A union offers a modicum of protections when and if they do come.\n\nSuch anxiety is felt in newsrooms across the country, not just the Times, but Miranda and her colleagues have also been driven by specific frustrations with Tronc.\n\nLast month, Times journalists bristled when financial disclosures showed Tronc chairman Michael Ferro paid himself a $5 million a year consulting agreement, and that the company had been paying for his private jet.\n\nThere has also been apparent friction brought on by personnel changes. Levinsohn replaced Davan Maharaj, the Times' publisher and editor in chief since 2016 who had clashed with Ferro and Tronc CEO Justin Dearborn.\n\nAnd D'Vorkin, who was hired in October from Forbes, has had a rocky start to his tenure as editor-in-chief. Earlier this week, NPR published audio recordings of a staff meeting held by D'Vorkin in November, where he was pressed by journalists over a dispute between the Times and Disney.\n\nThe studio had barred Times critics and other journalists from receiving advance screenings of movies, retaliation for the newspaper's investigation into financial breaks afforded to Disney by the city of Anaheim, the home of Disneyland.\n\nDisney eventually ended the ban after what it characterized as productive discussions with the newly installed leadership at The Los Angeles Times regarding our specific concerns.\n\nD'Vorkin can be heard in one of the recordings responding to employees who wanted to know what those productive discussions entailed. In another recording published by NPR, D'Vorkin used harsh terms to criticize the person who had leaked audio of that November meeting to the New York Times. That person, D'Vorkin said, was both unethical and morally bankrupt.\n\nD'Vorkin may be dealt more disappointing news on January 19, when the votes for the Times union are tallied.\n\nWe feel very good about it, Miranda said.

The views expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Wednesday, January 6, shouldn't be a memorable date on the political calendar. To the contrary -- this day is typically a mostly unnoticed step in the certification of the Electoral College votes in the chambers of the US Capitol.\n\nYet if you follow the baseless claims of President Donald Trump and his staunchest allies, you might believe we are confronting an event of utmost controversy or vast legal questions.\n\nSpoiler alert: We aren't. The voters picked Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and they will take office as president and vice president January 20. Still, a handful of Trump zealots in Congress are injecting a veneer of chaos into the process, seeking to undermine faith in our democracy itself.\n\nSo, we have to ask the question: Who among us, especially in the current iteration of the Republican Party, will hold firm on the side of the voters and the rule of law against Trump's assault on the fundamentals of our system of government?\n\nWe should note that while it is positive that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and a growing number of leading Republicans have acknowledged the legitimacy of the election and Biden as President-elect, it is unacceptable that the outgoing President and his loyalists continue to undermine our democracy.\n\nIn many ways, we face another inflection point -- the kind of moment when our individual and collective actions determine in what direction we will travel, what type of society we will inhabit, what kind of country we will be. It's in those instances when a leader's character can be revealed and a people's fate can be sealed. It's in those decisions that we discover who stood on the right side of progress and who failed to uphold our best interests and values.\n\nThese moments are littered throughout our history books. Who fought with then-Gen. George Washington for independence and revolution over despotism and autocracy. Who stood with President Abraham Lincoln for the union and freedom over secession and slavery. Who joined the allies to preserve democracy and human rights against Nazi horrors and fascist violence. Who marched with Martin Luther King Jr. and John Lewis for civil rights, resisting the forces arrayed against human dignity.\n\nThe examples go on. And we face another such point right now: Congress is meeting to certify the Electoral College results January 6, marking the final stop on the road to Biden's inauguration. No matter what Trump and others try to claim, nothing will change the outcome.\n\nWhat makes this time different, though, are the threats of multiple Republicans to formally object to the tally, thereby rejecting the will of the voters in a contest that shattered turnout records\n\nPerhaps this is a last-ditch effort to appease Trump's ego, but it's enough already. The election was fair, secure and free -- and any attempt to undo the vote won't work. Like the more than 50 lawsuits filed since November 3, this has no merit.\n\nBut the perceived political cost of crossing Trump forces us to consider again: This week, who will stand for what's right over what's expedient? Who will choose country over party and law over partisanship?\n\nKentucky, New Hampshire, This gambit made headlines. But beneath the hysteria, something far more remarkable happened, too. There were Republicans who said no. Leaders from Idaho Ohio and even Texas refused to support this case.\n\nSen. John Cornyn of Texas, a former Texas attorney general himself, said he frankly struggles to understand the legal theory of the suit. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert and Gov.-elect Spencer Cox called this case an unwise use of taxpayers' money. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah referred to it as an effort to subvert the vote of the people (that) is dangerous and destructive of the cause of democracy.\n\nAnd, in a brief filed with the Supreme Court, a group of prominent conservative lawyers and former elected officials described the Texas case as a mockery of federalism and separation of powers.\n\nThese leaders held true to the ocath they swore as lawyers and as public servants: to uphold the Constitution and defend the very heart of our republic.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThis shouldn't be anything special. But in this day and age, their actions are. And these leaders show us what it means to stay true to our nation's -- and their own -- character. If we wish to see our values and our way of life survive beyond this unsteady interlude, we need more voices to follow in these footsteps. We need to see that level of dignity and honesty on the floor of Congress. Anything less is a betrayal of our democracy.\n\nThis is a time to step up to the plate. It's not the first, and it won't be the last. But it speaks to who we are -- and can be -- as a people.\n\nJust think back to the origins of our modern system. When the founders concluded the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, a group of citizens standing outside saw Benjamin Franklin, the elder statesman of early America, emerge from the deliberations and asked: What sort of government would we see? What would our future hold?\n\nTo this, Franklin said simply : A republic, if you can keep it.\n\nOur democracy isn't a self-fulfilling prophecy. It requires constant attention and care. And now is another moment to keep our republic intact -- to sustain our magnificent experiment, led by elected representatives ready to preserve the promise of our Constitution.

Infrastructure investment has connected the people and industries of our vast continent with rails and roads, and it has saved lives in our cities with modern water and sewer systems.\n\nPHOTO: Jeff Robinson Jeff Robinson\n\nBut short-sighted infrastructure decisions have also caused serious harm – from the demolition of urban neighborhoods for freeways in the 1950s and 1960s to the flooding of irreplaceable natural gems such as Arizona's Glen Canyon during the dam-building years of the mid-20th century.\n\nThe stakes in the current infrastructure debate are high. But what matters most is not the size of any federal infrastructure package, nor how it is financed, nor even how many jobs it creates in the coming years. What matters most is building the infrastructure that will enable America to respond to the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.\n\nPHOTO: Frontier Group Tony Dutzik\n\nAny infrastructure package that incentivizes the wrong investments or unwisely rolls back crucial environmental, public health and safety regulations in the name of short-term profits could waste taxpayer money or, even worse, hurt the nation's future health and well-being.\n\nThe New Deal infrastructure programs of the 1930s are famous for putting unemployed Americans back to work, but that isn't all they achieved. Back then, economic opportunity was constrained by lack of access to good roads and electricity across much of the country. The iconic infrastructure of the New Deal – from the Merritt Parkway in Connecticut to the power systems of the Tennessee Valley Authority – addressed those needs, helping to position the nation for 20th century success.\n\nWhat is needed to advance America now?\n\nAnswering that question begins with knowing what we don't need to build. America already has too much infrastructure that we don't maintain adequately, or which we don't use to its fullest potential. Research indicates that fixing existing roads, for example, delivers greater return on investment than expanding them. We don't need new pipelines to distribute even more dangerous fossil fuels nearly as much as we need to fix existing pipeline leaks.\n\nAnd we should prioritize stewardship of our existing green infrastructure of wetlands and forests – the natural lands that absorb floodwaters and filter out pollutants before they reach our rivers, streams and lakes. Doing so will minimize the cost of the water and sewer system upgrades we need to deliver safe drinking water to our families and keep our rivers and lakes clean.\n\nWhen we do build, we need to keep 21st century priorities front and center, and incorporate the revolutionary knowledge and technologies spawned over the decades since America's last infrastructure overhaul.\n\nAs more households transition from just consuming energy to also producing energy with solar panels and other renewable technologies, we will need to build a modern, decentralized electric grid to accommodate them. Rural Americans today need access to broadband Internet the way they once needed electricity. As Americans, especially millennials, look for new transportation options without the stress and cost of driving, we need to provide them with new choices, such as convenient public transportation. And since whatever we construct today will be expected to last for a long time, our investments must make sense in an era of climate change.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nMoreover, we need to make sure that the money we spend – either in the form of direct investment or tax breaks – results in infrastructure that is managed for the public interest. Conducting a fire sale of our current publicly owned assets to finance a new wave of infrastructure construction, or subsidizing the construction of infrastructure for private benefit, could leave America weaker, not stronger, as we face the challenges of the modern era.\n\nWith a smart approach to infrastructure that is grounded in 21st century needs, our children and grandchildren can look back with gratitude at the wisdom of our choices. Without one, they will look back in disappointment at the precious opportunities – not to mention dollars – we wasted.

Elsa/Getty Images\n\nThe NFL is now the WWE, and Josh McDaniels, along with the Patriots, has become the top heel.\n\nThe Indianapolis Colts announced Tuesday that McDaniels had agreed to become their next head coach, prompting them to call a press conference to introduce him Wednesday, according to Dakota Crawford of the Indianapolis Star. On Tuesday night, McDaniels reversed course and went back to the Patriots, per ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nThis prompted a league reaction unlike few I've ever seen before. It was fast, vicious and unrelenting. The reaction was also sanctimonious and over-the-top. In other words, it was typical NFL.\n\nHe's a weasel, one NFC assistant coach said of McDaniels.\n\nSuch a gutless thing to do, another NFC assistant said.\n\nHe knows he can't win without Tom Brady, an AFC front office executive said.\n\nHoo boy. Told you this was rough.\n\nVideo Play Button Videos you might like\n\nIt went on and on and on. He made me like [Colts owner] Jim Irsay, an NFL source said. An NFC general manager added: It's easy to mock the Colts, but what Josh did was unprofessional. I know that's not a popular take, but it's true.\n\nActually, it's highly popular. McDaniels isn't just getting destroyed by NFL personnel; he's also a pariah on social media. He is seen as a coward—that was another way NFL sources described him—and the Patriots are viewed the biggest heels in league history.\n\nLife is always far more layered. Plenty of people get nervous and change their minds about jobs. It's happened, in fact, throughout the Bill Belichick coaching tree. Belichick's mentor, Bill Parcells, agreed to coach the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1991. He then backed out, leading then-owner Hugh Culverhouse to declare he was jilted at the altar, as Frank Litsky of the New York Times noted at the time.\n\nKevin C. Cox/Getty Images\n\nBelichick agreed to coach the New York Jets in 1999 before having one of the most infamous about-faces in league history. Belichick quit after just one day on the job, writing on a napkin he was resigning as HC of the NYJ. Classic Belichick.\n\nNow comes this. Perhaps McDaniels discovered something about Andrew Luck's much-discussed shoulder that scared him. Maybe the lack of weapons on defense made him nervous. He may not have wanted to uproot his family.\n\nRegardless, the view of McDaniels appears to have changed irrevocably for the worse. Meanwhile, the view of the Patriots as shady has hardened like a nuclear bunker.\n\nLeague sources say Patriots owner Robert Kraft played a significant role in McDaniels staying. Kraft still despises the Colts over Deflategate, I'm told. These sources also say McDaniels got assurances from Belichick that he was staying for at least several years as head coach of the Patriots.\n\nThere are indeed many factors at play, yet none of that really matters. What matters is perception, and the perception is that McDaniels not only took the easy way out, but assured his place in the Heel Hall of Fame.\n\nThe constant among the texts and phone calls to me as the news broke was the feeling that McDaniels wouldn't win without Brady. Humans can't see alternate universes (yet), so who knows what McDaniels can or can't do without Brady? But that's still the belief around the league.\n\nPatrick Smith/Getty Images\n\nYes, it's true, we don't know about Andrew Luck's shoulder, but that would be part of the challenge of going to Indianapolis. Former Patriots defensive coordinator Matt Patricia went to coach the Lions. The Lions. Coaching the Lions is the NFL equivalent of jumping out of a plane without a parachute.\n\nIt's stunning how McDaniels changing his mind seems like a storyline ripped straight from professional wrestling. You have a despised but great franchise and an offensive coordinator from that team who agrees to coach a hated rival. Then he doesn't. Because he wants to coach Brady, a star who is also despised.\n\nThe only thing missing is a commercial break, a controversial catch and an appearance by Roger Goodell.\n\nThe idea that McDaniels' career is over outside of the Patriots is far-fetched. If he keeps getting to Super Bowls, someone will take a chance on him.\n\nFor now, McDaniels and the Patriots are supervillains. So villainous, they make wrestling jealous.\n\nMike Freeman covers the NFL for Bleacher Report. Follow him on Twitter: @mikefreemanNFL.
Washington (CNN) The longer that President-elect Joe Biden takes to select his pick for US attorney general, the more pressure builds on him to staff his Justice Department with a diverse leadership team.\n\nWhat Biden had initially anticipated would be announced by Christmas Day, has stretched into the new year. That breaks with recent norms for an incoming president to make attorney general among his first Cabinet picks. It's also heightened the calls for Biden to address issues of diversity and racial injustice through his selection to lead the department.\n\nNot only is it the most prominent job left for Biden to fill, the attorney general also has purview over many of the issues feeding racial injustice.\n\nTensions are particularly high since, despite all the lobbying from outside groups, three of the top remaining frontrunners to lead the Justice Department are all White, and two of them are men.\n\nSources have told CNN the top candidates continue to be former Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, federal judge Merrick Garland and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates. As CNN has previously reported , former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, who is Black, remains in the mix. Picks for other top Justice Department jobs are expected to be more diverse, and there is a desire inside Biden's transition team to roll out those selections at the same time to showcase the new administration's commitment to diversity, sources say. That, too, could be adding to the long wait on the announcement for attorney general.\n\nTransition officials have told CNN they are in regular touch with civil rights groups about their attorney general selection and the Department of Justice more broadly, and that they value their perspectives and advice on both topics.\n\nThe diversity push is coming from a wide roster of civil rights activists from organizations like the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO), and the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE). All told CNN they have been in constant contact with the Biden transition team to dole out hundreds of recommendations of people they've vetted for positions throughout the administration.\n\nWe are recommending over 80 people for various (leadership) positions at the Department of Justice and Secret Service among other law enforcement agencies, NOBLE President Lynda Williams told CNN.\n\nWilliams acknowledged that the next attorney general may not be and does not need to be a person of color, but if he or she is, then it will be a bonus.\n\nIn the end, Williams said the nominee must understand they represent something larger than themselves and that there are major issues regarding race in this country, even if it does not sit right at their feet.\n\nAmong the most prominent voices for a culture change at the DOJ has been Rev. Al Sharpton, founder of the National Action Network. In an early December meeting with Biden, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and their team, Sharpton voiced his preference that the next attorney general be Black, and have experience within the federal government with a concentration on civil rights issues.\n\nSharpton however seemed to give an implicit nod to Jones recently when he followed up mid-December comments pushing for a Black attorney general by saying he could also accept a White candidate with a proven civil rights background that's going to handle this heightened racist bigoted atmosphere.\n\nJones was the US Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama under President Bill Clinton when he successfully prosecuted members of the Ku Klux Klan who were responsible for the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in 1963.\n\nA year of strife\n\nA Police officer charges forward as people protest the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis Police in front of the White House in Washington, D.C. on May 31, 2020. - Thousands of National Guard troops patrolled major US cities after five consecutive nights of protests over racism and police brutality that boiled over into arson and looting, sending shock waves through the country. The death Monday of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, at the hands of police in Minneapolis ignited this latest wave of outrage in the US over law enforcement's repeated use of lethal force against African Americans -- this one like others before captured on cellphone video. (Photo by Samuel Corum / AFP) (Photo by SAMUEL CORUM/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nFollowing a year marked by racial protests and strife, calls for federal charges and investigations into the police shootings that sparked widespread protests this summer largely went unanswered. Just days after George Floyd's death, then-Attorney General William Barr said Floyd's death had driven home a longstanding breakdown in the criminal justice system, and Barr vowed to find constructive solutions in the weeks and months ahead so that Mr. Floyd's death will not be in vain.\n\nBut little reform has occurred.\n\nSenate Democrats blocked a Republican policing reform measure in late June because they said it fell short in addressing the very concerns expressed during the summer unrest.\n\nAmong other things, Democrats said the proposal did not include an outright ban on chokeholds and they could not decide whether to overhaul qualified immunity for cops so it's easier to sue them in civil court.\n\nA federal civil rights investigation was launched in Floyd's death and, at the time, FBI Director Christopher Wray said things would be moving quickly.\n\nThat investigation, along with several other probes launched this summer will likely be among the first issues many expect the next attorney general to confront immediately\n\nLongstanding issues\n\nLast week, the Justice Department drew renewed outcry when it announced there was insufficient evidence for federal charges surrounding the police shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, a Black child in Cleveland who was holding a pellet gun in 2014 when he was shot by an officer who believed it was a real pistol.\n\ntamir rice\n\nThat case is a reminder that much of the strife over police brutality toward minorities predates the Trump administration, and that rank-and-file DOJ staffers have been pushing for internal changes for years.\n\nDarlene Brooks has worked at the Justice Department for 33 years, and she says it will take more than just a few diverse voices to change the White-centric culture that has been embedded over the course of many administrations.\n\nEven with Attorney General (Eric) Holder, I was excited for him, but it was like it stopped there, Brooks said. If the Department is riddled with career people who don't embrace diversity and only do a paper exercise, then it's futile and there's no change.\n\nBrooks serves as the President for the DOJ Chapter of the group Blacks in Government, where she leads a team that advocates for the equal opportunity and professional development of Black government employees. Brooks hopes new leadership at the Justice Department will usher in greater diversity in the workforce, will put a renewed focus on civil rights, and will place a priority on police reform.\n\nIt's not about defunding or taking money away from the police, which is how people keep misinterpreting it, Brooks explained. It's really about getting into these police departments and educating their practices.\n\nRestoring a commitment to equal justice\n\nTo do that, Sharpton said it is incumbent on the federal government to take the lead immediately.\n\nThe reason that we could not deal with local law enforcement and prosecutors is because of the intrinsic relationship between the local police who were involved in those situations and the prosecutors in those counties, Sharpton told CNN. Someone that is sensitive to that understands why the federal government and the Justice Department needs to intervene. ... So there's a sensitivity practice and an experienced practice that people of color could bring in that was totally absent in the last four years.\n\nKristen Clarke, the president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said the Justice Department should prioritize reinvigorating federal civil rights enforcement, enforcing the Voting Rights Act, dealing with police brutality and cases in the education space that needs scrutiny.\n\nI think this is one of the most important decisions that President Elect Biden will have to make finding the right attorney general, who can restore a commitment to equal justice under law for all, who can make protection of racial justice and civil rights a top priority. These are incredibly important principles and values of the country needs right now in its next attorney general, so I'm glad that the next administration isn't racing to announce a decision and being really thoughtful and careful in deciding who they put forth for this important position, Clarke said.\n\nNational Urban League President Marc Morial was in the December 8 virtual meeting with Biden, Harris and six other civil rights groups. We generally spoke about the diversity of the Cabinet and the need for there to be a maximum number of African Americans serving in the Cabinet, so that the President can be successful with an emphasis on racial justice and addressing those issues, Morial said.\n\nThe most important thing is that the leadership team be diverse and have a strong commitment to civil rights and racial justice. In this environment that goes beyond simply the attorney general and it goes to the other keys position. President-elect Biden clearly said to us, and it goes without any reservation, that racial justice is going to be a part of everything he does. Racial justice is going to be a part of everything he does whether it's an agricultural or commerce, whether it's an economic policy, he continued.\n\nWe know that the tip of the spear is police community relations. This police issue will not quit. Police relationship systemically with black communities is broken and its costing people their lives.
A new bug was found to be leaking information from hundreds of thousands of websites, but it doesn't appear anyone has exploited it yet.\n\nGoogle vulnerability researcher Tavis Ormandy discovered major websites were inadvertently exposing data while working on a side project last week.\n\nThe so-called cloudbleed vulnerability he found took the security community by storm when it was released Thursday night. Its nickname -- an homage to the Heartbleed bug -- made a lot of people nervous.\n\nBut while it's technically similar to the 2014 bug that compromised the security of large swaths of the internet, the vulnerability that Ormandy discovered has less impact on consumers.\n\nIt existed in websites that use Cloudflare, which is a popular content distribution and security company, with over five million customers including Uber, OkCupid and Fitbit.\n\nThe Cloudflare flaw leaked information from various client websites, potentially including private messages, authentication tokens, passwords and other sensitive data. So when one person visited an affected website, the page may have contained data from another user in its code.\n\nSo let's say a page on OkCupid had bad code. When you visited that web page, it might contain data from another person who was using a Cloudflare-hosted website like Uber. It would be invisible to most people, hidden in the browser's code but freely available to anyone who knows how to look for it.\n\nYou can get the random snapshots of data out of memory, and in some cases they'll contain nothing, Dan Tentler, founder and CEO of security consulting firm The Phobos Group, told CNNTech. In some cases, they'll contain snippets of private conversations happening on a service that is using Cloudflare.\n\nRelated: Your data is not safe. Here's how to lock it down\n\nIn a series of posts describing his discovery, Ormandy said he was able to find private messages from major dating sites, full messages from a well-known chat service, online password manager data, frames from adult video sites [and] hotel bookings. The bug had existed since September.\n\nOrmandy alerted Cloudflare to the issue on February 17. Cloudflare disabled the features that were causing the problem, and began working to delete caches of data that could have potentially exposed personal information. All the caches have not been fully removed yet.\n\nCloudflare CTO John Graham Cumming told CNNTech the company is not aware of anyone exploiting this vulnerability, and the risk that anyone's password has been exposed is small. They will continue to investigate whether anyone exploited the issue before Ormandy discovered it.\n\nOn Thursday night, Cloudflare published a blog post describing the bug and the actions the company took upon its discovery.\n\nBut as Tentler explained, this vulnerability could not have been used to target individual people or companies. Any information an attacker received would be a grab bag -- a random sample of data that may or may not contain any sensitive information.\n\nRelated: How Heartbleed bug weakened everyone's online safety\n\nIt is potentially scary for a small number of people that may have actually been affected, Tentler said. But there's no evidence that anyone discovered it before Ormandy, he said.\n\nCaution is warranted, though. Ryan Lackey, a security entrepreneur who formerly worked at Cloudflare, said since people can't be certain what information, if any, was affected, they may want to change their passwords. Also, anyone with website admin credentials should change them immediately.\n\nLackey also said people should use basic security strategies, including strong passwords, two-factor authentication and a password manager.\n\n1Password, a password manager and Cloudflare customer, said its security is not affected by this vulnerability. A spokeswoman for Fitbit (FIT) said the company is investigating the issue, and concerned users can change their passwords.\n\nOkCupid CEO Elie Seidman said the company's initial investigation into the bug revealed minimal, if any, exposure, and OkCupid will let users know if they find any security issues. An Uber spokeswoman said only a handful of session tokens were involved and have since been changed. Passwords were not exposed.\n\nThough some personal information may remain in cached data, Lackey said it's unlikely this vulnerability will be exploited. Because, he said, there are easier ways of getting personal information, including targeted phishing attacks.\n\nIn reality, it was a great find, Lackey said. But the practical consequences are not huge.
It's common to focus on income as the deciding factor for wealth, but income doesn't tell the whole story.\n\nConsider the perennial news articles about sports stars and actors who've declared bankruptcy despite their multimillion-dollar salaries; they have super-high incomes, yet can't even pay their bills.\n\nThat's why net worth is a much more realistic and accurate measure of your wealth.\n\nWhat is net worth?\n\nNet worth is the value of everything you own, minus everything you owe. It's entirely possible for someone with a very low income to have a substantial net worth, if they're careful about debt and save money regularly. It's equally possible for someone with a very high income -- like those bankrupt sports stars -- to spend every penny they make and then some, resulting in a negative net worth.\n\nNet worth determines wealth\n\nWealth has several possible definitions; open up your dictionary and you'll probably see at least five or six. The one that probably comes closest to the way we think of wealth in the context of being wealthy is this one from Dictionary.com: an abundance or profusion of anything; plentiful amount.\n\nBeing wealthy boils down to having more money than you need. And that's why net worth is a better determiner of wealth than income: your income doesn't say anything about how much money you have available right now, it just says how much money will be coming in on a periodic basis. Net worth is how much you have in cash and other assets to spend today, and if you have more money available to spend today than you need, you are by definition wealthy.\n\nHow to calculate net worth\n\nFiguring out your net worth is not complicated, although it may take some time. First, add up all the money and money-equivalent assets you have: checking accounts, savings accounts, investment accounts, retirement accounts, the money in your wallet, and the spare change in the cracks between your couch cushions.\n\nNext, add up the value of your physical possessions. Your house would be on this list of course (assuming you own it) but so would your car, furniture, artwork, jewelry, TVs, and so on. To get an absolutely accurate net worth number you would include every single thing you own down to that sock in your drawer that's missing its partner, but you don't need to go into that much detail to get a reasonably close total; you can limit your tally to your more valuable possessions.\n\nAnd remember, the things you own are not valued at what you paid for them but what you could sell them for today. Finally, add up the total amount of your debts and subtract this number from the value of your cash and everything you own. The easiest way to total up your debts is to pull a copy of your credit report, subtract any payments you've made that aren't yet reflected on the report, and use that number.\n\nWhat is a good net worth?\n\nThe book The Millionaire Next Door suggests the following formula to calculate what your net worth should be:\n\n(Age x Annual Pre-tax Income) / 10 = Target Net Worth\n\nUsing this formula, a 40-year-old man with an annual pre-tax income of $60,000 per year would calculate his target net worth as 40 x 60,000÷10, or $240,000. If this number looks really, really high to you, you're not alone: the average American falls far short of the target net worth indicated in this formula. According to US census data, 40-year-olds actually have a median net worth of about $35,000, not $240,000.\n\nSetting your own target net worth\n\nThe first step in growing your net worth is setting a goal for yourself. If you set a goal, you can also create a specific plan that will take you to that goal; if you don't have a goal, how can you decide what to do next? For example, let's say that you are the 40-year-old in the previous example and your net worth is $40,000. You're doing a bit better than the average, but you really want to get your net worth up to where the formula from the book says it should be, which is $240,000. You need to increase your net worth by $200,000 to get there. Now that you have a specific number, you can set a timeframe and mini-goals to get you to your ultimate goal no later than your deadline.\n\nHow to increase your net worth\n\nTo increase your net worth, you need to increase your assets, decrease your debt, or (preferably) both. The fastest way to increase your assets is to pump up your retirement contributions. Because the money you put in a 401(k) or IRA can grow tax-free, you can get a slightly better return than you would on the exact same investments in a standard brokerage account.\n\nPlus, your contributions to traditional retirement accounts are tax-deductible, so you can turn around and use the money you save on taxes to increase your net worth further. Decreasing your debt is a worthwhile goal for a lot of reasons, especially if you have a lot of expensive credit card debt or other high interest debt. In fact, getting rid of high interest debt is a higher priority than bumping your retirement contributions, because the interest you pay on your debt will more than cancel out the returns you get on your retirement savings.\n\nA plan for increasing net worth\n\nLet's say you want to increase your net worth by $200,000 and you've decided to set a timeframe of 15 years. For the purposes of this example, you have $5,000 of credit card debt at 18% interest but other than that, your only debt is a low-interest mortgage. The first step in the plan would be to get rid of the credit card debt, and you decide that your goal is to pay it off within one year. You fire up a debt calculator and discover that if you pay an extra $400 per month on your credit card over and above the minimum payment, you'll have it paid off in 11 months. You scrape together the extra $400 by cutting back on expenses, and get it paid off on schedule (don't forget to reward yourself for reaching your first goal!).\n\nNow you've got an extra $400 every month cleared from your budget, so why not start putting that $400 toward your retirement contributions? Assuming that you have $20,000 in retirement savings now and you've been contributing just $100 per month, increasing your contributions to $500 per month means that with an average annual return of 7%, your retirement savings balance will grow to $196,345 in 14 years. Since you'll also be paying down your mortgage over those 14 years, that should be more than enough to get you to your target net worth even if your house doesn't increase in value at all.\n\nSponsored content from The Motley Fool:\n\n• 5 Years From Now, You'll Probably Wish You Grabbed These Stocks\n\n• Kansas Man Turns $10,000 into $8 Million\n\n• Shark Tank Just Revealed a Trillion-Dollar Idea\n\nWhat's more, those calculations assume that your contributions won't increase over that 14-year time period. If you punch these numbers into a savings calculator and add just a 3% annual increase in contributions, you'll see that you'd hit a retirement savings of $199,277 after 13 years, not 14. Suddenly that target net worth doesn't sound so impossible, does it?

Listen to her plea\n\n'Realest thing I've ever seen' on 'The Bachelor:' Lemon reacts to finale twist\n\nActress Mary Tyler Moore appears in character as Mary Richards in The Mary Tyler Moore Show on August 1970.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nWhen Mary Tyler Moore auditioned for the role of Laura on The Dick Van Dyke Show, series creator Carl Reiner famously put his hand on her head, walked her down to producer Sheldon Leonard's office and said, I found her, here she is.\n\nThat might have been television viewers' introduction to Moore, but audiences would continue finding her for years to come, in a Hall of Fame career that included two of the best sitcoms of all time: The Dick Van Dyke Show and The Mary Tyler Moore Show.\n\nMoore was an inordinately gifted comedienne, from her trademark bouts of crying to her stammering delivery when flustered. Yet her career went well beyond that, from her brilliant performance in the movie Ordinary People to her influence as a co-founder of MTM with then-husband Grant Tinker, a TV production powerhouse that produced not only Mary Tyler Moore but many signature programs, including St. Elsewhere, Hill Street Blues and multiple spinoffs from her program, such as Lou Grant and Rhoda.\n\nTinker, the former NBC chairman, died in November, and the loss of both of them in such short order almost feels like the end of a TV era.\n\nHaving started as a dancer – and been featured solely for her legs as the secretary whose face was never seen in the 1950s show Richard Diamond, Private Detective – Moore had to overcome skepticism at the time that a beautiful actress (someone who could famously turn the world on with her smile, as the song went) could also be funny. Her series, moreover, marked a breakthrough in terms of depicting a working woman, one who was single, dated but devoted to her career.\n\nPhotos: Remembering Mary Tyler Moore PHOTO: Bettmann/Getty Images Actress Mary Tyler Moore, whose 1970s TV show helped usher in a new era for women on television, died Wednesday, January 25, her longtime representative Mara Buxbaum said. Moore was 80 years old. The Mary Tyler Moore Show debuted in 1970 and starred the actress as Mary Richards, a single career woman at a Minneapolis TV station. The series was hailed as the first modern woman's sitcom. Photos: Remembering Mary Tyler Moore PHOTO: CBS/Getty Images Moore came to fame in The Dick Van Dyke Show, a sitcom that ran from 1961-1966.

Prev Next\n\nShe did everything so naturally and so gracefully, Reiner said of Moore in a 2015 PBS special, calling her the Grace Kelly of comedians.\n\nMoore's career actually hit a fallow period after The Dick Van Dyke Show, before Van Dyke featured her in a variety special that helped trigger interest in her among network executives.\n\nThe Mary Tyler Moore Show followed in 1970, quickly becoming one of the most popular series on television. While Moore was surrounded by a one-for-the-ages cast, she more than held her own, including what many consider one of the greatest sitcom episodes ever, where Moore's character – after admonishing her co-workers for joking about it – breaks into uncontrollable laughter during a funeral for Chuckles the Clown.\n\nMoore continued to work regularly – in television and on stage – after those shows, while earning plaudits for her work as an advocate for various causes, including diabetes research.\n\nThe memories that linger, though, will for most stem from the glow she brought to the screen in the 1960s and '70s. And thanks to those shows, that hat she tossed skyward during the credits of her eponymous series will never come down.
MONROE, Michigan (CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama said firmly that families are off-limits in the campaign for president, reacting to news that GOP running mate Sarah Palin's 17-year-old daughter is pregnant.\n\nLet me be as clear as possible, Obama said. I think people's families are off-limits, and people's children are especially off-limits. This shouldn't be part of our politics. It has no relevance to Gov. Palin's performance as governor or her potential performance as a vice president.\n\nObama said reporters should back off these kinds of stories and noted that he was born to an 18-year-old mother.\n\nHow a family deals with issues and teenage children, that shouldn't be the topic of our politics, and I hope that anybody who is supporting me understands that's off-limits. Watch more of Obama's comments »\n\nBristol Palin, a senior in high school, is about five months pregnant, according to an aide to Sen. John McCain who asked not to be named. iReport.com: Were you married at a young age?\n\nThe aide said the Palins and the McCain campaign decided to reveal the information now because of rampant Internet rumors that Sarah Palin's 4-month-old baby, who has Down syndrome, was actually Bristol's.\n\nObama became annoyed when asked about a Reuters news service report that quoted an unnamed senior McCain aide saying that Obama's name appears in liberal blogs speculating about Trig's parentage in a way that certainly juxtaposes themselves against their 'campaign of change.'

There is no evidence at all that any of this involved us.\n\nWe don't go after people's families; we don't get them involved in the politics. It's not appropriate, and it's not relevant, he added.

(CNN) —\n\nNew York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and allied progressive groups are ramping up their push for a Green New Deal.\n\nThe initiative came to national prominence after Ocasio-Cortez joined young activists from the Sunrise Movement at a protest in then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's office during orientation for incoming House freshman last year.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, the Justice Democrats, a progressive group that recruited the Bronx-born New Yorker to run, and Sunrise are now poised to throw their organizing muscle behind the ambitious suite of policy proposals, which would move the country toward 100% renewable energy through a series of economic reforms, including a jobs guarantee and heavy public investment in low or no-carbon infrastructure like light rail for commuters.\n\nMovement leaders do not agree on a price tag. Estimates run in the hundreds of billions of dollars, or more. But they argue a combination of tax hikes on the super wealthy – Ocasio-Cortez has floated a 70% rate on income over $10 million – and cuts to fossil fuel industry subsidies and military spending, in addition to the stimulative effects of the new public spending would offset any cost.\n\nAs part of the new outreach, organizers will train volunteers – online and in-person at a series of events this spring – to more effectively confront elected officials and ask for their support. The Road to a GND Tour was drawn up as a traveling pressure campaign designed to secure the support of political leaders, from mayors and city council members to federal lawmakers, around the country.\n\nThe idea of a Green New Deal has, in just a few months, become a central piece of Ocasio-Cortez's agenda and attracted the attention of ambitious national Democrats.\n\nI am thrilled to see so many of the potential 2020 presidential candidates embracing the idea of a Green New Deal, Ocasio-Cortez told CNN. The oil and gas lobbyists won't back down without a fight and that's why we need to support groups like Sunrise Movement in their efforts to keep the pressure up. When the scientific consensus says that you have 12 years to avoid climate catastrophe, it's time to get to work.\n\nThose efforts are also now slated to include a large scale demonstration outside one of the first Democratic presidential primary debates, where Sunrise organizers are hoping that thousands of young activists will gather to demand the candidates onstage back the program. So far, Sens. Bernie Sanders, Jeff Merkley, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker have – to varying degrees – offered their support.\n\nOcasio-Cortez's efforts on Capitol Hill have so far met with mixed reactions from even liberal lawmakers. Her request to establish a committee specifically focused on developing and advancing a Green New Deal mostly fell flat with Democratic leadership, which has instead empaneled a Select Committee on the Climate Crisis to be chaired by Florida Rep. Kathy Castor.\n\nCastor came under fire from climate activists and some progressive Democrats after telling E&E News in December that she would not deny seats on the panel to members who had accepted donations from the fossil fuel industry, calling it a First Amendment issue. She has since backed off that position and pledged, in a subsequent interview with Sludge, to forswear those contributions herself. But the committee is not expected to have subpoena power, a sticking point with progressives who want the authority to compel energy executives to appear under oath.\n\nDemocratic leaders had an opportunity to embrace young people's energy and back the Green New Deal, but they failed us once again, Sunrise co-founder Varshini Prakash said in a statement. In 2019, we're going to talk to the millions of young people scared about climate change and get them organizing to demand that every congressional and presidential candidate back the Green New Deal.\n\nSunrise, along with Ocasio-Cortez and the Justice Democrats, are concerned that the committee itself is not committed to addressing climate change issues over the 12-year timeline addressed in the detailed and dire October report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nI don't want to see my own district under water and I know that Leader Pelosi doesn't either and I know that what we need to show her is we're here to back her up in pushing for 100% renewable energy, Ocasio-Cortez told CNN during the November sit-in at Pelosi's office. This is to show that we are here to back up bold action and that, you know she will be supported in that.\n\nIn response, they are also threatening to launch or back more aggressive primary challenges in 2020 to Democratic members who oppose or stay silent on the Green New Deal.\n\nWe're going to recruit Democratic primary challengers for House races in 2020 who will fight with us, said Alexandra Rojas, executive director of the Justice Democrats, and we'll keep putting pressure on Democrats in Congress and those running for President in 2020 to support the Green New Deal.
The Department of Defense announced today the death of Sgt. La David T. Johnson who was part of a joint U.S. and Nigerian train, advise and assist mission.Sgt. Johnson, 25, of Miami Gardens, Florida, died October 4, 2017 in southwest Niger as a result of enemy fire.\n\nA private funeral was held for Sgt. La David T. Johnson in Cooper City, Florida. Sgt. Johnson, 25, was part of a joint U.S. and Nigerian train, advise and assist mission and died October 4, 2017 in southwest Niger as a result of enemy fire.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe US military is continuing to investigate posts on Twitter claiming to show the aftermath of an October ambush of US troops in Niger in which four soldiers died.\n\nUS Africa Command which is overseeing the investigation issued a brief statement saying it is aware of a post on Twitter purporting to show a US Soldier from the October 4 ambush in Tongo Tongo, Niger. We are reviewing the post and determining the veracity of the tweet and the assertions that there is an associated video.\n\nOfficially the military is not confirming that there is video and separately that there are still images which analysts believe may show some of the Americans killed in combat. The military typically asks the media not to show images where dead US troops on the battlefield may be visible and identifiable by their loved ones.\n\nThe images, where they came from, and who is in possession of the original media, are now part of the investigation being conducted by Africa Command. It's an indication that even as the investigation is wrapping up, new material for investigators to examine is coming to light. It is not known yet if the images provide any significant new information that could change the course of the investigation.\n\nThe Pentagon had hoped to have the investigation completed with a declassified version made available to the public by the end of January. But several defense officials said it's now not likely to emerge before the second half of February due in part to the complexity of getting information declassified.\n\nTwo officials said that under standard procedures some military personnel mentioned in the report may be given a final opportunity to look at the conclusions. This would potentially happen if those personnel are being recommended for disciplinary action. Procedures would potentially allow them to add their statements or clarifications.

N.H., Iowa could have company on caucus calendar Democrats expected to OK changes to nominating process By Mark Preston\n\nCNN\n\nSen. John Kerry celebrates on stage after winning the New Hampshire primary in 2004. YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS New Hampshire Nevada South Carolina Iowa or or Create Your Own WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Nevada and South Carolina will likely join Iowa and New Hampshire as kickoff states for the Democratic presidential nominating process in 2008 after a panel voted to recommend the measure to the party's national committee Saturday. The full Democratic National Committee is expected to approve it when it meets next month in Chicago, Illinois. The DNC's Rules and Bylaws Committee chose Nevada and South Carolina over eight other states and the District of Columbia, which petitioned the DNC for an early position on the presidential primary and caucus calendar. Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Hawaii, Michigan, Mississippi and West Virginia were also vying for early slots. If the measure is approved, Democrats will schedule four nominating contests before February 5, 2008, forcing the party's presidential hopefuls to expand their campaign efforts beyond the Hawkeye and Granite states. The goal is to increase diversity in the nominating process, according to the DNC. The Republican Party is not planning to alter its 2008 presidential primary calendar. The Nevada caucus would fall between the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary, and South Carolina would hold a primary one week after the Granite State contest. Some Democrats say the move would encourage candidates to devote too many resources at the beginning of the nomination process, and could lead to an all-but-official nominee by the first week in February. We may now have a nominee by the time the window opens, said Harold Ickes, a DNC member from the District of Columbia. Choosing the nominee so early would preclude other states from taking part in the process, which could result in Republicans getting more media coverage later on because GOP contenders will still be battling it out, critics say. Supporters contend a change is necessary to bring diversity into the selection process. South Carolina's black population is about 29 percent, and Nevada's Hispanic's population is about 23 percent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Nevada also has a heavy union population, 14 percent, a key constituency for the Democrats. This is a net plus for democracy, but it is also a net plus for the Democratic Party which is trying to rebuild from the bottom up and also trying to include more voices in the process of who selects our nominee, said Donna Brazile, a DNC Rules Committee member from the District of Columbia, who also serves as a CNN political commentator. She also was former Vice President Al Gore's campaign manager in the 2000 presidential race. The new structure could dilute the influence New Hampshire wields in choosing the Democratic presidential nominee. It affects Iowa less because the Iowa caucus remains the first contest on the nominating calendar. New Hampshire officials have led opposition to the plan, fearing that it will marginalize the state's role of holding the First-in-the-Nation Primary. New Hampshire law says that the state's primary must be set at least a week before a similar contest anywhere else, and New Hampshire Secretary of State William Gardner has vowed to enforce state law. Gardner is expected to set the date for the primary in fall 2007. Should New Hampshire choose not to abide by the new DNC calendar, the national committee could refuse to seat New Hampshire delegates at the 2008 Democratic Convention. But Kathy Sullivan, chairwoman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party and a member of the DNC's rules panel, said New Hampshire Democrats will not be intimidated. Somebody who was a delegate in 2004 said to me: If he was elected as a delegate in 2008 and the DNC refused to seat him, he would still go down, and he said, 'I guess I would sit on the steps of the convention hall,'  Sullivan said.

(CNN) — With a past dating back to Roman times, London is widely known as the home of ritual, royalty, elitism and elegance.\n\nBut beneath the layers of history and grandeur lies a multifaceted destination brimming with diversity and individuality.\n\nMore than 300 languages are spoken in the capital, and one in three Londoners were born outside the UK (with one in four born outside of Europe.)\n\nLondon is an extraordinary city, because it is such a melting pot. There are people from all over the world that make this city their home, and everybody is welcome, London born actress Naomie Harris, who starred in Bond movies Skyfall and Spectre, tells CNN.\n\nIt's an incredibly diverse city. I love the energy of it.\n\nBreaking down barriers\n\nLondon's Kingdom Choir brought its musical message of love to the world at the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle,\n\nWhile this cultural mix hasn't always been reflected on the main stage, it was proudly on display at the wedding of the UK's Prince Harry and US actress Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, in May 2018.\n\nOne of the most notable moments from the ceremony, besides a rousing sermon from Bishop Michael Curry, was a rendition of Ben E. King's Stand By Me by Kingdom Choir.\n\nI felt that there was a coming together of communities, says Karen Gibson, founder and conductor of the London gospel choir, says of the performance, which was watched by a estimated two billion around the world.\n\nAs a child of the Windrush generation -- Caribbean immigrants invited to move to the UK by the British government to help with rebuilding after World War II -- Gibson's invitation to perform before the Queen was a clear sign of how far the city has come in breaking down its traditional class systems and embracing its diverse population.\n\nThis 4-year-old child, when she saw us on TV she said, 'Look mommy, they look like me,' she adds. The exclusion is not what it was.\n\nThe performance was a historic moment, as was the addition of Markle, a biracial American, to the British Royal family, where tradition is a fundamental part of everyday life.\n\nFor while aristocrats are now a dying breed in the city, the Royals still have a huge amount of clout.\n\nMagnet for rich people\n\nThere's only one grand family that matters in this town, and that is the monarchy, Peter York, a cultural commentator and co-author of the 1980s book The Official Sloane Ranger Handbook, tells CNN.\n\nThe old world, the pre-war world of dukes and earls with grand houses in central London has utterly gone.\n\nAt the very center of London, the rich people come from everywhere. It couldn't be more international.\n\nIn 2016, London's Sadiq Khan became the first Muslim elected mayor of any major Western city. WPA Pool/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nEncompassing more than 270 nationalities, there's no doubt that London is a truly global city.\n\nIt became the first major Western city to elect a Muslim mayor, Sadiq Khan, in 2016.\n\nBut while diversity is one of its strengths, the city also has its fair share of challenges.\n\nFor instance, the deprivation gap is increasing here, while inequality in income, employment and quality of life is also on the rise.\n\nThis means London is home to some of the UK's poorest citizens as well as its richest.\n\nAlthough this clash of cultures has helped to create enrichment and innovation, it's also led to tension and division in some sections of the city.\n\nQuite literally crossing this divide is youth theater group Intermission, a project that sees 16 to 25-year-olds from some of the city's most disadvantaged neighborhoods get together to perform the works of William Shakespeare in a church next to luxury department store Harrods in London's Knightsbridge.\n\nFounded in 2008 by ex-offender Darren Raymond, who discovered the playwright while serving time in prison, Intermission aims to inspire and engage vulnerable young people considered at risk of committing crime or reoffending.\n\nDrama is incredibly powerful, because it gives people an opportunity, especially young people who are not encouraged to voice their feelings, explains Harris, who acts as a patron for Intermission.\n\nIt gives them a platform to express themselves in a way that's safe, where they feel nurtured.\n\nShakespearean knife crime\n\nLondon theater group Intermission blends classic Shakespeare with the language of the street to engage disadvantaged and vulnerable people at risk of getting involved in crime\n\nRaymond helps the young people who come here connect with Shakespeare by reframing the words in language they can relate to, drawing parallels between the writer's classic plays and modern issues such as knife crime, which rose to its highest ever level in London in 2018.\n\nTo me, Julius Caesar is the ultimate knife crime [story], he says. He gets stabbed to death by conspirators, and we see a lot of that in the inner cities.\n\nWhile London still has a way to go in bridging some of its cultural gaps, Raymond feels that staging projects like this in the city's richest areas is a step in the right direction.\n\nThese people [the group] are from all over London, but we come to Knightsbridge, which is a very affluent area, and are able to be ourselves, he adds.\n\nWhen two worlds meet, beautiful things happen. We are in this world together, regardless of our race, our background, or class. We need to start breaking down these stereotypes.\n\nOf course, London's diversity goes far beyond race and class.\n\n'Night flowers'\n\nl e v a r t\n\nFrom the mods of the 1960s, to the punk scene of the '70s, to '80s goth culture, the city has long been a breeding ground for the subversive.\n\nOne of the capital's latest underground movements comes in the form of a group of men and women who frequent the streets of Soho in the early hours of the morning dressed in outlandish drag, complete with intricate headpieces and stage makeup.\n\nDubbed the night flowers by photographer Damien Frost, who spent a year capturing them on camera, they lurk in the shadows, coming out to bloom when the sun goes down.\n\nIt's a total expressionist movement, an unnamed night flower explains.\n\nYou can call it drag, but there could be many names given to it. It's not necessarily female or male.\n\nWhile the night flowers are from all different parts of the country, the vibrant environment of London is where they come to life, allowing what they describe as imagined versions of themselves to exist in the real world.\n\nLondon has always had eccentrics, explains Frost. I guess this is an extension of that. A lot of the people that do this come from smaller towns. They move to London, and suddenly they can blossom.\n\nThis group of extroverts join a long line of individuals who have relocated to London to blossom.\n\nAn average of 192,000 people a year moved to London from abroad between 2011 and 2015 and the capital's population is predicted to reach 9.8 million by 2025.\n\nThis evolving city continues to attract people from all walks of life, largely thanks to its vivacity and inclusiveness.\n\nCritics sometimes complain that London isn't what it used to be, and they're right, but for all the wrong reasons.

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton raised $27 million in the third quarter for her 2008 Democratic bid for the White House, a Clinton aide said Tuesday.\n\nPresidential hopeful Sen. Hillary Clinton raised $27 million in the third quarter, a Clinton aide said.\n\nAll but $5 million of Clinton's funds can be spent trying to win the Democratic presidential nomination in the primaries, the aide said.\n\nMore than 100,000 new donors contributed to the New York Democrat, the aide said.\n\nClinton outpaced Sen. Barack Obama over the last three months, a reversal of positions from the second quarter.\n\nThe Obama campaign announced Monday the Illinois Democrat raised at least $20 million for his presidential campaign during the third quarter. All but about $1 million of Obama's contributions can be used in the primary fight.\n\nIn the second quarter, he shattered fundraising records by reporting he raised $32.5 million, $31 million of which he can use in his bid for the Democratic nod.\n\nClinton raised $27 million during this same period; all but $6 million can be used in the primaries.\n\nFundraising is historically slow in the third quarter, which covers the final two months of summer and the first month of fall. Watch how summer can be a tough time for candidates »\n\nCampaign finance laws limit the amount an individual can contribute to a candidate during the primary cycle to $2,300. At the same time, individuals can contribute another $2,300 to a candidate for the general election.\n\nCampaigns often report the total of contributions for the primary and general cycles during a quarter, even though general election contributions can't be used immediately to buy ads or hire staff.\n\nMany in Washington have spent the last weeks declaring the outcome of this race to be preordained and the primary process a mere formality, said Obama campaign chief David Plouffe in a veiled reference to Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination in most national polls.\n\nYet, in this quarter alone, 93,000 more Americans joined our campaign, because they desire real change and believe Barack Obama is the one candidate who can deliver it, Plouffe said. This grass-roots movement for change will not be deterred by Washington conventional wisdom, because in many ways it is built to challenge it.\n\nObama's campaign said the senator has raised at least $74.9 million in primary funds so far this year from 352,000 donors.\n\nIn a conference call Monday, John Edwards' campaign announced the former U.S. senator from North Carolina raised $7 million during the third quarter.\n\nEdwards, the party's 2004 vice presidential nominee, said last week he would accept public financing for the primary and general election campaigns, challenging Clinton and Obama to do the same.\n\nEdwards' deputy campaign manager, Jonathan Prince, said the campaign has $12 million in cash. Prince said public funding will add $10 million to its totals.\n\nEdwards has raised more than $30 million so far, and the campaign is on the right track to reaching its goal of $40 million by January, Prince said.\n\nCrediting the campaign's aggressive grass-roots outreach, Prince said Edwards received donations from 150,000 Americans, with 97 percent of contributions less than $250.\n\nEdwards raised more than $9 million in the second quarter.\n\nOn Sunday, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson reported campaign contributions of $5.2 million for the third quarter, which his campaign said supports his claim that he is a top-tier candidate.\n\nThis figure obviously separates us from the second-tier candidates and makes clear this is a four-person race, Richardson's campaign said.\n\nMost political observers put Clinton, Obama and Edwards as the first-tier candidates for the Democratic nomination.\n\nThough $5.2 million is down from the $7 million reported in the second quarter, the Richardson campaign touted it as a strong showing in a historically difficult fundraising period.\n\nMost importantly, this amount ensures we will have the resources we need to compete in the early states like Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, it said. We have strong organizations in those states and continue to expand our field operations by adding staff and opening new offices.\n\nThe campaign did not disclose how much it had spent during the quarter or how much cash it had left. Candidates have until October 15 to file a full report with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nOn the Republican side, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney are expected to battle again for the top spot. Romney raised nearly $35 million so far this year, with Giuliani $1.5 million behind.\n\nSources close to the Giuliani campaign said their candidate expects to be atop the pack for the third quarter.\n\nAmong the GOP candidates, former Sen. Fred Thompson will have his numbers closely scrutinized. Thompson raised more than $8 million for his late-starting presidential campaign in the past three months, a Thompson campaign source said Monday.\n\nThompson's upcoming FEC report also will show 70,000 donors have contributed to the Tennessee Republican in the third quarter, according to the source, who requested anonymity because the campaign has not officially released the information.\n\nThe actor, a former Law & Order star, formally entered the presidential race last month, but he has been raising money since June. Thompson raised close to $3.5 million from about 9,000 donors in June, the final month of the second quarter.\n\nSen. John McCain of Arizona is expected to show he raised more than $5 million this quarter, but a McCain adviser said recent poll numbers in New Hampshire and a busy fundraising schedule next month show the campaign has some life.\n\nMcCain raised $24.5 million the first two quarters of the year but spent nearly all of the funds raised.\n\nLower numbers are expected for Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas, Rep. Duncan Hunter of California, Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, Sen. Tom Tancredo of Colorado and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.

(CNN) — Graham Holliday has made a career out of eating. The author of Eating Viet Nam recently published a new book, this time chronicling his culinary adventures through South Korea\n\nEating Korea: Reports on a Culinary Renaissance  explores the country's rich food history and evolving contemporary culinary scene.\n\nHolliday shares 10 of his favorite Korean foods with CNN Travel -- covering everything from 3-year-old kimchi in Seoul to Busan's unusual type of bibimbap -- and offers a few tips on where to find them.\n\n1. Mugeunji\n\nHolliday seeks out traditional Korean food in modern Seoul. Graham Holliday\n\nHanokjib Kimchi-jjim, in the Seodaemun district of Seoul, is minimally decorated, aside from framed certificates, awards, news clippings, menus and pictures -- all pinned haphazardly to the wall.\n\nThe restaurant serves one thing: kimchi.\n\nUsually made from cabbage and radish, kimchi that has fermented for six months or more is known as mugeunji and the mugeunji at this place is an exquisite 3 years old. A thick, sour, garlic-laced miasma greets you as you enter the traditional Korean-style house.\n\nThe room shudders with the smell, as a long, bloody rag of kimchi spread out like a dead octopus on an oval plate is placed on your table.\n\nHanokjib Kimchi-jjim , 178 Naengcheon-dong, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, South Korea; +82 02 362 8653\n\n2.

(CNN) The Trump administration will implement a new policy Friday to make it more difficult for foreign nationals to travel to give birth on US soil to ensure their children become American citizens, a practice commonly known as birth tourism.\n\nThe new rules will be effective January 24, according to a State Department cable obtained by CNN, which was sent on Wednesday to embassies around the world.\n\nThe White House announced Thursday that the State Department will no longer issue temporary visitor (B-1/B-2) visas to aliens seeking to enter the United States for 'birth tourism.'\n\nVisitors to the US will be denied temporary visas if it's found that the primary purpose of travel is for obtaining US citizenship for a child by giving birth in the United States, according to an amended State Department regulation to be published Friday. The rule does not apply to the 39 countries -- most of which are in Europe -- that are part of the Visa Waiver Program, a State Department official confirmed in a briefing call with reporters Thursday.\n\nFiguring out which travelers are coming to the US to give birth\n\nDuring that call, the official struggled to explain the specific ways that the new rule would be enforced and its actual effectiveness.\n\nAccording to the official on the call and the diplomatic cable, consular officers were told they can't directly ask a woman if they are pregnant.\n\nYou must not ask a visa applicant whether they are pregnant unless you have a specific articulable reason to believe they may be pregnant and planning to give birth in the United States. You should document any such reason in your case notes, reads the cable. You must not, as a matter of course, ask all female applicants (or any specific sub-sets of applicants) whether they are pregnant or intend to become pregnant.\n\nThe State Department official said that the specific articulable reason for bringing the topic up could be if the applicant says they will be traveling for a medical procedure -- which is one of the options already on the application.\n\nThat would be the trigger for much of this questioning of applicants, they said.\n\nThe official did not deny that the officers could use visual cues as part of that reasoning and would not directly say, despite repeated questions, if a consular official could ask a woman if she was pregnant if she looked pregnant. They said officers are not allowed to require a pregnancy test.\n\nAlthough the White House statement said the rule change was necessary to enhance public safety, national security, and the integrity of our immigration system, the official could not describe a specific example of a past national security threat that arose as a result of birth tourism. Instead, they emphasized that the change was closing a loophole that creates a vulnerability.\n\nCNN reported earlier this week that this policy was expected to be announced soon. A State Department official told CNN that the rule change is intended to address the national security and law enforcement risks.\n\nAccording to the rule, the State Department does not believe that visiting the US for the primary purpose of obtaining U.S. citizenship for a child is a legitimate activity.\n\nThe rule is specific to B nonimmigrant visas, which are obtained for temporary visitors for business or tourism.\n\nAdditionally, the regulation requires that visa applicants who seek medical treatment in the US must demonstrate their arrangements for treatment and establish their ability to pay all associated costs.\n\nThis is the first recognition that it's not OK to use a visitor visa for the purposes of 'birth tourism,' so it has a symbolic strength in that respect, at the same time it's not a very effective way at going after the 'birth tourism' industry, said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute.\n\nA 'very awkward position'\n\nThe regulation presents multiple challenges, according to Pierce. It puts consular officers in a very awkward position of having to decide whether or not they believe someone is imminently going to give birth, she said.\n\nPierce also pointed out that most people don't admit that they are intending to use a visa for the purposes of gaining citizenship for a child, she said.\n\nIn addition, these types of visas are granted for up to 10 years, so someone could apply to come to the US long before becoming or intending to become pregnant, said Pierce.\n\nA much more effective way to go after this would be to go after the industry itself, she said.\n\nWhile the US government does not specifically track 'birth tourism,' the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publishes annually the number of births in the US to foreign women who reside overseas.\n\nThere have been around 10,000 such births every year for the past few years, according to CDC data.\n\nThe State Department estimates thousands of children are born in the US to these types of business and tourist visa holders annually, however the department acknowledged it is challenging to come up with precise estimates. The State Department official did not have an estimate on how much so-called birth tourism cost US taxpayers.\n\nThe US has also sought legal action against people thought to be capitalizing on the 'birth tourism' industry.\n\nLast year, the Department of Justice charged three people with running birth tourism companies that catered to Chinese clients in Southern California -- the first time that criminal charges had been filed in a US federal court over the practice.\n\nThe charges stemmed from a 2015 raid of dozens of maternity hotels, often upscale apartments, where mothers-to-be paid between $15,000 and $50,000 to give birth in the US, according to a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement statement at the time.\n\nOn Thursday, acting ICE Director Matt Albence said his agency would continue to prosecute and investigate birth tourism cases, as they've previously done, but didn't comment on any future plans.\n\nThe investigations that we conduct now are the same ones we conducted under the Obama administration, Bush administration, I was hired under the Clinton administration. The laws generally haven't changed with what we do, he said, reiterating that State Department handles issuing visas.\n\nIf we have information on groups or intel with regard to people that might be coming, trying to exploit those regulations, we certainly share that information and work closely, he said.\n\nThe White House said Thursday the new rule will close a glaring immigration loophole and protect the US from the national security risks created by this practice.\n\nBy obtaining a child's US citizenship through birth tourism, foreign nationals are able to help that child avoid the scrutiny, standards, and procedures would normally be undergone, if someone seeks to become a US citizen through the naturalization process, according to the State Department.\n\nIn 2018, President Donald Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship by executive order, though lawmakers immediately pushed back against his comments.\n\nTom Jawetz, vice president of Immigration Policy at the Center for American Progress said, the rule encourages officials to use their authority to discriminate on the basis of gender and age by denying a visa based on the possibility that a person might give birth in the United States.\n\nBy creating a 'rebuttable presumption' for people deemed by a single consular officer to potentially give birth while in the United States, the rule would almost certainly make it far harder for women, especially women of color, to come to the United States on tourist or business visas. The bill is only the latest effort by this White House to reshape immigration policy to harm women, he added in a statement.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect that the new rules will be effective January 24, 2020.

Washington (CNN) In an extraordinary move, all four federal prosecutors who took the case against longtime Donald Trump confidant Roger Stone to trial withdrew Tuesday after top Justice Department officials undercut them and disavowed the government's recommended sentence against Stone.\n\nThe mass withdrawal of the career prosecutors on the case was a stunning response to the controversial and politically charged decision by Attorney General William Barr and other top Justice Department officials to reduce prosecutors' recommended sentence of up to nine years, which came just hours after Trump publicly criticized it on Twitter.\n\nThe rapid-fire developments in the case -- the prosecutors' withdrawals came one by one through court filings over the course of two hours Tuesday afternoon -- spilled tensions between Justice Department brass and the career prosecutors into the open, raising questions about the Justice Department's independence from political pressure. In a new filing Tuesday, the US Attorney's Office in Washington revised the sentencing recommendation to be far less than the seven-to-nine years recommended on Monday. It was not signed by any of the prosecutors who worked the case.\n\nUltimately, the presiding judge in the case will have the final say on Stone's sentence.\n\nTrump denied any involvement in the sentencing revision, but the turnaround drew howls from congressional Democrats, who called for the Justice Department inspector general to investigate.\n\nIt is outrageous that DOJ has deeply damaged the rule of law by withdrawing its recommendation, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, tweeted Tuesday. Stepping down of prosecutors should be commended & actions of DOJ should be investigated.\n\nOf the four prosecutors who withdrew from the case -- Aaron S.J. Zelinsky, Jonathan Kravis, Adam Jed and Mike Marando -- Zelinsky and Kravis also resigned from the DC US attorney's office. Zelinsky, who worked on former special counsel Robert Mueller's team , did not resign from the Baltimore US attorney's office, where he is based.\n\nThe mass withdrawal was set in motion on Monday when the prosecutors from the DC US Attorney's office, who are Justice Department employees, wrote in a filing that Stone should be sentenced seven to nine years in prison after he was convicted on seven charges last year that came out of Mueller's investigation, including lying to Congress and witness tampering.\n\nTrump weighed in on Twitter overnight on Tuesday, calling it a horrible and very unfair situation.\n\nThe real crimes were on the other side, as nothing happens to them. Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice! Trump said. On Tuesday afternoon, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that he didn't ask the Justice Department to change the sentencing recommendation.\n\nBy midday Tuesday, a senior Justice Department official said that the original sentencing recommendation from the prosecutors, transmitted to a judge and signed off on by the office's top prosecutor, had not been communicated to leadership at the Justice Department.\n\nThe Department was shocked to see the sentencing recommendation, the official told CNN. The Department believes the recommendation is extreme and excessive and is grossly disproportionate to Stone's offenses.\n\nIn the revised sentencing recommendation, filed Tuesday afternoon, federal prosecutors asked for Stone to still be sentenced to prison, but said it should be far less than the office had asked for a day earlier. The prosecutors declined to say how much time in prison Stone should serve.\n\nWhile it remains the position of the United States that a sentence of incarceration is warranted here, the government respectfully submits that the range of 87 to 108 months presented as the applicable advisory Guidelines range would not be appropriate or serve the interests of justice in this case, the prosecutors write.\n\nThe decision to make the change was directed by the leadership of the Justice Department, the official said. The department made the decision before the President's tweet and without consultation with the White House, according to Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman. The White House referred a request for comment to the Justice Department, and the US attorney's office in Washington declined to comment.\n\nLater Tuesday, Trump attacked the prosecutors in a series of tweets, saying they cut and ran and asking if they were Mueller people.\n\nGrant Smith, an attorney for Stone, said they look forward to reviewing the government's latest filing shortly.\n\nWe have read with interest the new reporting on Roger Stone's case. Our sentencing memo outlined our position on the recommendation made yesterday by the government. We look forward to reviewing the government's supplemental filing, Smith said in a statement. Stone's attorneys had argued a sentence of 15 to 21 months would be appropriate.\n\nProsecutors quit\n\nIn between the two sentencing recommendations, the mass exodus from the Stone case began.\n\nZelinsky, who is based at the Baltimore US attorney's office, was the Mueller prosecutor most closely associated with Stone's case while it was being investigated, and also played a significant role in questioning witnesses at Stone's trial. He stayed with the Stone case following the closure of Mueller's office and resigned effective immediately after this filing from his role in the DC US attorney's office, he wrote to the judge on Tuesday.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Baltimore US attorney's office said Tuesday afternoon that Zelinsky had not resigned from his position there.\n\nAfter Zelinsky's filing, Kravis told the court he was also withdrawing from the case and resigning from the DC US attorney's office. Jed and Marando soon followed with withdrawals of their own, making clear that the revised sentencing recommendation prompted all four prosecutors who worked on the Stone case to leave it.\n\nMarando delivered a passionate closing argument to the jury at Stone's trial: Truth matters, he told the jury.\n\nThe US attorney's office in Washington declined to comment on the resignations. John Crabb, another prosecutor in the DC US attorney's Office, has announced he'll work on the Stone case.\n\nA senior Justice Department official acknowledged that the four Stone prosecutors appeared to resign in protest after their recommended sentence was reduced by senior leadership at justice.\n\nIn a briefing earlier Tuesday, the official tried to downplay the significance of the department's reversal as a breakdown in communication between prosecutors in the field and leadership, despite the extraordinary spectacle of all four prosecutors quitting the case in response.\n\nThe crux of the behind the scenes disagreement between the prosecutors on the Stone case and main justice leadership appears to be over whether Stone should get additional years of punishment for the witness tampering charge and other aggravating offenses.\n\nProsecutors on Monday had requested the judge enhance Stone's sentence in line with a strict interpretation of the charges. Without the enhancement, the prosecutor's sentencing recommendation would be years lighter -- more in line with what the senior department official had said was due in the case.\n\nBut having such a disagreement lead to a change and downplaying of the original sentencing recommendation is not a common occurrence.\n\nShock over department's move\n\nIt's not immediately clear whether the Justice Department's revised recommendation will affect the decision of Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who will have broad authority to sentence Stone as she sees fit on February 20.\n\nBut the move to overrule federal prosecutors after they've already made a public commitment is rare, and quickly reverberated throughout the ranks of career Justice Department employees, with prosecutors from another high-profile US attorney's office expressing shock to CNN.\n\nTensions have simmered at the department in recent months over Barr's penchant to be closely involved in matters big and small in the department, Justice officials say. The attorney general has a reputation as a micro-manager and that has manifested itself in odd ways.\n\nBarr in recent weeks appointed Timothy Shea, a close aide, to be acting US attorney in Washington in a clumsy transition with the former US Attorney Jessie Liu, who was moving to a post at the Treasury Department.\n\nLiu had been waiting to move to the new job, but Barr's move to appoint Shea while Liu was still awaiting her hearing created an awkward transition.\n\nShea had qualms about the sentencing recommendation on Stone made by line prosecutors, but went along with it, perhaps as a way to win over his troops in the office, one official said\n\nBarr's decision to disavow and sharply criticize a decision made by Shea severely undermines him in his new job, officials say.\n\nFederal prosecutors and a person convicted of crimes both have the opportunity to submit a memorandum to the court ahead of their sentencing hearing, asking for certain amounts of prison time or less severe punishments. At the sentencing hearing, they'll speak again to the judge about their wishes before the judge makes a final decision.\n\nLiu's nomination withdrawn\n\nTrump on Tuesday abruptly withdrew the nomination for Liu , the former US attorney who headed the office that oversaw Stone's prosecution, to serve in a top Treasury Department position, three sources told CNN.\n\nLiu was nominated in December to serve as the Treasury Department's under secretary for terrorism and financial crimes. She previously headed the US attorney's office that oversaw the prosecution and conviction of Trump's longtime political adviser until Barr replaced her last month, and she also led the team that worked on the sentencing of former Trump deputy campaign manager Rick Gates.\n\nOne of the sources on Tuesday did not dismiss the idea that the withdrawal was connected to the Stone case development.\n\nLiu was informed the White House had withdrawn her nomination Tuesday, according to two sources.\n\nChanning Phillips, Liu's predecessor as US attorney in DC, said Tuesday night that the day's developments are deeply troubling.\n\nWithout knowing all of the details, the mere fact that all four of the line prosecutors withdrew from the case, as has been reported, suggests undue meddling by higher ups at DOJ or elsewhere, Phillips said in a statement.\n\nWhile it is not uncommon for a USAO to consult with Main Justice in such high profile matters (indeed, it is required for certain matters), it is unprecedented to have a USAO dramatically change their sentencing recommendation after its memorandum has been filed unless there has been a change in circumstances or facts, he said, adding: One simply cannot reconcile the two sentencing memoranda filed by the USAO.\n\nTrump has faced intense lobbying to pardon Stone\n\nTrump was outraged after the prosecutors filed the sentencing memo, and has continued to fume about it privately, multiple people said. The question at hand, of course, is whether Trump will pardon one of his longest-serving advisers.\n\nSeveral of Stone's allies have stepped up their lobbying efforts in recent weeks, appealing to Trump by discussing Stone's devastating legal fees and highlighting the damage to his family. But there are also multiple people who have advised Trump that pardoning his former adviser would be harmful politically during his run for reelection.\n\nNot all the lobbying has been done behind closed doors. Some of Stone's closest confidantes, including his daughter and friend Michael Caputo, have advocated for a pardon on the airwaves of Fox News on Tucker Carlson's program, which Trump watches religiously. People who know Trump well say these tactics can often be more effective than appealing to him directly.\n\nIt's unknown when Trump would pardon Stone, should he choose to do so. Some have advised he wait until after the election, but others have said that would be far too late -- and it's a stronger message if he does it sooner rather than later.\n\nThe Trump-Stone relationship hasn't always been rosy. Trump has fumed about Stone privately at times, bad-mouthed him to others often and once fired him for being publicity-seeking.\n\nBut the President also views his former confidant through the lens of himself, several people close to him say, seeing an attack on Stone as an attack on him.\n\nNew filing takes more sympathetic view of Stone's crimes\n\nThe new filing -- which isn't signed by any of the four prosecutors who endorsed the original sentencing memo before announcing their departure from the case on Tuesday -- takes a more sympathetic view of Stone's crimes. It suggests that Stone may not have truly threatened to injure his associate Randy Credico, even though a jury had found him guilty of intimidating him.\n\nThe filing says Stone's advanced age, health, personal circumstances and lack of criminal history weigh in favor of a lesser sentence. The prosecutors point to other cases, including that of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who received more lenient sentences for witness intimidation, false statements and obstruction of justice.\n\nThe DC US Attorney's Office now argues that Jackson should effectively discount Stone's social media posts following his arrest, including one threatening her, when deciding his sentence.\n\nIn their previous argument that Stone should get seven to nine years in prison, prosecutors had noted that Stone posted an image on Instagram of Jackson with crosshairs behind her head, contradicted himself under oath in a court hearing about the Instagram post, and violated the judge's orders not to speak publicly about the case should merit him more prison time.\n\nBut the new court filing on Thursday says those actions shouldn't add to Stone's sentence.\n\nIt is unclear to what extent the defendant's obstructive conduct actually prejudiced the government at trial, a new prosecutor on the case wrote to the judge.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers said they were calling for the Justice Department inspector general to investigate the decision to revise Stone's sentencing recommendation.\n\nThis situation has all the indicia of improper political interference in a criminal prosecution, Schumer said in a letter to the inspector general, Michael Horowitz. I therefore request that you immediately investigate this matter to determine how and why the Stone sentencing recommendations were countermanded, which Justice Department officials made this decision, and which White House officials were involved.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.
Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, wants world leaders who call themselves feminists to practice what they preach.\n\nI've heard so many leaders say, 'Oh, I'm a feminist,' Lagarde told Richard Quest of CNNMoney. To all those who have declared themselves feminists -- and I applaud them and I continue to applaud them -- let's make sure that we hold them to account and that they actually demonstrate what they preach.\n\nThe focus of the interview was International Women's Day, which takes place March 8. Lagarde said she was concerned that feminist rhetoric from some world leaders does not necessarily match the practice and I don't really understand why.\n\nWhen you have women in any executive group, the results are better, she said. When you have women join the labor force, it's better for growth. It improves the whole chemistry, and yet it is not happening fast enough. In some cases, it is not happening at all.\n\nRelated: What will it take to close the gender gap by 2044?\n\nShe said that many countries need to change laws before women can achieve equality. For example, she said that some countries tax by the family, which causes the second worker in the household -- usually the woman -- to be taxed at a higher rate. She also said that more countries should provide good child care services so women can work during the day.\n\nLagarde acknowleged to Quest that it's a bit depressing to still be falling behind in achieving equality for women.\n\nI think it will continuously be so, because there's an element of culture, there's an element of history, she said. There is an element of biology and genetics about it, which we have to constantly fight against and we should do so because I think it leads to improvement of the entire community.\n\nRelated: IMF chief Lagarde guilty of negligence\n\nLagarde has said, in an IMF video two years ago, that IMF research shows that women's participation in the workforce leads boosts economies. But there are many legal barriers to them working in many countries, including the tax system, and the lack of maternity and paternity leave.
(CNN) Australia woke up to a new year on Friday -- and a slightly different national anthem.\n\nThe anthem, Advance Australia Fair, has been tweaked to recognize the country's Indigenous history and communities, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced late Thursday, hours before 2021.\n\nThe first line, Australians all let us rejoice, for we are young and free, will now end with one and free.\n\nAustralia as a modern nation may be relatively young, but our country's story is ancient, as are the stories of the many First Nations peoples whose stewardship we rightly acknowledge and respect, Morrison wrote in an opinion piece in the Sydney Morning Herald\n\nIn the spirit of unity, it is only right that we also now acknowledge this and ensure our national anthem reflects this truth and shared appreciation. Changing 'young and free' to 'one and free' takes nothing away, but I believe it adds much.
The Koch brothers' company is advertising in Sunday's Super Bowl.\n\nBillionaires Charles and David Koch are well known for spending enormous sums of money to back conservative politicians and causes.\n\nBut they're also the owners of Koch Industries, which deals in petroleum, chemicals, energy, commodities trading and several other businesses. It is the second-largest private company in America, according to Forbes, with $100 billion in revenue and 100,000 employees.\n\nThe Kochs launched the ad campaign, called Challenge Accepted, to educate people about what the company does, said company spokesman Steve Lombardo.\n\nThe ads are basically filling an information gap, Lombardo said. Right now, people really don't know much about Koch at all -- what we do, the products we provide.\n\nRelated: Why Super Bowl ads still matter\n\nThe Super Bowl ads will air in regional markets. Koch ads will also air nationwide during this month's Olympics, beginning with the opening ceremonies. The campaign was first reported Thursday by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nLombardo declined to say where the Super Bowl ads would be broadcast, though he added that fluctuations in ad prices could cause those markets to change. He would also not say how much Koch Industries is spending on the commercials.\n\nThe company first began advertising on national TV in 2014 with its We Are Koch campaign. That ad opened with a sweeping shot of a tractor rolling across farmland as a woman announced that Koch Industries was proudly built on American values and skill.\n\nLombardo described the new ads as phase two of that campaign. Some ads will feature workers, while others will feature people taking on challenges in every day life.\n\nRelated: The Koch network isn't slowing down\n\nWhile Koch Industries is focused on its new awareness campaign, the Koch brothers also have their eyes on Washington.\n\nThe Koch brothers plan on spending big money this year to lobby lawmakers on policy through their vast network of political advocacy groups and donors.\n\nAt an event last weekend in California, leaders of the political advocacy network founded by the Kochs met to talk spending on political strategy and messaging.\n\nThat network, which includes the conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, is set to invest close to $400 million in this election cycle -- more than in any previous midterm.\n\nThe Kochs also plan to lobby Washington for criminal justice reform. And they favor a path to citizenship for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n\n--CNN's Rebecca Berg contributed to this story.
London (CNN) The UK has abolished the 5% rate of value-added-tax (VAT) on menstrual products, known as the tampon tax.\n\nIt means that from January 1, period products will no longer be subject to VAT.\n\nThe UK government said the change was made possible by the end of the Brexit transition period, and freedom from an EU law that mandates VAT on sanitary products.\n\nI'm proud that we are today delivering on our promise to scrap the tampon tax, said UK finance minister Rishi Sunak, who committed to the change in his March budget.\n\nSanitary products are essential so it's right that we do not charge VAT, he said in a statement.\n\nRead More

The battle between Amazon and Walmart is heating up.\n\nAmazon has lowered its free shipping minimum for non-Prime members to $35 -- a nearly 29% drop.\n\nThe company increased its free shipping threshold to $49 from $35 almost a year ago.\n\nItems will be delivered five to eight days after they are available to ship.\n\nAmazon didn't specify exactly when the minimum was lowered, but did say the change happened recently.\n\nOrders that contain at least $25 of eligible books also ship free.\n\nShoppers with an Amazon (AMZN) Prime membership, which costs $10.99 a month or $99 a year, get unlimited free two-day shipping on eligible items along with other benefits like streaming TV, movies and music.\n\nRelated: Move over, Amazon: Here comes Walmart\n\nAs more people turn to online shopping, Walmart (WMT) and Amazon have been competing for customers.\n\nWalmart started offering free two-day shipping without a membership fee on orders of at least $35 on January 31. It had previously offered unlimited free two-day shipping with its $49-a-year-ShippingPass subscription.\n\nOn Tuesday, Walmart reported its e-commerce revenue increased 29% in the fourth quarter from a year ago. Amazon reported earlier this month that total sales rose 22% in the same period.
(CNN) Cleta Mitchell, a lawyer who assisted President Donald Trump on the January 2 call when Trump pressured Georgia officials to find him votes, has resigned from her law firm.\n\nNational law firm Foley & Lardner previously said it was concerned with Mitchell's involvement in Trump's call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, and said the firm wasn't engaged in any legal work challenging the election results. Tuesday, it announced Mitchell was no longer with the firm.\n\nCleta Mitchell has informed firm management of her decision to resign from Foley & Lardner effective immediately. Ms. Mitchell concluded that her departure was in the firm's best interests, as well as in her own personal best interests, firm spokesman Dan Farrell said in a statement Tuesday. We thank her for her contributions to the firm and wish her well.\n\nMitchell told her friends and clients on Tuesday in a personal email that she had left her law firm after almost two decades, blaming a massive pressure campaign in the last several days mounted by leftist groups against her, the firm and her clients stemming from her affiliation with Trump and his post-election litigation and efforts in Georgia.\n\nWith the ever more brazen attacks on conservatives and, most especially, anyone who supports and wants to help President Trump, I realize that a large national law firm is no longer the right platform for me or my law practice, she wrote. Mitchell confirmed her email to CNN but declined to comment further.\n\nRead More
No matter how skilled the teacher, and how clever the lesson plans, most kids would find at least some academic work utter drudgery.\n\nMany families are experiencing this drudgery compounded by distance learning compounded by two-plus weeks of sweet, winter break freedom during which nobody asked anyone to answer a math problem on Zoom.\n\nKids, we need you to motivate. For your own sake, so you can resume your schoolwork without too much struggle or pain. And for your parents' sake, so we can work, cook, clean, grocery shop and whatever else we need to do during our precious daytime hours instead of making sure you're paying attention to Zoom school.\n\nIf only it were as easy as bribing them with the Halloween candy leftovers. Motivation is a complex mechanism, one that depends on a mix of biological and social factors. Punishments and rewards can help nudge it in the right direction. To really unlock a child's drive, however, parents need to think beyond simply getting things done.\n\nHow motivation works\n\nFourth grader Miriam Amacker does schoolwork in her room at her family's home in San Francisco.\n\nThe brain systems behind motivation are shaped over time, and begin in the early years. Young children need a supportive caregiver to encourage them to take chances and explore, and cheer them on when they find an activity rewarding. Over time, the pleasure a child experiences from overcoming a challenge or indulging a curiosity will reinforce his or her desire to do it over and over again.\n\n2018 paper from the Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University explains the brain mechanisms behind this process. It advises parents to start this early, and remember to challenge kids -- not too little, and not too much.\n\nFrom infancy onward, effort is required to sustain motivation, but success must be possible. They lose motivation when a task is too easy, but also when it is so difficult as to be insurmountable, the authors wrote.\n\nTo get kids more motivated, they recommend giving kids as much agency as possible, keep the rewards to a minimum while fostering intrinsic motivation, and remember that conditions -- including resources, time and support -- matter. It is incorrect to say that if anyone wants something badly enough, he or she will find a way to do it.\n\nDoing more by doing less\n\nThis post-holiday period during a pandemic hasn't created the ideal conditions for parents to help kids get motivated. Who has the time? The resources? The ability to support? But even frazzled, exhausted parents, which is to say nearly all parents, can do it.\n\nLike so much else in life, when it comes to motivating your kids less really can be more.\n\nWendy Ostroff, associate professor of cognitive and developmental science at Sonoma State University in California, found that her sixth grade son was having a hard time with distance learning this fall.\n\nHe was having a lot of anxiety, and not getting his work in, said Ostroff, who is also the author of  Cultivating Curiosity in K-12 Classrooms: How to Promote and Sustain Deep Learning . It was too many moving parts for him, and it was derailing our whole family.\n\nReluctant to be that mom, the one asking for special treatment, at first she held off on requesting a lighter load from his teachers. But after two months, enough was enough, and she requested they cut back on the art and music classes that were hard for her son.\n\nHe was a different kid, she said.\n\nOstroff considers this an important lesson, and one that she hopes other parents receive. Sometimes with kids, the trick to motivation is as simple as cutting back on your child's workload. If your kid feels overwhelmed, it's hard for them to see the potential in himself, or his work.\n\nMake sure they have time to play\n\nThird grader Elena recites multiplication tables as her brother Wyatt reviews his kindergarten work on a tablet with their mom, Christi Brouder, in Haverhill, Massachusetts.\n\nChildren are not designed to learn virtually, Ostroff said, no matter how good their teacher is and how long they can sit still. Instead, kids learn best through play, social interactions and collaboration, all difficult to achieve on a screen.\n\nWe have to put the joy back in learning because a lot of the joy is gone, she said, explaining that surprise and silliness are what activate kids' brains.\n\nIn order to inject more of this in their lives, Ostroff recommends carving out time in the day when kids can learn in a more playful manner, whether it's during school or not. Listen to kids, help them follow their own curiosities, and worry less whether they are putting their all into every online assignment.\n\nSometimes this learning might be easy to identify -- maybe they've taken up astronomy or skateboarding -- and sometimes it will be more subtle. Learning how to fight through boredom and stay resilient in tough times are important skills that many kids are refining right now, Ostroff said.\n\nAlso, kids who feel they have some control and time to play are likely to be happier, and happier kids are more likely to grin and bear those parts of the day about which they are less than enthusiastic.\n\nWe need more dialogue with kids, and a loosening from teachers and parents, but unfortunately all the news is about tightening in on them, and being afraid, she said.\n\nHelp kids think big\n\nFor those moments when there is an essay that your daughter really doesn't want to write or a math problem that your son just doesn't want to figure out, it can be helpful to redirect their attention to how learning today will impact their future.\n\nIt's not about how successful they will be, since that may not sound inspiring, said David Yeager, associate professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin. Try motivating them in the context of how they will be better able to help others.\n\nReframe any frustration or difficulty a student is having as part of their contribution to the world, he said. Tell them the stronger their brain is, the more they will be able to contribute to something bigger than themselves.\n\nThis taps into our instinct to help others, and the wash of feel-good hormones we tend to get from acts of empathy and altruism, Yeager said.\n\nThe human brain is wired to get satisfaction from these acts before we see their results. That makes this a more useful motivation trick than focusing on getting a good grade or making lots of money when they grow up. With those, the good feeling tends to come much later, if at all.\n\nWhen you donate to the homeless you immediately feel like a good person, even though they aren't getting money for days or weeks, Yeager explained.\n\nFor teens, it can be particularly useful to help them see how the things they learn in school can help them change the world when they grow up. Teenagers make better life choices when they see these choices as an act of defiance, a 2016 study found.\n\nTeens can also be motivated by their hunger for meaning.\n\nThe new neuroscience of adolescence is actually showing that teen brains are ready to learn if they see how it gives their life significance, he said.\n\nFor younger kids, Yeager suggests parents encourage kids to try hard for the sake of their teacher. This tends to be someone they care for, and doing right by their teacher will help provide that emotional immediacy that is a key component for motivation.\n\nReward the process, not the action\n\nRewards and punishments can be used for all ages, he said, but not to reward results or productivity. We should reward the routines and habits that make productivity possible.\n\nDon't use a reward for completing a Zoom call with perfect attention, use the reward for something smaller like being seated at 8:15 with your laptop open, he said. You are rewarding the habit, or the step that will make it easy, almost automatic, for them to be in class.\n\nGet them to do smaller steps and they will be more likely to do bigger steps on their own.\n\nOverall, taking small steps is always good advice when trying to change a behavior or attitude.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nParents might want to try these motivational tricks on ourselves when trying to get motivated to motivate our children.\n\nWhether you're reimaging your children's schedules, making more space for them to play, or having conversations about how today's work impacts their ability to contribute in the future, slow down and see what works to motivate your kid in these difficult times.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nLawyers working for former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort accidentally revealed on Tuesday the clearest public evidence of coordination between the campaign and Russians, adding new details to the murky mosaic of potential collusion in 2016 – including sharing polling data with an alleged Russian operative.\n\nThe explosive new information was buried in a court filing from Manafort's lawyers, though the portions about his contacts with a shadowy Russian during the campaign were meant to be redacted.\n\nBut the document was fully searchable, even the blacked-out parts, revealing fresh details about the core of the ongoing investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the latest disclosures and how they might fit into the existing puzzle.\n\nRelationship with Kilimnik\n\nClose watchers of the investigation have been intrigued by the still-developing role of Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian political consultant who worked closely with Manafort in Ukraine. They helped Moscow-friendly politicians get elected and hold onto power for nearly a decade.\n\nManafort and Kilimnik stayed in touch after their Ukrainian clients were ousted in 2014. They met twice in the United States during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to their own public statements. News reports have detailed their phone calls and emails in 2016, including one exchange where Manafort tried to use Kilimnik to reach a prominent Russian oligarch.\n\nBut Tuesday's filing revealed they had a third meeting, this time in the Spanish capital of Madrid. One redacted portion quoted Mueller's team: After being told that Mr. Kilimnik had traveled to Madrid on the same day that Mr. Manafort was in Madrid, Mr. Manafort 'acknowledged' that he and Mr. Kilimnik met while they were both in Madrid. A spokesman for Manafort sought to clarify the filing in a statement Tuesday night, saying that the third meeting happened in early 2017, after the election.\n\nThe growing list of Manafort-Kilimnik contacts could be relevant to the collusion question because, according to previous court filings from Mueller, the FBI has assessed that Kilimnik has ties to a Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016.\n\nMany of their contacts happened while the Russian government was aggressively meddling in the US election. Court filings said Kilimnik was affiliated with the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency that was responsible for hacking Democratic targets and orchestrating the WikiLeaks releases.\n\nCNN reported in February 2017 that Manafort was among a handful of senior Trump advisers who were in constant communication with suspected Russian operatives during the campaign. At the time, Manafort told CNN in a statement, that is 100% not true, at least as far as me.\n\nSharing campaign polls\n\nBeyond the fact that Manafort was in regular touch with Kilimnik, the unredacted court filings shed new light on the content of some of their conversations. For the first time, the public learned that Manafort shared polling data about the 2016 campaign with his Russian friend.\n\nIssues and communications related to Ukrainian political events simply were not at the forefront of Mr. Manafort's mind during the period at issue and it is not surprising at all that Mr. Manafort was unable to recall specific details prior to having his recollection refreshed, Manafort's lawyers wrote. The same is true with regard to the Government's allegation that Mr. Manafort lied about sharing polling data with Mr. Kilimnik related to the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThere aren't any additional details – all this tells us is that Mueller believes that Manafort fed polling data to Kilimnik, possibly even polls commissioned by the Trump campaign.\n\nPolling data is a key part of any modern political operation – presidential campaigns and outside groups like super PACs spend millions of dollars on polls. These numbers can drive decisions on messaging, where to campaign and advertising, both on television and in the digital space.\n\nTrump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale ran Trump's data team in 2016. They've publicly touted about how they used data to target voters.\n\nIt's possible Manafort innocuously gave the polls to Kilimnik because he is a political junkie and wanted to dig into the crosstabs. But there's also a possibility that Kilimnik, with his active ties to Russian intelligence, funneled the information to Russian agents to influence the election.\n\nThe primary suspect would be the troll farm in St. Petersburg that essentially acted as a pro-Trump super PAC and pumped out political propaganda to millions of Americans on social media during the 2016 race. These messages can be targeted to specific demographics based on polling data. There aren't any publicly known ties between Kilimnik and the troll farm.\n\nUkraine peace plan\n\nTuesday's filing also unintentionally disclosed that Manafort and Kilimnik discussed a Ukraine peace plan.\n\nAfter being shown documents, Mr. Manafort 'conceded' that he discussed or may have discussed a Ukraine peace plan with Mr. Kilimnik on more than one occasion, the filing said. The document was filed by Manafort's team, but this line appears to quote a past Mueller filing.\n\nThe filing revealed no details about what the Ukraine plan would entail. After Manafort's clients were ousted in 2014, Russian forced annexed Crimea and Kremlin-backed proxies invaded eastern Ukraine. Western nations condemned the moves and have applied economic sanctions against Moscow ever since. The diplomatic and military crisis is ongoing.\n\nThe news that Manafort was in talks with Kilimnik about a Ukraine peace plan is interesting, because it's not the first time the Ukraine conflict became an issue inside Trump's orbit.\n\nDuring the 2016 Republican National Convention, Trump campaign officials intervened to change language in the GOP platform about the Ukraine conflict. Their actions blocked a provision that called on the US to arm the Ukrainian government to fight the Russian proxies.\n\nAt the time, Manafort denied that the Trump campaign was involved. He also said he was not personally involved in any effort to change the platform and learned of it from news reports.\n\nThe Ukraine issue came up again shortly before Trump's inauguration.\n\nAn informal Ukraine peace plan was hatched at a January 2017 meeting between Trump's longtime attorney and fixer Michael Cohen, former Trump business partner Felix Sater and Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Artemenko. The proposal was seen by some as friendly to Moscow.\n\nCohen confirmed to CNN that the meeting took place but denied discussing Ukraine. In comments to other news organizations, Cohen acknowledged the so-called peace plan and said he delivered the proposal to the office of then-national security adviser Michael Flynn. The White House denied that anyone ever received any documents from Cohen about Ukraine.\n\nIt is not clear if this proposal was related in any way to the plan that Manafort discussed with Kilimnik. There aren't any publicly known ties between Artemenko and Kilimnik, though Kilimnik is an insider in Ukrainian political circles and has relationships with many lawmakers there. Artemenko has cooperated with Mueller and testified before the grand jury last summer.\n\nCNN's Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.
Jacopo Prisco , CNN Written by\n\nThis month supermodel and designer Claudia Schiffer is CNN Style's guest editor. She's commissioned a series of features around the theme of icons and iconic imagery.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2014, acclaimed German photographer Thomas Struth made eight trips to Israel and the West Bank. He took about 2,000 snapshots with a digital camera of scenes he found interesting, then around 60 photographs in large format.\n\nOut of those, he selected just 18, his ultimate summary of a five-year project that is now on show for the first time in its entirety at the Aspen Art Museum\n\nPhotography is very much about editing and reducing to the number of works that is really necessary, he said in a phone interview. Struth is best known for his museum photographs -- in which the focus is on the spectators -- his black and white street photography and his distinctive family portraits. In 2011 he took the diamond jubilee photograph of the Queen of England and the Duke of Edinburgh for the National Portrait Gallery.\n\nHis latest shots, he argues, contain some of the sadness of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but are free from a direct political message. I think I come from a position of empathy for both sides, and also a critical tone that is not particularly evident as I'm not a journalist. I don't believe in putting the fingers in the wound too obviously; it makes things too easy for whoever is viewing my work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 8 – Silwan, East Jerusalem (2009) Acclaimed German photographer Thomas Struth offers his personal view of Israel and the Palestinian territories in 18 essential photographs taken over eight trips between 2009 and 2014. This one is from the Silwan neighborhood of East Jerusalem, depicting a Palestinian woman. This picture is about the fact that what's happening there is embedded in every individual, such as this woman, highlighting the relationship between the individual and the community, he said. Credit: © Thomas Struth\n\nNo expectations\n\nStruth went to the region as one of the participants in a larger project titled  This Place , started by photographer Frédéric Brenner, notable for a quarter century of work on the Jewish diaspora. But it took some convincing. Brenner came to my studio on his 50th birthday, which I found unusual. We got along very well and I decided to participate, said Struth.\n\nAfter an initial stay of a few weeks, Struth went back seven more times, spending up to three weeks per trip and exploring, among others, East Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, the Golan Heights, Ramallah, Al-Khalil/Hebron, Nazareth, and Negev.

Credit: © Thomas Struth\n\nStruth had not visited Israel before the project, although his parents had, and his brother had worked in a kibbutz, a type of Israeli communal settlement based on agriculture. I didn't have any expectation other than looking forward to finally getting there after having witnessed the conflict between Israel and Palestine for all my life in the news, but I was fairly open otherwise, he said.\n\nBut I was a bit nervous, because I was wondering what I would be doing, what my choices would be. I had never worked before in a place of conflict.\n\nTwo families\n\nThe exhibition includes two family portraits, one depicting eight Bedouin men in Negev, the other a young family of nine in Rehovot. The presence of these two photographs, literally full of people, is in stark contrast with the rest of the images, where people are barely seen at all. It's an element of divergence that stems from the more general change in approach that Struth has applied to this show.\n\nIn my body of work I usually have one artistic concept that I apply to many different locations, but here I did the opposite, I applied several concepts I've done before on one location. There's family portraits, there's science and technology, there's architectural photographs, some landscape photography. This is something I've never done before, he said.\n\nThe works, which encompass street view, technological research, landscapes, holy sites and private yards, are designed to be scrutinized, according to curator and Aspen Art Museum Director, Heidi Zuckerman. For me, art has always been about an opportunity to pay attention. The precision and clarity of Thomas Struth's photographs encourage close looking. His images of Israel and Palestine offer a different view of places and people that perhaps we thought we knew. Yet they also reveal how much more complex these things truly are, she said in an email interview.\n\nWith the self-reflection that art allows, we can often understand ourselves, and what we value, differently.

Danny Lawson/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nMixing Covid-19 vaccines is not recommended, Public Health England's Head of Immunisations Dr. Mary Ramsay said Saturday, after government guidance was updated this week to say the interchangeability of Covid-19 vaccines was a reasonable option.\n\nWe do not recommend mixing the Covid-19 vaccines – if your first dose is the Pfizer vaccine you should not be given the AstraZeneca vaccine for your second dose and vice versa, Ramsay said in a statement.\n\nThere may be extremely rare occasions where the same vaccine is not available, or where it is not known what vaccine the patient received. Every effort should be made to give them the same vaccine, but where this is not possible it is better to give a second dose of another vaccine than not at all, she added.\n\nRamsay clarified the UK's position on vaccine mixing after an update to the government's vaccine playbook on Dec. 31.\n\nWhat did the updated guidance say? Thursday's guidance said if the same vaccine is not available, or if the first product received is unknown, it is reasonable to offer one dose of the locally available product to complete the schedule.\n\nThis option is preferred if the individual is likely to be at immediate high risk or is considered unlikely to attend again, it added.\n\nWhich vaccines are the UK using? The UK authorized emergency use of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on December 2 and the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine on Dec. 30.\n\nThe guidance recommends both vaccines to be administered in two doses, a minimum of 21 days apart for Pfizer/BioNTech and 28 days apart for AstraZeneca, with longer term protection provided by the second inoculation.\n\nUK guidelines contradict US approach: The updated UK guidance contradicts guidelines in the United States for the two vaccines it has authorized, Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has noted that the authorized Covid-19 vaccines are not interchangeable with each other or with other Covid-19 vaccine products, and that the safety and efficacy of a mixed-product series have not been evaluated. Both doses of the series should be completed with the same product.\n\nThe CDC adds, however, that if two doses of different mRNA COVID-19 vaccine products are inadvertently administered, no additional doses of either product are recommended at this time.

Story highlights Annual survey spots a record number of manatees in Florida's waters This comes amid proposed move to remove manatees from endangered species status\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThere's some good news out of Florida: For the third straight year, spotters counted more than 6,000 manatees navigating Florida's waters.\n\nAn aerial survey ending earlier this month had a preliminary total of 6,620 creatures, compared to 6,250 in 2016 and 6,063 the year before. That's a far cry from the estimated 1,267 manatees seen in 1991.\n\nThe manatees, of course, have to be seen to be counted and their exact numbers are unknown. But this year's 15 observers were helped by warm, sunny weather and good visibility, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conversation Commission said Monday.\n\nThe relatively high counts we have seen for the past three years underscore the importance of warm water habitat to manatees in Florida, said Gil McRae, head of the state's Fish and Wildlife Research Institute. The survey counted 3,488 of the lovable sea cows on the state's east coast and 3,132 along the west coast.\n\nMcRae, in the statement, said successful conservation involves many organizations.\n\nDebate over endangered species status\n\nThe annual count comes as the US Fish and Wildlife Service mulls a final decision on reclassifying the West Indian manatee from endangered to threatened.\n\n01:28 - Source: WSVN Manatees set to lose endangered status\n\nThe agency early last year proposed making the change to a less serious status because of significant improvements in the manatee population and habitat conditions. The West Indian manatee includes the Florida manatee.\n\nThe manatee's recovery is incredibly encouraging and a great testament to the conservation actions of many, Cindy Dohner, the Southeast regional director for US Fish and Wildlife, said at the time. Today's proposal is not only about recognizing this progress, but it's also about recommitting ourselves to ensuring the manatee's long-term success and recovery.\n\nA public comment period ended in April 2016.\n\nThe Pacific Legal Foundation, a libertarian-leaning watchdog and property rights group, has pushed for the federal government to formally adopt the change, saying it should follow the requirements of the Endangered Species Act.\n\nThe foundation has represented residents who formed the organization Save Crystal River. Christina Martin, an attorney for the foundation, said Save Crystal River is concerned the federal government might adopt more and more restrictions that would be harmful to their community.\n\nMartin said the agency should focus on the species most in need of being saved from going extinct.\n\nLast month, the foundation threatened legal action. Martin said she hopes the USFWS will formally adopt the rule change in the next month. I am hopeful they will have something and we don't have to sue.\n\nSome in the state have questioned the effectiveness of boating speed zones meant to protect the species.\n\nThe Save the Manatee Club says at least 98 manatees were killed by watercraft in 2016. The organization also has cited the vulnerability of the animals to cold weather and red tide, a harmful algal bloom.\n\nThe threat is still out there, and it's not going away, Katie Tripp, director of science and conservation for the club, said last year. You don't celebrate when you're not done with the game. There's a lot more work to be done to safeguard the habitat, to get manatees removed from the Endangered Species Act altogether.\n\nThe act defines an endangered species as one currently in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. The designation came with federal restrictions on such things as boat speed and waterfront development that are credited with protecting the species and reversing its decline.\n\nA threatened species is one that is likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future.\n\nThe manatee remains protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\n\nCNN reached out late Monday to the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the Save the Manatee Club for comment.\n\nCNN's Emanuella Grinberg and John Couwels contributed to this report.
(CNN) —\n\nWhether or not Congress makes a deal to avoid a government shutdown before midnight tonight, they've already failed.\n\nThe most basic job of Congress is to approve bills that fund the many activities and operations of the federal government. In an ideal world, Congress would approve a year's worth of government spending so that agencies could do some mid- and long-range planning.\n\nThat hasn't happened in years. Twenty years to be exact, according to the non-partisan Peter G. Peterson Foundation. Instead, Congress has increasingly resorted to continuing resolutions – short-term Band-aids to keep the government funded.\n\nSince the start of Fiscal Year 1998, there have been – wait for it – 112(!) continuing resolutions to keep the government running.\n\nThe result of using a Band-aid to try to stop a gaping wound – i.e., a task for which it was never intended – is that our Congress winds up lurching from crisis to crisis, each one separated by increasingly shorter amounts of time.\n\nConsider the debate earlier this week: A month-long continuing resolution was dismissed as impossible, with several senators floating a two-week – or even five-day – CR. Five days!\n\nThe simple fact is that even if a deal gets cuts tonight to keep the government open, we will almost certainly be right back at the brink of shutdown in five days or two weeks or a month. Passing any sort of continuing resolution won't preserve the DACA program or provide funding for President Donald Trump's much-ballyhooed border wall. It won't change the dynamic at all.\n\nFights delayed are not fights avoided. They are just fights delayed.\n\nThe Point: Governing from crisis to crisis isn't governing. It's punting – and punting and punting. And no one wins when all you do is punt.\n\nRead Friday's full edition of The Point.
(CNN) Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton furthered her comments discrediting Sen. Bernie Sanders as a viable presidential candidate on Thursday, insinuating that his potential failure to deliver the moon would detract from efforts to rebuild public trust.\n\nWhen asked by talk show host Ellen DeGeneres if she wanted to address her prior remarks about the Vermont independent, Clinton noted that while she originally made them about a year and a half ago, I have a pretty clear perspective about what it's going to take to win, and as I said earlier, that's what I think the key calculation for any voter has to be.\n\nYou've got to be responsible for what you say, and what you say you're going to do, Clinton added. We need to rebuild trust in our fellow Americans and in our institutions, and if you promise the moon and you can't deliver the moon, then that's going to be one more indicator of how, you know, we just can't trust each other.\n\nSanders' campaign declined to comment Thursday. When Clinton's previous remarks surfaced last month, Sanders said in a statement that his focus was President Donald Trump: Together, we are going to go forward and defeat the most dangerous president in American history.\n\nClinton's comments Thursday come as Sanders is in a near-tie with former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg in the Iowa caucuses . As of Thursday afternoon, with 97% of precincts reporting, Buttigieg remained the leader of the race, with 26.2% of state delegates, while Sanders closely trailed with 26.1%.\n\nRead More

(CNN) Andrew Lu moved to Georgia in 2017. By 2018, he was canvassing for Stacey Abrams' gubernatorial campaign.\n\nThe 35-year-old, who was working in Oakland, California, before the move, said he was a registered Republican until his early 20s. But even when he had a change of heart politically, he says he usually didn't vote.\n\nThat changed when he came to the East Coast.\n\nSince I'm no longer in California, I can't hide behind, 'Oh, it's a blue state,' Lu, who grew up in Los Angeles, said. Now I have to put my words into action.\n\nLu is among the hundreds of thousands of Georgia transplants who experts say have played a part in helping shift the state's political demographics -- a shift that made the once Red state a political battleground in 2020. Georgia voted for a Democratic president for the first time in nearly 30 years -- but the win was narrow, with President-elect Joe Biden taking the lead with fewer than 13,000 votes.\n\nNow another crucial race -- the US Senate runoffs -- is just days away, since none of the Senate candidates received a majority of the vote in November.\n\nNew residents have absolutely played a role, not only in our shifting demographics, but also in what's possible with our politics, and soon with policy, says Nse Ufot, CEO of the New Georgia Project, a nonpartisan voter registration group.\n\nThis influx of people coming into our state from not only across the country but across the globe, has only sort of underscored Georgia as this (cosmopolitan) melting pot, gathering place, in the Deep South.\n\nGeorgia ranked as the top fifth state to welcome the most newcomers in 2019, according to a US Census Bureau report . More than 50,000 people came from abroad, while thousands relocated from other states, including Florida, Texas, California and New York.\n\nIt's worth pointing out the state's flip during the Presidential elections is largely credited to Black women and their years-long efforts to register voters and get them to the polls -- efforts backed by community leaders like Abrams and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, among others.\n\nNewcomers have been just one part of the equation -- and experts say it's hard to tell just how big of an influence they've had in flipping Georgia.\n\nWhat experts do know however, is that many new residents are more likely to vote blue.\n\nWe know that the strongest Republican voters are people who've been in Georgia more than 20 years, said Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia in Athens. Individuals who have been in Georgia less time are more likely to be Democratic.\n\nWho the newcomers are\n\nWhile it's hard to track down who the newcomers are, Bullock says Georgia's voter registration rolls offer clues.\n\nWe know that a million new voters registered since 2016, Bullock said, adding that the number doesn't necessarily mean all of those new voters were newcomers, but that number likely also includes new residents.\n\nAbout two-thirds of those voters were minorities, he said. Half of them were under 35, Bullock added.\n\nWe know that minority group voters are more Democratic than Republican and that young voters are more likely to be Democratic than Republican, he said. So kind of triangulating on all that we can say, 'Okay, the folks who are moving here are bringing not only their furniture with them, but also their partisanship. And a lot of them are bringing Democratic leanings.\n\nPeople of color, residents ages 18 to 29 and unmarried women made up a significant part of the state's newcomers over the past decade, according to the New Georgia Project.\n\nThe majority of newcomers are Black, Ufot, of the New Georgia Project, said.\n\nMany are Black Americans, moving back in a reversal of the Great Migration -- a period roughly between the 1920s and 1970s, where many Black people left the South, fleeing racial violence and seeking better job opportunities.\n\nIt is why Black folks in Chicago trace their roots to Mississippi, Black folks in New York and New Jersey trace their roots to the Carolinas and to Georgia, Ufot said. Now those people are ... moving back South or their children are, their descendants are.\n\nOthers are African and Caribbean immigrants, who recently became US citizens, she said.\n\nBut to be clear, it is not just Black voters, Ufot said. We're also talking about a significant influx of AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders) and Latinx Georgians.\n\nWith the changes that are taking place, Bullock says the Republican leadership in the state is beginning to awaken to the challenges that they're going to confront.\n\nThat with the younger voters, these more diverse ethnically voters, the warning signs are out there that if Republicans don't come up with broader and more encompassing policies, yeah, they may still control the legislature right now ... but their long-term positions are becoming perilous.\n\nThere's going to be some serious re-thinking in the leadership of the GOP in terms of how do they want to present themselves.\n\nWhy they're coming\n\nIn his Southern politics course, Bullock said he no longer divides the region between the Deep South and the Rim South (the peripheral states) for his students, like he used to.\n\nNow, what I tell my students is that that no longer really captures things in terms of partisanship, he said. What we talk about now in my class is the growth South versus the stagnant South.\n\nGeorgia falls in the former category -- one of several states across the Eastern seaboard, plus Texas -- that are growing and attracting more investment.\n\nThe stagnant parts of the South, where people are either leaving or (have) very slow growth, in those areas -- like Alabama, Arkansas, for example -- the Republican party is still growing, as opposed to the Democratic party beginning to stage a comeback, Bullock said.\n\nMuch of Georgia's influx is concentrated in and around the metro Atlanta area -- the state's liberal hub. A 2019 US Census Bureau report ranked the area as the fourth fastest growing in the nation between 2010 and 2018 -- with more than 660,000 new residents. It's where Biden's lead surged in November as votes were tabulated.\n\nTransplants are coming for all kinds of reasons. Many, like Lu, move because of job opportunities. But it's not just work: the state also offers an attractive housing market and a more affordable lifestyle, dissimilar to other populous areas of the country where the cost of living has skyrocketed.\n\nDiana Gu\n\nDiana Gu, a 29-year-old originally from Florida, has settled into Atlanta's Old Fourth Ward area in Fulton County -- a heavily blue part of the state -- after hopping around different parts of the country for months at a time to conduct botanical and wildlife research.\n\nI wanted to find a full-time job somewhere that was affordable, she said. Somewhere that was more diverse, and somewhere that it felt new, but also homey, I guess. And Atlanta fit all those things.\n\nThe booming populations are making a difference.\n\nIf you look to see where Democrats are beginning to stage a comeback, well, Virginia is a blue state already, Bullock said. Florida has voted Democrat for president ... three of the last seven elections. North Carolina has a Democratic governor.\n\nWhat they care most about\n\nNewcomers' priorities, Ufot said, are often no different than what many long-time residents want as well: safe communities, clear air and water, affordable healthcare, access to quality education and reliable transportation.\n\nI think A, they want the things that everyone else wants for themselves and their families and B, they're no longer ... interested in any sort of platitudes or excuses about the way things are down here.\n\nAnd so it's contributed to a push for accountability from our elected officials.\n\nGu said she began getting more involved in elections after the state's jarring 2018 gubernatorial race -- which was riddled with allegations of voter suppression after Democratic candidate Abrams lost to Gov. Brian Kemp by about 55,000 votes.\n\nIt was kind of a wake-up call, Gu said.\n\nShe estimates that she waited in line about three or four hours to vote back then. She voted again during the Presidential election, and has already cast her ballot for the January senate runoffs.\n\nThe past year's harrowing experiences -- everything from the summer's racial unrest to the devastating Covd-19 pandemic -- are still fresh in her mind and issues she cares deeply about.\n\nThe first thing on my mind would be police brutality, she said. I don't think I'll ever forget what this past year has felt and looked like in terms of going to protests and just what I saw out there.\n\nYoung voters like Gu are energized by similar issues, said Helen Butler, the executive director of the Georgia Coalition for the People's Agenda, a non-profit that works to register and mobilize voters across the state.\n\nButler, who's been involved in voter registration efforts for more than two decades, looks at voters based on age demographics, ethnic demographics and gender. She said that the 18 to 35-year-old group this time around played a tremendous role in terms of turnout.\n\nThese populations now understand how public policy immediately impacts their lives, she said, in everything from criminal justice, to health care, to schooling. And they have been fueled by the raging pandemic and the demonstrations against police killings, she added.\n\nSo I think that really galvanized them to be engaged and really helped change the landscape, she said. Were there new people that were involved? Yes, because I know they're new citizens, especially because we do voter registration and naturalization ceremonies, and you see that they're so enthused about being able to exercise their right to vote for the first time.\n\nFor Lu, the stakes are high.\n\nIn some cases, his concerns are personal: During his time in Atlanta, he said he grew more passionate about issues like LGBTQ rights, immigration and racial discrimination. He saw first-hand how his wife's wholesale business was affected by the President's trade wars . He says he often finds himself enraged reading news about limits placed on certain minorities , who basically share a similar story to how my parents got here.\n\nAnd a former public school student himself, he's also concerned about having a strong schooling system, something he said he wasn't confident about during the Trump administration.\n\nIt's like death by a thousand cuts, he said. It does feel like no matter where you go, there's an important issue, and the stakes are always high.\n\nIt's that sense of urgency, he said, that drives him to the polls.
Editor's note: Jonathan Safran Foer is the author of the critically acclaimed novels Everything is Illuminated and Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close. His latest book, the nonfiction Eating Animals, (Little, Brown and Co.) will be published November 2.\n\nNew York (CNN) -- Like most people, I'd given some thought to what meat actually is, but until I became a father and faced the prospect of having to make food choices on someone else's behalf, there was no urgency to get to the bottom of things.\n\nI'm a novelist and never had it in mind to write nonfiction. Frankly, I doubt I'll ever do it again. But the subject of animal agriculture, at this moment, is something no one should ignore. As a writer, putting words on the page is how I pay attention.\n\nIf the way we raise animals for food isn't the most important problem in the world right now, it's arguably the No. 1 cause of global warming: The United Nations reports the livestock business generates more greenhouse gas emissions than all forms of transportation combined.\n\nIt's the No. 1 cause of animal suffering, a decisive factor in the creation of zoonotic diseases like bird and swine flu, and the list goes on. It is the problem with the most deafening silence surrounding it.\n\nEven the most political people, the most thoughtful and engaged, tend not to go there. And for good reason. Going there can be extremely uncomfortable. Food is not just what we put in our mouths to fill up; it is culture and identity. Reason plays some role in our decisions about food, but it's rarely driving the car.\n\nWe need a better way to talk about eating animals, a way that doesn't ignore or even just shruggingly accept things like habits, cravings, family and history but rather incorporates them into the conversation. The more they are allowed in, the more able we will be to follow our best instincts. And although there are many respectable ways to think about meat, there is not a person on Earth whose best instincts would lead him or her to factory farming.\n\nMy book, Eating Animals, addresses factory farming from numerous perspectives: animal welfare, the environment, the price paid by rural communities, the economic costs. In two essays, I will share some of what I've learned about how the way we raise animals for food affects human health.\n\nWhat we eat and what we are\n\nWhy aren't more people aware of, and angry about, the rates of avoidable food-borne illness? Perhaps it doesn't seem obvious that something is amiss simply because anything that happens all the time -- like meat, especially poultry, becoming infected by pathogens -- tends to fade into the background.\n\nWhatever the case, if you know what to look for, the pathogen problem comes into terrifying focus. For example, the next time a friend has a sudden flu -- what folks sometimes misdescribe as the stomach flu -- ask a few questions. Was your friend's illness one of those 24-hour flus that come and go quickly: retch or crap, then relief? The diagnosis isn't quite so simple, but if the answer to this question is yes, your friend probably didn't have the flu at all.\n\nHe or she was probably suffering from one of the 76 million cases of food-borne illness the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated happen in America each year. Your friend didn't catch a bug so much as eat a bug. And in all likelihood, that bug was created by factory farming.\n\nBeyond the sheer number of illnesses linked to factory farming, we know that factory farms are contributing to the growth of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens simply because these farms consume so many antimicrobials.\n\nWe have to go to a doctor to obtain antibiotics and other antimicrobials as a public-health measure to limit the number of such drugs being taken by humans. We accept this inconvenience because of its medical importance. Microbes eventually adapt to antimicrobials, and we want to make sure it is the truly sick who benefit from the finite number of uses any antimicrobial will have before the microbes learn how to survive it.\n\nOn a typical factory farm, drugs are fed to animals with every meal. In poultry factory farms, they almost have to be. It's a perfect storm: The animals have been bred to such extremes that sickness is inevitable, and the living conditions promote illness.\n\nIndustry saw this problem from the beginning, but rather than accept less-productive animals, it compensated for the animals' compromised immunity with drugs. As a result, farmed animals are fed antibiotics nontherapeutically: that is, before they get sick.\n\nIn the United States, about 3 million pounds of antibiotics are given to humans each year, but a whopping 17.8 million pounds are fed to livestock -- at least, that is what the industry claims.\n\nThe Union of Concerned Scientists estimated that the industry underreported its antibiotic use by at least 40 percent.\n\nThe group calculated that 24.6 million pounds of antibiotics were fed to chickens, pigs and other farmed animals, counting only nontherapeutic uses. And that was in 2001. In other words, for every dose of antibiotics taken by a sick human, eight doses are given to a healthy animal.\n\nThe implications for creating drug-resistant pathogens are quite straightforward. Study after study has shown that antimicrobial resistance follows quickly on the heels of the introduction of new drugs on factory farms.\n\nFor example, in 1995, when the Food and Drug Administration approved fluoroquinolones -- such as Cipro -- for use in chickens against the protest of the Centers for Disease Control, the percentage of bacteria resistant to this powerful new class of antibiotics rose from almost zero to 18 percent by 2002.\n\nA broader study in the New England Journal of Medicine showed an eightfold increase in antimicrobial resistance from 1992 to 1997 and linked this increase to the use of antimicrobials in farmed chickens. As far back as the late 1960s, scientists have warned against the nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in farmed-animal feed.\n\nToday, institutions as diverse as the American Medical Association; the Centers for Disease Control; the Institute of Medicine, a division of the National Academy of Sciences; and the World Health Organization have linked nontherapeutic antibiotic use on factory farms with increased antimicrobial resistance and called for a ban.\n\nStill, the factory farm industry has effectively opposed such a ban in the United States. And, unsurprisingly, the limited bans in other countries are only a limited solution.\n\nThere is a glaring reason that the necessary total ban on nontherapeutic use of antibiotics hasn't happened: The factory farm industry, allied with the pharmaceutical industry, has more power than public-health professionals.\n\nWhat is the source of the industry's immense power? We give it to them. We have chosen, unwittingly, to fund this industry on a massive scale by eating factory-farmed animal products. And we do so daily.\n\nThe same conditions that lead at least 76 million Americans to become ill from their food annually and that promote antimicrobial resistance also contribute to the risk of a pandemic.\n\nAt a remarkable 2004 conference, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World Health Organization and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) put their tremendous resources together to evaluate the available information on emerging zoonotic diseases or those spread by humans-to- animals and animals-to-humans.\n\nAt the time of the conference, H5N1 and SARS topped the list of feared emerging zoonotic diseases. Today, the H1N1 swine flu would be the pathogen enemy No. 1.\n\nThe scientists distinguished between primary risk factors for zoonotic diseases and mere amplification risk factors, which affect only the rate at which a disease spreads. Their examples of primary risk factors were change to an agricultural production system or consumption patterns. What particular agricultural and consumer changes did they have in mind?\n\nFirst in a list of four main risk factors was increasing demand for animal protein, which is a way of saying that demand for meat, eggs, and dairy is a primary factor influencing emerging zoonotic diseases. This demand for animal products, the report continues, leads to changes in farming practices. Lest we have any confusion about the changes that are relevant, poultry factory farms are singled out.\n\nSimilar conclusions were reached by the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology, which brought together industry experts and experts from the WHO, OIE and USDA. Their 2005 report argued that a major impact of factory farming is the rapid selection and amplification of pathogens that arise from a virulent ancestor (frequently by subtle mutation), thus there is increasing risk for disease entrance and/or dissemination.\n\nBreeding genetically uniform and sickness-prone birds in the overcrowded, stressful, feces-infested and artificially lit conditions of factory farms promotes the growth and mutation of pathogens. The cost of increased efficiency, the report concludes, is increased global risk for diseases. Our choice is simple: cheap chicken or our health.\n\nToday, the factory farm-pandemic link couldn't be more lucid. The primary ancestor of the recent H1N1 swine flu outbreak originated at a hog factory farm in America's most hog-factory-rich state, North Carolina, and then quickly spread throughout the Americas.\n\nIt was in these factory farms that scientists saw, for the first time, viruses that combined genetic material from bird, pig and human viruses. Scientists at Columbia and Princeton Universities have actually been able to trace six of the eight genetic segments of the most feared virus in the world directly to U.S. factory farms.\n\nPerhaps in the back of our minds we already understand, without all the science, that something terribly wrong is happening. We know that it cannot possibly be healthy to raise such grotesque animals in such grossly unnatural conditions. We know that if someone offers to show us a film on how our meat is produced, it will be a horror film.\n\nWe perhaps know more than we care to admit, keeping it down in the dark places of our memory -- disavowed. When we eat factory-farmed meat, we live on tortured flesh. Increasingly, those sick animals are making us sick.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jonathan Safran Foer.
Manhattan's got phones in different area codes -- and one more is on the way.\n\nThe borough is getting a new area code in the coming weeks. Now, 332 is joining 212, 917, and 646.\n\nIn a text to customers, Verizon (VZ) said the new area code will be available on June 10. The company confirmed the June availability to CNNTech.\n\nThe New York Public Service Commission announced the change in 2015 due to a growing number of residents and businesses that needed New York numbers. The North American Numbering Plan Administrator (NANPA), the body in charge of area codes, predicted Manhattan would run out of available central office codes by the end of this year.\n\nAt the time, local publications panned it as lame and said New Yorkers fear getting stuck with it. For many, an area code is an identity. If you keep it for a while, it says a lot about where you came from. It's like your mobile DNA.\n\nThe 212 area code is something of a status symbol. It was one of the original 86 codes created in 1947, and the first in New York City. As residents told New York Times in 2015, the only acceptable area code for a Manhattanite is 212.\n\nRelated: Verizon loses wireless customers for first time\n\nArea codes are used to identify phone numbers both by geographic location and specific services, like toll-free numbers. And the numbers vary; California has more than 30, while Vermont has only one.\n\nThe North American Numbering Plan serves 20 North American countries, including the U.S., and oversees the different three-number codes. Each country has its own communications regulator that implements changes to the phone system; in the U.S., it's the FCC. The North American Numbering Plan was created by AT&T in 1947 to make long-distance calling easier. As more people need phone numbers and mobile devices proliferate, area codes increase to meet the demand.\n\nDemand for phone numbers has grown in large part thanks to wireless phones, according to John Manning, senior director of NANPA. If someone has an Arizona area code and keeps that number when she moves to California, that means Arizona can't give that number to a new resident. Also, a couple decades ago, a household would have only one landline. Now, a household might have a cell phone for each person who lives there.\n\nIt's generational, Manning says -- before mobile phones, faxes were at fault.\n\nIt's not just New York City that clings to area codes as an identity. Manning said that in 2013, when the 628 area code was introduced in the Bay Area, people in San Francisco did not want to use it for the city. One of the alternatives was splitting up the cities, so all of San Francisco could keep 415, but people in the city would need new numbers. Eventually, 628 was added as an overlay on top of the existing area code, and it now covers multiple Bay Area cities, including San Francisco.\n\nWith each new area code, a potential 8 million numbers are added to the pool of available numbers. As of December 2016, there were 313 area codes in the U.S. and its territories.\n\nOther locations are introducing new numbers, too. For instance, southern New Jersey is adding code 640 next year.\n\nIt's created a business opportunity for at least one enterprising man. For more than eight years, David Day has sold numbers with 212 area codes through 212areacode.com. They are coveted both for the geographic location, and the limited availability, he said. Both businesses and consumers want that three-number prefix.\n\nWhy? Because it's in Manhattan, and also because phone companies don't have them anymore, Day told CNNTech. It adds an element of exclusivity to the area code.\n\nIt's not the first time three new numbers have caused consternation. In 1998, just before the 646 area code was available for Manhattan, an episode of Seinfeld explored the area code as a status symbol. Elaine got mad when the phone company gave her a 646 number.
Retirement investing is mostly contextual. So much depends on your risk tolerance, how much time you have before you retire, and how much you can save.\n\nHowever, there are a few best practices that are nearly universal. So keep these in mind, whether you're a few years from retirement or still have decades to go.\n\nReduce taxes where possible\n\nUncle Sam wants you saving for retirement, so the U.S. tax code has all kinds of incentives to sock away money for your golden years.\n\nYour workplace retirement plan (whether 401(k), 403(b), TSP, etc.) comes with specific tax benefits. If it's a traditional 401(k) (or equivalent plan), you get to reduce your taxable income by a dollar for every dollar you put in. So if you save $18,500 (the limit for 2018 if you're under 50 years old; it's $24,500 if you're age 50 or older) in a 401(k), your taxable income will be reduced by $18,500 that year. That means you'd get to pocket a rather nice tax savings that year and not have to pay taxes on any of that money until you withdraw it in retirement.\n\nMany workplace retirement plans also come in the Roth flavor -- which means you don't get to save on taxes this year, but that money won't be taxed at all in retirement. IRAs (which you can open on your own, and fund with up to $5,500 per year -- or $6,500 if you're age 55 or older) also come in both flavors. There are arguments for both, so learn more about Roth vs. Traditional accounts if you're unsure where you stand.\n\nTake the free money\n\nIt's not just Uncle Sam who's trying to help you retire. Chances are good that, if your employer offers you access to a retirement plan like a 401(k), they also offer you some incentives to participate. Usually these incentives take the form of matching funds, whereby if you put a certain amount aside in your retirement plan, your employer will contribute some cash on top to help boost your account balance. For example, employers often offer a 50% match on contributions of up to 6% of an employee's salary. In that case, if you're setting aside 6% of your salary in your 401(k), your employer will contribute an additional amount equal to 3% of your salary.\n\nIn that example, you wouldn't get anything extra from your employer for anything you contribute above 6%, but you'd still get the tax benefits. Anyway, bottom line: At the very least, if at all possible, make sure you max out your employer match. Think about it this way: If you make $50,000 a year and contribute 6% for a 50% employer match, you're putting in $3,000 annually -- and your employer pays you an extra $1,500 in your 401(k) as a thank-you for doing that. That's a nice chunk of change.\n\nA study published in 2015 estimated that American workers were leaving $24 billion in matching funds on the table each year (an average of $1,336 per worker who failed to take full advantage) by not maxing out their employer match. That's free money. Claim it.\n\nAggressively cut fees\n\nFees are one of the two great killers of investing returns -- second only to making bad investments. It can be difficult to predict how great or terrible an investment will be, but fortunately, fees are a lot easier to identify. And the savings are potentially huge. In fact, a 1-percentage-point reduction in fees could net you an extra $43,000 or more. How?\n\nLet's say you invested $3,000 per year for 30 years into a fund that tracks the S&P 500, returns 6% annually (a little less than historical stock market returns), and has a 1.14% expense ratio. At the end of 30 years, you'll have a little over $201,000. That's a nice chunk of change.\n\nNow let's say you put the same amounts into the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VFINX) over the same time period at the same hypothetical annual return. The Vanguard fund, however, has a 0.14% expense ratio -- that's 1 percentage point lower than the other fund's, all for the same exact investments. You'd end 30 years with a little over $244,000 -- an extra $43,000 -- by tracking the same underlying investment.\n\nRelated links:\n\n• Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy Alert\n\n• This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997\n\n• 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market\n\nYou can spend hours -- even days -- stressing about all the little nitpicky elements of saving for retirement. But this handful of best practices can get you pretty far for very little effort or stress. And so long as you're investing that saved money in good funds -- consider some of the best index funds for 2018, for example -- then you'll be well on your way to a great retirement.
Sam Greenwood/Getty Images\n\nJaguars vs. Vikings sounds like an early-October London game with a 9:30 a.m. ET kickoff (6:30 a.m. on the West Coast!) that you didn't even know was on the schedule until noon, when you realize you forgot to add Kyle Rudolph to your fantasy lineup.\n\nBlake Bortles vs. Case Keenum sounds like a Thursday Night Football quarterback showdown scheduled against baseball's ALCS, a snoozer that ends in a 22-13 final score thanks to seven field goals. Who won? Who cares!\n\nWhen you walk into a bar with the satellite package and 100 televisions on Sunday afternoon, Jaguars-Vikings should be the game that's on in the back corner of the dining area, watched only by a dude in a faded Maurice Jones-Drew jersey whose girlfriend never looks up from her smartphone.\n\nBut it could also be the matchup in Super Bowl XLII in two weeks.\n\nHow, oh how, did we fall so far from grace?\n\nNow, before anyone panics, a couple of fellows named Tom Brady and Bill Belichick still stand between us and the End of Days, not to mention the pesky Philadelphia Eagles and their fanbase, which has somehow managed to grow even more unhinged over the last five days.\n\nVideo Play Button Videos you might like\n\nFootball Outsiders projects just a 14.6 percent chance of a Vikings-Jaguars Super Bowl, a figure that jibes with the Vegas moneylines (Vikings a slight favorite, Jaguars a heavy-but-not-prohibitive underdog) but, on a subconscious level, feels too high. Our brains shriek at us that the likelihood of a Vikings-Jaguars Super Bowl should be roughly 0.0000000000003 percent, roughly the same as being struck by lightning twice after cashing our fifth straight winning Powerball ticket.\n\nThat's because our primitive brains evolved to predict migration patterns on the African plains millennia ago, making them short-circuit when coping with the pace of modern life. Just as social media and the 24-7 news cycle cause severe anxiety, the possibility of a Jaguars-Vikings Super Bowl causes dislocation and dissonance: Human minds just aren't evolutionarily equipped for both of these teams to be good at the same time.\n\nThe NFL itself might not be equipped for a showdown between the 15th-ranked (Minneapolis-St. Paul) and 42nd-ranked (Jacksonville) television markets in the nation, as determined by Nielsen. The Vikings and Jaguars home markets combined (2,431,320 TV homes) are smaller than the Eagles home market (2,869,580). Unlike smaller-market teams like the Steelers or Packers, the Vikings and Jaguars have tiny national fan footprints.\n\nYou may have heard somewhere that NFL ratings are down: Last weekend's divisional round playoff games, for example, drew the smallest television audience since 2009, despite three dramatic games and a traditional Patriots beating. Some will insist the cause is political—some want very, very badly for it to be political—but besides an overall change in national viewing habits, the NFL's biggest problem this season has been disappointing years by popular teams and injuries to Aaron Rodgers-level must-watch superstars.\n\nBill Kostroun/Associated Press/Associated Press\n\nSo here's what we have left to work with, from a sizzle standpoint:\n\nThe Patriots, the most polarizing team in American professional sports. That makes them great for box office, though they have been in the spotlight for so long that we've resorted to investigative docudramas that make Tom Brady sound like Lego Batman just to keep the narrative fresh.\n\nThe Eagles, who lost fresh-faced superstar Carson Wentz weeks ago, but bring a huge media market and a legendarily rabid fanbase to the table. The Eagles are also the NFL's most overtly political team, which might hurt ratings among the demographic that falls asleep watching MeTV but could also give the Super Bowl both broader attention and a countercultural cache. With Eagles fans currently purchasing the entire global supply of dog masks, they could turn the Super Bowl into Woodstock for furries.\n\nThe Vikings, an excellent football team populated by guys you can't imagine starring in an auto insurance commercial.\n\nThe Jaguars. The Jaguars.\n\nThe hardcore pigskin junkies in the audience are probably shouting objections by now. What about Defensive Player of the Year candidates Harrison Smith and Calais Campbell? What about potential matchups between Adam Thielen and Jalen Ramsey as well as Stefon Diggs and A.J. Bouye? Finally, a Super Bowl about tactics, defensive fronts, blocking schemes and zzzzzzzz...\n\nThe Super Bowl isn't for the fanatics who study internet GIFs of off-tackle runs on Wednesday mornings. It's for casual fans to host parties and cheer for touchdowns, local rock jocks to dare listeners to eat live crickets in exchange for tickets and the corner supermarket to offer buy-one-get-one-free jars of salsa. An entire cottage industry has grown around the Super Bowl as a holiday. Vikings-Jaguars would make this the NFL's year without a Santa Claus.\n\nAttempts to find a narrative angle for Jaguars-Vikings would result in endless retellings of Thielen's come-from-nowhere tale, straight-faced attempts at a Bortles redemption arc and ill-fitting efforts to cast Keenum as the next Kurt Warner, milking the Vikings' home-field advantage for all it's worth (plenty from a football standpoint, little from a storytelling standpoint), and an effort to recast the Sacksonville defense as the new Legion of Boom or 1985 Bears that leaves you feeling the same way about Sacksonville as you do about Dilly Dilly! When all else fails, we'll just replay the Diggs touchdown over and over until kickoff.\n\nA Vikings-Jaguars Super Bowl sounds like karmic punishment upon the NFL for its many sins, from farcical officiating, blithe franchise relocations and the endless recycling of boring coaches to turning Deflategate into an impeachment trial and playing both sides toward the middle when it comes to player protests.\n\nThe NFL doesn't deserve a transcendent Brady versus the charismatically woke Eagles after treating both Brady and player protests with grudging ambivalence. After sliding the Rams and Chargers around the map like Risk pieces and dangling the Jaguars in front of London fans for years, the league deserves two weeks of trying to build interest around Yannick Ngakoue.\n\nJamie Squire/Getty Images\n\nAnd yes, this may be our culture's punishment for allowing Bon Jovi to reach the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, letting the Star Wars franchise lapse into a deconstructionist self-critique, blending politics with reality television and kvetching for years about how boring Thursday Night Football games are.\n\nBut a Jaguars-Vikings Super Bowl may also be the reboot the Super Bowl needs.\n\nThe Jaguars would stand testament to the fact that a team could go 3-13 for years, do everything just right and compete immediately for a championship. The Vikings would offer proof that a third-choice quarterback can reach the Super Bowl on a well-run team. Every last-place finisher and quarterback-starved franchise would have renewed hope. With defense and perseverance, anything is indeed possible.\n\nThat hope won't dazzle the casual audience this year. But the NFL's current model—building everything around quarterbacks who either get injured or get labeled as disappointments after their second interceptions—isn't doing much for brand loyalty, either.\n\nMaybe the NFL needs to market its product as it really is rather than reclaim a level of cultural dominance that no longer exists. Maybe, as fans, we will be happier if we learn to love the Jaguars-Vikings games we always get instead of the Brady-Manning matchups we used to wait for. Those Thursday night and Sunday morning games can feel like potential Super Bowl previews again.\n\nOr perhaps the Patriots whup the Jaguars as expected Sunday, and we spend the Super Bowl dancing around Brady like he's the maypole for the eighth time while Belichick snaps at us for daring to show enthusiasm for the grim business of manufacturing football championships.\n\nCome to think of it, some new faces in the Super Bowl might be refreshing.\n\nMike Tanier covers the NFL for Bleacher Report.

Through all of the highs and lows (and really low) of 2020, we were grateful to be able to weather it with you. Now that we've finally turned the page on a, ahem, newsworthy year, it's time to look forward to everything that 2021 may bring. Here's a rundown of the most anticipated events, milestones and trends for this brand new trip around the sun\n\nThe 5 Things team also wanted to share our own lists of things we're looking forward to. Chief among them: Spending time with you each morning to get you Up to Speed and On With Your day.\n\nAJ Willingham, writer\n\nI'm looking forward to ... looking forward to stuff. Does that make sense? 2020 taught us that even the best laid plans can go awry, so I'm eager for the day when people feel safe and secure enough to look hopefully to the future, agenda books wide open. Once that happens, then baseball. And concerts. And singing with other people again. I also can't wait to continue testing your patience with my early morning attempts at humor. You are all amazing.\n\nHarmeet Kaur, writer\n\nI haven't spent too much time yet ruminating on the new year. It still feels like the pandemic is very much in full swing, and at least for the first few months of 2021, things will probably look a lot like they did in 2020. But finally, there seems to be a light at the end of the tunnel. I'm looking forward to the vaccine (obviously) because it can make real again so much of what I missed about this last year: Seeing more of my friends and family, going to concerts, sitting in movie theaters, congregating in restaurants, and traveling to new places. Here's hoping 2021 can bring back the things that make life worth living.\n\nFaith Karimi, writer\n\nAfter living like a hermit in 2020, I'm really looking forward to doing a lot of the simple things we couldn't do due to the pandemic. Like eating guacamole in loud restaurants without fear of coronavirus and taking my son to Kenya to visit his grandparents. I'm hoping to carve more time for things I'm passionate about like biking and writing. The past year has taught us life can quickly change, so I'm taking more leaps of faith this year without overthinking things.\n\nMichelle Krupa, editor\n\nI try not to get ahead of myself, and I suspect 2021 will roll in much the way 2020 flamed out. So, I'm looking forward to lots more runs, walks and bike rides in our neighborhood, take-out dates with my husband, cooking projects with our 9-year-old and helping our kindergartner learn to read. I'm eager for a coronavirus vaccine, and I hope getting a shot in this new year will mean lots of hugging (outside our bubble), traveling, enjoying live performance and returning to the CNN newsroom.\n\nSaeed Ahmed, editor\n\nI'm looking forward to going home. I haven't seen my parents in more than a year, and they're going stir crazy locked down in their apartment in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I'm also hoping that this is the year I finally -- FINALLY -- get to run the Chicago Marathon, my white whale. I signed up in 2018 but had to defer due to injury. In 2019, a death in the family meant I wasn't in the right headspace. And the 2020 race was (rightly) canceled because ... Covid. On the work front, we are cooking up some really cool ideas and I'm excited to get you -- our 5 Things family -- involved.\n\nAnd finally ...\n\nAll together now!\n\nA few months ago, a group of CNN friends (and their friends) got together virtually to record this lovely, socially-distanced Bob Marley cover. We hope it starts your new year off right!

Hill: I just do what I think is right\n\nDemocratic Congressional candidate Katie Hill speaks to supporters at her election night party in California's 25th Congressional district on November 6, 2018 in Santa Clarita, California.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nWhen Katie Hill opened the heavy wooden door to her new congressional office in the Longworth House Office Building, one feeling smacked her in the gut.\n\nWell, this doesn't feel like me, recalled the freshman congresswoman from California's 25th District.\n\nSo yeah, this very formal place being my home base does feel strange, she added. I don't want to become more formal. That's not on the table.\n\nHill argues her life doesn't allow her to embrace any of the formal trappings of Washington. Raised in suburban Los Angeles, she prefers sneakers to heels. She's a Democrat and the daughter of a Republican police officer and survived a sexual assault. Socially conscious, she married a man but identifies as bisexual.\n\nThe thrust of her career has been in non-profits, as an advocate for the homeless. She also embraces the sexist criticism, known as resting bitch face, about a serious woman (like her) not smiling while thinking.\n\nThis isn't the sort of resume or life story that typically precedes a seat in Congress, but that's just fine with Hill and the voters who elected her. An unconventional woman, the 31-year-old joins the 116th Congress, the most diverse legislature in history by many measures — gender, race and sexual orientation.\n\nRefusing to change is part of the internal feedback loop in Hill's first days in Washington.\n\nSometimes in the middle of an unreal day, you just really need to hug your mom.\n\n\n\nWe're about to be sworn in. Let's do this. pic.twitter.com/8zmyMbgvb9 — Rep. Katie Hill (@RepKatieHill) January 3, 2019\n\nA grassroots candidate\n\nHill won with an insurgent campaign spurred by the 2016 election. She channeled her anger at the victory of President Donald Trump by taking aim at her congressman, Rep. Steve Knight, who voted with fellow House Republicans in May 2017 to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Who is going to run against him? Hill typed out on her social media accounts. A friend said, Why not you?\n\nWhy not, thought Hill.\n\nA year and a half later, Hill flipped the suburban Los Angeles district for Democrats. The first-time candidate had started her grassroots campaign out of a rented apartment backed by a hoodie-wearing millennial staff, chain-sipping La Croix sparkling water. The team raised more than $8 million without taking a cent in corporate or special interest money.\n\nHill won over voters as a progressive advocate for affordable housing while offering a pragmatic willingness to work across party lines for her purple district. Trying to fit into Washington is not why Hill was elected nor does it sit anywhere on her agenda.\n\nPlaying nice isn't really something that's in my vocabulary, she said. I just do what I think is right.\n\nDemanding to be heard\n\nThat philosophy may sound quaint, even naive, for Washington, but Hill believes that's the shared sentiment among the incoming freshmen congressional class.\n\nA record-setting 127 women were elected to the 116th Congress, the majority of whom are Democrats. More African Americans, Latinos and LGBTQ members now serve in Congress. The legislature also saw its median age drop by approximately a decade with its newly elected members.\n\nPHOTO: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images Katie Hill laughs as Nancy Pelosi's granddaughter reacts to votes for Pelosi to become Speaker of the House.\n\nHill is notable for her youth as well as being California's first openly bisexual woman elected to Congress. But it's the sheer size of the freshman class, at 92 new members with 46 flipped seats in the 2018 midterm election, that's politically powerful to her.\n\nTraditionally, new legislators have been expected to wait their turn while more seasoned members drove the agenda. But this time, and in this age, the newbies are demanding their voices be heard.\n\nI think we have enough power and enough strength in numbers and enough of a strong mandate from voters that we're going to be able to continue to stay true to the things that we ran on, said Hill, who was elected to the Democratic House leadership team as one of two new members representing freshmen.\n\nPHOTO: Win McNamee/Getty Images Katie Hill, right, poses with other members of the newly elected Democratic House Leadership team in November.\n\nThe result, she hopes, will be in them governing differently.\n\nA new agenda and attitude\n\nTop of Hill's agenda is focusing on a more equitable system, from health care to taxes to housing. Hill believes the biggest problem with Washington has been the billionaire class being controlled by special interest donors and ignoring the needs of the politically powerless.\n\nWe are regular, middle class people, said Hill, the now third-youngest member of Congress (behind Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Iowa's Abby Finkenauer.)\n\nWe're young. We look like and speak like the people that we're there to represent. We're not people who came up through the political process. The majority of us are first-time candidates. We're not stuck in the old way of doing things, she said.\n\nThis Freshman class is larger, younger, and more diverse than ever before and that's not a coincidence – it's a call to action.\n\n\n\nYesterday @JoeNeguse and I were elected to be the Co-Representatives to Leadership for this historic class and we are so ready to get to work. pic.twitter.com/GZv3FUElNe — Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) November 29, 2018\n\nHill spoke to CNN as she made the flight to Washington from Burbank, California, inviting us to chronicle her journey from candidate to congresswoman-elect to swearing in.\n\nA millennial, Hill embraces the sharing philosophy of her generation via social media and speaks easily with reporters as cameras roll. She's shared on Twitter and Facebook her personal stories about surviving sexual assault and an unplanned pregnancy that ended in a miscarriage. In her unconventional political ads, she went rock climbing.\n\nAs Hill checked in for the 6:45 a.m. flight, she remarked, I've never lived outside of California or traveled with so many bags. For the record, there were three suitcases.\n\nShe wore athletic clothing for the flight, noticing then, under the bright fluorescent lights of the ticket counter, that her black pants were covered in her dog's white hair. Oh well, she said, as she walked towards airport security. Her goal, she said, is to demystify Congress by bringing her voters with her on this journey and through her entire term, dog hair and all.\n\nI think what I, and many of the other freshmen have, what's kind of unique, is this sort of ability to relate to people in a different way.\n\nI left my house in SoCal and it was 37 degrees, landed in DC and it's more than 50 degrees here! What a warm welcome! ☀️\n\n\n\nCan't believe inauguration is this week — I'm so ready to get to work. 💪🏼 pic.twitter.com/UV28nRQPFO — Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) December 29, 2018\n\nIt's why on Hill's Twitter feed she's posted frequent updates on her first impressions of Washington during new member orientation, known as Congress Camp. She talked about what committees she hoped to join to best represent her district, a sprawling community with suburban middle-class families and lower-income desert communities, and doesn't plan on slowing down the tweets.\n\n'There's going to be fights'\n\nHill signed the lease at her new home – a small, no frills, two-bedroom apartment that gives off a corporate, temporary housing sensibility. It's there she caught up with her roommate and fellow freshman, Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois. Nearly the same age, the congresswomen initially give off a bubbly vibe of moving into a college dorm.\n\nYou can only have tough dinner table conversations if you first get the dinner table! 😂\n\n\n\n@LUnderwood630 is the best Ikea partner I could imagine — the true test of roommate compatibility! (And maybe our negotiation skills too...) pic.twitter.com/knACssVjXF — Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) December 30, 2018\n\nBut as Underwood talked, it became apparent that both carried the weight of their new elected jobs.\n\nI think it's going to be hard, said Underwood, who also flipped her district, defeating a Republican male incumbent. She is now the youngest black woman to ever serve in Congress. We don't walk in and everything automatically changes.\n\nI would imagine there will be confrontations, said Hill. There's going to be fights between the old guard and the new one. But I feel very optimistic that the existing leadership all want us to be part of this process. They recognize the change that's happening, and they're trying to include us.\n\nPHOTO: Kyung Lah/CNN The nameplate for Rep. Katie Hill outside her office on Capitol Hill.\n\nOn inauguration morning, a crush of cameras greeted Hill, swarming around her as she tried to enter the Capitol to be sworn in.\n\nIt feels good. It feels like we can finally get to work, she said.\n\nShe stepped into the US Capitol through the south door entrance and disappeared into the tunnel. Her cross-country journey had ended but her new role as Congresswoman Katie Hill had just begun.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nLawyers working for former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort accidentally revealed on Tuesday the clearest public evidence of coordination between the campaign and Russians, adding new details to the murky mosaic of potential collusion in 2016 – including sharing polling data with an alleged Russian operative.\n\nThe explosive new information was buried in a court filing from Manafort's lawyers, though the portions about his contacts with a shadowy Russian during the campaign were meant to be redacted.\n\nBut the document was fully searchable, even the blacked-out parts, revealing fresh details about the core of the ongoing investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the latest disclosures and how they might fit into the existing puzzle.\n\nRelationship with Kilimnik\n\nClose watchers of the investigation have been intrigued by the still-developing role of Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian political consultant who worked closely with Manafort in Ukraine. They helped Moscow-friendly politicians get elected and hold onto power for nearly a decade.\n\nManafort and Kilimnik stayed in touch after their Ukrainian clients were ousted in 2014. They met twice in the United States during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to their own public statements. News reports have detailed their phone calls and emails in 2016, including one exchange where Manafort tried to use Kilimnik to reach a prominent Russian oligarch.\n\nBut Tuesday's filing revealed they had a third meeting, this time in the Spanish capital of Madrid. One redacted portion quoted Mueller's team: After being told that Mr. Kilimnik had traveled to Madrid on the same day that Mr. Manafort was in Madrid, Mr. Manafort 'acknowledged' that he and Mr. Kilimnik met while they were both in Madrid. A spokesman for Manafort sought to clarify the filing in a statement Tuesday night, saying that the third meeting happened in early 2017, after the election.\n\nThe growing list of Manafort-Kilimnik contacts could be relevant to the collusion question because, according to previous court filings from Mueller, the FBI has assessed that Kilimnik has ties to a Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016.\n\nMany of their contacts happened while the Russian government was aggressively meddling in the US election. Court filings said Kilimnik was affiliated with the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency that was responsible for hacking Democratic targets and orchestrating the WikiLeaks releases.\n\nCNN reported in February 2017 that Manafort was among a handful of senior Trump advisers who were in constant communication with suspected Russian operatives during the campaign. At the time, Manafort told CNN in a statement, that is 100% not true, at least as far as me.\n\nSharing campaign polls\n\nBeyond the fact that Manafort was in regular touch with Kilimnik, the unredacted court filings shed new light on the content of some of their conversations. For the first time, the public learned that Manafort shared polling data about the 2016 campaign with his Russian friend.\n\nIssues and communications related to Ukrainian political events simply were not at the forefront of Mr. Manafort's mind during the period at issue and it is not surprising at all that Mr. Manafort was unable to recall specific details prior to having his recollection refreshed, Manafort's lawyers wrote. The same is true with regard to the Government's allegation that Mr. Manafort lied about sharing polling data with Mr. Kilimnik related to the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThere aren't any additional details – all this tells us is that Mueller believes that Manafort fed polling data to Kilimnik, possibly even polls commissioned by the Trump campaign.\n\nPolling data is a key part of any modern political operation – presidential campaigns and outside groups like super PACs spend millions of dollars on polls. These numbers can drive decisions on messaging, where to campaign and advertising, both on television and in the digital space.\n\nTrump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale ran Trump's data team in 2016. They've publicly touted about how they used data to target voters.\n\nIt's possible Manafort innocuously gave the polls to Kilimnik because he is a political junkie and wanted to dig into the crosstabs. But there's also a possibility that Kilimnik, with his active ties to Russian intelligence, funneled the information to Russian agents to influence the election.\n\nThe primary suspect would be the troll farm in St. Petersburg that essentially acted as a pro-Trump super PAC and pumped out political propaganda to millions of Americans on social media during the 2016 race. These messages can be targeted to specific demographics based on polling data. There aren't any publicly known ties between Kilimnik and the troll farm.\n\nUkraine peace plan\n\nTuesday's filing also unintentionally disclosed that Manafort and Kilimnik discussed a Ukraine peace plan.\n\nAfter being shown documents, Mr. Manafort 'conceded' that he discussed or may have discussed a Ukraine peace plan with Mr. Kilimnik on more than one occasion, the filing said. The document was filed by Manafort's team, but this line appears to quote a past Mueller filing.\n\nThe filing revealed no details about what the Ukraine plan would entail. After Manafort's clients were ousted in 2014, Russian forced annexed Crimea and Kremlin-backed proxies invaded eastern Ukraine. Western nations condemned the moves and have applied economic sanctions against Moscow ever since. The diplomatic and military crisis is ongoing.\n\nThe news that Manafort was in talks with Kilimnik about a Ukraine peace plan is interesting, because it's not the first time the Ukraine conflict became an issue inside Trump's orbit.\n\nDuring the 2016 Republican National Convention, Trump campaign officials intervened to change language in the GOP platform about the Ukraine conflict. Their actions blocked a provision that called on the US to arm the Ukrainian government to fight the Russian proxies.\n\nAt the time, Manafort denied that the Trump campaign was involved. He also said he was not personally involved in any effort to change the platform and learned of it from news reports.\n\nThe Ukraine issue came up again shortly before Trump's inauguration.\n\nAn informal Ukraine peace plan was hatched at a January 2017 meeting between Trump's longtime attorney and fixer Michael Cohen, former Trump business partner Felix Sater and Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Artemenko. The proposal was seen by some as friendly to Moscow.\n\nCohen confirmed to CNN that the meeting took place but denied discussing Ukraine. In comments to other news organizations, Cohen acknowledged the so-called peace plan and said he delivered the proposal to the office of then-national security adviser Michael Flynn. The White House denied that anyone ever received any documents from Cohen about Ukraine.\n\nIt is not clear if this proposal was related in any way to the plan that Manafort discussed with Kilimnik. There aren't any publicly known ties between Artemenko and Kilimnik, though Kilimnik is an insider in Ukrainian political circles and has relationships with many lawmakers there. Artemenko has cooperated with Mueller and testified before the grand jury last summer.\n\nCNN's Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.

It's a new climate… women are coming together and you're able to have that platform to share your story and create real change for other women.\n\nIn a story published by Time on Wednesday, the 25-year-old model claims that Marciano verbally harassed and inappropriately touched her starting when she was 18 years old.\n\nMarciano denied the accusations in a statement to Time, which CNN obtained, calling them absolutely false.\n\nI have never been alone with Kate Upton, Marciano said in the statement. I have never touched her inappropriately. Nor would I ever refer to a Guess model in such a derogatory manner.\n\nCNN reached out to Marciano again on Friday to comment on Upton's GMA remarks.\n\nUpton alleges that at a 2010 photo shoot for her first Guess campaign, Marciano forcibly grabbed her breasts, saying he wanted to make sure they're real.\n\nShe told GMA's Robin Roberts on Friday that she found the courage to come forward after doing a workout with some of the newer models participating in New York Fashion Week.\n\nA lot of girls were sharing how excited they were about the different opportunities they got and the start of their career, Upton said. I remember being in that place whenever I got the meeting to go meet with Paul Marciano and how different my view of the industry after that meeting was and I wanted to prevent that from happening to these other girls who were just starting out.\n\nThe alleged incident with Marciano changed her perception of the modeling world, Upton said, and caused her to question herself.\n\nAs for the fashion mogul denying her allegations, Upton said she expected that.\n\nHonestly, I don't really need his validation for what happened, she said. I'm not looking for him to come forward and tell the truth and honestly I expected him to do that. I think it speaks to how he's treated these allegations in the past and it used to work before but that's not the case anymore and we're being heard and our stories are taken seriously.
Washington (CNN) Vice President Mike Pence on Saturday signaled his support for a bid by Republicans lawmakers to challenge electoral votes when Congress is expected to certify President-elect Joe Biden's victory in a meeting this week.\n\nVice President Pence shares the concerns of millions of Americans about voter fraud and irregularities in the last election. The vice president welcomes the efforts of members of the House and Senate to use the authority they have under the law to raise objections and bring forward evidence before the Congress and the American people on January 6th, Pence's chief of staff, Marc Short, said in a statement to CNN.\n\nThough there have been no credible allegations of any issues with voting that would have affected the election, a dozen GOP senators -- a handful of whom will be sworn-in Sunday -- have announced they will object to counting votes in Biden's clear Electoral College win during what has traditionally been a ceremonial exercise on Capitol Hill. President Donald Trump has been pushing for Congress to try to overturn the election result, but his vice president has sought to keep a safe distance from the more inflammatory claims and behavior of his fellow Republicans -- while subtly egging them on when it suits him.\n\nWhile at least 140 House Republicans are expected to join their Republican colleagues in the Senate in voting against counting the electoral votes in Congress, according to two GOP House members, the effort has virtually zero chance of changing the election outcome, only to delay for a few hours the inevitable affirmation of Biden's victory as the Electoral College winner and the next president.\n\nLast week, Sen. Josh Hawley became the first senator to announce plans to object to the results -- a significant move since both a House member and senator are required to mount an objection when Congress counts the electoral votes. The Missouri Republican on Sunday was still reviewing how many states he might object to and whether he will object to more than just Pennsylvania, according to a source familiar with his thinking.\n\nRead More
London (CNN) At a recent Saturday protest outside London's Stratford train station -- comprised of bindi-wearing hippies, conspiracy theorists in balaclavas, and middle-aged men in waterproof jackets -- a protester with the grassroots, anti-lockdown group StandUpX yelled into a megaphone.\n\nThe vaccine is there to make you infertile... that vaccine is just going to make them able to control you, they shouted.\n\nListening to the dangerously false spiel was 24-year-old Rebekah, who we are only identifying by her first name. A survivor of domestic abuse, Rebekah said she was living in a Manchester safe house when the first UK-wide lockdown began in March. If I was still living at home [with her abuser] in lockdown, I probably would have died, she told CNN.\n\nBut Rebekah's concerns about the crushing social and economic effects of pandemic restrictions took a conspiratorial turn after she read an Instagram post that she said made her question information shared by the media. She researched the matter online, churning up information that, while not supported by facts, nonetheless backed up her growing suspicions.\n\nMany conspiracy theories have found legs during the pandemic, and one of the first ones that Rebekah found was the widely debunked claim that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates was profiting from coronavirus vaccines.\n\nProtesters gather at a StandUpX rally in Stratford\n\nIn recent weeks, Rebekah says she has attended numerous anti-lockdown protests with her two children, while sharing conspiracy-laden posts about the pandemic to her 11,000 followers on Instagram. We have to trust it [the vaccine] ... knowing that they [Gates and the pharmaceutical companies] won't get in trouble if any of us die, she said as she handed her daughter a lollipop.\n\nWhile it might seem easy to pass off the 80-strong rally as a fringe event, Rebekah's journey to the protest frontlines is a microcosm of how online misinformation has allowed fantastical conspiracies to find a bigger audience.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) realized if people think Covid-19 is a hoax they will not only go outside and flout rules, said Anna-Sophie Harling, the Europe managing director of internet trust tool NewsGuard, which flags anti-vaccination misinformation for the UN agency, among other projects. But it's hard to convince people to take a vaccine for something they don't think exists or don't think is a problem, she told CNN.\n\nIn 2021, experts fear this alternative, fact-free universe will fuel hesitancy in taking the vaccine, a vital weapon in the fight against the virus. To beat Covid-19, we also need to defeat the parallel pandemic of mistrust that has consistently hindered our collective response to this disease, Francesco Rocca, president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, warned in a virtual briefing to the UN Correspondents Association on November 30.\n\nThe alt-universe\n\nAnti-lockdown protesters and conspiracy theorists take part in the Unite for Freedom protest, which was co-organized by Save Our Rights UK, in Trafalgar Square in August.\n\nThe first sign of a problem began as lockdowns shuttered large swathes of the planet in the spring.\n\nA study by the University of Oxford found that thousands of coronavirus misinformation videos, including the Plandemic clip that falsely claimed Covid-19 was created in a lab for profit, were shared 20 million times on social media between October 2019 and June 2020.\n\nAround the same time, QAnon, a dangerous online cult that believes US President Donald Trump is secretly fighting to bring down a cabal of pedophiles, also found a wider audience in Europe. A CNN investigation reviewed Facebook pages and groups related to the QAnon conspiracy based outside the US and found at least 12.8 million interactions between the beginning of the year and the last week of September.\n\nAs the months wore on, libertarian debates against mask-wearing and lockdowns began to intersect more strongly with conspiracy theories. An August march against Covid-19 restrictions in Germany's capital Berlin ended with protestors storming the steps of the Reichstag. Among the crowd were QAnon supporters toting the conspiracy group's insignia, as well as demonstrators waving imperial banners, a flag now deployed by the far right as the swastika is banned in Germany.\n\nAnetta Kahane, founder of the anti-racism group the Amadeu Antonio Foundation, watched the march from her Berlin apartment's window in horror. She told CNN it looked like disparate groups of conspiracists, neo-nazis, anti-vaxxers and esoterics appeared to have overcome their political differences. It is against liberalism, against globalised society, against science, against intellectuals, against multiculturalism and all the [trappings of] modern society, she said at the time\n\nLouise Creffield and Vince Dunmall, the founders of one anti-lockdown group, Save Our Rights UK, told CNN their focus was legislation, not conspiracies -- insisting that lockdowns and mask mandates are illegal and undemocratic.\n\nThe group's founders have, however, expressed anti-vaccination sentiments and knowingly co-organized marches with anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists like Piers Corbyn -- brother of former British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. Piers Corbyn is a climate change denier who proselytizes online about Covid-19 being a fake virus, despite all the evidence to the contrary.\n\nCNN has reached out to Corbyn for comment.\n\nDemonstrators stormed the steps of the Reichstag in August.\n\nThe group's Facebook page has posted videos featuring anti-Semitic conspiracy theorists such as David Icke, who popularized the false idea that a shape-shifting lizard-like species exerts control over human society by garnering political power to manipulate the world. Considered one of the most notorious conspiracists in the UK, Icke now claims the pandemic was entirely planned. We really do stand at the cusp between any kind type of freedom and a fascism that would make even the Nazis wince because of its technological nature, he said in Save Our Rights UK's video interview with him, which clocked nearly a quarter of a million\n\nNearly two months later, they posted an interview with Desmond Swayne, a ruling Conservative Party lawmaker, who is opposed to lockdowns. Save Our Rights UK's co-founder, Dunmall said: Look, David Icke may be someone who is talking out of turn in respect to a lot of what a lot of people think. But we've had a combination of Mr. Desmond Swayne coming on and saying what he's got to say. You know, it's freedom of speech, and it's a human right to have your opinions. Just because you don't agree with it doesn't mean you're not entitled to it, he told CNN.\n\nThe interview with SOR [Save Our Rights UK] was exclusively about lockdown and coercion, Swayne told CNN in an email. Whilst I would never countenance compulsory or coerced vaccination, I am an enthusiast for vaccination, he added.\n\n'Truthiness'\n\nThe issue is not freedom of speech; the real problem is that professional conspiracy theorists like Icke have exploited world events to make a living, says Daniel Allington, a senior lecturer at King's College London and an expert on conspiracy beliefs.\n\nWhen asked to comment on whether he exploited world events for financial gain, Icke declined to comment.\n\nThe government's Covid-19 restrictions contained aspects of scenarios that conspiracy theorists had been predicting for years, Allington said.\n\nThat life is going to be like George Orwell's '1984' and every aspect of your life will be controlled by the government and everything will be tracked and you'll be under constant surveillance and there'll be terrible punishments for it, he explained.\n\nIt does not help when these false ideologies are backed by celebrities and television pundits. At the start of December, Black Panther star Letitia Wright shared concerns and conspiracy theories about Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nThe actress shared a video on Twitter from a YouTube personality who made baseless claims about the vaccines' safety, but eventually deleted the tweet after dozens of back-and-forth exchanges with people criticizing her for spreading potentially dangerous misinformation.\n\nIn November, British television presenter Emma Kenny suggested Covid-19 vaccinations would injure children in a since-deleted tweet. She also shared a video in which she said, everything as far as I am concerned that I have considered conspiracy is looking more and more like reality.\n\nPiers Corbyn speaks to demonstrators as a man holds up a QAnon sign behind him during a StandUpX protest in London this October.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Kenny said she is not a Covid-19 denier or anti-vaccination. In fact, for those wanting the vaccine then if that makes them feel secure, then that will be a good thing. I at this point just want to be allowed an informed choice and I would think in the US and the UK this would not be a contentious point. I will always stand for people to have autonomy over their bodies, she added.\n\nWestern populist movements, like the Brexit vote, also laid the groundwork for people to ignore warnings from experts around the middle of this decade, says Joe Ondrak, a senior researcher at fact-checking organization Logically.\n\nYou had [Conservative lawmaker] Michael Gove's famous soundbite that people had enough of experts, Ondrak said of the politician's statement in the run-up to UK's Brexit vote in 2016. He explained that the period set a precedent for civil discourse no longer being about a person's qualifications to speak on a matter, but far more about feelings and emotion, and the idea of truthiness -- the latter meaning that it feels like the truth and therefore I'm going to believe it.\n\n'Much of the damage has already been done'\n\nThe main culprit in the spread of these fictional worldviews has been social media.\n\nWhile surveys by Allington have found a majority of people in the UK reject conspiracies, he said it's quite clear that the events of the past year have thrown these theories into overdrive.\n\nBy May, a King's College London and Ipsos MORI study based on three surveys on Covid-19 conspiracies by Allington and his colleagues surveyed UK residents and found three in ten believed the virus was probably created in a lab. People who got their information from social media were more likely to believe in conspiracies than those who got it on television or radio the study also found.\n\nFacebook groups containing Covid-19 and vaccine misinformation have been growing virtually unchecked, NewsGuard's Harling said. Each group has a backup group, and when that fails [after being de-platformed by Facebook] they tend to move off Facebook, to the controversial conservative social media platform Parler, or Gab or Telegram, she added.\n\nFacebook has historically struggled to handle anti-vaccine misinformation on its platform and only started to ban QAnon sites in October, three years after the conspiracy formed.\n\nThe company said this month it would remove debunked coronavirus claims . But NewsGuard's report on Covid-19 vaccine misinformation 'superspreaders' on the platform, released prior to Facebook's announcement, shows that many of the flagged pages remain on the site.\n\nA Facebook company spokesperson told CNN that it takes aggressive steps to limit the spread of misinformation about Covid-19, that it has connected over two billion people with accurate information from public health authorities and it removes content that could lead to imminent physical harm, such as false posts about virus cures or vaccines.\n\nThe spokesperson added that Facebook took down more than 12 million examples of such content between March and October and worked with third-party fact checkers to attach warnings to 167 million Covid-19 posts.\n\nOn Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, four of the top 10 search results for the word vaccine are anti-vaccination accounts. In many ways, I think much of the damage has already been done. The anti-vax movement: people believe Covid-19 is a hoax -- those people have been sowing their seeds since March, Harling said.\n\nConspiracy theorists like David Icke (center) are accused of exploiting world events to make a living.\n\nOndrak said another problem for Facebook is what he calls micro-influencers -- individual profiles promoting Covid-19 conspiracies through public posts that are getting hundreds of shares. They are tricky as it is an underground network that is not viewable off analytics software, he added.\n\nThere is no one single solution to the problem. Ondrak worries that takedowns of posts and pages could risk re-enforcing people's views on conspiracies.\n\nBefore 2020, fringe conspiracy narratives were just fringe, but it is not like that now and the idea of takedowns needs to be rethought, purely because it's wider discourse now, he said, adding that removal could in itself be seen as a vindication of someone's warped beliefs.\n\nFor Allington, social media giants like Facebook need to own this problem and recognize they have contributed to it through their policies.\n\nOne possible fix could be opening itself up to external researchers who will be able to audit the success of their policies and controlling the spread of this content, Allington said.\n\nWhen asked if Facebook would be open to Allington's suggestion, the company spokesperson said it worked with third-party fact checkers and has displayed warnings on around 167 million COVID-19 posts - leading to 95% of people not clicking through to read the original post.\n\nAnother focus, said Harling, is upping media literacy skills and complete transparency from tech companies.\n\nSo transparency towards the user on what's behind the content in their newsfeed, but also on the part of the tech platforms as to why they're making certain decisions, how much content they're removing, what steps are being taken and why, she said.\n\nBack at the London protest, Rebekah told CNN after the demonstration that she didn't leave her flat for three months during the UK's first national lockdown, fearful for her and her children's lives due to Covid-19.\n\nBut she said she felt conned after reading a misleading Instagram post in the summer, which pointed to the UK government downgrading Covid-19 from its high consequence infectious disease (HCID) list as proof that authorities were overhyping the virus.\n\nTo find out that during all that time, my mind could have been at peace, I could have focused on other things. The children could have gone out and played, I felt so gullible, Rebekah said. Now, she says, there is very little that will change her mind about her belief in the conspiracy about Bill Gates and the Covid-19 vaccine. Nor will she be taking the Covid-19 vaccine. I always question everything... I know Google isn't everything, but I'll have a look on there and see what I can find.
(CNN) The scattershot efforts to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's election victory are coalescing into a movement led by top Republicans determined to exploit a manufactured crisis for broader political gains.\n\nNearly a dozen more GOP senators, a handful of whom will be sworn-in Sunday, have now announced they will challenge Biden's clear Electoral College win over President Donald Trump next week during what has traditionally been a ceremonial exercise on Capitol Hill. Their gambit is doomed to fail -- they have acknowledged as much -- in its immediate objective, but likely to succeed in hardening the conspiracy theory-fueled, right-wing base in Trump's thrall.\n\nThe President is, predictably, cheering on the charade. And in a taped phone conversation on Saturday, reported by The Washington Post , encouraged Georgia's top elections official to find enough votes to overturn Biden's victory in the state.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with saying, you know, um, that you've recalculated, Trump told Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, according to the Post, adding later in the call: All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state.\n\nAround the time Trump was working over Raffensperger, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows urged his former House colleagues to fight back in a Saturday night tweet\n\nVice President Mike Pence -- who has sought to keep a safe distance from the more inflammatory claims and behavior of fellow Republicans while subtly egging them on when it suits him -- has also welcomed congressional Republicans' challenge. He wants lawmakers to bring forward evidence before the Congress, his chief of staff said in a statement Saturday.\n\nThe push to cast doubt over the election result -- and, in Trump's case, pressure officials to juke the numbers -- is now escalating beyond ambitious Republicans' initial bids to curry favor with the President by idly urging on a would-be power grab. The announcement Saturday from Republican senators and senators-elect cut deeper and, framed in a maddening circular logic, argued that Congress should commission an emergency 10-day audit of results from disputed states because of the volume of allegations of voter fraud, violations and lax enforcement of election law, and other voting irregularities.\n\nThose charges, of course, are coming from the same cohort of lawmakers now trying to refashion them as evidence to support their actions. The group's citation of a poll that underscores voters' distrust in the election process ignores Trump's role in ginning up an increasingly paranoiac strain of conservatism -- one that is shape-shifting now, in the final days of his presidency, into what is likely to become an enduring and corrosive political faction. That their announcement came on the eve of a new Congress, and for some less than a day before they take their oaths on the Senate floor, provided an immediate preview of Trumpism's sticking power and how it might manifest itself -- with more diplomatic language, but no less authoritarian tendencies -- in the coming years.\n\nOn Sunday morning, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine embraced the basis of the Republican senators' argument, telling CNN's Jake Tapper on State of the Union that he would support a bipartisan commission to take a look at the concerns of people questioning this election.\n\nAsked why he believed those questions -- relentlessly promoted by Trump and right-wing media -- existed in the first place, DeWine demurred. The process in his state, which the President won, had met a high bar, he insisted, before suggesting that other states had a responsibility to restore the confidence that the leaders of his own party had spent so much time trying to break.\n\nThe newfangled GOP caucus now leading the assault on the presidential election counts a dozen members, including Trump loyalist Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Wisconsin's Ron Johnson, along with some new names, like Sen.-elect Roger Marshall of Kansas and former college football coach Tommy Tuberville, the incoming senator from Alabama. The group took shape after Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley announced last week he would contest the election results.\n\nNotably, none of the officials who signed the Saturday statement, nor any of what could be as many as 140 allies in the House, have suggested that the election fraud that so concerns them might have also affected their own races. The fix, as they would have Americans believe, started and stopped at the top of the ticket.\n\nThe absurdity is not entirely lost on the group, which added a new wrinkle with its call for Congress to intervene in the Electoral College process by engineering a kind of Star Chamber to review results from an unstated number of unnamed states.\n\nOnce completed, individual states would evaluate the Commission's findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a change in their vote, if needed, the Republican senators wrote. Never mind that the states they likely have in mind have already certified the will of their voters and repeatedly resisted prodding from Trump to ignore state law as part of a scheme to flip the election in his favor.\n\nRepublicans play multiple angles\n\nThe real-life effects of the ramped-up campaign to seed and sow new doubts about Trump's defeat are being felt most acutely now in Georgia , where a pair of runoffs -- which will decide control of the Senate in the next Congress -- are set for Tuesday.\n\nTrump again attacked Raffensperger Sunday morning, before their phone call became public, complaining in a tweet that the Georgia Republican had not turned up evidence of nonexistent voter fraud.\n\nRaffensperger responded 90 minutes later.\n\nRespectfully, President Trump: What you're saying is not true, he tweeted. The truth will come out.\n\nThe night before, Geoff Duncan, the state's Republican lieutenant governor, told CNN that the feeling on the ground there was very tense, before declining to speak specifically about security threats. Trump has called on Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, also a Republican, to resign after repeated recounts of the presidential vote there confirmed Biden's narrow win.\n\nKemp is one of a handful of Republicans to speak out against Trump's behavior. Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, who is retiring in 2022, has also been critical of his GOP colleagues' rhetoric and, on Saturday, responded to the new announcement with a sharp rebuke of the senators involved.\n\nA fundamental, defining feature of a democratic republic is the right of the people to elect their own leaders. The effort by Senators Hawley, Cruz, and others to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in swing states like Pennsylvania directly undermines this right, Toomey said in a statement.\n\nBiden's success in Pennsylvania, Toomey concluded, said little about the election process and could be easily explained by the decline in suburban support for President Trump and the President's slightly smaller victory margins in most rural counties.\n\nHawley shot back at Toomey late Saturday in an email to the Republican Senate conference, obtained by CNN from a GOP source, accusing his colleague of putting words into (his mouth) before recycling a series of post-hoc complaints about the election rules in Pennsylvania.\n\nBut the stunt in the works now figures to have longer political and social coattails. It fits in with a wider, burgeoning attempt to further constrain voting rights in the future. Back in November, Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott, who is not taking part in this Wednesday's protest, signaled that he would seek to parlay the confusion created by Trump and his allies into support for new federal restrictions.\n\nThis election has shown we need major reforms to our election systems, including Voter ID laws across the nation, to protect against fraud and rebuild the American people's trust in fair outcomes, Scott tweeted, linking to a press release about his VOTER Act.\n\nPrecisely what about the election had shown that action was necessary was left ominously unstated. After years of being accused of enabling the President, Scott offered a preview of how some in the GOP hope he could enable them to gather support for their own, pre-existing agenda.\n\nThe vice president, through Justice Department lawyers, pushed back against a lawsuit filed by Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert and Arizona Republicans that sought to give Pence the power to effectively dump the electoral college results and hand reelection to Trump. The suit was dismissed , for a lack of standing, by a federal judge on Friday night.\n\nBy Saturday, though, the vice president's office was cheering on congressional Republicans.\n\nVice President Pence shares the concerns of millions of Americans about voter fraud and irregularities in the last election, Pence chief of staff Marc Short said in a statement. The Vice President welcomes the efforts of members of the House and Senate to use the authority they have under the law to raise objections and bring forward evidence before the Congress and the American people on January 6th.\n\nA federal court on Saturday dismissed an appeal from Gohmert in his lawsuit.\n\nDemocrats bite back\n\nFor his part, Biden -- who as vice president himself oversaw without incident the same ceremonial confirmation, in 2016, that sealed Trump's election -- has been mostly understated in his comments on Republican machinations.\n\nIn a December speech, he noted the dozens of failed legal challenges brought by the Trump campaign and praised elections officials and workers for doing their duty in the face of political pressure, verbal abuse and even threats of physical violence.\n\nThey could not and would not give credence to what they know is not true, Biden said. They knew this election was overseen, it was honest, it was free and it was fair. They saw it with their own eyes, and they wouldn't be bullied into saying anything different.\n\nOn Saturday, a spokesman for Biden, Mike Gwin, responded to news that a new crop of Republican senators would be objecting to the final certification by dismissing their plans as political theater.\n\nThis stunt won't change the fact that President-elect Biden will be sworn in on January 20th, Gwin said, reiterating Biden and the transition's earlier position. And these baseless claims have already been examined and dismissed by Trump's own Attorney General, dozens of courts, and election officials from both parties.\n\nOther Democrats were less circumspect.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with the Democrats and was Biden's toughest competition in the 2020 party primary, called the effort pathetic and its aims unconstitutional.\n\nWhat all of this comes down to is that Donald Trump and right wing extremists are refusing to accept the will of the people and the fact that Trump lost the election, Sanders said in a statement. In their contempt for democracy, they are using lies and conspiracy theories about 'voter fraud' in an attempt to overturn the election results.\n\nHe was joined, among others, by another former Biden primary rival, Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, in cutting through the façade of concern projected by their GOP counterparts.\n\nFor a group of my Republican colleagues to claim that they want an additional federal 'commission' to supersede state certifications when the votes have already been counted, recounted, litigated, and state-certified, Klobuchar said, amounts to nothing more than an attempt to subvert the will of the voters.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Sunday.
Milagros Bosse and her kids -- Tron, from left, Julian, Taina and Terence -- are unsure where they'll live.\n\nStory highlights FEMA says 3,895 families displaced by Hurricane Maria are still being put up in hotels Most stays have been extended through March 20, but what happens then is uncertain\n\n(CNN) —\n\nFamilies displaced by Hurricane Maria are nervously counting the days until Federal Emergency Management Agency funding dries up for temporary housing in hotels across 40 states and Puerto Rico.\n\nNearly five months after the hurricane pummeled the US territory, 3,895 families are still being put up in hotel rooms paid for by FEMA's Transitional Shelter Assistance program. The Puerto Ricans took temporary shelter after the storm destroyed or seriously damaged thousands of homes and left much of the island without power and drinking water.\n\nWe live in limbo, said Milagros Bosse, a 32-year-old Marine Corps veteran who has been staying at a New York hotel with her four young children since December. We stress out every single day.\n\nMost stays have been extended through March 20, but about 200 families recently learned that FEMA was to stop paying for their rooms on Wednesday. It's unclear what's happening to those families, and the agency declined to comment on specific cases.\n\nFEMA spokesman Daniel P. Llargués said the program is supposed to be a bridge to longer term housing and that some households were denied extensions after the agency determined their homes on the island were habitable.\n\nLlargués said the agency was reviewing a request from Puerto Rico's government to extend its direct lease program – which provides temporary housing in apartments or multifamily homes directly to survivors – to displaced families on the mainland.\n\nThe Transitional Shelter Assistance program could be extended beyond March at the request of the island's government, Llargués said\n\nIn addition to 873 households staying at hotels on the island, FEMA said it is paying for the stays of 1,488 families in Florida, 600 in Massachusetts, 243 in New York, 167 in Connecticut and 177 in Pennsylvania.\n\nLlargués said the overall numbers are fluid and change rapidly, with survivors moving in and out of the program on a daily basis.\n\nThe eligibility for transitional housing is re-evaluated every 30 days. But some families said they have enrolled their children in schools and now face an uncertain future on the US mainland.\n\nBosse said her children are doing well in school but said a school psychologist told her that her 9-year-old daughter, Taina, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and separation anxiety as a result of the September storm.\n\nBosse said she is waiting for the Department of Veterans Affairs to assign her a caseworker so she can apply for a housing program for homeless veterans. She has been looking for work.\n\nWe're grateful to have been put up in a hotel, but now it seems like we're forgotten, she said. I don't want to have to keep on moving the children. I don't want to keep on traumatizing them.
Story highlights James Green, vice chair of the Wasatch County GOP, argued against mandating equal pay Green argued that it was not the role of the government to dictate to businesses what they should pay\n\n(CNN) —\n\nA Utah county Republican Party official has resigned after receiving blowback for criticizing a bill in the state legislature designed to create equal pay criteria.\n\nJames Green, vice chair of the Wasatch County GOP, wrote a letter to the editor published in the Wasatch Wave and The Park Record on Wednesday in which he argued against requiring equal pay because if businesses are forced to pay women the same as male earnings, that means they will have to reduce the pay for the men they employ.\n\nThe letter argues that it is not the role of the government to dictate to businesses what they should pay and said traditionally, men have earned more than women in the workplace because they are considered the primary breadwinners for families. They need to make enough to support their families and allow the mother to remain in the home to raise and nurture the children.\n\nGreen later apologized for the remarks and decided Friday that he was resigning his position.\n\nI didn't mean it to be demeaning to anyone with my letter, Green told CNN in an email Saturday evening. Quite unfortunate that some took this wrong. I'm one of the strongest supporters of women in the nation.\n\nHe said he has been shocked by the virulent reaction he has received and said his argument was with the legislation, not the premise of equal pay for women.\n\nI still feel government should not dictate to private establishments what they must do. I guess people don't want to understand these basic issues, he wrote.\n\nThe bill, S.B. 210, would require certain employers in the state to adopt and disclose to each employee uniform criteria that the employer uses to determine whether to change an employee's compensation or benefits based on the employee's performance, among other things.
(CNN) —\n\nWearing traditional Palestinian gowns, hundreds of women across the United States showed off their heritage in honor of a historic day.\n\nRashida Tlaib on Thursday became the first Palestinian-American woman to be sworn in to Congress. Weeks ago, she announced she would wear a thobe to the ceremony and she kept her word.\n\nA thobe is a hand-embroidered gown that comes in a range of designs and colors, and often signifies the village from where the wearer hails. Most Palestinian women have at least one of these special dresses in their closets, and wearing one is seen as a show of pride for their culture and heritage.\n\nPHOTO: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Rashida Tlaib wears a traditional Palestinian gown, as her son does a dance move, the dab.\n\nWomen and girls wore their thobes as part of a social media campaign to honor the Michigan Democrat. Some posted photos on Twitter and Instagram with #TweetYourThobe, while others traveled to the Capitol to greet Tlaib in their gowns.\n\nIt was a very proud day for me and for all Palestinian people, especially proud for Palestinian girls and women, said Alice Muaddi, who traveled from New Jersey to Washington to greet Tlaib in her thobe. Muaddi emigrated from a Palestinian village to the United States in the 1960s.\n\nTlaib, whose parents are also Palestinian immigrants, filled the seat formerly occupied by Democratic Rep. John Conyers, who left office last year amid accusations of sexual misconduct. She ran unopposed in the general election after her August primary win in Michigan's 13th Congressional District.\n\nI have been in the USA for 52 years and today I felt that her win is for every Palestinian-American girl and woman. She is an inspiration and a role model to all of us, Muaddi said.\n\n#tweetyourthobe Congratulations to Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib ! A proud day for Palestinian women. A great role model for young girls. God bless Palestine. pic.twitter.com/Z207o4zJPT — alice muaddi (@umaboud) January 3, 2019\n\nA solidarity movement is born on social media\n\nWhen Tlaib shared that she would be wearing a thobe to the ceremony, Susan Muaddi Darraj was delighted. Yet some people on social media weren't so kind, saying wearing the dress would be un-American.\n\nThe professor and novelist from Maryland created the #TweetYourThobe hashtag on social media, asking people to share photos of themselves in the traditional garment. She wanted to do something to educate people, while also celebrating Tlaib's achievement, she said.\n\nPalestinian-American women all have these thobes. They are given to us by our mothers and are often handed down through families, Muaddi Darraj explained. They are worn to very special occasions, weddings, baptisms and graduations, so it's very appropriate she's wearing this dress, which her mother gave her, to her swearing-in.\n\nTlaib wearing her thobe sends a message, said Muaddi Darraj, a first-generation Palestinian-American. Alice Muaddi, the woman who traveled to the Capitol to meet Tlaib, is her mother.\n\nShe is wearing it because her mother made that dress for her. That dress is like her way of attesting to her mother's hard work and love. I respect her so much for wearing it, she said.\n\nWhen Muaddi Darraj saw all the images of girls and women, and even entire families of women, sharing their photos, she said she was overwhelmed.\n\nThey are handmade, and it can take months to make one of these dresses. To see these women showing these off in a moment of pride and celebration, I'm excited and inspired by it, Muaddi Darraj said.\n\nOur culture gets misrepresented so often. Portraying our culture in this authentic manner is so important to me, she said.\n\nWomen who said they aren't Palestinian also posted messages of support, some wearing thobes as well, which touched Muaddi Darraj.\n\nWomen of Palestinian heritage dressed to support her\n\nRenad Uri is a Palestinian-American who lives in Ramallah, West Bank. She shared a photo of her and her niece wearing their thobes in support of Tlaib. Uri worked on Capitol Hill for two years and for her, Tlaib joining Congress is significant.\n\nI've been shut down by staffers for being Palestinian and for being a woman. It's amazing for me to now have (Tlaib's) concrete role that no one can put down or kick out of their offices, she said. Uri interned with a lobbying organization on Capitol Hill and recently graduated from college.\n\nIt's so gratifying to see someone that's a woman and a Palestinian loving our culture and heritage, making sure that everyone sees it and feels it, the 22-year-old said.\n\n#TweetYourThobe so excited for @RashidaTlaib getting sworn in today!

And bonus, Bernie Sanders was there.\n\nHassan dressed in her thobe and went to Tlaib's office to greet and welcome her to Washington. Other women did the same, showing up in their family's thobes. Some traveled from cities across the country.\n\nI'm very proud to have a Palestinian-American representative from Michigan in Washington. It's been very difficult for Palestinians to engage in the political process, said Hassan, who is a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n.@RashidaTlaib Four generations of Palestinian-Americans have waited for your arrival. Welcome home. Welcome to the House! #TweetYourThobe #Palestinian pic.twitter.com/hR8WgolTHE — Zaha Hassan زها حسن (@zahahassan) January 3, 2019\n\nIt's remarkable, historic and gives us hope that Palestinian-Americans can be part of the fabric of this democracy and participating on equal footing with the rest of the citizens in this country, the 49-year-old said.\n\nHaving a Palestinian-American in Congress signals change, but this moment is about more than that, says the social media movement's creator Muaddi Darraj. She said she's thrilled Native American women and other women of diverse backgrounds have also been elected to office.\n\nThis is a very American moment, she said. We have a Congress that finally looks like our country and that's incredibly thrilling to me. It's about time.
Story highlights Cardiovascular diseases are the No. 1 cause of death globally A new device could make detecting them simpler, quicker and cheaper\n\n(CNN) —\n\nIt starts with an uncomfortable pressure gripping the center of your chest. A sharp pain shoots through your arms, neck and jaw. Your breath starts to shorten; you feel a growing urge to vomit.\n\nWhat do you do next? Nearly half of Americans do nothing.\n\nA report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the early warning signs of heart attacks discovered that about 47% of sudden cardiac deaths occur away from hospital. This suggests, the report continues, that many people with heart disease do not act on early warning signs.\n\nNot only are the symptoms of a heart attack frightening by themselves, but testing for them at a hospital in the United States can run into the tens of thousands of dollars. Most important: The longer a heart attack goes undetected, the greater the damage to the victim's heart.\n\nTime is muscle. We know the heart muscle can live without blood for four to six hours, so if you are opening the artery after four hours, there will be a lot of damage to the heart, said Dr. Chaim Lotan, director of the Heart Institute and Cardiovascular Division at Hadassah Ein Kerem Medical Center in Jerusalem. If you open the artery early, you can save a lot of muscle.\n\nBut a device developed in Israel could radically change how we detect heart attacks by making the process simpler, quicker and cheaper. It is the brainchild of Emil Katz, founder and CEO of Novamed, a life-sciences company that makes medical products, who was alarmed at how quickly a number of his friends suddenly died from heart attacks.\n\nSome of them had symptoms that lasted one, two and three days, but they neglected them and said, 'it is not strong enough; let us wait,'  Katz recalled. Then I started to read the statistics about how many people in the world die from a heart attack before getting medical aid, and I was shocked. Something had to be done.\n\nIn the US, heart disease is the leading cause of death, according to the CDC, with more than 600,000 deaths each year. One in three American adults – about 80 million people – has high blood pressure, which increases the risk of heart attack and other major health problems, according to the American Heart Association. The World Health Organization found that cardiovascular diseases are the No. 1 cause of death globally, killing 17.7 million people in 2015.\n\nKatz's solution: a device called SensAheart, roughly the size of a USB stick, which is as easy to use as a blood sugar or pregnancy test and just as quick.\n\nA five-minute test\n\nIn his office, I receive a demonstration. A nurse pricks my finger, placing a drop of blood on a testing strip. She then applies a special liquid. The device is checking my blood for evidence of a reaction between two types of proteins – HFABP and troponin – and any antibodies my body would have produced in the event of a heart attack.\n\nA damaged heart releases both types of protein into the bloodstream, and by searching for evidence of their reaction with antibodies, the experimental test can identify heart attacks that have occurred as recently as an hour ago, or as long ago as several days.\n\nExisting blood tests can take up to six hours to deliver a result, after a patient shows symptoms of a heart attack. I wait roughly five minutes for the result of my test. I am told that a positive result will generate two lines on the strip. If that happens, I will receive immediate medical attention, Lotan assures me.\n\nThe [waiting] lines [at the hospitals] are long, and if the patient [arrives] in pain, he can wait in the emergency room until there is time [to see] him, Lotan said. But if that patient comes into the hospital with a positive test, they will be a priority, because we will believe with a very high certainty that something is wrong with his heart.\n\nMy results come back. The device shows only one line. Even though I have not suffered any symptoms, it is still something of a relief to be told I have not suffered a heart attack. I have a history of heart disease in the family, so it brings me a little peace of mind.\n\nLotan and his medical team at the Hadassah Hospital have been assessing the accuracy of the device. They discovered that SensAheart is more accurate than the current available test.\n\nIf the result is positive, the likelihood that SensAheart is mistaken is very small, they say – and the recommendation for the individual is to go immediately to a hospital.\n\nIf the result comes back negative, it is important to keep in mind the possibility that the test might have failed; in a trial of people who had all suffered heart attacks, SensAheart failed to detect the attack on 23% of occasions.\n\nThe advice in the case of a negative result, and in which the symptoms go away, is to nevertheless repeat the test after three hours. If the result of the second test is also negative, the individual can be pretty much certain they have not suffered a cardiac event.\n\nIn all other eventualities, the advice is to go to a hospital and get checked.\n\nThere is never 100% in anything, Lotan said. First of all, you have to combine the symptoms. It is not only the test, you [also] have to take into consideration the entire history of the patient.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nKatz also stresses that this is not a crystal ball. It cannot detect a heart attack before it happens.\n\nYou cannot rely on the test [to predict] the future. Like every disease, at that particular moment things might be OK, but a little bit later, something might happen, he said.\n\nThe device is available in Europe and Israel. Katz says he is working to introduce it into the US.\n\nSensAheart is still relatively unknown in the US, and it is very unlikely that American consumers will be able to find the product in a pharmacy or hospital anytime soon, according to Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. He describes enormous hurdles to cross before approval from the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe regulatory pathway for approval of such a device in the United States is daunting, Nissen said. When you're dealing with a life-threatening disorder, [a product developer] would need to invest an enormous amount of money in proving it was safe and effective, especially for home use.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nNissen believes that process could take up to a decade.\n\nFor the moment, Israel's Ministry of Health's Medical Devices Department states that only medical professionals may use the test. Katz hopes that the restrictions will be eased and that his product will be seen from bathroom medicine cabinets to airplanes – meaning an end, perhaps, to those is there a doctor on board? emergencies.\n\nHow much will one of the kits cost? Well, it is cheaper than rushing to the emergency room for something that turns out not to be a heart attack.\n\nIt will be $10 to $20 per test, Katz insisted. Not big money for your health.

The official anniversary of when an 1821 revolution sparked a war of independence against the Ottoman Empire is in February-March, but parties and events to mark the bicentennial are expected -- Covid permitting -- throughout the year.\n\nThe charming port of Nafplio, in the Peloponnese region southwest of Athens, is as good a place as any to join in the celebrations -- it was modern Greece's first capital. As well as beaches and nearby ancient sites like the remarkable Epidaurus amphitheater and the imposing ruins of Mycenae , Nafplio has its own attractions, including the hilltop Palamidi fortress, a secluded beach and, especially apt for these times, a museum of worry beads\n\nBeyond Nafplio, the Peloponnese are worth exploring. Less touristed than many of Greece's hotspots, they're more set up for social distancing, especially on the wild and mountainous Mani Peninsula. That said, most of Greece, which is known to take health matters very seriously, seemed to cope well with creating a Covid-safe visitor experience in the summer of 2020, succumbing to a virus surge far later than most European destinations.\n\nWhile a slow return to normal might make previously overtouristed places like Santorini worth a look in 2021, there's no loss in playing it safe with a quieter option, like the island of Milos in the Cyclades -- a plane or ferry hop from Athens. This volcanic playground has a beach for every day of the month, with more than a few to spare. -- Barry Neild\n\nGrenada\n\nWhile Grenada's nickname comes from its famous nutmeg industry, the Isle of Spice is packed with flavor in every way possible.\n\nMeasuring just 18 kilometers wide and 34 kilometers long, the eastern Caribbean island is made up of sandy beaches, lush rainforests and spectacular waterfalls, but it's Grenada's rich character that sets it apart from more well-known tropical destinations.\n\nAlthough each of its seven parishes has its own very distinct charm and appeal, Grenada's capital St. George's, known for its horseshoe-shaped harbor and colorful houses, is undoubtedly the most vibrant and picturesque.\n\nSt. George's is also home to many of Grenada's top hotels, including The Point at Petite Calivigny , a boutique wellness resort, which opened in late 2020, and Silversands Grenada , where visitors will find the longest infinity pool in the Caribbean.\n\nThe island has around 45 beaches, but Grand Anse is its most popular for good reason. Spanning three kilometers, this stunning stretch of white sand frequented by both visitors and locals offers tranquil waters, fantastic views and a wonderfully serene atmosphere. -- Tamara Hardingham-Gill\n\nHawaii\n\nHawaii is home to truly extraordinary beaches -- and a whole lot more. Shutterstock\n\nHawaii is underrated. This in spite of its unceasing popularity among travelers.\n\nTo be sure, it is a gorgeous place, with breathtaking sunrises and sunsets, and every beach seemingly prettier than the next, but its beauty goes much deeper than its preternatural appearance.\n\nExtraordinary beaches -- some even boast black and green sand (Papakōlea Beach and Punaluʻu Beach, respectively) -- have their expected appeal, but visitors who take time to venture out and away from the coast quickly discover Hawaii's charms are in every nook and cranny.\n\nRelated content What it's like to travel to Hawaii right now\n\nOn Maui, after a few blissful days lounging at one of Wailea's top resorts ( Hotel Wailea for adults and Four Seasons for the whole family), take the road to Hana , an epic, winding adventure where half the joy is stopping along the way -- to get the perfect shot or the most delicious tropical juice.\n\nNo matter which island you choose, which beachfront accommodation or which adventure, the key is slowing down and inviting the Aloha vibes to take over. -- Stacey Lastoe\n\nItaly\n\nPerennially popular Italy hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons in March 2020, when it became the global epicenter of the pandemic -- and after controlling infection rates better than most European countries over the summer, its aging population has been hit hard again by the second wave.\n\nBut nothing can dim Italy's attraction, and as restrictions ease, this will be a time to see it at its best. Pre-pandemic, Italy's art cities were notorious epicenters of overtourism.\n\nBut with visitor numbers not expected to return to 2019 levels for several years, for those who can make it safely, 2021 will afford the chance to see the Bel Paese in a way that hasn't been possible for decades.\n\nRelated content The Italian towns perfect for social distancing\n\nWhat's more, the best known cities are trying to change tourism for the better. Having seen many of the tatty souvenir shops close in the pandemic, Venice, for instance, is focusing on promoting the city's traditional artisans, in a bid to readjust the tourism economy before the crowds come back.\n\nMeanwhile, Milan's Pinacoteca di Brera -- one of Italy's showstopper (and queue-heavy) art galleries -- has vowed to keep entrance by pre-booking only, in order to give visitors more space, while Da Vinci masterwork The Last Supper is considering more same-day tickets to favor individuals rather than the big groups that usually book up slots months in advance.\n\nRelated content How Italy accidentally invented the perfect Covid-era hotel\n\nStill social distancing? Italy has some of Europe's loveliest rural towns, and its alberghi diffusi (scattered hotels) are perfect for the Covid era, putting you up in self-contained apartments dotted around villages.

Stanislav Kogiku/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nThough every tourism-dependent nation is certainly deserving of sympathy going into 2021, one can't help but feel particularly moved by the plight of Japan.\n\nThis is a country that hustled hard to ready itself for the 2020 Olympic Summer Games, only to have to cancel the event just as it was ready to showcase those efforts to the world.\n\nThose postponed Olympic Games will kick off in Tokyo on July 23, 2021, giving travelers a chance to see some of the huge changes that have taken place, along with all the reasons we fell in love with the country in the first place. The food, the people, the culture ... Japan has a way of embedding itself into your soul and we can't wait to get back.\n\nMajor Tokyo additions include the Takanawa Gateway -- the first new station built on the city's key JR Yamanote train line since 1971. The area around busy Shibuya Station has also been revamped as part of a huge multi-layer makeover to cement it as the city's entertainment, transport and business hub for decades to come. Other changes of note include wider free Wi-Fi coverage not just in Tokyo but in the entire country -- including 108 Shinkansen bullet train stations.\n\nSeveral new hotels opened this year as well, including the luxurious Kimpton Shinjuku Tokyo and the Four Seasons Hotel Tokyo at Otemachi.\n\nBut there's plenty to see elsewhere, too -- particularly for theme park fans. Our top pick? The new Super Nintendo World, which is due to open at Universal Studios Japan in Osaka in February 2021. -- Karla Cripps\n\nMaldives\n\nWhite sand beaches? Check. World-class dining? Yep. Incredible swimming, sailing and scuba diving? Got those too. Throughout the pandemic, Maldives has also managed to keep its borders open more than most thanks to the built-in social distancing offered by its luxurious resorts.\n\nIf anybody needed additional incentive to cross Maldives off of their bucket list in 2021, a spate of hotel openings is keeping things interesting. On deck for 2021 openings are new resorts from Ritz-Carlton, Patina, Le Meridien, Capella and Radisson Blu.\n\nNext year will also mark a world's-first country-wide loyalty program: the Maldives Border Miles program will allow visitors to earn points based on how often they visit and how long they stay. After all, the only thing better than visiting is visiting twice. -- Lilit Marcus\n\nMexico\n\nTravel between the United States and Mexico never really stopped during the pandemic. Donald Miralle/Getty Images\n\nThis US neighbor to the south was a respite for many in 2020, in spite of the closure of land borders between the US and Mexico and multiple surges in coronavirus cases.\n\nAir travel into and out of Mexico never really stopped, owing to the country's limited Covid-related travel requirements, plus its natural beauty, breathtaking coastlines and a wide swath of relatively under-touristed locations beyond hotspots like Puerto Vallarta, Cancun and Cabo San Lucas.\n\nWhile balancing physical and economic health has been an uneven juggling act the world over, the fact is Mexico and many other destinations are in dire need of tourism revenue.\n\nLooking into fall 2021, which hopefully will be a much less complicated time to visit, Mexico City will be celebrating its quincentennial, commemorating its founding 500 years ago, with most festivities planned in September to coincide with Mexican Independence Day.\n\nLater in the fall, Formula 1 racing fans can attend the 2021 Mexico City Grand Prix on October 29-31 at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez. -- Brekke Fletcher\n\nNew Zealand\n\nOtherworldly -- a term often applied to New Zealand's eye-popping, Hobbit-friendly landscapes -- has taken on new meaning when it comes to this South Pacific jewel.\n\nUnlike vast swaths of the rest of the world, many of life's normal activities have resumed in New Zealand, thanks to one of the globe's most successful pandemic responses\n\nThe island country of five million has all but stamped out coronavirus, logging just over two dozen Covid-19 deaths . While its borders are closed to most travelers at present, we expect a lot of pent-up demand from people in all corners of the world salivating over images of its boundless terrain and return to relative normalcy.\n\nNew York City\n\nIt's a good time to explore New York's fascinating neighborhoods on foot. C. Taylor Crothers/Getty Images\n\nStart spreading the news, reports of New York City's demise have been grossly exaggerated. While the city has no doubt been adversely affected (what place hasn't?) over the last year, the city that never sleeps has high hopes for a better 2021.\n\nA lot of New York's best offerings remain accessible, despite the ongoing pandemic (two major closures still in effect as the new year dawns are Broadway and indoor dining). And while New York City is rarely referred to as an outdoor wonderland, the truth is the best way to experience the city is walking through its distinct neighborhoods, maybe even with a slice of pizza in hand.\n\nOne of the best views of lower Manhattan can be seen while strolling across the Brooklyn Bridge, and New York City's waterfront and parks are always there for you to explore.\n\nSome seminal cultural institutions, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, can be experienced with timed-ticketing -- and without the usual crowds.\n\nTo add to the excitement, there are two highly anticipated luxury hotel openings.\n\nLuxury brand Aman will make its New York debut in the Crown Building on Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, with 83 rooms, a 65-foot swimming pool, Japanese and Italian restaurants, cigar bar and rooftop terrace with views of Central Park, which is just a short stroll away.\n\nAll the way on the West Side, along the Hudson River near the High Line, the new Six Senses New York is slated to open inside The Xi -- two new twisting towers designed by architect Bjarke Ingels. The brand's first North American hotel boasts 136 rooms and suites and a spa spanning 45,000 square fee with a vibroacoustic meditation dome. -- Brekke Fletcher\n\nSingapore\n\nMost travelers don't want to spend any more time in an airport than they have to. But Singapore's Changi is no ordinary airport.\n\nWhile the rest of the world was hunkering down at home, Singaporean locals were paying to hang out at Changi, whether it was co-working in one of the lounges or glamping alongside the world's tallest indoor waterfall at the Changi Jewel , which opened in 2019.\n\nThe coming year is a chance to fall back in love with travel, and a visit to the Lion City should rekindle that romance.\n\nBeyond its spectacular airport, the city-state is home to a UNESCO-listed botanical garden, one-of-a-kind Peranakan culture, and some of the world's most spectacular luxury hotels.\n\nIts food scene is a major highlight -- whether visitors opt for $5 Hainan chicken rice from a hawker stall or $500-per-plate Michelin-starred fine dining, nobody ever goes home hungry. -- Lilit Marcus\n\nSpain\n\nBarcelona has taken time out to reevaluate its tourism offering.

The country has been heavily promoting domestic tourism in recent months, meaning there's been no shortage of new hotel and restaurant openings -- particularly in the capital, Bangkok.\n\nThe city's historic riverside Charoenkrung area recently welcomed two new luxury hotels -- Capella and the Four Seasons Bangkok -- while nearby Yaowarat -- aka Chinatown -- continues to evolve with the addition of wonderfully eclectic bars and boutique hotels. One of our favorites is gallery/bar/restaurant Baan Rim Naam , which sits in a 200 year-old riverside warehouse in the Talad Noi neighborhood.\n\nFor those with their eye on Thailand's south, the government is reportedly considering reopening Maya Bay, which has been closed since 2018 as part of a program aimed at reviving the area's decimated corals.\n\nThough not yet confirmed, the stunning cove made famous by The Beach, the 2000 film starring Leonardo DiCaprio, may welcome visitors in mid-2021, but with strict visitor caps. -- Karla Cripps\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe UK has plenty of beautiful scenery, including the Lake District.

Champagne corks pop in Berlin as gay rights supporters celebrate a historic vote to legalize same-sex marriage Photographs by Andrea Gjestvang for CNN Story by Laura Smith-Spark and Claudia Otto, CNN\n\nBerlin (CNN) — Pouring rain could do nothing to dampen the spirits of scores of people who gathered outside the Bundestag in Berlin on Friday morning, some clutching rainbow umbrellas, to await parliament's vote on a bill legalizing gay marriage in Germany.\n\nAs news came that the bill had passed — convincingly — they broke out into loud cheers, wept tears of joy and exchanged kisses. Some popped champagne corks in celebration despite the early hour.\n\nThis was the day that some had doubted would ever come. And now, in the space of a few days, an offer by Chancellor Angela Merkel to allow lawmakers a free vote on the issue has become all but law.\n\nPeople celebrate outside the Chancellery in Berlin after lawmakers voted to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nOnce Germany's Senate approves the bill next week, as expected, homosexual couples in Germany will have the same rights as heterosexual couples to marry and jointly adopt children — barring any legal challenge.\n\nIt is a very important moment for Germany and for the queer people in Germany, because we fought really long for equality in our rights and now it is time, project manager Andreas Reschke told CNN.\n\nAsked if he had any marriage plans, Reschke laughed and looked at his partner as he responded. Yeah, maybe.\n\nAndreas Reschke kisses his boyfriend after the result was announced.\n\nNico, a 20-year-old student who preferred to give only his first name, said he had traveled with his partner from Dresden, 120 miles away, to be part of the landmark moment and that he was now so happy.\n\nWe woke up very early and we knew it was raining in Berlin, but we thought it is so important we have to come here, he said. It is incredible, I can't believe it. I think (Merkel) said it on Monday and today is Friday and we have a new law.\n\nThe change means his dream of marriage is now possible, he said, as is his hope of one day adopting children.\n\nNico and Jan came to Berlin from Dresden to witness the historic moment.\n\nHannah Klaubert, 26, said it was important to be visible on such a significant day — and that the fight for equality was not over.\n\nThere are still 200 people who voted against (the bill) today, so I think it's going to be important still, said Klaubert, who works for an international non-profit organization.\n\nAnd there are so many other issues like trans-rights and all other kinds of things that are not okay here and that we need to keep on fighting for.\n\nHannah Klabuert hugs her partner.\n\nSpeaking after the bill passed, Merkel — who had until Monday opposed the holding of a free vote on the issue — said she had voted no, but that it had been important to put it to a vote of conscience.\n\nKlaubert said she was unimpressed by the way the Chancellor handled the issue. I think it was just a political, cold-hearted strategy and I really don't like it.\n\nFor Torsten Benzin, a lawyer, the change in the law is hugely significant.\n\nTorsten Benzin said Friday's vote was as monumental a moment as the fall of the USSR.\n\nIt took almost 30 years in Germany, we fought for it and today is the day. For me personally, because I'm from the former GDR, this is as important as the Berlin Wall falling, he said.\n\nI'm already in a partnership and of course, I will now finally change it into a real marriage. This means no longer having to tick boxes on forms to say that he is partnered rather than married, Benzin said, adding: My sexuality is nobody's business.\n\nHe said Merkel had delayed on the issue until her hand was finally forced by pressure from rival political parties ahead of September's elections. I believe that it was a tactical maneuver because she knew, if she didn't do it now, it would be an ever-lasting thing for the next coalition negotiations.\n\nRainy weather didn't stop people from gathering outside the Bundestag in Berlin.\n\nSoftware developer Sebastian Vetter told CNN he had braved the downpour to be part of the historic moment.\n\nIt is important to show we are here, we support gay marriage, marriage equality, marriage for everyone — so that the people there who are giving their vote know we are here and we are proud to be part of the community, he said.\n\nMerkel could have acted on the issue far sooner, Vetter said, but no matter how it happened it just happened. Now we got the chance and we have to use it.\n\nIt is a historical day and yes let's celebrate the whole weekend, said Sebastian Vetter.\n\nWhile he has no immediate plans to get married, Vetter is very happy to now have that option.\n\nLet's see what the future brings, but as we saw in other countries, if there is gender equality people are more aware that people love people and that has nothing to do with their sex or gender.\n\nIt is a step in the right direction to end discrimination.
A model of Explorer 1, America's first satellite, is held by, from left, NASA official William Pickering, scientist James Van Allen and rocket pioneer Wernher von Braun. The team was gathered at a news conference at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington to announce the satellite's successful launch. It had been launched a few hours before, on January 31, 1958.\n\nSurveyor 1 was the first U.S. spacecraft to make a soft landing on the Moon. The program ran during the mid-1960s and was declared a success. The program's focus eventually switched to support of the Apollo program.\n\nOf all the NASA missions, none has visited as many planets, rings and moons as the twin Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft, which were launched in 1977. Each probe is much farther away from Earth and the sun than Pluto. In August 2012, Voyager 1 made the historic entry into interstellar space, the region between stars. Scientists hope to learn more about this region when Voyager 2 reaches interstellar space. Both spacecraft are still sending scientific information back to NASA.\n\nThe Stardust spacecraft was launched on February 7, 1999, from Cape Canaveral, Florida. After traveling 3.5 billion miles (5.6 billion kilometers), the spacecraft made history by capturing images of asteroid Annefrank and collecting samples of comet Wild 2 and successfully returning them to Earth. It also took spectacular images of comet Tempel 1. The probe's mission ended on March 25, 2011, when mission managers put it in safe mode and turned off the transmitter for the last time.\n\nThe Cassini spacecraft ended its mission in 2017. The probe was launched on October 15, 1997, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. It arrived at Saturn on June 30, 2004. The spacecraft dropped a probe called Huygens to the surface of Saturn's moon Titan. It was the first landing on a moon in the outer solar system.\n\nNASA's Deep Impact spacecraft was launched on January 12, 2005, and it traveled 268 million miles (431 million kilometers) to hurl its coffee table-sized probe into comet Tempel 1 on July 4, 2005. This image of Tempel 1 was taken by Deep Impact's camera 67 seconds after the probe hit the comet. Scattered light from the collision saturated the camera's detector and caused the bright splash seen in this image. The Deep Impact mission was supposed to end a few weeks later, but NASA approved an extension and renamed the spacecraft EPOXI and sent it on to fly by Comet Hartley 2 in November 2010. The probe stopped communicating with mission managers in September 2013 and was declared lost.\n\nNASA's Dawn spacecraft began orbiting the dwarf planet Ceres in March. Scientists were surprised by the large white spots shining on Ceres, seen above. On its way to Ceres, Dawn spent time studying the proto-planet Vesta in 2001. Ceres and Vesta are the two most massive bodies in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The mission, launched in 2007, is giving scientists new knowledge of how the solar system formed and evolved.\n\nNASA's infrared-wavelength space telescope called NEOWISE may help make us safer. The space telescope hunts for asteroids and comets, including those that could pose a threat to Earth. During its planned three-year survey through 2016, NEOWISE will identify near-Earth objects, gather data on their size and take other measurements. The probe was launched on December 14, 2009, for its original mission -- to perform an all-sky astronomical survey. The probe was put in hibernation for several years, but it was fired up again in December 2013 to hunt for asteroids. Its images are now available to the public online.\n\nThe Kepler space observatory is the first NASA mission dedicated to finding Earth-size planets in or near the habitable zones of stars. Launched in 2009, Kepler has been detecting planets and planet candidates with a wide range of sizes and orbital distances. Yes, we are still finding new planets.\n\nThis image shows the Curiosity rover doing a test drill on a rock dubbed Bonanza King to see if it would be a good place to dig deeper and take a sample. Curiosity was launched in 2011, and it is the most advanced rover ever built. It's helping scientists determine whether Mars is, or ever was, habitable for life forms.\n\nNo spacecraft had ever gone to Pluto before NASA's New Horizons made its fly-by on July 14, 2015. The probe sent back amazing, detailed images of Pluto and its largest moon, Charon. It also dazzled scientists with new information about Pluto's atmosphere and landscape. New Horizons is still going today, heading out into the Kuiper Belt.\n\nPhilanthropist Yuri Milner, left, and astrophysicist Stephen Hawking host a press conference to announce Breakthrough Starshot on Tuesday, April 12, in New York City.

The proposed Breakthrough Starshot project would send hundreds of nanocraft space probes 4.37 light years away -- at speeds of up to 100 million miles an hour -- to to explore Alpha Centauri, our nearest star system. The ambitious project is many years away from becoming reality.\n\nThis is an artist's concept of the Solar Probe Plus spacecraft approaching the sun.

In the first three months since it began surveying the sky in July, it has found three exoplanets, with the promise of many more ahead.\n\nNASA's Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk mission -- known as the GOLD mission -- will examine the response of the upper atmosphere to force from the sun, the magnetosphere and the lower atmosphere.\n\nBright swaths of red in the upper atmosphere, known as airglow, can be seen in this image from the International Space Station. NASA's ICON mission will observe how interactions between terrestrial weather and a layer of charged particles called the ionosphere create the colorful glow.\n\nThis is an artist's concept of the Europa Clipper spacecraft, which will investigate Jupiter's icy moon.\n\nNASA's Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope, slated to launch in the mid-2020s, has been named the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, after NASA's first chief astronomer.\n\nThis illustration shows NASA's Dragonfly rotorcraft-lander approaching a site on Saturn's exotic moon, Titan. Taking advantage of Titan's dense atmosphere and low gravity, Dragonfly will explore dozens of locations across the icy world, sampling and measuring the compositions of Titan's organic surface materials to characterize the habitability of Titan's environment and investigate the progression of prebiotic chemistry.\n\nSPHEREx, the Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer, will study the beginning and evolution of the universe and determine how common the ingredients for life are within the planetary systems found in our galaxy, the Milky Way. It is targeted to launch in 2024.\n\nStory highlights The NASA GOLD mission launched Thursday from French Guiana\n\n(CNN) —\n\nA NASA mission launched Thursday to explore the zone between Earth's atmosphere and the lowest reaches of space, where key communications satellites orbit amid bright bands of color known as airglow.\n\nDubbed the GOLD mission – for Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk – it is the first NASA science mission to fly an instrument on a commercial communications satellite. It launched at 5:20 p.m. ET today from French Guiana, the agency said.\n\nThe near-space environment is important because it's home to technology that is key to human communication, such as satellites that provide information for GPS systems and radio signals that help guide ships and airplanes.\n\nIt's also where astronauts live on the International Space Station.\n\nThe mission will examine the response of the upper atmosphere to force from the sun, the magnetosphere and the lower atmosphere. Learning more about the ionosphere, part of Earth's upper atmosphere where the sun's radiation collides with gas that breaks into electrons and ions, is key. This dynamic environment is always changing and could easily garble radio signals coming through our atmosphere. The mission will be able to see how exactly it affects our day-to-day life.\n\nGOLD will seek to understand what drives change in this region where terrestrial weather in the lower atmosphere interacts with the tumult of solar activity from above and Earth's magnetic field, NASA said in a statement. Resulting data will improve forecasting models of space weather events that can impact life on Earth, as well as satellites and astronauts in space.\n\nAny research gained by this mission, led by the University of Central Florida, will help protect assets in the near-space zone, which extends several hundred miles from Earth's surface, NASA said.\n\nFor years, scientists have been able to study Earth's upper atmosphere in detail, using ground-based observations as well as low-Earth-orbit missions. But they were missing the bigger picture.\n\nThe GOLD mission, situated in geostationary orbit over the Western Hemisphere, will take a global scan of the ionosphere and upper atmosphere every half-hour, allowing scientists to get a complete look at the temperature and weather of that region, which they've never had before. This continued observation has the capability to last for years.\n\nRichard Eastes, principal investigator for the GOLD mission, said that the constant monitoring will allow for observations of other phenomena, such as the effects of solar flares.\n\nThe mission is also studying a relatively new area of scientific research. Previously, it was believed that the upper atmosphere was affected primarily by the sun's radiation, which creates space weather. But there is growing evidence that it's also affected by what's going on below, like the weather on Earth.\n\nTsunamis create waves in the air, and they move upwards, which could cause changes at the boundary between Earth and space, said Sarah Jones, GOLD mission scientist. GOLD is studying how to tease out effects of sun above and Earth below.\n\nGOLD will work directly in concert with another mission launching this year: ICON, the Ionospheric Connection Explorer.\n\nGOLD will capture the global perspective from 22,000 miles above Earth's surface, while ICON will capture a closer view from within the upper atmosphere itself, 350 miles above Earth.

Collins: I think Obamacare ruling will be overturned\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe House adopted the second part of a rules package Friday proposed by Democrats that shapes the way the House will conduct business over the next two years.\n\nThe legislation creates a select committee to improve and modernize Congress and was passed with overwhelming support, 418-12.\n\nThe vast majority of the rules package was adopted on Thursday but in a largely party-line vote, with only three Republicans joining Democrats to pass it. That's because the package backs Democratic priorities, such as defending Obamacare in court and creating a select committee on climate change.\n\nHere are a few of the provisions in the overall rules package:\n\nRequires the text of a bill to be public for 72 hours before the House votes on it.\n\nMakes slight changes to the names of the Oversight and Education committees.\n\nRequires support from a majority of Democrats for a motion to vacate the speaker, rather than just one lawmaker.\n\nExpedites consideration of measures with broad bipartisan support.\n\nCreates a bipartisan select committee to modernize and improve Congress.\n\nAllows Congress to suspend the debt limit by passing a budget – also known as the Gephardt Rule.\n\nBans discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nAllows people to wear religious headgear in the House chamber.\n\nRequires a pay-as-you-go provision, designed to make it harder for legislation to pass if it raises the budget deficit or reduces the surplus (the rule can be waived).\n\nBans members of Congress and employees from sitting on corporate boards.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments from Friday.

Hill: I just do what I think is right\n\nDemocratic Congressional candidate Katie Hill speaks to supporters at her election night party in California's 25th Congressional district on November 6, 2018 in Santa Clarita, California.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nWhen Katie Hill opened the heavy wooden door to her new congressional office in the Longworth House Office Building, one feeling smacked her in the gut.\n\nWell, this doesn't feel like me, recalled the freshman congresswoman from California's 25th District.\n\nSo yeah, this very formal place being my home base does feel strange, she added. I don't want to become more formal. That's not on the table.\n\nHill argues her life doesn't allow her to embrace any of the formal trappings of Washington. Raised in suburban Los Angeles, she prefers sneakers to heels. She's a Democrat and the daughter of a Republican police officer and survived a sexual assault. Socially conscious, she married a man but identifies as bisexual.\n\nThe thrust of her career has been in non-profits, as an advocate for the homeless. She also embraces the sexist criticism, known as resting bitch face, about a serious woman (like her) not smiling while thinking.\n\nThis isn't the sort of resume or life story that typically precedes a seat in Congress, but that's just fine with Hill and the voters who elected her. An unconventional woman, the 31-year-old joins the 116th Congress, the most diverse legislature in history by many measures — gender, race and sexual orientation.\n\nRefusing to change is part of the internal feedback loop in Hill's first days in Washington.\n\nSometimes in the middle of an unreal day, you just really need to hug your mom.\n\n\n\nWe're about to be sworn in. Let's do this. pic.twitter.com/8zmyMbgvb9 — Rep. Katie Hill (@RepKatieHill) January 3, 2019\n\nA grassroots candidate\n\nHill won with an insurgent campaign spurred by the 2016 election. She channeled her anger at the victory of President Donald Trump by taking aim at her congressman, Rep. Steve Knight, who voted with fellow House Republicans in May 2017 to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Who is going to run against him? Hill typed out on her social media accounts. A friend said, Why not you?\n\nWhy not, thought Hill.\n\nA year and a half later, Hill flipped the suburban Los Angeles district for Democrats. The first-time candidate had started her grassroots campaign out of a rented apartment backed by a hoodie-wearing millennial staff, chain-sipping La Croix sparkling water. The team raised more than $8 million without taking a cent in corporate or special interest money.\n\nHill won over voters as a progressive advocate for affordable housing while offering a pragmatic willingness to work across party lines for her purple district. Trying to fit into Washington is not why Hill was elected nor does it sit anywhere on her agenda.\n\nPlaying nice isn't really something that's in my vocabulary, she said. I just do what I think is right.\n\nDemanding to be heard\n\nThat philosophy may sound quaint, even naive, for Washington, but Hill believes that's the shared sentiment among the incoming freshmen congressional class.\n\nA record-setting 127 women were elected to the 116th Congress, the majority of whom are Democrats. More African Americans, Latinos and LGBTQ members now serve in Congress. The legislature also saw its median age drop by approximately a decade with its newly elected members.\n\nPHOTO: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images Katie Hill laughs as Nancy Pelosi's granddaughter reacts to votes for Pelosi to become Speaker of the House.\n\nHill is notable for her youth as well as being California's first openly bisexual woman elected to Congress. But it's the sheer size of the freshman class, at 92 new members with 46 flipped seats in the 2018 midterm election, that's politically powerful to her.\n\nTraditionally, new legislators have been expected to wait their turn while more seasoned members drove the agenda. But this time, and in this age, the newbies are demanding their voices be heard.\n\nI think we have enough power and enough strength in numbers and enough of a strong mandate from voters that we're going to be able to continue to stay true to the things that we ran on, said Hill, who was elected to the Democratic House leadership team as one of two new members representing freshmen.\n\nPHOTO: Win McNamee/Getty Images Katie Hill, right, poses with other members of the newly elected Democratic House Leadership team in November.\n\nThe result, she hopes, will be in them governing differently.\n\nA new agenda and attitude\n\nTop of Hill's agenda is focusing on a more equitable system, from health care to taxes to housing. Hill believes the biggest problem with Washington has been the billionaire class being controlled by special interest donors and ignoring the needs of the politically powerless.\n\nWe are regular, middle class people, said Hill, the now third-youngest member of Congress (behind Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Iowa's Abby Finkenauer.)\n\nWe're young. We look like and speak like the people that we're there to represent. We're not people who came up through the political process. The majority of us are first-time candidates. We're not stuck in the old way of doing things, she said.\n\nThis Freshman class is larger, younger, and more diverse than ever before and that's not a coincidence – it's a call to action.\n\n\n\nYesterday @JoeNeguse and I were elected to be the Co-Representatives to Leadership for this historic class and we are so ready to get to work. pic.twitter.com/GZv3FUElNe — Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) November 29, 2018\n\nHill spoke to CNN as she made the flight to Washington from Burbank, California, inviting us to chronicle her journey from candidate to congresswoman-elect to swearing in.\n\nA millennial, Hill embraces the sharing philosophy of her generation via social media and speaks easily with reporters as cameras roll. She's shared on Twitter and Facebook her personal stories about surviving sexual assault and an unplanned pregnancy that ended in a miscarriage. In her unconventional political ads, she went rock climbing.\n\nAs Hill checked in for the 6:45 a.m. flight, she remarked, I've never lived outside of California or traveled with so many bags. For the record, there were three suitcases.\n\nShe wore athletic clothing for the flight, noticing then, under the bright fluorescent lights of the ticket counter, that her black pants were covered in her dog's white hair. Oh well, she said, as she walked towards airport security. Her goal, she said, is to demystify Congress by bringing her voters with her on this journey and through her entire term, dog hair and all.\n\nI think what I, and many of the other freshmen have, what's kind of unique, is this sort of ability to relate to people in a different way.\n\nI left my house in SoCal and it was 37 degrees, landed in DC and it's more than 50 degrees here!

She talked about what committees she hoped to join to best represent her district, a sprawling community with suburban middle-class families and lower-income desert communities, and doesn't plan on slowing down the tweets.\n\n'There's going to be fights'\n\nHill signed the lease at her new home – a small, no frills, two-bedroom apartment that gives off a corporate, temporary housing sensibility. It's there she caught up with her roommate and fellow freshman, Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois. Nearly the same age, the congresswomen initially give off a bubbly vibe of moving into a college dorm.\n\nYou can only have tough dinner table conversations if you first get the dinner table! 😂\n\n\n\n@LUnderwood630 is the best Ikea partner I could imagine — the true test of roommate compatibility!

She is now the youngest black woman to ever serve in Congress. We don't walk in and everything automatically changes.\n\nI would imagine there will be confrontations, said Hill. There's going to be fights between the old guard and the new one. But I feel very optimistic that the existing leadership all want us to be part of this process. They recognize the change that's happening, and they're trying to include us.\n\nPHOTO: Kyung Lah/CNN The nameplate for Rep. Katie Hill outside her office on Capitol Hill.\n\nOn inauguration morning, a crush of cameras greeted Hill, swarming around her as she tried to enter the Capitol to be sworn in.\n\nIt feels good.

Soldiers on Gabon state TV read a statement saying they have seized control of the government on Monday, January 7, 2019.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe government in Gabon says the situation is under control and that rebels there have been arrested after military officers seized state media and announced they had leadership of the country.\n\nThe officers declared their dissatisfaction with President Ali Bongo and said they had seized power to restore democracy in the Central African nation.\n\nHowever, government spokesman Guy-Bertrand Mapangou told French news outlet RFI that defense forces have now taken back control of state TV and radio.\n\nIt seems it was a group of troublemakers because military officials say they weren't aware of this group, Mapangou said, adding that four have been arrested and that a fifth is on the run.\n\nMany foreign missions have condemned Monday's coup attempt.\n\nIn a video which circulated on social media appearing to show the events, several officers stood in a radio studio dressed in military fatigues.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nA man, who described himself as commander of the Republican Guard and president of the Patriotic Movement of the young security forces of Gabon, said in a lengthy statement that there has been a decline in the President's health and in his presidential capacities. He said, as two men dressed as officers stood behind him with guns, that the Patriotic Movement would preserve the integrity of the nation.\n\nThe officer said it was disappointed by Bongo's message on December 31 from Morocco where he is recovering from a stroke. Bongo has been battling ill health since October and acknowledged the speculation about his health during his New Year's speech while reiterating that he was recovering.\n\nAfrican Union's Commission chair, Moussa Faki Mahamat, said the AU totally rejects all unconstitutional change of power.\n\nThe @_AfricanUnion strongly condemns the coup attempt this morning in #Gabon.

I'm going to have to step up my car game, I guess.\n\nNot just yet. The former North Carolina gunslinger honored a pledge to Bears general manager Ryan Pace, who asked him on draft night to take the sedan to Halas Hall.\n\nHey, you gotta promise me one thing, you gotta promise me one thing, OK? Pace said, per MMQB.com's Emily Kaplan. You're going to drive your beat-up car here. Don't change a thing with it.\n\nTrubisky obliged. Everyone eats tales of the young hotshot staying humble and remembering his roots, but don't hold it against him if/when he eventually purchases a newer car.\n\n[Chicago Bears]
(CNN) The one sure bet from Tuesday's US Senate runoff elections in Georgia is that they will produce a Senate precariously balanced between the two parties, accelerating a fundamental change that is simultaneously making the institution more volatile and more rigid.\n\nEven if Republicans win both races, they will control the Senate majority with only 52 seats. If Democrats win both, they will eke out a 50-50 Senate majority with the tie-breaking vote of incoming Vice President Kamala Harris. A split would produce a 51-49 GOP majority.\n\nThat slim range of possibilities underscores a key change in the structure of Senate elections: With each party now consistently dominating elections up and down the ballot across a larger swath of states, it has become much tougher for either to amass a commanding Senate majority.\n\nThe fact that neither side will control more than 52 seats after Tuesday means that either party has held at least 55 Senate seats in only three congressional sessions since 2000. By contrast, in the previous 20-year span, one party reached 55 seats or more in seven congressional sessions. In fact, the meager three majorities of 55 seats or more since 2000 represent the fewest times that any party has accumulated at least 55% of the Senate seats over a 20-year span since the turn of the 20th century, according to official Senate records.\n\nThe inability of either side to build a big cushion has contributed to a historic level of volatility in Senate control, with neither party holding the majority for more than eight consecutive years since 1980, a span of turnover unprecedented in American history.\n\nThe narrow majorities have also contributed to a Senate that has grown more rigid, with much more partisan conflict and less of the ad hoc bipartisan deal-making that characterized the body through the second half of the 20th century. The Senate will mark a new high -- or low -- in its rising partisanship on Wednesday when about a quarter or more of Republican senators will vote against recognizing Democrat Joe Biden's election as president, despite the complete inability of President Donald Trump to present any credible evidence of fraud.\n\nCounterintuitively, narrow majorities are bad for bipartisanship, because when control of the majority is constantly within reach in the next election it gives the side that is out of power less incentive to cooperate and more incentive to obstruct, to make the party that is in power look bad. Adam Jentleson, author of Kill Switch\n\nDespite that ominous start, some observers believe that the narrow Senate division certain to emerge from Tuesday's election will encourage a return to bipartisan deal-making, like the agreement between centrist Republican and Democratic senators that helped break the months-long stalemate over Covid economic relief legislation.\n\nThe closeness of it, I think, is good for the center, and I think it's good for Joe Biden because he's a product of the center, says John Breaux, a former centrist Democratic senator from Louisiana who is now a Washington lobbyist. Biden understands the Senate. He grew up in the Senate; he knows that you have to talk to both sides. So I think the closeness of it -- whether it's 52-48 or 50-50 or 51-49 -- is probably good for him and good for the country, because he is going to know how to deal in that type of a Senate.\n\nBut other observers note that the narrow Senate majorities of recent years have, in practice, produced very few bipartisan compromises. Instead, they say the slim advantages -- and regular shifts in control -- have intensified the chamber's growing partisanship. With control constantly at risk, the majority party faces heightened pressure for lockstep unity, while the minority party never has much incentive to help the majority burnish its record with bipartisan accomplishments that could buttress its advantage in the next election.\n\nCounterintuitively, narrow majorities are bad for bipartisanship, because when control of the majority is constantly within reach in the next election it gives the side that is out of power less incentive to cooperate and more incentive to obstruct, to make the party that is in power look bad, says Adam Jentleson, a former Democratic Senate leadership aide who's the author of the book Kill Switch, a critical analysis of the modern Senate due to be published next week.\n\nDemise of split-ticket voting\n\nWhatever the results of Tuesday's Georgia elections between Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler and Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock , respectively, those polarizing dynamics are guaranteed to remain in force, because the party that falls into the minority now will remain close enough to immediately begin plotting how to recapture the majority in 2022. (The partisan pressures will be magnified because the Democrats' slim margin in the House of Representatives guarantees that chamber will be in play in 2022 as well.)\n\nThe modern inability of either side to build a big advantage over the other in the upper chamber is rooted above all in the solidifying connection between Senate and presidential outcomes, a factor that is also central to the body's escalating partisan hostilities. The huge Democratic Senate majorities that persisted from the late 1950s through the mid-1990s were rooted in the party's continued dominance of Senate seats from Southern states that routinely voted Republican for president, notes Sarah Binder, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. But over the past generation, it has become much more difficult for either party to win Senate seats in states that usually vote the other way in presidential elections.\n\nThat powerful dynamic is grounded in the shrinking share of voters who split their tickets, voting for one party in the presidential contest and another in Senate races. As recently as 2008, six Senate candidates (five Democrats and Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine) won election in states that supported the other side's presidential candidate. In 2012, four Democrats and Republican Dean Heller of Nevada won Senate races in states that voted the other way for president.\n\nFrom left, Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff and Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler.\n\nBut in 2016, for the first time since the direct election of senators around World War I, the same party won the Senate and the presidential race in every state. That previously unprecedented pattern virtually repeated in 2020, with every Senate race tracking the presidential outcome in that state except in Maine, where Collins won reelection despite Biden's comfortable victory there. Though Democrats shattered fundraising records for Senate challengers in Iowa, South Carolina, Montana, North Carolina, Texas and Kentucky, all of those candidates fell short in states that Trump carried; almost all of them drew virtually the same share of the vote as Biden.\n\nOver that same period, almost all of the senators in both parties who had won their split-ticket victories in the 2008 and 2012 presidential races lost their seats in the next midterm elections (2014 and 2018, respectively). The result has been to deepen the overlap between states' presidential leans and their Senate choices -- and in the process reduce the maximum number of seats each side can win under all but the most unusual circumstances.\n\nThe return of GOP South and decline in split-ticket voting and increased nationalization of US politics generally explains a good amount of the decline in Senate majority margins in recent decades, notes Binder.\n\nSen. Susan Collins\n\nThe solidifying connection between presidential and Senate results provides Republicans a small, but significant, advantage in the battle for control of the chamber. Over the past two presidential elections, 20 states have voted both times against Trump; Democrats now hold fully 39 of their 40 Senate seats, all but Collins' in Maine. But 25 states have voted both times for Trump, and Republicans now hold 47 of their 50 seats, all but Joe Manchin's in West Virginia, Jon Tester's in Montana and Sherrod Brown's in Ohio.\n\nIn the five states (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) that backed Trump in 2016 but switched to Biden in 2020, Democrats now hold six Senate seats and Republicans two, pending the results in Georgia on Tuesday. But the GOP dominance of the Senate seats from the states that lean Republican at the presidential level leaves Democrats with a very narrow path to a Senate majority.\n\nDisincentive to compromise\n\nWith Senate results now so tightly correlated to presidential outcomes and most states leaning reliably toward one side or the other in the race for the White House, the battle for Senate control has become a kind of grinding trench warfare. Since 2000, either party has reached at least 55 Senate seats in only three congressional sessions: Republicans held 55 after President George W. Bush's reelection in 2004, while Democrats reached 59 after President Barack Obama's first victory in 2008 and 55 after his second in 2012. (For a time in 2009, Democrats reached 60 seats when Republican Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania switched sides to join them.)\n\nIn sharp contrast, from 1981 through 2000, Democrats held at least 55 seats in four sessions, while Republicans reached that level of control in three. From 1961 through 1980, Democrats -- still bolstered by their virtually unchallenged dominance of the South -- held at least 55 seats in nine of the 10 sessions. One party also controlled at least 55% of the Senate seats (which were fewer than 100 at that point because there were fewer states) in eight of the 10 congressional sessions from 1921 through 1940 and seven of the 10 from 1901 through 1920. Only the 1950s saw anything like today's precarious balances: While Democrats controlled at least 55% of the seats four times from 1941 to 1950, neither side reached that level through four consecutive sessions beginning in 1951, until Democrats broke through with big gains in the 1958 election.\n\nLooking at the trend from the opposite direction completes the picture. Unless Republicans win both of Tuesday's runoffs, the party controlling the Senate will hold a majority of two seats or fewer. That would mark the fifth time since 2000 that the majority party held such a narrow advantage. Again, in stark contrast, the majority party never held an advantage that slim in any congressional session from 1961 through 1999. Only three times from 1901 through 1950 was the majority so narrow. The only real comparison is the 1950s, when no more than two seats separated the two sides in those four consecutive Congresses from 1951 through 1958.\n\nBack then, narrow Senate majorities encouraged bipartisan deal-making between Lyndon Johnson, the titanic Democratic Senate leader, and Republicans such as Everett Dirksen -- as well as President Dwight Eisenhower. But that was in an era when each party was so starkly split between liberal and conservative wings (including very conservative Southern Democrats and liberal Northeast Republicans) that scholars wrote of four-party politics in Congress.\n\nIn today's more polarized politics -- with each party much more ideologically homogenous than in earlier generations -- the narrow Senate majorities appear to be having the opposite effect. Again, the growing correlation between presidential and Senate outcomes may be a key factor in the shift. Pending the Georgia results, only three senators in each party represent states that supported the other side's presidential candidate this year. That means the vast majority of Democratic senators have a strong electoral incentive to support Biden --and the vast majority of Republican senators have a comparable incentive to oppose him.\n\nThe alignment of Senate representation with presidential outcomes is a very real phenomenon and it means that senators have even less political incentive to cross the aisle, says Jentleson. If a Republican senator comes from a red state, which almost all of them do, their constituents don't want to see them cooperate with Biden and they please their constituents and help ensure their own reelection by obstructing him.\n\nI don't think I would draw a direct line from the size of the majority to the prospect that ... we will have greater bipartisanship. We are in a system ... that really works against the emergence of centrist-driven decisions. Sarah Binder, senior fellow in governance studies, Brookings Institutio\n\nBreaux, the former Democratic senator, believes the narrow balance of power can overcome that centrifugal pressure by providing small groups of relatively centrist deal-makers from each party the leverage to build majority legislative coalitions. Regardless of which party controls the chamber, Breaux predicts that ad hoc gangs of centrist senators committed to working together on key issues can determine the terms of agreements that can pass.\n\nYou can form coalitions starting in the middle and then moving out on each side until you create a majority, he says. And that way you can leave the far left and the far right ... off the train but you can put together a majority starting in the center.\n\nBut Jentleson and Binder believe that any such centrist-driven agreements are likely to remain far more the exception than the rule, no matter how narrow a majority emerges from Tuesday's Georgia vote.\n\nI don't think I would draw a direct line from the size of the majority to the prospect that 'gangs' will emerge and we will have greater bipartisanship, Binder says. We are in a system ... that really works against the emergence of centrist-driven decisions.\n\nThat is the paradox of a modern Senate in which the parties are simultaneously more evenly matched and more bitterly divided -- much like the country that it serves.
How can I pay off six-figure student loans while earning my PhD, living in an expensive city and trying to adopt a child? --Derion\n\nIt's tough for students to plan for the future while wrestling with student loan debt. But with careful strategy, it's not impossible.\n\nThere are a few steps you can take to help lighten the burden.\n\nStep 1: Contact your loan provider\n\nYou can use the fact that you're still in school to your advantage. If you're at least a part-time student, you can apply for loan deferment, explains certified financial planner Bill Simonet of Simonet Financial Group.\n\nWhile your loan is deferred, you won't have to make payments until you graduate. And some loans offer a six-month grace period, giving you time after graduation to get settled before your first payment is due. Loan deferment usually occurs automatically when you enroll in a degree program, but you can also apply through the Department of Education's website.\n\nWhen graduation nears, you should choose a repayment plan that works for your lifestyle, says Marguerita Cheng, a certified financial planner at Blue Ocean Global Wealth. Federal student loan providers offer a variety of options, including income-based plans which cap monthly payments at 15% of your income. If your circumstances change, you can always choose a new plan.\n\nStep 2: Tackle interest payments\n\nOnce you've deferred your loans, it can be tempting to ignore them until your payments kick in. But that could make your monthly bills higher down the line, because you could still be racking up interest before your first payment is due.\n\nUnsubsidized loans begin accruing interest the moment you take them out. In contrast, the federal government pays off the interest on subsidized loans while you're in school, in loan deferment, or in a grace period.\n\nTo minimize the post-graduation headache, consider at least paying down the interest on unsubsidized loans while you're in school, suggests Jaime Quinones, a CFP based in New Jersey.\n\nQuinones also suggests holding off on consolidating your loans, since it can be hard to predict where life will take you after graduation. If you consolidate now, you may not be able to apply for income-driven repayment plans or loan forgiveness later.\n\nStill, consolidation can help if your interest rates are unbearable. This is especially true if you can structure a 10 or 15 year pay-down schedule, explains Simonet.\n\nStep 3: Consider working part time\n\nA part-time job can help ease your financial burdens while you're in school. That extra income can be used to cover student loan payments, living expenses and personal goals -- or in Derion's case, adoption expenses.\n\nSimonet suggests Uber or Lyft, bartending, or working as a server or a graduate assistant. You could also inquire about work study programs at your university or other on-campus job opportunities.\n\nStep 4: Look for employers that offer repayment benefits\n\nAfter graduation, you could consider applying for a job that offers student loan repayment benefits. A small but growing number of employers are starting to offer the perk to attract young workers.\n\nMany savvy employers know the burden of student loans is real and have found that offering repayment programs is an excellent way to attract the talent they need, explains Jeffrey Sturgis, a CFP at Brightstone Advisors.\n\nYou could also apply for a job at a government agency, where you might be eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. This program promises to forgive any remaining student debt as long as you've been making payments on time for 10 years. But the program has come under scrutiny in recent months and could soon be going away.\n\nStep 5: Lean on family\n\nIt can be hard to ask mom and dad for help when you're starting your own life. But family members might be willing to loan you money at a low interest rate -- or for no interest at all.\n\nThe reward for the parent or grandparent is seeing the relief and genuine appreciation in their family member's eyes and the satisfaction of knowing they made a real difference in their life, explains Sturgis.\n\nHave a question about your money?

Saudi Arabia is winding down a spectacular crackdown into alleged corruption after agreeing to release one of its highest profile suspects and recovering billions of dollars in cash and much more in real estate.\n\nPrince Alwaleed bin Talal, a billionaire global investor with stakes in Citigroup (C), Twitter (TWTR) and Apple (AAPL), was released on Saturday. The conditions of his freedom are unclear, and the country's ministry of information said it would not comment on his situation.\n\nIn a surprise move in November, Saudi authorities arrested dozens of royals, businessmen and senior government officials and held many of them at the lavish Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh.\n\nWe are at a very final stage of the Ritz-Carlton situation. Hopefully it's going to be days before the hotel opens up, Economy Minister Mohammed Al-Tuwaijri told CNNMoney's emerging markets editor John Defterios.\n\nThe 5-star hotel is taking online reservations from February 14.\n\nAlwaleed's detention, and the crackdown as a whole, rattled investors.\n\nJust days earlier, the hotel had hosted a conference dubbed 'Davos in the Desert' where 3,500 business leaders and government officials met to discuss the kingdom's ambitious Vision 2030 plan to diversify away from oil.\n\nRelated: 6 ways life in Saudi Arabia will change in 2018\n\nNow the Saudi government is preparing a roadshow starting in February to explain the episode in the hope of encouraging investors to commit cash in support of the economic transformation.\n\nWe will be talking to investors, regulators and whoever is interested in our plan and Vision 2030, Al-Tuwaijri said. It's more clarity about the process, the governance around it. Why it's being done and how it's being done.\n\nOther suspects were released earlier after agreeing to settlements including the exchange of assets and cash. Authorities said those who don't settle will face trial.\n\nAlwaleed told Reuters on Saturday that there were no charges against him and that he was in discussions with the government. His company, Kingdom Holding did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nShares in Kingdom Holding soared 10% on trading on Sunday, reversing almost all the losses posted since Alwaleed's detention in November.\n\nRelated: Saudi Arabia ends 35-year ban on movie theaters\n\nSaudi Arabia said in November that corrupt practices by Saudi royals and officials have cost the kingdom at least $100 billion over decades and it planned to recover that amount.\n\nAl-Tuwaijri said that target was realistic.\n\nBut most of these assets will be in some form of illiquid assets -- real estate, structured instruments and so on and so forth. It will take its course to recover, Al-Tuwaijri added.\n\nFinance Minister Mohammed Al Jadaan said last week that the government had already recovered some cash and plans to use some of it to fund handouts for the 70% of Saudi nationals who are state employees.\n\nA senior Saudi official told CNN that the government had also seized 1.4 billion square meters of land.

Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger called their actions, which included breaking windows, invading the House and Senate floors and other violent behavior, a coup attempt.\n\nBesides President Trump himself, a portion of the responsibility for this attack on our democracy also rests on the shoulders of Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive, and to a lesser extent, on Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and other tech executives whose platforms have allowed Trump and his allies and supporters to spread malicious untruths about the 2020 election.\n\nWith the horrifying images of a Capitol under siege still glowing on most of our screens and amid pressure from groups like the NAACP, Anti-Defamation League and Free Press, it comes as little surprise that on Wednesday, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube all took action on Trump's posts.\n\nFacebook and YouTube both removed Trump's video addressing supporters earlier Wednesday, in which he urged them to go home but reiterated his debunked claims about election fraud. Twitter initially restricted retweets and disabled likes and replies to the video, but later r emoved it along with several other tweets . Then for the first time, Twitter locked Trump's account for 12 hours and said it might be banned altogether -- which stopped short of a call from the NAACP president, issued through a spokesperson, to ban his account entirely.\n\nAll of these actions come too late. One reason that things got so out of hand in the first place is because Twitter didn't shut Trump's account down sooner. I warned even before Trump took office that the way he won the 2016 presidential election was largely by sharing information that was untrue on Twitter. The platform, of course, allowed Trump to bypass the traditional media, which would have fact checked him, and make claims that were patently false . Trump continued to do this throughout his presidency . And because no one was willing to shut him down (@jack, I'm looking at you), he only became more emboldened.\n\nSocial networks should have held Trump to the same standards as other users from the start. The first few times he shared mistruths or used abusive language, his posts should have been immediately removed and he should have been issued warnings. If he then continued to share misinformation or hate, his accounts should have been permanently suspended. If this had happened, our Capitol might never have come under siege.\n\nBut because he wasn't held to account, Trump's claims grew more dangerous over time. According to The Washington Post's fact checkers, Trump initially made an average of 12 false claims per day, so it took him 827 days in office to reach 10,000 false claims. But it took him just 440 days more to reach 20,000 false claims -- an average of 23 per day.\n\nIn addition to lying more as he realized he could get away with it, he also began to use more abusive language. As Helio Fred Garcia wrote in his 2020 book Words on Fire: The Power of Incendiary Language and How to Confront It, over time, the frequency and intensity of Trump's language (on social media as well as in speeches and with the media) changed. Without anyone or anything to stop it ... he became more aggressive and his language more directly incendiary when discrediting his political rivals. And, predictably, Garcia noted, after Trump insulted members of different groups, hate crimes against them spiked. So, let's be clear: This is not the first time he has incited violence.\n\nOf course, many of Trump's tweets violated the rules Twitter applies to other users. But when Twitter was asked why it allowed Trump to tweet, for example, veiled death threats against North Korea's leader and foreign minister in 2017, the platform said he enjoys an exemption for being newsworthy. As I argued back then , no one should be allowed to abuse Twitter's platform, no matter how powerful they are.\n\nYet, because he enjoyed this impunity, Trump was able to build a base on Twitter that actually believes his mistruths. Now, the problem is that we have a huge number of citizens who falsely think the election was stolen and stormed the Capitol as a result.\n\nIn regard to the ongoing situation in Washington, DC, we are working proactively to protect the health of the public conversation occurring on the service and will take action on any content that violates the Twitter Rules, Twitter said on Wednesday. If Wednesday's events show us anything, it's that this kind of approach is antiquated at best and dangerously naïve at worst. It's too little, too late.\n\nWhile shuttering Trump's Twitter account now would make it too late to alter today's disturbing threat to democracy, we still need to prevent this from happening again anywhere. Being a world leader should not exempt anyone from being required to follow the community standards that apply to other Twitter users. No one should use the platform to spread hate and misinformation. Jack Dorsey should change this policy today.\n\nFacebook, for its part, called the rioting a disgrace, but also declined on Tuesday to shutter Trump's account. That's also a mistake.\n\nIn a televised address, President-elect Biden called on Trump to go on television and shut down the protesters -- a sentiment that was echoed by many others on Twitter, including Alyssa Farah, his former communications director. The problem is that these calls, however well intentioned, reinvested Trump with too much power, signaling that a single statement from him could end the insurrection.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nIt's true that Trump probably did have the power to end this faster and more bloodlessly with a single tweet or address than was possible through any other channel. But our democracy can't hinge on the claims of a single person who lies and incites violence. We have to be stronger than this. We need institutions that keep us safe and ensure a peaceful transfer of power -- including the Congress, which clearly needs better security. And we need social networks that don't spread hate and lies.\n\nWhile all eyes have been on Trump this afternoon, they should also turn to Jack Dorsey, who holds extraordinary power to help prevent future attacks on our democracy. In the long term, it's social media platforms who have to make the next move.
Uber and Airbnb were founded around the same time and helped kickstart what is sometimes called the sharing economy.\n\nNow, Airbnb's CEO Brian Chesky is watching as his peer deals with one crisis after another.\n\nWhen asked about the struggles of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, Chesky framed the issue as being partly the result of young tech executives learning on the job.\n\nI think that all of us are on our leadership journeys frankly. I know Travis is. I've been on mine myself. i think we are all learning, Chesky said Monday at event hosted by The Economic Club of New York.\n\nI think there's a benefit to young people like us starting companies, Chesky added. We can come up with novel ideas. But it also means we are learning on the jobs.\n\nUber is currently conducting an urgent investigation in response to a former employee who went public with allegations of sexism and harassment at the company.\n\nUber customers also took issue with Kalanick's decision to serve on Trump's business advisory council. And Kalanick was caught on camera arguing with an Uber driver.\n\nRelated: Uber investors blast company culture\n\nI must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up, Kalanick said in a statement after the video surfaced last week.\n\nWe need mentors, Chesky said at the event Monday, noting that he has reached out in the past to business leaders like Warren Buffett and Sheryl Sandberg.\n\nUber is now in the process of searching for a COO to help Kalanick run the business, just as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg did by hiring Sandberg in 2008.\n\nChesky says he has not spoken to Kalanick about his challenges, but spoke favorably of the steps Kalanick has taken so far.\n\nI think he's doing everything he probably should be at this point, which is to say he's owned up to every problem, Chesky said. Every time there's a challenge that broke out, he apologized, he's owned it and he seems to have established a step forward.\n\nUber and Airbnb are now the two most valuable U.S. tech startups, respectively -- and neither appears to plan on going public anytime soon.\n\nOur investors are very patient. None of them are anxiously waiting for us to go public, Chesky said of Airbnb during the interview, which took place at -- of all places -- the New York Stock Exchange. At least right now we can take big bets as a private company.\n\nAirbnb closed a $1 billion round of funding last week, giving it even more runway to stay private longer.

Yet her career went well beyond that, from her brilliant performance in the movie Ordinary People to her influence as a co-founder of MTM with then-husband Grant Tinker, a TV production powerhouse that produced not only Mary Tyler Moore but many signature programs, including St. Elsewhere, Hill Street Blues and multiple spinoffs from her program, such as Lou Grant and Rhoda.\n\nTinker, the former NBC chairman, died in November, and the loss of both of them in such short order almost feels like the end of a TV era.\n\nHaving started as a dancer – and been featured solely for her legs as the secretary whose face was never seen in the 1950s show Richard Diamond, Private Detective – Moore had to overcome skepticism at the time that a beautiful actress (someone who could famously turn the world on with her smile, as the song went) could also be funny. Her series, moreover, marked a breakthrough in terms of depicting a working woman, one who was single, dated but devoted to her career.\n\nPhotos: Remembering Mary Tyler Moore PHOTO: Bettmann/Getty Images Actress Mary Tyler Moore, whose 1970s TV show helped usher in a new era for women on television, died Wednesday, January 25, her longtime representative Mara Buxbaum said. Moore was 80 years old. The Mary Tyler Moore Show debuted in 1970 and starred the actress as Mary Richards, a single career woman at a Minneapolis TV station. The series was hailed as the first modern woman's sitcom. Photos: Remembering Mary Tyler Moore PHOTO: CBS/Getty Images Moore came to fame in The Dick Van Dyke Show, a sitcom that ran from 1961-1966.

While Moore was surrounded by a one-for-the-ages cast, she more than held her own, including what many consider one of the greatest sitcom episodes ever, where Moore's character – after admonishing her co-workers for joking about it – breaks into uncontrollable laughter during a funeral for Chuckles the Clown.\n\nMoore continued to work regularly – in television and on stage – after those shows, while earning plaudits for her work as an advocate for various causes, including diabetes research.\n\nThe memories that linger, though, will for most stem from the glow she brought to the screen in the 1960s and '70s. And thanks to those shows, that hat she tossed skyward during the credits of her eponymous series will never come down.
GO WITH AFP STORY by Desiree Martin A picture taken on April 12, 2013 shows plants of marijuana at the plantation of the Sibaratas Med Can association in Mogan on the southwest coast of the island of Gran Canaria. The plants grow from cuttings for approximately two months and then blossom before being harvested, dried, stored in jars for a month and later processed to be consumed on site. Spanish law prohibits the possession of soft drugs like cannabis in public and its growth to be sold for profit is illegal. But the law does tolerate growing cannabis for personal use and its consumption in private. Dozens of private marijuana smoking clubs operate across Spain that take advantage of this legal loophole that serve cannabis users who do not want to get their drugs from the streets. AFP PHOTO / DESIREE MARTIN (Photo credit should read DESIREE MARTIN/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAn Israeli agricultural engineer inspects marijuana plants at the BOL (Breath Of Life) Pharma greenhouse in the country's second-largest medical cannabis plantation, near Kfar Pines in northern Israel, on March 9, 2016. The recreational use of cannabis is illegal in the Jewish state, but for the past 10 years its therapeutic use has not only been permitted but also encouraged. Last year, doctors prescribed the herb to about 25,000 patients suffering from cancer, epilepsy, post-traumatic stress and degenerative diseases. The purpose is not to cure them but to alleviate their symptoms. Forbidden to export its cannabis plants, Israel is concentrating instead on marketing its agronomic, medical and technological expertise in the hope of becoming a world hub in the field. / AFP / JACK GUEZ (Photo credit should read JACK GUEZ/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThousands of people with misdemeanor marijuana possession convictions will be pardoned in Washington state, Gov. Jay Inslee said.\n\nWashington voters approved legalizing marijuana as a tax revenue measure in 2012. Initiative 502 legalized and regulated the production, possession and distribution of cannabis for people ages 21 and older.\n\nNow, Inslee has announced the Marijuana Justice Initiative, a plan to expedite record clearances for thousands of citizens who were convicted of small-time possession charges before the law came into effect. About 3,500 people could be pardoned by the Marijuana Justice Initiative, according to the governor's office.\n\nInslee said he hopes the change will alleviate undue burden on those previously convicted.\n\nWe shouldn't be punishing people for something that is no longer illegal in Washington state, Inslee said. Forgiving these convictions can help lessen their impact and allow people to move on with their lives. It's a small step, but one that moves us in the direction of correcting these injustices.\n\nThese misdemeanor convictions can be over a decade old, but still create barriers to housing, employment, student loans, credit scores and even the ability to participate in a child or grandchild's school field trip.\n\nCarrying around misdemeanors for something that is no longer considered illegal is unfair, and they disproportionately affect communities of color the governor said.\n\nOnly people with a single conviction on their record will be eligible for the pardon, according to the statement. That person must also have been convicted between January 1, 1998 and December 5, 2012 for misdemeanor marijuana possession as an adult. That prosecution must have occurred under state law in Washington.\n\nThose who have an adult misdemeanor marijuana possession and believe they qualify for a pardon can submit a petition online, the statement said. Once the Office of the Governor reviews the case and confirms they are eligible, Inslee will pardon the conviction and ask Washington State Patrol to remove the offense from the criminal history report that is available to the public.\n\nSeattle already overturned the convictions of more than 500 people in September.\n\nAll seven judges on the city's municipal court agreed to vacate convictions from 1996 to 2010 for misdemeanor marijuana possession, saying that they disproportionally impacted people of color.\n\nOf the more than 500 cases cited, 46% involved African-American defendants, the judges said in their ruling. As of July 2017, the population of Seattle was about 7% African-American, according to US Census data.\n\nAnd Washington isn't alone is overturning the convictions.\n\nMore than 3,000 cases of marijuana smoking and possession, dating to 1978, were dismissed in September in New York City. And California lawmakers last summer approved a bill that would allow residents to petition the judicial system to have their old pot convictions expunged.

Written by Jack Forster Geneva\n\nJack Forster is editor-in-chief of online specialist watch magazine Hodinkee\n\nFor the last few years, the watch industry has witnessed the resurgence of vintage-inspired watches and more affordable timepieces. However, at this year's Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie Genève (SIHH), the impressive selection of technologically advanced offerings suggest that the appetite for innovation -- and the high prices it commands -- has not disappeared completely.\n\nSlimming down\n\nOne of the most talked-about watches at SIHH 2018 comes from Piaget. The company publicly unveiled the flattest mechanical wristwatch ever made: the Altiplano Ultimate Concept Watch , which is just 2 millimeters thick. (While the company is best known for its fine jewelry, it has a long history of specializing in extra flat watches.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 8 – Van Cleef & Arpels Lady Arpels Planetarium Credit: Van Cleef & Arpels' Lady Arpels Planetarium shows the actual positions of Earth, Mercury and Venus around the sun, and the position of the moon around the Earth. Scroll through the gallery for more highlights from this year's Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie Genève via Hodinkee\n\nAudemars Piguet also introduced a slim new model: Royal Oak RD#2 Perpetual Calendar Ultra-Thin . The self-winding watch comes equipped with a perpetual calendar (a mechanism that can correctly detect the length of each month, and doesn't need to be manually reset at the end of the month) and a 2.89-millimeter movement.\n\nBoth watches are concept pieces and not available commercially -- at least for now. But German watchmaker A. Lange & Söhne has displayed two notable complicated watches that are available for purchase.\n\nPiaget's Altiplano Ultimate Concept Watch purports to be the thinnest mechanical wristwatch of all time. Credit: Courtesy Piaget\n\nOne, the 47,000-euro ($57,550) 1815 Homage to Walter Lange , was produced in honor of the company's founder, who passed away last year. Its second hand jumps once per second, and, because it can be stopped and reset to the zero position, can also be used as a timer.\n\nAt a higher price point is the A. Lange & Söhne $147,000 Triple Split , a watch with a simple name but a lot of parts -- 567 in the movement, to be precise. This is a type of watch known as a split-seconds chronograph, which lets you time two events simultaneously. Most split-seconds chronographs can only split times less than a minute apart, but the Triple Split can do so over seconds, minutes and hours.\n\nIndependent innovation\n\nAmong the most visually stunning watches on display at SIHH is Van Cleef & Arpels' Lady Arpels Planetarium . The $245,000 watch puts the planets of the inner solar system on your wrist, showing the actual positions of Earth, Mercury and Venus around the sun, and the position of the moon around the Earth. The time is displayed by way of a comet that moves around the dial once per day.\n\nContinuing the out-of-this-world theme, Officine Panerai debuted the highly complex L'Astronomo Luminor 1950 Tourbillon Moon Phases Equation of Time GMT. It's the company's first watch with a moon phase complication.\n\nGreubel Forsey's new GMT Earth world-time watch features a miniature globe rotating inside the mechanism.

(Van Cleef & Arpels, Officine Panerai, A. Lange & Söhne and Piaget are subsidiaries of Richemont.)\n\nGreubel Forsey, who specializes in exotic complicated timepieces with elaborate hand-finishing, displayed the new GMT Earth world-time watch, which features a miniature globe rotating inside the mechanism. It's more a wearable art object than a watch and, at around 610,000 Swiss francs ($635,760), is priced as such.\n\nCatering to more understated tastes, independent Belgian brand Ressence has unveiled its Type 2 e-Crown Concept . The watch, which was created with iPod co-designer Tony Fadell, contains a solar-cell chargeable electric motor, and connects to an app that can automatically set the time or change time zone.\n\nThese models are all notable departure from the classic watches that have been in style recently. But watch enthusiasts of any taste and budget can appreciate the inventiveness the industry's watchmakers and designers still have to offer.

Truthfully, it's an easy way to go back a step and to undo text. But now you can also tap with three fingers to undo or redo when in a text field. This is handy for messages, typing in a URL and even with emails.\n\nShare a website as a PDF\n\nSend an entire webpage as a PDF\n\nYes, you can screenshot on an iPhone (just click the power button and volume up at the same time on models with Face ID, and power and home button for older models). But you can also tap Full Page to have iOS capture the entirety of the webpage. It's a great way to share news articles, your favorite listicle or even a recipe. From there, you can save it to your iPhone or share it in an email or message.\n\nYour iPhone can be a tape measure\n\nMeasure nearly anything with this built-in app\n\nApple first introduced the Measure app with iOS 12, and while it's a perfect demo of augmented reality, it can actually come in handy. Essentially, through the combination of the cameras on your iPhone and software smarts, it measures distances. You can mark those with different starting and stopping points, while also being able to easily change what standard you're using to measure.\n\nSwitch Wi-Fi on the fly\n\nEasily access nearby Wi-Fi networks\n\nIn the Control Center, you can easily turn on or off Wi-Fi, but you can also switch between different networks. Swipe down from the top left-hand corner, press the long-press into the square with connections and then long press again on the Wi-Fi symbol. It will then show the network you're currently connected to and then show a list of other networks in your range. You can switch on the fly to a known network or join a new one. Plus, this also works for Bluetooth connections.\n\nYour keyboard can be a mouse cursor\n\nHold down the screen to turn your finger into a cursor\n\nThere's nothing worse than writing a long email and having to oh-so-carefully click to change a double space or to fix a sentence structure. But holding down your keyboard will let you turn it into a mouse cursor, allowing you to quickly get to the spot you need to fix. It's super helpful for those quick changes.\n\nSwipe away a number in Calculator\n\nClear numbers in Calculator with a swipe\n\nWhile the Calculator is pretty basic, it's a handy app. But did you know hitting Clear (aka the C button) isn't the only way to start fresh? You can swipe an individual number away to remove it. This is super handy, especially if you add an extra digit. Just swipe left or right on a number to remove it.\n\nPin your favorite conversation\n\nMessages got a number of new features in iOS 14 but our favorite trick is pinning conversations. No longer do you need to scroll through endless rows of convos to find your most used, rather you can pin it to the top. Simply swipe from left to right on a conversation and you'll see a yellow pin icon appear. That contact will jump to the top as a circle and you can rearrange it as you like.\n\nTap the back of your phone instead of swiping up\n\nBack Tap might be the best kept secret on the iPhone. Originally designed as an Accessibility feature for easily triggering a task or action, it's open for everyone and can be super charged. Essentially an iPhone can pickup a two finger or triple tap on its back thanks to the Haptic sensor. In Settings you can set a double tap to open Messages or to go back home. While a triple tap can trigger the opening of a specific app or even locking your phone. It's super handy. This is found under Settings > Accessibility > Back Tap.\n\nBedtime in Clock can help set a habit\n\nThe Bedtime feature in the Clock app lets you set a bedtime and will send a friendly reminder. You can set when it should send (typically 30 or 45 minutes prior) and it can even engage Do Not Disturb to encourage less phone usage before slumber time.\n\nSearch for emojis\n\nApple adds a plethora of new emojis to iOS in updates throughout the year and we all have our favorites. For us, it has to be the upside down smiley face and the lightning bolt. But did you know you can search for an emoji right within the keyboard? It's super handy for finding the right emoji for when words aren't enough.\n\nCapture in ProRaw\n\nLooking to take your photos to the next level? Shooting in ProRaw on the iPhone 12 mini, 12, 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max bundles additional information that you can take advantage of in photo editing apps. Think Photoshop or Pixelmator. This ultimately gives you greater control over an image – but know that these files take up a bit more space.\n\nTake a photo in a FaceTime\n\nNow more than ever, we're using FaceTime to stay connected. Ever notice the white circular shutter button? Well, it's an easy way to snap a photo during the call – and you can even set it to be a live photo. It's an easy way to capture a memory during a call.
Uber should be regulated as a transportation company and not a tech service, an adviser to Europe's top court said on Thursday.\n\nThe non-binding opinion issued by the Advocate General of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) is a major setback for Uber, which has argued that it is best classified as a digital service.\n\nThe Uber electronic platform, whilst innovative, falls within the field of transport: Uber can thus be required to obtain the necessary licenses and authorizations under national law, Advocate General Maciej Szpunar wrote in an opinion published by the court.\n\nA final decision in the case is expected before the end of the year. While guidance from the Advocate General is not binding, the court typically rules in similar fashion.\n\nUber has long sought to avoid tougher regulation by arguing that it is a tech platform that connects passengers and drivers.\n\nCritics, however, say that it more closely resembles a taxi company and should be regulated as such. Another frequent point of contention: Uber says full- and part-time drivers who ferry passengers around are not employees, but contractors.\n\nAn Uber spokesperson said Thursday that the company would wait for the court's final ruling.\n\nBeing considered a transportation company would not change the way we are regulated in most EU countries as that is already the situation today, the spokesperson added. It will, however, undermine the much needed reform of outdated laws.\n\nRelated: Uber is ditching this country next month\n\nThe case against Uber was brought by an organization representing professional taxi drivers in Spain. They argued that Uber has an unfair advantage because its drivers don't have the taxi licenses required by the city of Barcelona. A Spanish court referred the case to the European Court of Justice.\n\nSpain is not the only European country where Uber faces a backlash. The company was fined in France last year for running an illegal transportation service.\n\nIn the U.K., Uber faces a backlash from taxi drivers and labor unions over its treatment of drivers.\n\nUber announced last month that it would pull out of Denmark because of the country's new taxi laws.
Among the chief advantages of trusts, they let you:\n\nPut conditions on how and when your assets are distributed after you die;\n\nReduce estate and gift taxes;\n\nDistribute assets to heirs efficiently without the cost, delay and publicity of probate court. Probate can cost between 5% to 7% of your estate;\n\nBetter protect your assets from creditors and lawsuits;\n\nName a successor trustee, who not only manages your trust after you die, but is empowered to manage the trust assets if you become unable to do so.\n\nTrusts are flexible, varied and complex. Each type has advantages and disadvantages, which you should discuss thoroughly with your estate-planning attorney before setting one up.\n\nWhen it comes to cost, a basic trust plan may run anywhere from $1,600 to $3,000, or possibly more depending on the complexity of the trust. Such a plan should include the trust setup, a will, a living will and a health-care proxy. You will also pay fees to amend the trust if it's revocable and to administer the trust after you die.\n\nOne caveat: Assets you want protected by the trust must be retitled in the name of the trust. Anything that is not so titled when you die will have to be probated and may not go to the heir you intended but to one the probate court chooses.\n\nFor a trust in which you want to put the majority of your assets -- known as a revocable living trust -- you also have to have a pour-over will to cover any of your holdings that might be outside of your trust if you die unexpectedly. A pour-over will essentially directs that any assets outside of the trust at the time of your death be put into it so they can go to the heirs you choose.\n\nCredit-shelter trust:\n\nWith a credit-shelter trust (also called a bypass or family trust), you write a will bequeathing an amount to the trust up to the estate-tax exemption. Then you pass the rest of your estate to your spouse tax-free. You also specify how you want the trust to be used -- for example, you may stipulate that income from the trust after you die goes to your spouse and that when he or she dies, the principal will be distributed tax-free among your children.\n\nSince your spouse is also entitled to an estate-tax exemption, the two of you can effectively double (or more than double) that portion of your kids' inheritance that is shielded from estate taxes by using this strategy.\n\nAnd there's an added bonus: Once money is placed in a bypass trust it is forever free of estate tax, even if it grows. So if your surviving spouse invests it wisely, he or she may add to your children's inheritance.\n\nOf course, you can pass an amount equal to the estate-tax exemption directly to your kids when you die, but the reason for a bypass trust is to protect your spouse financially in the event he or she has need for income from the trust or in the event you think your children will squander their inheritance before the surviving parent dies.\n\nGeneration-skipping trust:\n\nA generation-skipping trust (also called a dynasty trust) allows you to transfer a substantial amount of money tax-free to beneficiaries who are at least two generations your junior -- typically your grandchildren.\n\nYou may specify that your children may receive income from the trust and even use its principal for almost anything that would benefit your grand kids, including health care, housing or tuition bills.\n\nBeware, however. If you leave more than the exemption amount, the bequest will be subject to a generation-skipping transfer tax. This tax is separate from estate taxes, and is designed to stop wealthy seniors from funneling all their money to their grandchildren.\n\nQualified personal residence trust:\n\nA qualified personal residence trust (QPRT) can remove the value of your home or vacation dwelling from your estate and is particularly useful if your home is likely to appreciate in value.\n\nA QPRT lets you give your home as a gift -- most commonly to your children -- while you keep control of it for a period that you stipulate, say 10 years. You may continue to live in the home and maintain full control of it during that time.\n\nIn valuing the gift, the IRS assumes your home is worth less than its present-day value since your kids won't take possession of it for several years. (The longer the term of the trust, the less the value of the gift.)\n\nHere's the catch: If you don't outlive the trust, the full market value of your house at the time of your death will be counted in your estate. In order for the trust to be valid, you must outlive it, and then either move out of your home or pay your children fair market rent to continue living there, Janko says. While that may not seem ideal, the upside is that the rent you pay will reduce your estate further, Levine notes.\n\nIrrevocable life insurance trust:\n\nAn irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT) can remove your life insurance from your taxable estate, help pay estate costs, and provide your heirs with cash for a variety of purposes. To remove the policy from your estate, you surrender ownership rights, which means you may no longer borrow against it or change beneficiaries. In return, the proceeds from the policy may be used to pay any estate costs after you die and provide your beneficiaries with tax-free income.\n\nThat can be useful in cases where you leave heirs an illiquid asset such as a business. The business might take a while to sell, and in the meantime your heirs will have to pay operating expenses. If they don't have cash on hand, they might have to have a fire sale just to meet the bills. But proceeds from an ILIT can help tide them over.\n\nQualified terminable interest property trust:\n\nIf you're part of a family where there have been divorces, remarriages and stepchildren, you may want to direct your assets to particular relatives through a qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) trust.\n\nYour surviving spouse will receive income from the trust, and the beneficiaries you specify will get the principal or remainder after your spouse dies. People typically use QTIP trusts to ensure that a fair portion of their wealth ultimately passes to their own children and not someone else's.\n\nMoney in a QTIP trust, unlike that in a bypass trust, is treated as part of the surviving spouse's estate and may be subject to estate tax. That's why you should create a bypass trust first, which shelters assets up to the estate-tax exemption, and then if you have assets left over you can put it in a QTIP, Levine says.
HOUSTON, TX - FEBRUARY 05: Tom Brady #12 of the New England Patriots celebrates with the Vince Lombardi Trophy after defeating the Atlanta Falcons during Super Bowl 51 at NRG Stadium on February 5, 2017 in Houston, Texas. The Patriots defeated the Falcons 34-28. (Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nFootball lovers, welcome to the holiest time of the season: The NFL playoffs. Over the next few weeks, the postseason teams will slowly be whittled down to two, culminating in that most sacred of events on February 3: The big, long Super Bowl commercial with a football game squeezed in between.\n\nWhether you're stocking up on buffalo wings and Imodium in preparation for a playoff binge, or are just reluctantly accompanying someone who is, here's everything you need to know about the postseason picture, including a full schedule of games.\n\nREAD MORE: CNN's complete NFL Championship coverage\n\nLet's start with the big question:\n\nWho should I root for?\n\nWell that's a complicated question. There are some pretty great storylines to explore: Two NFL greats who are old as dirt by sports standards (That's 41-year-old Tom Brady of the Patriots and 39-year-old Drew Brees of the Saints, for those of you keeping score), and an exciting new team from Los Angeles, which surely thrills people from their abandoned hometown of St. Louis.\n\nPHOTO: Sean Gardner/Getty Images New Orleans Saints Quarterback Drew Brees\n\nOf course you could root for whatever team is closest to you, or whatever team your mom likes. But it may also be liberating to shrug off the yoke of parochialism and chose a new favorite. Especially if you're a New England fan. Behold, a guide:\n\nI want to support smaller market teams and watch networks sweat over viewership: Root for the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nI think every team in the entire country should relocate to Los Angeles, thus completing a football singularity that will open a portal to the center of the Earth: Root for the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nI like legendary quarterbacks who have already WON Super Bowls and don't NEED any more and/or I want the entire city of Atlanta to SUFFER DEEPLY: Root for the New Orleans Saints or the New England Patriots.\n\nThis is too much. Just tell me what teams might win\n\nWhile we can't predict the future, maybe Vegas can: As of the beginning of the wild card round, odds from Vegas Insider have the New Orleans Saints as Super Bowl favorites at 11/4, followed by the Kansas City Chiefs at 9/2.\n\nUnsurprisingly, these odds mimic the playoff seeds. But who knows, anything can happen!\n\nPHOTO: Sean M.

It's the IRS's job to collect taxes for the federal government, so it's not surprising that most people are less than fond of the agency.\n\nThe IRS, in turn, does its best to keep certain facts under wraps -- either because it would make it easier for the agency if people don't know these details, or because taxpayers can use this information to get some of their money back .\n\n1. You probably won't be audited\n\nIn recent years, the IRS's budget has been repeatedly slashed. As a result, it's been forced to reduce its personnel, including auditors. The inevitable result is a steep decline in audit rates: Fewer than 1% of taxpayers are audited these days, and as the budget cuts continue, this rate will likely drop further.\n\nHowever, this doesn't give you carte blanche to throw whatever numbers you like into your tax return. Setting aside the ethical issues of cheating on your taxes, there's no guarantee that the IRS' budget or priorities won't change in the near future (before the statute of limitations runs out on your current tax return). So while it's natural to be happy that you are extremely unlikely to be audited, don't push your luck. Claiming legitimate deductions that you might otherwise be too nervous to take is one thing; committing tax fraud is entirely different.\n\n2. The IRS may owe you interest\n\nThe IRS spells it out loud and clear that taxpayers owe the agency interest and penalties for late payments, but it's significantly quieter about the fact that if the IRS is late giving you your tax refund, it will owe interest to you. If the IRS doesn't issue you your refund within 45 days of the returns due date or the date it accepted your tax return (whichever comes later), it owes you interest for every day that the refund is late.\n\nNote that the timing rule means that you can't cheat by turning your return in late, then claiming that the IRS owes you interest because it's been more than 45 days since the return due date.\n\nThe IRS's interest rates change quarterly; for first quarter 2017, the rate is 4%.\n\n3. Qualified charitable distributions in lieu of RMDs\n\nOnce you hit age 70½, the IRS requires you to withdraw a certain minimum amount from your tax-deferred retirement accounts every year. It doesn't want you to be able to hang on to that money forever; after a certain point, it wants to be able to start collecting taxes on the money in these accounts. Thus, you'll be forced to take distributions (and pay taxes on them) whether or not you actually need the income. And because the distributions are taxed as income, this can cause all kinds of other tax complications such as raising your tax bracket (and your capital gains rate as a result), and making your Social Security benefits partially taxable.\n\nYou can't get out of taking the required minimum distribution from your tax-deferred accounts unless you're willing to pay a grotesquely high 50% penalty, but you can avoid paying income taxes on that money by donating it to charity instead of keeping it yourself. This would count as an RMD, but it would help decrease your tax liability.\n\nIn order for this to work, the distribution has to go straight from the retirement account to the charity -- you can't pull out the money and then write a check to the charity of your choice. Consult with your retirement account's trustee or your financial adviser to learn the nitty-gritty details of how to manage this transaction so as to meet IRS requirements.\n\n4. Removing the penalty on early withdrawals from retirement accounts\n\nTake money out of your tax-deferred IRA or 401(k) before age 59½, and the IRS will slap a 10% penalty tax on the distribution (in addition to taxing the distribution as income). However, there's an exception that's available to all: the substantially equal periodic payment rule.\n\nWhat this rule says, in brief, is that if you commit to taking exactly the same amount from your retirement account every year -- an amount figured by one of three calculation methods offered by the IRS -- you won't have to pay penalties on the distributions. The three calculation methods are based on how much money you have in your retirement accounts, and on life expectancy tables provided by the IRS.\n\nRelated links:\n\n• Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy Alert\n\n• This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997\n\n• 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market\n\nNote that this is not an exception you should take advantage of unless you really, really need to. There are significant drawbacks: You have to keep taking the distributions for at least five years or until you reach age 59½, and taking money out of your retirement accounts before you retire can cause you serious financial hardship later on. However, if you do end up needing the money before 59½, at least you have a way to avoid the 10% penalty.
New York City has changed its policy on gender designation for birth certificates.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nA new law in New York City makes it easier for transgender and non-binary New Yorkers to match their birth certificate to their gender identity without needing a signed affidavit from a healthcare provider.\n\nThe law, which went into effect Tuesday, also creates a new label, X, to reflect a non-binary identity.\n\nTransgender and gender non-conforming New Yorkers deserve the right to choose how they identify and to live with respect and dignity, Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement released Monday.\n\nOur city respects your gender identity and the right to have it affirmed on your birth certificate, de Blasio's office echoed in a Tuesday tweet.\n\nUnder the law, individuals born in New York City can apply to have the gender marker on their birth certificate changed by submitting a notarized application stating that the revision is to reflect their true gender identity and is not for any fraudulent purpose.\n\nYou don't need a doctor to tell you who you are and you shouldn't need a doctor to change your birth certificate to reflect your true self, New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson said in a June statement when the law was first proposed.\n\nThe X option will not be available at the time of birth, Michael Lanza, a spokesman for the New York City Health Department, told CNN Thursday, though it will be an option for amending youth birth certificates.\n\nThe move is the latest in the city's efforts to reduce legal red tape for transgender and non-binary individuals. Hundreds have already received amended birth certificates with a health care provider's signature since the city eased requirements for a gender marker change in 2015. Prior to that, individuals seeking to have their gender marker changed on their birth certificate would have had to provide proof of sex-reassignment surgery.\n\nNew York City joins the states of California, Oregon, Washington and Idaho in allowing a birth certificate change without the signature of a medical authority. New Jersey is scheduled to follow suit in February.\n\nNew York state still requires a medical professional's signature for a gender marker change on state-issued documents, including drivers' licenses, according to a database maintained by the National Center for Transgender Equality.\n\nCNN's Sonia Moghe contributed to this report
Story highlights Sam Bird racing at Buenos Aires ePrix Formula E returning after winter break\n\n(CNN) —\n\nIt wasn't so long ago that owners of electric vehicles were greeted with mocking sneers by fellow motorists – and with some justification.\n\nThe ill-fated Sinclair C5 didn't even resemble a car, the G-Wiz was recently voted the UK's worst-ever car, while the three-wheeled Zap Xebra appeared to be a battery-powered reincarnation of the defunct Reliant Robin.\n\nTimes and technology have moved on, thanks in part to Tesla, which has altered perceptions and the performance of electric vehicles in recent years.\n\nOn the race track, meanwhile, it's Formula E that's helping drive that change.\n\nFormula E is the future, says Sam Bird, who drives for the DS Virgin Racing team in the world's only all-electric race series.\n\nIn 40 years' time – let's face it – everyone on the planet will be driving an electric vehicle, the Briton adds.\n\nREAD: Branson predicts all cars will be electric by 2030\n\nWe are a catalyst in that, kind of, cog to ensure that electric cars develop quickly and that people watch Formula E and think, 'They're cool, I'm going to buy one for the road.'\n\nBird and his teammate Jose Maria Lopez are in Buenos Aires for this weekend's third round of the 2016-17 world championship.\n\nFor Argentine native Lopez, the ePrix will be a home race, but Bird will be feeling right at home too – the 2.4-kilometer (1.5-mile) Puerto Madero Street Circuit was the scene of his one and only race victory in season two.\n\nFirstly, the city is amazing – we go to the heart of the cities and this is one I really look forward to, Bird explains.\n\nThe track lends itself to overtaking and intense battles throughout the pack – and that's exactly what you saw last year with me and (Sebastien) Buemi at the front.\n\nI hope that's what you see again hopefully with me able to repeat what I did last year.\n\nBird and the rest of the Formula E grid have had to play second fiddle to reigning champion Buemi in season three thus far.\n\nThe Swiss has steered his Renault eDams car to victory in the opening two races in Hong Kong and Marrakesh, giving Buemi a commanding 22-point lead over nearest rival, ABT Schaeffler Audi Sport driver Lucas di Grassi.\n\nBuemi's in great form at the moment, Bird concedes.\n\nIn Hong Kong, I felt like I had the beating of him but unfortunately my pit stop wasn't brilliant. In Marrakesh we came second to him – so we've been there or thereabouts. I'd like to think we can reverse the roles when we get to Buenos Aires.\n\nA different formula\n\nThe home of racing legend Juan Manuel Fangio and an intermittent host to Formula One between 1953 and 1998, Buenos Aires is steeped in motorsport history.\n\nREAD: How the virtual world breeds real-life success\n\nREAD: After F1, Esteban Gutierrez finds Formula E\n\nIt's an appropriate place for Formula E to put down some roots – this is the third successive year an ePrix has been staged in the city.\n\nBird has experience of both race series – previously he was a reserve driver for the all-conquering Mercedes F1 team – and he thinks Formula E offers something different.\n\nVisit cnn.com/motorsport for more news and videos\n\nFormula E doesn't want to be compared to F1 – it has a completely new identity and it's going down a completely different road, Bird says.\n\nI think Formula E is as fun, if not funner. We go to some amazing countries, some great cities and I'm racing some of the best drivers in the world in high-tech machinery at 140 mph on a street where you would only be able to go 20 mph normally.
A Message of Discontent from Wisconsin (TIME, April 17, 1972) -- Like some metaphysical lottery, with hazards of sudden political death or prizes of resurrection, the American primary system ramshackled through Wisconsin last week to the end of its first phase -- and a pause before the next series, starting April 25, in such crucial industrial states as Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan. The Wisconsin primary left the eventual outcome of the long spring campaign more enigmatic than ever, but some of the election results were startling: -- George McGovern, hitherto regarded as a one-issue antiwar champion of the liberal-left, exploited his own superb organization in the state, tapped deep wells of economic discontent and, by winning a 30% plurality, transformed himself at last into a major candidate. In Wisconsin his support was astonishingly broad, bracketing liberals, conservatives, blue- collar workers, farmers, suburbanites and the young. -- George Wallace, with the help of 35% of the G.O.P. voters who crossed over to vote Democratic, similarly appealed to a restive mood of the little man. Although he campaigned for only eight days in Wisconsin, Wallace came in second, with 22% of the vote. Adding the Wallace and McGovern totals, 52% of the voters cast ballots for anti-Establishment candidates. -- Minnesota's Hubert Humphrey, who had counted on his longtime popularity in neighboring Wisconsin to catapult him into the Democratic lead, came in third, with 21%. It was a serious, though by no means fatal blow for Humphrey, who has yet to win a presidential primary. -- Edmund Muskie, limping into fourth place with only 10% of the vote, was the real loser. Once regarded as the front runner, Muskie's defeats in Florida and Wisconsin have deflated his trust and confidence campaign. In an almost breathtaking descent, Muskie in a matter of weeks has become merely another contender. At least one candidate did not survive Wisconsin at all. New York Mayor John Lindsay, with a dismal 7% showing on top of his 7% in Florida, declared himself out of the race. A Muskie aide who had earlier called Lindsay the wild card in this campaign remarked last week: He turned out to be a deuce. Washington Senator Henry Jackson, who won 8% in Wisconsin, remained the darkest of horses, suffering from a massive problem of nonrecognition; on primary day last week, his workers were still distributing a leaflet headlined WHO IS SENATOR JACKSON? On the Republican ballot, Richard Nixon was opposed by Ohio's conservative Congressman John Ashbrook, who got 1% of the vote. California's liberal Republican Congressman Paul McCloskey, who had already withdrawn from the race, also got 1%. The President scored 97%. The Wisconsin campaign was a furious montage of political styles. With mod glasses and carefully darkened hair, 61-year-old Humphrey bounced through 19-hour days. We can sleep next year, he told his workers. Everywhere, except among college students, he found deep affection, but the warmth did not always convert to votes. At times, his campaign savored of last hurrah. In Milwaukee, a woman wearing a McGovern button told H.H.H.: We love you. But you're voting for McGovern, replied Humphrey. Said the woman: Yes, but we love Hubert Humphrey. George Wallace planned only a minimal campaign in Wisconsin, where busing was not an issue, and he had virtually no organization. But when he sensed the crowd's mood at his first rally in Milwaukee on March 23, Wallace abruptly changed his schedule. Suddenly all his earlier explanations about our inability to rent halls because of basketball games became academic. Wallace sought his little man with eleven rallies in eight days and a flurry of local television interviews. He repeatedly brought up busing as a philosophical issue. He complained that the other candidates were horning in on his populist issues: I dig the bone up and throw it out there, and the big dogs grab it. I'm just a little dog from Alabama. McGovern's television commercials confirmed the Wallace complaint. If you want lower property taxes, you want George McGovern, said one. It's as simple as that. But McGovern emphasized direct campaigning. In oblique reference to Lindsay's stylish and futile TV campaigns in Florida and Wisconsin, one McGovern press release claimed: The day of the media candidate is over. People have stopped watching television commercials and started listening to details. Top-Heavy. Despite his efforts to sharpen his stand on issues, Muskie failed to come across clearly on any topic. His organization, top-heavy with endorsements and contributors, never took root on the local levels where primaries are won. He failed to define a constituency. The overall message from Wisconsin is of a contrary mood, an impatience with more traditional candidates and a deep undercurrent of economic dismay. Most specifically, Wisconsin signaled a massive discontent with taxes and inflation -- the pocketbook issues that McGovern and Wallace hit the hardest. In a study of TIME, the attitude research firm of Daniel Yankelovich Inc. found that four of the five top issues that influenced Wisconsin voters were economic. The sixth was the Vietnam War, and McGovern made that into an economic issue as well, emphasizing its continuing costs. According to the survey, 82% of those interviewed said that the Administration's wage and price policies are not working. Fifty-two percent called for overall tax reform, with 41% complaining about high prices and 36% about high unemployment. McGovern and Humphrey both hammered away on the issue of tax reform, of giving the little taxpayer and the working man a fairer break. They shared the rewards: well over half of McGovern's voters and almost two-thirds of Wallace's assailed tax loopholes. The issue cut across both party and ideological grounds, attracting liberals as well as conservatives, Republicans as well as Democrats. The Yankelovich pollsters found a surprising degree of second-choice support for McGovern among the Wallace voters -- support rooted in McGovern's broad anti-Establishment campaign. It was not that Wisconsin voters were running to ideological extremes at the expense of centrist candidates, but rather that both McGovern and Wallace seem to have located an authentic area of concern that the other candidates failed to articulate. Significantly, the survey found that voters still saw Centrist Humphrey as the Democrat with the best chance to be nominated and, if nominated, to beat Nixon. According to the TIME/Yankelovich survey, McGovern trailed both Wallace and Humphrey among blue-collar workers and union members, but he still got 25% of their votes. More than any other, McGovern came through as someone you can trust. Improbably, he won the Fourth Congressional District, on the blue-collar and ethnic south side of Milwaukee, with the largest concentration of Poles in the state. Muskie, who had emphasized his Polish ancestry, finished fourth. Cross-Overs. Wallace and McGovern worked the same vein of economic distress, but the McGovern vote was moderate-liberal, according to the survey, while the Wallace vote was essentially moderate- conservative. McGovern fared well with young voters (47%); Wallace did poorly. The final results were complicated, of course, by the fact that 26% of the votes cast in the Democratic primary came from Republicans and Independents. The cross-overs cost Humphrey a second-place finish, since most of them went to Wallace. Yankelovich found, however, that most of the cross-overs came not as spoilers but as voters anxious to make their views known on the economy and other issues. Wisconsin served to prolong and compound the suspense of the race. It established the major Democratic theme -- a profound economic disgruntlement -- but not a party leader. It's kind of a scramble now, Humphrey said last week. Coming out of Wisconsin, Muskie still led in committed delegate votes, with 96 1/2. McGovern, gaining 54 in Wisconsin, had a total of 89 1/2, trailed by Wallace with 75 and Humphrey with 19. With the delegate-rich primaries in Pennsylvania (182), Massachusetts (102), New York (278) and California (271) still to come, all the candidates are still far from the 1,509 needed for nomination in Miami Beach. For the moment, Wisconsin seemed to have reduced it to a three-man contest among Muskie, Humphrey and McGovern. Although McGovern now ranks as a heavyweight contender, he must still establish that Wisconsin was not a fluke in which the candidate was secondary to the issues. McGovern displayed surprising strength among labor's rank and file in Wisconsin, but his comparative radicalism and long anti-war record have earned him the hostility of many labor leaders as well as Democratic professionals. If McGovern begins to seem a serious threat, many of the regulars might mount a counterattack in favor of Humphrey. Some Democrats fear that a McGovern candidacy might be the equivalent of Barry Goldwater's campaign in 1964 -- an ideological debacle -- and they are already poor-mouthing his victory on the grounds that his excellent Wisconsin organization and Republican cross-over votes distorted the natural outcome. Scenarios. These primaries, said McGovern last week, are going to go on from state to state, from battle to battle. His most optimistic scenario now is to win Massachusetts, where his liberal following is strong, on April 25, then Nebraska on May 9, run well enough (meaning third behind Humphrey and Wallace) in Michigan on May 16 and then go on to take Oregon, California and New York. For Humphrey and Muskie, April 25 will be critical. That is the date of both the Massachusetts and Pennsylvania primaries. Humphrey, badly needing a victory, will count on his support among organized labor for a win in Pennsylvania. Despite Wisconsin, Humphrey's camp insists that McGovern is not really a factor -- This is a race between Humphrey and Muskie. McGovern's advisers, meantime, regard Muskie as a political corpse, seeing the race as a head-on collision between McGovern and Humphrey. Muskie had planned to run in Pennsylvania against Humphrey and in Massachusetts against McGovern, to regain momentum. Last week, however, his advisers were discussing a stop-Humphrey ploy with McGovern's forces -- Muskie would concentrate on winning in Pennsylvania while leaving Massachusetts to McGovern. With each future contest, the political equations will change and the pressures increase. It is now highly likely that after all the bloodshed of the primaries, no one will go to Miami Beach with a lock on the nomination. If so, it will be a fascinating week in July. A deadlock would probably eliminate McGovern as too leftward and experimental, even though that might provoke a fourth-party rebellion. Humphrey might also be unacceptable: too much like 1968...a loser's image. That might leave Muskie as a reconciliation candidate. Or is it possible, as some politicians have already begun to fantasize, that stalemated delegates from all factions of the party will send up a cry from the floor: Kennedy! Kennedy! Success at Last for George I believe the people of this country are tired of the old rhetoric, the unmet promise, the image makers and the practitioners of the expedient. The people are not centrist or liberal or conservative. Rather, they seek a way out of the wilderness. So said Senator McGovern as he officially hit the campaign trail 15 long months ago -- and all but disappeared into the political wilderness. As the earliest declared candidate for the presidential nomination in recent memory, he had a plan: challenge Edmund Muskie before he built up an insurmountable lead, go all out to make a credible showing in the New Hampshire primary, and then, gathering momentum, overtake the field in Wisconsin. Back then, his strategy seemed dreamy, if not downright doomed. Few political leaders took his candidacy seriously, dismissing him as a self-appointed conscience of the party or a stalking horse for Ted Kennedy. The Margin. The professional polls had clearly underestimated George Stanley McGovern, 49, child of the plains, minister's son, college-debate champion, World War II bomber pilot, former history professor, father of five and, according to Robert Kennedy, the most decent man in the Senate. Decency and doggedness -- traits that served him well when he first ran for Congress in 1956, traveling the dusty side roads for one-to-one meetings in farmhouses and general stores. Taken singly, the encounters were insignificant; taken together, they meant the margin of victory. Recalls Journalist Harl Andersen, who covered the campaign for the Associated Press: George only builds a stone at a time. After a while, though, it begins to show up. In 1962 he moved on to the Senate, winning a seat by only 597 votes. One of the earliest and most persistent antiwar Senators, McGovern began building a small but strong following with his co- sponsorship of the 1968 McGovern-Hatfield resolution calling for an end to the war. Though unsuccessful, the legislation occasioned a rare flash of fire from the quiet man. Every Senator in this chamber is partly responsible for sending 50,000 young Americans to an early grave. McGovern fumed. This chamber reeks of blood! When Robert Kennedy was assassinated, McGovern sought to keep Bobby's antiwar supporters together by entering the race in his stead less than three weeks before the 1968 convention. Though he polled only 146 1/2 of the 2,622 delegate votes, the effort gave McGovern the presidential bug. The candidate of 1972 has changed little; he is still the personable but plodding campaigner. McGovern's success is a combination of his persistence and a new, high-powered, appealingly unprofessional organization. Without the aggressiveness of Bobby Kennedy or the aloofness of Eugene McCarthy, McGovern has forged a coalition of followers from both camps. On one flank are such Kennedy men as Advisers John Kenneth Galbraith and Arthur Schlesinger Jr., former Kennedy Press Secretaries Pierre Salinger and Frank Mankiewicz, Writers Richard Goodwin and Adam Walinsky. (His principal financial contributors are Max Palevsky, chairman of the Xerox Executive Committee, and Henry Kimelman, board chairman of West Indies Corp.) On the other are legions of young staffers and student volunteers bristling with go-for-George enthusiasm. The spectacle of the old Kennedy pros followed by McGovern's young crusaders, says Eugene McCarthy, is like German officers leading Irish troops. Index Cards. But they march well together. Typical of McGovern's young minions is Gene Pokorny, 26, a scholarly Nebraskan who, says Campaign Manager Gary Hart, has the mind of a revolutionist in the body of Henry Aldrich. Dispatched to Wisconsin a year ago on a salary of $200 a month, he tirelessly crisscrossed the state with clipboard and index cards in hand, organizing and opening 39 McGovern headquarters. When it was discovered that voting day fell during campus spring vacations, Pokorny ran forms in students newspapers which could be exchanged for absentee ballots. By election day an estimated 70% of the students cast their votes for McGovern and the number of workers had grown from 80 to 10,000. McGovern, say staffers, is no softie, despite his easygoing ways. He's a classic Clark Kent, says Aide Ted Van Dyk. All calmness on the outside -- serene -- but when crisis strikes, it's into the phone booth. He has other useful traits as well. Accused at a University of Wisconsin rally of being a warmonger for voting for passage of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, McGovern did not turn peevish as Muskie has done in the face of similar baiting. Instead, McGovern asked that those who believed the charge raise their hands; when less than six hands shot up, McGovern moved on to other matters. He has successfully overcome his image as a one-issue peace candidate by promoting his stands on income distribution, tax, reform and decreased defense spending. McGovern projects simplicity, honesty and candor. He remains confident despite the many Democratic leaders who still dismiss his candidacy. Meanwhile, stone by stone, George moves on. What Happened to Muskie? In just one month, Maine's Ed Muskie slipped from the position of the serene front runner to that of an embattled man on the verge of being knocked completely out of the race for his party's nomination for President. Before the plunge, much of the press (including TIME) and many politicians saw him as almost a certain first-ballot winner at the Democratic Convention in July. Now he could easily turn out to be what President Nixon derisively termed him after the 1970 Congressional elections: the George Romney of the Democratic Party. What went wrong? No single reason, or incident, can be cited to explain Muskie's decline. There was, in fact, a whole series of mistakes made by political pros, journalists, Muskie strategists and Muskie himself. In the first place, he probably should never have been rated so far ahead. That status was based largely on the fact that national surveys showed him to be the Democrat with the best chance to defeat Nixon -- but those polls do not translate into strength in state primaries. Yet that impression of Muskie's popularity had never really been tested in voting booths nationwide. Muskie had looked cool and impressive as Hubert Humphrey's running mate in 1968, and he exuded much more of a presidential aura than did his G.O.P. counterpart, Spiro Agnew. Yet few voters select a President primarily by looking at the vice presidential candidates, and Muskie's appeal was not really an issue in that election. Muskie was now recognized by most Democratic voters all right, but how did they really feel about him? No one could be sure. Euphoric. Nevertheless, Muskie and his advisers almost euphorically accepted the pleasant notion that he was far ahead of the field -- and they designed a campaign based on that assumption. He would speak cautiously, even vaguely, if need be, on most issues, so as not to antagonize any large blocs of voters. Ignoring his rivals for the nomination, he would campaign against the President. The essence of that campaign would be to portray Nixon as an excitable, expedient politician whose statements were rarely credible. By contrast, voters were urged to trust Muskie, the man of integrity. That strategy might have been sound if the premises had been right. Muskie at his best is far more inspiring than Nixon, who does have credibility problems and is unpredictable. Nixon had sounded shrill and unfair as he tried to link Democrats with crime, drugs and antiwar violence during the 1970 congressional campaigns, while Muskie on that election eve effectively deplored such tactics and appealed for a return to reason. Perhaps the voters did long for a calmer, loftier leader. To further the bandwagon psychology, the Muskie strategists won endorsements from big names in the party: California Senator John Tunney, Ohio Governor John Gilligan, Illinois Senator Adlai Stevenson III, Iowa Senator Harold Hughes, Pennsylvania Governor Milton Shapp. Each new name made the nomination seem that much more inevitable. This was organizing the party drive from the top down, rather than from the bottom up. Suddenly, the edifice began to crumble, and the entire strategy was shattered. Democratic voters showed that in primaries, at least, they were not all that concerned about finding a contrast with Nixon. They were not looking for a unifier and mollifier. They were in a balky, grumpy mood. They wanted specific answers to specific problems that plagued them. They were more interested in voting against the status quo, and men like George McGovern and George Wallace seemed to offer that chance to protest. Moreover Muskie hurt his own image as the judicious, controlled candidate by sobbing in the snows of New Hampshire, ironically at the very time that Nixon in Peking was acting as the healer of international passions. This outburst was partly the result of Muskie's emotional and physical fatigue. Trying to be all things to all people, and torn by his commitments to so many primary campaigns, he lost his sense of direction, creating doubts about his ability to stand up under pressure. Fed Up. Muskie's overconfident staff had also erred badly in ignoring grass-roots organizational work. In a primary, voters have to be coaxed to go to the polls and persuaded to select a particular name out of a crowded field. In New Hampshire, the Muskie camp had to send out-of-state organizers in at the last minute to get out a favorable vote. Muskie now concedes that entering the Florida primary was a mistake; once Wallace had entered, he should have known it was hopeless and avoided that first big blow to his front-running status. He relied heavily for support in Florida upon its Democratic state legislators -- but they were tied down by their duties in Tallahassee and were of little help. Muskie came out of his Florida defeat in a new fighting mood. He tackled specific issues, such as taxes and the economy, and began berating his competitors. Yet the turnabout gave Muskie the impression of a man lashing out in desperation, seeking a new image. Muskie's dilemma is painfully difficult. He has come across as a fuzzy Establishment kind of politician in a year when voters seem in revolt, and has been unable to put his brand on any issue that can attract that fed-up, turned-off voter. If he cannot beat such lesser-known Democrats, how can he be seen as the man to beat Nixon? He's got to find the ways to tap the anger and frustration that people have about big government and big business, says Senator Tunney, one of his now-disillusioned supporters. I know Muskie favors reform of institutions, but he hasn't been able to convey that. There is perhaps one consolation in all of the Muskie miscalculations so far. If the voters are as unpredictable as they early primaries indicate, similar troubles could lie ahead for the other candidates. Muskie may be no more finished now than he was a shoo-in in January.

London (CNN) UK health workers are preparing to reactivate seven emergency Covid-19 field hospitals , as a surge of coronavirus cases fueled by the spread of a new, more contagious variant threatens to overwhelm intensive care units.\n\nA spokesperson for the National Health Service (NHS) told CNN on Saturday that those in charge of the field hospitals -- hastily set up during the first wave of the pandemic but largely mothballed since -- were asked on December 23 to get services ready to use.\n\nSome London hospitals are now almost two-thirds full with Covid-19 patients, President of the Royal College of Physicians Andrew Goddard said Saturday.\n\nHis warning came as the UK recorded its highest daily rise in coronavirus cases since the pandemic began, with 57,725 new cases registered Saturday and a further 445 deaths, according to the government's dashboard.\n\nIn an interview with CNN affiliate ITV News, Goddard said: If you look at the data, some of the hospitals in London at the moment... almost two-thirds of their beds that are available are filled with Covid patients and that is just a staggering statistic and has to make us wonder if this is going to happen across the whole of the UK.\n\nThere is no doubt the new variant is more transmissible and the escalation of cases that we've seen in South Wales, London, Essex and the South East has been at a much greater rate than we've seen with the previous strains, Goddard added.\n\nThe emergency field hospitals which may soon come into play are called NHS Nightingale , after the pioneering nurse Florence Nightingale. In London, the huge ExCel convention center in the Docklands area was converted to offer up to 500 beds equipped with ventilators and oxygen. But only a few dozen patients received treatment there in the spring.\n\nQuestions have previously been asked about how the Nightingale hospitals will be staffed given that hospitals are already struggling to meet demand.\n\nAccording to the government's latest healthcare data on January 1, there were 22,534 coronavirus patients in hospitals across England. This is higher than the almost 19,000 during the April peak.\n\nDoctors have made impassioned appeals to the public to stay at home and follow government guidelines on social distancing as hospitals and other health care services come under intense pressure.\n\nIntensive care doctor Rupert Pearse, at the Royal London Hospital in east London, tweeted Saturday that he was working on the Covid ICU again. Almost all my patients are less than 60 years old and previously fit. Some are very young. If you think this disease can't touch you then think again, he said.\n\nIn another message posted Thursday, Pearse said: Media reports of pressures on the NHS are all true. The situation in London is now MUCH worse than the first wave, and still deteriorating. Sad to see long queues of ambulances outside the hospital where I work.\n\nAmbulances are parked outside the NHS Nightingale hospital at the ExCel centre in east London on January 1, 2021.\n\n'Record numbers' of Covid patients\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan told CNN that the capital's hospitals were dealing with record numbers of Covid-19 patients on top of the normal, non-Covid winter surge in demand.\n\nWe now have in the hospitals in London more Covid patients than at any time during this pandemic and the NHS in London, hospitals in London and our fantastic health workers in London are stretched, Khan said Thursday.\n\nKhan said he was concerned about hospitals becoming overwhelmed but added that the NHS had the flexibility to increase capacity, for example by canceling certain routine, elective surgeries.\n\nBut the big worry we do have is, if we continue to see an increase in the virus spreading, it's possible that hospitals won't have the ability to cope and that's particularly the concern because we have not yet reached the normal January, non-Covid peak, he said.\n\nAsked whether the military could step in to help with new patients, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told Times Radio on Thursday: Of course we stand ready to help with Nightingales if the critical pressures go beyond the capacity of the existing NHS.\n\nHe said the Army currently had about 5,000 personnel deployed in the Covid-19 response.\n\nA general view of social distancing signs displayed at Coldfall Primary School in Muswell Hill on January 2, 2021 in London, England.\n\nMost of England is now under the toughest level of restrictions to try to limit the virus' spread.\n\nAmid the worsening situation, ministers were forced to reverse a decision to reopen some primary schools in London next week, after coming under pressure from local authorities and teaching unions. All schools in London will now switch to remote learning from Monday, when the new term starts, with only vulnerable and critical worker children allowed to attend in person.\n\nThe change of course came only two days after the UK Department for Education said nine London boroughs and the City of London would keep primary schools open, while those in 23 other boroughs would remain closed. Khan tweeted Friday that the government had finally seen sense and U-turned on its plan to open schools in some areas.\n\nVaccine roll-out plan\n\nThe UK government is pinning its hopes for a route out of disaster on a swift roll-out of the two vaccines now approved for use by the national regulatory agency.\n\nMore than half a million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine will be available from Monday, according to UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock, with millions more to follow in the coming weeks.\n\nBatches of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine began arriving Saturday at hospitals in England, the PA news agency reported. Among the first to receive a batch was the Princess Royal Hospital in Haywards Heath, West Sussex.\n\nDr. George Findlay, chief medical officer and deputy chief executive for the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust, said the hospital expected to give the vaccine to hundreds of people a day starting from next week.\n\nThe vaccine is cheaper and easier to distribute than the Pfizer/BioNTech jab, approved for use in the UK in early December, because it can be kept at regular refrigerator temperatures for at least six months.\n\nPlans announced Wednesday by the head of the UK's medicines regulator, MHRA, to delay giving second doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in order to prioritize first doses for as many vulnerable people as possible have prompted opposition from doctors' groups.\n\nThe new strategy means that the interval between doses could be extended to up to 12 weeks, instead of the three weeks previously stipulated. However, Pfizer has said it has no data to show that just a single dose of its vaccine would provide protection against the disease after more than 21 days.\n\nThe deputy chairman of the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, Anthony Harnden, defended the dosing strategy in an interview Saturday with the BBC.\n\nWe're not saying you shouldn't have a second dose. We're saying the second dose can be temporarily delayed to get more people vaccinated, Harnden said. We're in a dire situation in this country at the moment, the virus is rapidly spreading and the more vaccine we can get into these priority groups, the more deaths and hospitalizations we can prevent.\n\nUK regulators have also advised giving the second dose of the newly approved Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine four to 12 weeks later.\n\nPublic Health England's Head of Immunisations Dr. Mary Ramsay said Saturday that mixing Covid-19 vaccines is not recommended . Her comment clarified the UK's position on vaccine mixing after an update to the government's vaccine playbook on December 31 said the interchangeability of Covid-19 vaccines was a reasonable option.\n\nMembers of the public are seen on a quiet Princess Street on Hogmanay on December 31, 2020 in Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\nNew variant more prevalent in under-20s\n\nEven if the government achieves its aim of swiftly inoculating millions of elderly and clinically vulnerable people, thereby reducing Covid-related hospital admissions, the UK faces some tough weeks ahead.\n\nIt is a pretty grim and depressing picture at the moment in England, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van Tam told a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday.\n\nIt is almost certainly true that the NHS has not yet seen the impact of the infections that will have occurred during mixing in Christmas and that unfortunately is rather sobering.\n\nAs of January 1, at least 30 countries, including the United States, had reported cases of the more infectious variant of the coronavirus first detected in the UK.\n\nA study authored by a collaborative team from Imperial College London, University of Edinburgh, Public Health England and others confirmed that the variant had greater transmissibility and was more prevalent in people under 20 years of age.\n\nWhile the study, released Thursday, found that people aged under 20 make up a greater proportion of cases of the new variant of the virus, its authors said it was too early to determine the reasons for this, adding that further research was ongoing.\n\nThere's no evidence that the variant is any more deadly or causes more severe disease, according to health officials.
Kerry wins Iowa; Gephardt to bow out\n\nEdwards in second place; Dean vows to fight on\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa (CNN) -- Iowa Democrats upended the race for their party's presidential nomination Monday night, giving Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts a strong victory and dealing an apparently fatal blow to Rep. Dick Gephardt's run for the White House.\n\nJohn Edwards, a first-term senator from North Carolina, managed a second-place finish, and former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, an early favorite in the polls, was left in third place. Gephardt finished a distant fourth.\n\nStanding on a stage in Des Moines before cheering supporters, the jubilant Kerry christened himself comeback Kerry, echoing the comeback kid line President Clinton used to great effect while battling scandal during the 1992 primary season.\n\nLast night, the New England Patriots won. Tonight, this New Englander won, and you've sent me on the way to the Super Bowl, he said, in a raspy voice, strained by days of intense campaigning.\n\nI make you this pledge -- I have only just begun to fight, Kerry declared. He hurled hard words at the Bush administration, calling its foreign policy arrogant, inept and reckless. (Full story)\n\nEdwards, the first runner-up in Iowa, told his cheering supporters that they started a movement to change this country that will sweep across America. (Full story)\n\nDean's third-place position in Iowa after being widely viewed as the national front-runner going into the caucuses will likely sap his momentum going into next week's New Hampshire primary. (Full story)\n\nGephardt, who was once battling Dean for supremacy in Iowa, indicated he was dropping out. (Full story)\n\nLife will go on because this campaign was never about me, a somber Gephardt told supporters, and he promised to support the party's nominee.\n\nCNN has learned that Gephardt will announce he is dropping out of the race at 1 p.m. Tuesday (2 p.m. ET) at the Americas Center in downtown St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nWith 98 percent of the nearly 2,000 precincts reporting, Kerry won 38 percent of the state convention delegates, with 32 percent for Edwards, 18 percent for Dean and 11 percent for Gephardt, according to figures reported by the Iowa Democratic Party.\n\nThe race tightened in recent days, bringing suspense, surprise and electricity to the Democratic fight.\n\nAn estimated 100,000 to 125,000 Iowans braved single-digit temperatures across the state to attend their precinct caucuses.\n\nThe caucuses attracted considerable attention, but the state's selections don't always mesh with who wins either party's nomination.\n\nFor example, Gephardt won the Iowa caucuses in 1988 but lost the Democratic nomination to Michael Dukakis. That same year, Bob Dole won the GOP caucuses in Iowa, but the nomination went to George H.W. Bush -- father of the sitting president.\n\nDean tried to put the best spin on his finish. We will not quit now or never. We want our country back for ordinary Americans, he shouted to supporters. (Full story)\n\nThe result was a clear disappointment for Gephardt. Industrial unions provided the backbone for his campaign in Iowa. A labor source told CNN it was pretty clear that he was not able to expand beyond that base.\n\nThere wasn't the enthusiasm for Dick, the source said.\n\nOnce viewed as a two-way contest between Dean and Gephardt, the race changed significantly as Kerry and Edwards surged. (Full story)\n\nKerry's strong showing could call into question Dean's front-runner status -- as determined by various national polls, fund raising and endorsements -- and it likely elevates the importance of the primary in New Hampshire next Tuesday. (Analysts examine Iowa fallout)\n\nRep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio had 1 percent in the Iowa caucuses, and civil right activist the Rev. Al Sharpton trailed him.\n\nTwo other Democratic hopefuls -- retired Army Gen. Wesley Clark, who places second to Dean in national polls, and Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut -- skipped Iowa to concentrate on the New Hampshire primary. (CNN.com's interactive Election Calendar)
(CNN) After a US patient contracted novel coronavirus and left medical authorities no clues as to where it came from, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has begun sending out new testing guidance to health care workers, the top CDC official said Thursday.\n\nA patient in California who has cornonavirus didn't travel anywhere known to have the virus, the CDC announced Wednesday night. And the patient wasn't exposed to anyone known to be infected.\n\nThe patient is in serious condition, Rep. John Garamendi, who represents the district in California where the patient is from, told CNN's OutFront with Erin Burnett.\n\nWhether this person can actually talk or not is of question. She's been intubated, and so may not be in a position to discuss it, he said.\n\nEarlier in the outbreak, CDC guidance to doctors in the United States was that a patient had to have a travel history to China or be a close contact of someone who had been there before being tested, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said.\n\nThe new patient who prompted the guidance change was transferred from another Northern California hospital last week.\n\nAccording to a letter from UC Davis Health, the patient did not fit the existing CDC criteria for Covid-19, a test was not immediately administered. After doctors persisted in their request for the test, on Sunday, CDC went ahead with testing.\n\nThat patient became the first US case of unknown origin, according to the CDC. It could be the first US case of community spread of the virus, when the source of the infection is unknown.\n\nAs soon as that case was recognized, we met and we revised our case definition for persons under investigation, Redfield said. Today, that has been posted (to the CDC website) along with a new health advisory that the recommendation should be when a clinician or individual suspects coronavirus, then we should be able to get a test for coronavirus.\n\nThe mysterious nature of this case is significant, said Dr. Dean Blumberg, an infectious disease specialist at UC Davis Medical Center.\n\nThat suggests that the virus is out there in the community, and that means pretty much that everybody's at risk, he told CNN affiliate KCRA . We don't know who might be carrying it. We don't know who we can get it from.\n\nAs for whoever passed the virus to the UC Davis patient, that other person probably exposed other people, Blumberg said.\n\nAnd you have to realize that this virus is so new, that none of us have any immunity to it. So, anybody who's exposed is at high risk of getting infected with this.\n\nHealth officials are now trying to trace those who may have been in contact with the UC Davis patient.\n\nWe currently have people in the field working in the community from the local, from the state and also from the CDC, said Dr. Sonia Angell, director of the California Department of Public Health.\n\nThey're contacting any individuals who might have been exposed, and they're isolating them.\n\nBut Angell emphasized the risk to the general public remains low.\n\nThe United States has 60 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said.\n\n42 are former passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the site of a recent outbreak and quarantine.\n\n3 are Americans recently repatriated from Wuhan, China, the center of the outbreak.\n\n1 patient at UC Davis Medical Center contracted the illness through unknown means.\n\nMost of the other 14 patients either had recently been to China or are a spouse of someone who recently returned from China.\n\n'Simply inadequate' number of test kits so far\n\nThere's been a strain on testing capabilities since novel coronavirus was first detected in the United States last month.\n\nIn the early weeks of the virus, the CDC was the only facility in the United States that could test for the virus.\n\nSince then, coronavirus test kits have been shipped to labs across the country, but some produced inconclusive results . The CDC said it would remake parts of the test kits.\n\nThe UC Davis patient was transferred from another California hospital February 19 with a suspected viral infection, the university hospital's letter said.\n\nUC Davis said it requested CDC testing for Covid-19, the formal name of the virus, because neither Sacramento County nor the California Department of Public Health were conducting testing.\n\nSince the patient did not fit the existing CDC criteria for Covid-19, a test was not immediately administered, the letter says. UC Davis Health does not control the testing process.\n\nThe patient is from Solano County, which declared a local emergency Thursday, allowing it to use funds for response efforts.\n\nMultiple health care personnel were exposed to the patient, Solano County Health and Social Services public health officer Dr. Bela Matyas said.\n\nSince the patient didn't meet the criteria for testing, the patient was not in airborne isolation initially, Matyas said.\n\nHospitals are trying to identify the people who were exposed to the patient to put them into appropriate categories -- whether they need to be under isolation or under quarantine, he added.\n\nSome of the patient's family members are in isolation, he said. The person has no connection to Travis Air Force Base, which is in the county and has seen several repatriation flights from China.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said at least 8,400 people have been monitored locally, but the number of test kits his state has received isn't enough.\n\nWe have just 200 kits, and that's for not just the traditional diagnostic, but also surveillance. It's simply inadequate, Newsom said Thursday. But no longer will that be the case. ... We have been assured of our capacity to significantly, exponentially increase the capacity to test.\n\nBy this weekend, 93 labs across the United States are expected to have testing capabilities, Azar said. And as many as 70 companies are vying to develop a bedside diagnostic test for hospital use.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration has authorized a two-step test that will allow labs other than the CDC to test for the virus, Azar said.\n\nPreviously, the process for testing involved three steps. The third step had been causing some inconclusive results, Azar said.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, the FDA authorized the use of those tests by using just the first and second step (to) provide a definitive diagnostic, Azar said. Forty labs are qualified to already be doing that.\n\nUS is testing treatment\n\nMeanwhile, a clinical trial is underway at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha to evaluate how effective an antiviral drug would be on people diagnosed with coronavirus, the National Institutes of Health said.\n\nThere have been at least 82,056 confirmed cases worldwide and at least 2,800 deaths -- the vast majority in China.\n\nThe drug being tested in the trial, remdesivir, was previously tested in humans for Ebola, but studies found it was ineffective in fighting that disease. It was also tested in MERS and SARS trials in animals.\n\nThere are also clinical trials of the drug going on in China, the NIH said, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases developed the American study to match those studies.\n\nThe first participant in the Omaha trial is an American who was evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.\n\nParticipants will receive 200 milligrams of remdesivir intravenously when they're enrolled and another 100 while they're hospitalized for up to 10 days in total. A placebo group will receive a solution that resembles remdesivir but contains only inactive ingredients, the NIH said.
(CNN) Rev. Raphael Warnock will make history when he becomes Georgia's first Black senator and the first Black Democrat to represent a southern state in the Senate.\n\nOnce sworn in, Warnock will be the 11th African American to serve in the US Senate -- a group that includes former President Barack Obama, who served as a US senator from Illinois, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, who is a US senator from California.\n\nOn Wednesday, Warnock told CNN's John Berman that his victory was stunning, but I think in America anything is possible.\n\nThat's why I love this country so much and I refuse to give in to the forces of cynicism. It takes hard work. Change is slow, often it comes in fits and starts, he said. Our democracy tends to expand and then there are moments when it contracts.\n\nWarnock's projected victory is a significant breakthrough for African Americans in southern politics as his election is the culmination of years of voter registration drives conducted by former state House Democratic leader Stacey Abrams and other Black activists, who also helped flip Georgia blue this past presidential election. Warnock will also be the first Georgia Democrat elected to the Senate in 20 years.\n\nIn 2013, Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, became the first African American to represent a southern state in the Senate since Reconstruction. America's first two Black senators, Hiram Revels and Blanche Bruce, were both Republicans elected by the Mississippi state legislature to represent the state during Reconstruction. More than 80 years later, Edward Brooke, a Republican from Massachusetts, would be the first African American elected to the US Senate by popular vote in 1966 and the third Black senator. Warnock, along with Scott and Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, will be the US Senate's only Black politicians. Harris will step down later in January when she's sworn in as vice president.\n\nA senior campaign aide for Warnock told CNN's Kyung Lah that the campaign believes Democratic runoff voters were driven to vote for Warnock based on his message and the hopes of sending the first Black senator from Georgia to the US Senate, rather than out of anger at President Donald Trump.\n\nI am an iteration and an example of the American dream, Warnock said on CNN's New Day, adding that he's deeply honored that Georgians would place their trust in him.\n\nWarnock grew up in Savannah, Georgia, in public housing, the 11th out of 12 children. He's the first college graduate in his family, having attended Morehouse College, a historically Black college in Atlanta. And he's the senior pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church where Martin Luther King Jr. preached.\n\nWarnock's father, the late Rev. Jonathan Warnock , was born in 1917 in the Jim Crow South and was a World War II veteran. Warnock tells the story of how his father, dressed in his military fatigues, was asked to give up his seat on a bus to a White teenager.\n\nHe never gave in to bitterness. He never gave in to resentment, Warnock said during a campaign rally earlier this month in Macon, Georgia. He taught me to love America because he had lived long enough to see the arc of change in his own lifetime, and he knew if we worked hard enough that together if we built a multiracial coalition of conscious, we can bring change that allows the country to live up to its ideals.\n\nWarnock's mother, Rev. Verlene Warnock, grew up in Waycross and worked picking cotton and tobacco in the 1950s.\n\nIn a speech Tuesday night, Warnock thanked supporters, paid tribute to his mother and highlighted his family history as how emblematic his candidacy is of the American dream.\n\nBecause this is America, the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else's cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator, Warnock said in his remarks.\n\nI stand before you as a man who knows that the improbable journey that led me to this place in this historic moment in America could only happen here, he added.
(CNN) President-elect Joe Biden will make remarks Wednesday focusing on delivering relief to small businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic with a focus on helping minority-owned businesses, a transition spokesperson tells CNN.\n\nThe planned speech in Wilmington, Delaware, the details of which were shared first with CNN, will come as a group of Republicans in the House and Senate mount a futile effort Wednesday to block the counting of the electoral votes that delivered the presidency to Biden.\n\nA source close to the transition said the president-elect's plans to keep the focus on the coronavirus pandemic amid these attempts highlights a longtime strategy from Biden and his advisers to keep their eye on the tasks at hand and not give oxygen to President Donald Trump's baseless attempts to undermine the election.\n\nBiden will outline his commitment to ensuring direct relief reaches the small businesses that need help the most, with a focus on Black, Hispanic, Asian and Native American small business owners who need additional resources to reopen and rebuild, a transition spokesperson said.\n\nHe will also reiterate his commitment to rooting out waste, fraud and abuse and ensuring federal assistance goes to the businesses who not only deserve it, but are playing a role in rebuilding their communities, the spokesperson said.\n\nRead More
(CNN) —\n\nIt started with one woman. Then it became dozens.\n\nBy the time Larry Nassar was sentenced on Wednesday for criminal sexual conduct, 156 people had appeared in a Michigan courtroom to share stories of sexual assault at the disgraced doctor's hands.\n\nThe former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University doctor received a prison term of up to 175 years. But Olympic champion Aly Raisman said she doesn't think justice has been served.\n\nIt's not something where you just instantly feel better, Raisman told NBC's Today show Thursday.\n\nWe need to hold these organizations accountable – USA Gymnastics, United States Olympic Committee, MSU. They need an independent investigation. This is bigger than Larry Nassar.\n\nRaisman, who famously lambasted Nassar during his sentencing hearing, is far from alone. In a news conference after sentencing, survivor Kaylee Lorincz called for accountability for the people and institutions that fed Nassar his victims.\n\nAnd many said the problem extends beyond the sports world.\n\nLarry is sentenced, but there's still so much more work to to do, survivor Lindsey Lemke said. We're not going to heal all the way until we know exactly who knew what, when, and how they're going to fix it.\n\nCelebration, then silence\n\nAfter she won gold medals in the last two Olympics, Raisman said USAG and USOC were quick to celebrate and capitalize on her success.\n\nBut since she testified about Nassar's abuse, Raisman said, she's heard nothing from those two organizations.\n\nI have not been contacted by anyone, she told Today on Thursday.\n\nRaisman said she believes the culture of such organizations contributes to their silence.\n\nFor so long, they put medals, reputation and money over the safety of athletes, she said.\n\nBut survivors of Nassar's abuse are speaking up louder than ever.\n\nStrength in numbers\n\nPHOTO: WDIV\n\nWhen she testified on day one, Kyle Stephens said a mood of fear and apprehension was palpable in the courtroom. As more people stepped up to the podium to read victim impact statements, she said the tone shifted.\n\nYou could really feel the momentum in the courtroom begin to pick up, she said.\n\nStephens linked what the women did to broader efforts to stem sexual violence as part of the #MeToo movement.\n\nI'm really proud that we were able to start something that I think has snowballed and grown outside the courtroom, said Stephens, the first woman to testify in Nassar's sentencing. But the army is not limited to Larry Nassar's victims.\n\nTarana Burke, the woman credited with launching the Me Too movement a decade ago, praised the courage and camaraderie of Nassar's survivors, saying they embodied the movement's power.\n\nIt's about survivors drawing strength from other survivors, Burke tweeted Thursday.\n\nWoke up with the brave Olympic gymnast and all the girls who testified against LN on my heart. They are the embodiment of the #metoo MOVEMENT. It's about survivors drawing strength from other survivors. @Aly_Raisman is a hero and so are all of the others. 💕 — Tarana (@TaranaBurke) January 25, 2018\n\nSurvivors find their voices\n\nInitially, 88 survivors wanted to speak at Nassar's sentencing hearing, and most of them did not want to be publicly identified, prosecutor Angela Povilaitis said. Each day, the number of people willing to step up and be identified grew, she said.\n\nI absolutely believe they took that shame and they put it on him. And they no longer had to carry that around, because they did nothing wrong.\n\nIt was a cumulative effect, said Larissa Boyce. At first, most people wanted to remain anonymous. Then, with each person's statement, they saw a chance to reclaim what Nassar had stolen from them.\n\nIn that courtroom, seeing women start to take back their power, there was really a sense of a shift … of women saying, 'wait a minute, I'm not a number. I am a name. I am a real person,' Boyce said.\n\nAs a teen gymnast, Boyce said she told an MSU coach that she was uncomfortable with the intravaginal treatments Nassar performed on her for an injury. She said her concerns were not only ignored, but she was made to think that she had maligned a respected doctor.\n\nIn the courtroom, everything changed, she said.\n\nBecause we were backed by such a wonderful army who we knew experienced the same things, we just started gaining confidence.\n\nActress Akemi Look, a former member of USAG's rhythmic national team, submitted a written statement to the judge. Prosecutors read it aloud in court on day two of sentencing. Then, Look said the bravery of the other women inspired her to take a last-minute flight to Michigan to stand with them. Because her statement was already shared she could not speak in court. Instead, she spoke at the post-sentencing news conference.\n\nShe commended Judge Rosemarie Aquilina for putting the women's stories at the center of Nassar's sentencing. Throughout the hearing, Aquilina consoled the women and offered words of support.\n\nWe are so grateful for how she has handled so delicately our souls and our lives, Look said. We need change. This needs to end here.\n\nSterling Riethman said she and others had received messages of gratitude from people around the world who have not had the voice to come forward. The messages served as reminders that they're not alone, and that a cultural shift is underway, she said.\n\nWe are just a small part of this movement happening, she said. There is no doubt there is a movement.\n\n'The why and the how has yet to be uncovered'\n\nRachael Denhollander, the first woman to publicly accuse Nassar of sexual abuse, called the sentence a victory. But she demanded further investigation of what she called the worst sexual assault scandal in history, starting with institutions connected to him.\n\nShe identified four by name: Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics, both of whom employed Nassar during his decades of abuse, as well as the United States Olympic Committee and Twistars Gymnastics Club in Michigan, where Nassar admitted to sexually abusing athletes.\n\nAfter the sentencing, MSU, USAG and USOC released statements condemning Nassar's actions and pledging internal investigations. But Denhollander said those statements were too little, too late, and didn't go far enough.\n\nWe survivors have taken our stand. We have demonstrated the desperate need for change at MSU, USAG and organizations like Twistars. But in order to make that change, we must identify each and every breakdown that occurred which allowed Larry to prey on women and children for so long, Denhollander said.\n\nShe called on the media to stay with the story to identify those breakdowns.\n\nThe who, the what, the when and the where was answered this week, as my survivor sisters and I took the stand, she said. But the why and the how has yet to be uncovered.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Michigan State University Lou Anna Simon announced her resignation. But many questions remain unanswered.\n\nWhy could Nassar get away with sexually abusing little girls for so very long? How could two major institutions surrounding him so abhorrently fail at protecting the children and women under their care? Denhollander said.\n\nIt's the biggest sexual assault scandal in history, and we should want to know why it happened. And if we don't, it's not going to get better.

Story highlights I think you see from Occupy Wall Street, you start to see how Brownshirts operated, Bannon said in 2012. You start to see it as instrument of intimidation, bully tactics, he added\n\n(CNN) —\n\nSteve Bannon, chief strategist to President Donald Trump, repeatedly in 2012 interviews equated the Occupy Wall Street movement to Nazi Brownshirts, the paramilitary group that harassed and instigated violence against opponents.\n\nBannon made the comments in appearances to promote his film, Occupy Unmasked, a movie that, according to its official description, reveals the sinister, organized, and highly orchestrated nature of its leaders and their number one goal: Not just to change government, but to destroy it.\n\nIn his interviews and through the film, Bannon argues that the Occupy movement was part of the professional and highly organized left.\n\nIn an interview with Breitbart.tv at the 2012 Conservative Political Action Conference, Bannon argues the media helped the left-wing protesters shift the conversation from deficits and spending towards income inequality. Bannon said you could see this professional left trying to stop people from gathering at CPAC.\n\nTo see government employee unions, to see union thugs, to see anarchists out there to try to stop people from – which you would never see anybody on the right try to do, to stop people from assembling – you see the violent nature. I gotta tell you, this organized left and what you're gonna see in the film, is what I consider the Brownshirts.\n\nI think you see from Occupy Wall Street, you start to see how Brownshirts operated, he adds. You start to see it as instrument of intimidation, bully tactics.\n\nA White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAt a CPAC panel for the film, Bannon made similar comments.\n\nYou see the infrastructure of these Brownshirts, which essentially they are, and what they intend to do to intimidate decent people, Bannon said of the professional left. The victims of this film are some of the most liberal mayors in this country, in Oakland, and in Portland, and in Seattle, and places like that. People that tried to work with these people. You'll see the carnage they leave in their wake.\n\nAnd speaking to radio host Larry Sinclair, Bannon went further, saying he saw moral equivalency between the two groups.\n\nThe Occupy movement is really a combination of the internet, the media, and street thugs. Right? It's a weapon of intimidation, Bannon said in September 2012. It is the moral equivalent today of the Brownshirts of the 1930s. It's going to be used as a weapon of intimidation. People after they see this film, they go–people walk out of the audience frightened.\n\nWe put the cameras down in these groups, and what you see, the images of hatred on these people's faces, is really if you were in the first days of the French revolution.

Yet her career went well beyond that, from her brilliant performance in the movie Ordinary People to her influence as a co-founder of MTM with then-husband Grant Tinker, a TV production powerhouse that produced not only Mary Tyler Moore but many signature programs, including St. Elsewhere, Hill Street Blues and multiple spinoffs from her program, such as Lou Grant and Rhoda.\n\nTinker, the former NBC chairman, died in November, and the loss of both of them in such short order almost feels like the end of a TV era.\n\nHaving started as a dancer – and been featured solely for her legs as the secretary whose face was never seen in the 1950s show Richard Diamond, Private Detective – Moore had to overcome skepticism at the time that a beautiful actress (someone who could famously turn the world on with her smile, as the song went) could also be funny. Her series, moreover, marked a breakthrough in terms of depicting a working woman, one who was single, dated but devoted to her career.\n\nPhotos: Remembering Mary Tyler Moore PHOTO: Bettmann/Getty Images Actress Mary Tyler Moore, whose 1970s TV show helped usher in a new era for women on television, died Wednesday, January 25, her longtime representative Mara Buxbaum said.

While Moore was surrounded by a one-for-the-ages cast, she more than held her own, including what many consider one of the greatest sitcom episodes ever, where Moore's character – after admonishing her co-workers for joking about it – breaks into uncontrollable laughter during a funeral for Chuckles the Clown.\n\nMoore continued to work regularly – in television and on stage – after those shows, while earning plaudits for her work as an advocate for various causes, including diabetes research.\n\nThe memories that linger, though, will for most stem from the glow she brought to the screen in the 1960s and '70s. And thanks to those shows, that hat she tossed skyward during the credits of her eponymous series will never come down.
Looks like Major League Baseball is about to change the game on Pepsi.\n\nOn Monday, the league announced it was dropping the soda company in exchange for a new deal with its biggest rival: Coca-Cola (COKE).\n\nWith the new deal, Coca-Cola becomes the official sponsor of MLB beverages.\n\nThe good news for Pepsi (PEP) lovers is that the deal won't affect its 11 existing partnerships with teams such as the New York Yankees and the Chicago Cubs. Those stadiums will still be able to serve Pepsi, but the rest of them will sell nothing but Coke.\n\nCoca-Cola products are already available in 18 stadiums and one MLB team has a deal with Zevia.\n\nRelated: Under Armour scores first major league deal ever with MLB\n\nThe MLB partnership is the latest in a battle for turf between the two soda giants.\n\nIn 2015, Pepsi won a contract with the NBA -- beating out Coca-Cola, which had that sponsorship for 28 years. Pepsi also currently has deals with the NFL and NHL.\n\nPepsi said in a statement that it loves the great sport of baseball and has had a collaborative, longstanding relationship with the league. The statement also notes that Gatorade, which is owned by Pepsi, is still the official sports fuel partner of MLB.

(CNN) —\n\nThe last 12 months have been rough, to say the least, and the pandemic has taken a severe toll on the personal finances of many Americans. Fortunately, it's a new year, and with any luck, the pandemic will be in our rearview mirror in the near future. Still, the damage has been done, and many people are taking stock and vowing to improve their financial situation in 2021.\n\nBut New Year's resolutions are hard enough to keep even when the world isn't in a pandemic. So we've put together a list of three realistic ways you can start getting your personal finances in order in 2021, along with some of our favorite financial tools that can help you along the way.\n\n1) Pay down a portion of your debt\n\nFirst, note that we said a portion of your debt, not the whole thing. Studies show that the best way to make a New Year's resolution stick is to set specific, obtainable goals, and if you've spent several years — or one very terrible 2020 — getting yourself into debt, it's going to be really hard and frustrating to try to get out of it all at once.\n\nBut you can take several manageable steps to not only pay down some of your debt but to also set yourself up so that the remainder of your debt is easier to pay off down the line. How? By reducing the interest you're paying on your debt.\n\nAccording to WalletHub, the average credit card interest rate on existing accounts was 14.58% in October, and an even higher 17.98% for new accounts. Those extraordinarily high rates make it harder and harder to pay down what you owe, even when you're making your minimum payments on time.\n\nSo how can you lower your interest to a more manageable level? Believe it or not, the best choice is a somewhat counterintuitive one: opening up a new credit card.\n\nWe know what you're thinking, but hang on! We're not advising you to open a new credit card to spend more money. Rather, you'll want to look for a credit card with an introductory balance transfer offer.\n\nPHOTO: iStock A balance transfer credit card can temporarily reduce the interest rate to 0% on your debt.\n\nBalance transfer credit cards are cards that offer a 0% interest rate for a temporary period of time on existing debt that you transfer over from other cards. The intro period can be anywhere between 15 and 20 months, depending on the card.\n\nBy transferring over your debt to a new card with an introductory balance transfer offer, you'll be stopping the interest on that debt for more than a year. And even if you keep paying the same amount that you've been paying each month up until now, you'll be reducing your debt, because a portion of your payment is no longer for an exorbitant amount of interest.\n\nHow can you find credit cards with balance transfer offers? Just check out CNN Underscored's list of the best balance transfer credit cards and see which card might be right for you.\n\nNow, the bad news is that credit card issuers got more stingy during 2020, and it's harder to get approved for a balance transfer credit card than it used to be, especially if you have a low credit score. It's worth trying, but if you get turned down, applying for a personal loan is another option.\n\nThe interest rate on a personal loan is likely to be higher than a credit card introductory balance transfer offer, but it may still be better than sticking with the interest rate you're currently paying. It's also easier to get approved for a personal loan, as there are options for people with all levels of credit, though the worse your credit is, the more you'll pay in interest for a personal loan.\n\nYou can use a personal loan to pay off your existing debt, and with a personal loan, you'll have a set timetable for paying off your debt in full so it doesn't drag on forever. But if you're considering a personal loan, make sure the interest rate on it is lower than what you're currently paying — otherwise, it doesn't make sense to switch.\n\nThere are other factors to consider if you're applying for a personal loan, so if you're thinking about this option, make sure to read our guide on why you might consider a personal loan and how to apply for one. And for more ideas on how to make your debt more manageable in 2021, check out our four steps to getting rid of your credit card debt.\n\n2) Start an emergency fund, then build it over time\n\nIf there's one thing that 2020 taught us, it's the importance of having some sort of savings or emergency fund.\n\nSome people say that, as a rule of thumb, you should have three or six months of living expenses saved up. But if you don't have any savings at all right now, don't try to accumulate six months of savings all at once. Again, your resolutions should be achievable so you have a good chance of accomplishing them and setting yourself up for future wins.\n\nSo instead, make your goal that you'll start an emergency fund in January and add to it each month in 2021. This could be as simple as putting a jar on your kitchen counter with a slot in the lid and dropping your loose change into it each time you get home. That's not going to add up to a ton, but it's still better than doing nothing.\n\nHowever, an even better strategy is to open a savings account and have a portion of your paycheck deposited into it automatically on each payday. This is a concept known as paying yourself first, because you're putting money aside for yourself each month before you start paying your bills, instead of trying to save whatever's left over at the end.\n\nPHOTO: iStock Use a savings account as a modern-day piggy bank to put aside money for a rainy day... or a rainy year like 2020.\n\nYou might be thinking that opening a savings account sounds like a hassle, and 20 years ago, it probably meant a trip to the bank and 45 minutes with a bank employee. But in 2021, you can literally do it from home in about 10 minutes with any of hundreds of online savings account options.\n\nMaybe you're nervous about putting your money with an online bank you aren't familiar with? Then you might consider an option like the American Express High Yield Savings Account, which CNN Underscored recently reviewed. There are other savings accounts that earn more interest, but if you're looking for an established company and an extremely easy and quick way to start, it's a solid choice.\n\nNow, if you're already spending every dime of your income and aren't sure how you're going to find money to put aside for savings, you should take a little time at the start of 2021 to sit down and put together a spending plan.\n\nA spending plan is slightly different from a budget, in that it allows you to choose what you must spend money on each month and then gives you the freedom to do whatever you want with the rest. (Plus, it's more fun to think about making a spending plan than a budget. Everyone likes spending money, right?)\n\nIf you don't know how to make a spending plan, we've got a spending plan guide that will take you through it step by step. And if you're having trouble finding ways to cut back on how much you're spending in order to make room to save some money, check out our ideas on how to reduce three of your major household expenses in just 30 minutes.\n\n3) Improve your credit score (but it doesn't have to be perfect)\n\nCredit scores can be scary and confusing, and there's a lot of misinformation out there about how they're calculated and what affects them. But the one thing that everyone knows for sure is that higher is better when it comes to your credit score. In modern life, your credit score influences everything from how much you'll pay for your car loan to whether you can get a mortgage to buy a home.\n\nSo how do you improve your score? Well, like everything else on our list, you can't go from a poor score to an excellent one all at once. But you don't need to have a perfect credit score to make a difference. While higher is better, even a good score will open new financial doors for you that an average score couldn't.\n\nOf course, the first step to improving your credit score is knowing what your score is to start. CNN Underscored's guide on how to check your credit score has several online options, many of which are free and some of which you might already have access to and don't even know it.\n\nPHOTO: iStock The first step to improving your credit score is knowing your current score.\n\nAnd once you know your credit score, how can you tell if it's good, bad or somewhere in between? The answer is it depends on which credit score you're looking at. That's right — just to make it all more complicated, there are several different credit scoring models that different companies use. But don't worry, because our story on what's a good credit score lays it all out for you.\n\nOnce you know your credit score and where you stand, the best way to increase your score in 2021 is to make sure you're paying all your bills on time each month — making on-time payments is one of the biggest factors used when calculating your credit score. And if debt is dragging down your score, paying off a portion of it using our tips at the top of this story will help your score increase as well.\n\nFinally, while you should be careful of bad credit repair services that don't have a known reputation, one service you can safely use is Experian Boost, which is run by one of the three main credit agencies. Experian Boost can track down a good payment history for services that don't usually appear on your credit report — such as your utility or streaming service bills like Netflix — and improve your score by adding them to your credit file. And best of all, it's free.\n\nBonus: If you're a homeowner, refinance your mortgage\n\nPHOTO: iStock With interest rates at historical lows, mortgage refinancing should be a priority for homeowners in early 2021.\n\nThis one won't apply to everyone, so we're calling it a bonus resolution. But if you have a mortgage on your home and haven't already taken advantage of the market's historically low interest rates, now's the time to consider whether a refinance makes sense.\n\nMany people hesitate to pursue a refinance because the process can be time-consuming and they don't know where to start. While many banks and credit unions offer refinancing options, an easier way to start is with an online lending marketplace, which can provide multiple refinancing offers from different lenders all at once without even having to pick up the phone.\n\nIf you're ready to look into a refinance and want to try an online marketplace, use our guide on the smart way to refinance your mortgage. And if you're thinking about taking cash out of your home with a refinance, make sure to review CNN Underscored's story on the pros and cons of a cash out refinance.\n\nRegardless of how you refinance, you don't want to wait much longer. Lenders expect interest rates to rise in 2021, so if you want to lock in lower rates — and potentially a lower monthly payment on your home for years to come — make it a priority to look into refinancing your mortgage now.\n\nHere are some of CNN Underscored's financial resources to help with your New Year's resolutions:\n\nAnd you can find all our personal finance stories every day at our CNN Underscored Money hub.
New York (CNN Business) Bitcoin prices more than quadrupled in 2020 and surged to a new record above $30,000 this year, but many investors think there's still room for the cryptocurrency to run. Anthony Scaramucci has become the latest bitcoin bull hoping to give the digital currency some legitimacy.\n\nbitcoin XBT Scaramucci's firm, SkyBridge Capital, officially launched the SkyBridge Bitcoin Fund LP on Monday. It's a fund geared towards wealthy investors looking for exposure to the high-flying crypto. The fund currently holds about $310 million worth of. The minimum investment is $50,000.\n\nThe goal of the fund is to provide affluent investors an opportunity to get exposure to bitcoin, said Scaramucci, who famously served eleven days as President Trump's communications director before leaving the White House.\n\nThis is digital gold and it is easier to transfer. We love the scarcity of bitcoin, Scaramucci said in an interview with CNN Business before the fund's launch.\n\nScaramucci cited the fact that there is a finite number of bitcoins that can eventually be mined.\n\nRead More
Should you roll over your retirement plan to your new job (and pay the rollover fee) or let it stay put and incur administrative fees? --Lyra\n\nThere are a few things you can do with your retirement plan when switching jobs -- and some pitfalls to avoid.\n\nFor starters, you can leave it right where it is. You can cash it out (but probably shouldn't). You can also roll it over into your new employer's 401(k) plan, or you can roll it into a separate IRA.\n\nHere are some tips on how to figure out the best choice for you.\n\nDon't cash out\n\nThat hefty balance may look tempting, but the amount of cash you'll end up with will look nothing like it.\n\nMost experts warn against withdrawing funds from your retirement plan because you'll lose too much of it. If you are under the age of 59 ½, you'll be hit with a 10% penalty for cashing out your 401(k). Plus, you'll have to pay income taxes on the withdrawal.\n\nKeep the money where it is\n\nIn general, you are free to leave your money right where it is, even if you no longer work for that company. (Though some employers may not allow you to keep the plan if you have less than $5,000 in your account.)\n\nThere are several factors you want to consider when comparing your old retirement plan to your new one. But fees are an important one.\n\nThere may not be any fees associated with moving your retirement funds from one 401(k) to another -- you shouldn't have to pay to transfer your 401(k) plan from your old job to your new one.\n\nBut there are some other administrative fees all plans have that you'll want to consider.\n\nResearch all of the fees that would affect your investments, and compare them on both plans, said Katherine Fibiger, a certified financial planner with Stratos Wealth Partners. There are also other 'hidden' participant fees and fund expense ratios.\n\nRelated: How do you financially prepare for a career change?\n\nFibiger noted that charges like fund expense ratios -- which are determined by your balance and the plan's rate -- are annual, and can add up. Comparing those fees will give you a good sense of how much each plan costs.\n\nYou'll also want to take a close look at how many investment choices the plan has. Some are limited to a handful of funds with high expense ratios, while other plans offer a lot more choice.\n\nIf you've considered both options and think your old plan is the best one for you, you can keep it. Nothing wrong with holding on to a good thing.\n\nMove your savings to your new 401(k) plan\n\nIf your new employer offers a better deal, you should consider moving your plan over -- especially because there are advantages to consolidating your retirement savings. It's easier to manage fewer accounts, and more likely that you'll make the best choices if you have fewer plans to consider.\n\nRelated: The secret to being a great saver\n\nBy leaving money in an old plan, you're also opening yourself up to certain risks. That plan's investment options could change, or your old employer could go out of business, making it difficult to access the 401(k).\n\nTo avoid accidentally getting hit with penalties and taxes, make sure to transfer the plan directly. That means that instead of having the rollover check made out in your name and moving the money over yourself, you should have the check made out to the custodian of your new plan in a direct transfer.\n\nOpen an IRA\n\nIf neither of your 401(k) plan options have great investment choices or both come with high fees, you may want to think about opening your own rollover IRA, which gives you more control over your investments, and may help you minimize fees.\n\nThere are hundreds of funds you can [hold in] an IRA which have good long-term track records, explained Jon L. Ten Haagen, certified financial planner and founder of Ten Haagen Financial Group. You then have to determine how many years until you will retire so you can decide how much risk you are comfortable taking.\n\nAs with any retirement plan, make sure you research the fees associated with your IRA and choose a low-cost option.\n\nGot a money question for Broke No More?

(CNN) When it comes to spats with managerial rivals, Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho is arguably very much in a league of his own.\n\nHe infamously labeled Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger a voyeur when he was Chelsea manager and has exchanged a series of barbs with former Liverpool, Real Madrid and Inter Milan boss Rafael Benitez -- and the Spaniard's wife.\n\nNot forgetting Mourinho's run-ins with Barcelona, Manchester City and the Chelsea first team during the 2015-16 season, saying he felt betrayed by his players.\n\nEither way it's not befitting as a manager of Manchester United. It seems to be a smoke screen for stale tactics. — Andy Hilton (@Hiltaldo) January 10, 2018\n\nBut his recent verbal jousting with Chelsea manager Antonio Conte really has taken things to a whole new level.\n\nConte has labeled his Portuguese rival a little man and a fake, while Mourinho aimed low by bringing up the match-fixing case in which the Italian was exonerated after an investigation. Ouch.
Source: CNN\n\nThe Amazon is burning -- and humans are likely to blame.\n\nEnvironmental organizations and researchers say the wildfires blazing in the Brazilian rainforest were set by cattle ranchers and loggers who want to clear and utilize the land, emboldened by the country's pro-business president.\n\nThe vast majority of these fires are human-lit, said Christian Poirier, the program director of non-profit organization Amazon Watch. He added that even during dry seasons, the Amazon -- a humid rainforest -- doesn't catch on fire easily, unlike the dry bushland in California or Australia.\n\nFarmers and ranchers have long used fire to clear land, said Poirier, and are likely behind the unusually large number fires burning in the Amazon today.\n\nThe country's space research center (INPE) said this week that the number of fires in Brazil are 80% higher than last year. More than half are in the Amazon region, spelling disaster for the local environment and ecology.\n\nAnd 99% percent of the fires result from human actions either on purpose or by accident, Alberto Setzer, a senior scientist at INPE, said. The burning can range from a small-scale agricultural practice, to new deforestation for a mechanized and modern agribusiness project, Setzer told CNN by email.\n\nThe Amazon forest produces about 20% of the world's oxygen, and is often called the planet's lungs. According to the World Wildlife Fund, if it is irrevocably damaged, it could start emitting carbon instead -- the major driver of climate change.\n\nThe environmental minister, Ricardo Salles, tweeted on Wednesday that the fires were caused by dry weather, wind, and heat. But CNN meteorologist Haley Brink said the fires are definitely human-induced, and can't be attributed to natural causes like lightning strikes.\n\nThis year's fires fit into an established seasonal agricultural pattern, Brink said. It's the best time to burn because the vegetation is dry. [Farmers] wait for the dry season and they start burning and clearing the areas so that their cattle can graze. And that's what we're suspecting is going on down there.\n\nThe peak of the dry season is still to come in September, she added.\n\nCompared to previous years, the destruction this year is unprecedented, Poirier said.\n\nIt's also very difficult to halt human-induced blazes, Lincoln Muniz Alves, a researcher at INPE's Earth System Science Centre, told CNN.\n\nBecause the use of fire is a traditional part of tropical agriculture to clean agricultural land, grazing land, it is very difficult to stop it, Alves said in an email.\n\nEnvironmentalists are blaming Bolsonaro\n\nOrganizations, activists, and social media users worldwide have reacted to the news with alarm. #PrayForTheAmazon and other variations of the hashtag are trending globally on Twitter, with hundreds of thousands of tweets. As images and news of the fire spread, many are demanding accountability from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nWhen Bolsonaro was running for president, he made campaign promises to restore the economy by exploring the Amazon's economic potential. Now, environmental organizations say he has encouraged ranchers, farmers, and loggers to exploit and burn the rainforest like never before with a sense of impunity.\n\nIn a statement, Amazon Watch pointed to widespread local media reports that just last week, farmers had organized a coordinated fire day to burn land for agriculture, inspired by Bolsonaro's rhetoric.\n\nFires are just the most visible symptom of Bolsonaro's policies, and reflect the irresponsibility of the president, said Observatorio do Clima (Climate Observatory) in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe pro-business Bolsonaro has hamstrung Brazil's environmental enforcement agency with budget cuts amounting to $23 million -- official data sent to CNN by Observatorio do Clima shows the enforcement agency's operations have gone down since Bolsonaro was sworn in.\n\nAnd just weeks ago, the director of INPE was fired after a spat with the president. The director had defended satellite data that showed deforestation was 88% higher in June than a year earlier, which Bolsonaro characterized as lies.\n\nBolsonaro, who has previously said he is not Captain Chainsaw in reference to Amazon deforestation, has dismissed accusations of responsibility for the fires. On Wednesday, he speculated that the Amazon fires could have been caused by nonprofit organizations who are suffering from lack of funding, to generate negative attention against me and against the Brazilian government.\n\nPoirier warns that shrugging off the fires could embolden farmers to burn more and land grabbers to illegally occupy, parcel out, and resell plots of land to ranchers. There have previously been attempts to rein in these rainforest mafia -- but these attempted crackdowns are rare and often met with strong public opposition.\n\nAll the while, the Amazon veers toward potential disaster.\n\nThe Amazon is incredibly important for our future, for our ability to stave off the worst of climate change, said Poirier. This isn't hyperbole. We're looking at untold destruction — not just of the Amazon but for our entire planet.
London, England (CNN) -- An independent report released Wednesday into the leaked Climategate e-mails found no evidence to question the rigor and honesty of scientists involved.\n\nThe scandal fueled skepticism about the case for global warming just weeks before world leaders met to agree a global deal on climate change at a United Nations conference in Copenhagen last December.\n\nThe seven-month review, led by Muir Russell, found scientists at the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit (CRU) did not unduly influence reports detailing the scale of the threat of global warming produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nWe went through this very carefully and we concluded that these behaviors did not damage our judgment of the integrity, the honesty, the rigor with which they had operated as scientists, Russell said.\n\nRead the full report\n\nThe 160-page report did however find that the CRU scientists had failed to display the proper degree of openness when it came to dealing with public requests for information.\n\nThey had not shown sufficient openness in the way in which they responded to requests for information about what they were doing, about the data that they were processing, about the stations that they were analyzing, so on, he said.\n\nQ&A: 'Climategate' explained\n\nIn November 2009, the integrity of the CRU and its research were called into question after the publication of more than 1,000 emails, dating back to 1996, to and from scientists employed there.\n\nParticular attention focused on one e-mail from the unit's head, Professor Phil Jones, which referred to a trick being used on data submitted to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1999.\n\nJones wrote: I've just completed Mike's Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years ... to hide the decline.\n\nThe 'Climategate' emails\n\nThe review found the figure supplied for the WMO was in fact misleading, given its subsequent iconic significance (not least the use of a similar figure in the IPCC Third Assessment Report).\n\nIt said: We do not find that it is misleading to curtail reconstructions at some point per se, or to splice data, but we believe that both of these procedures should have been made plain.\n\nOf the language used by the CRU scientists, the report said that it was generally informal, using slang, jargon and acronyms.\n\nIn his submission, Jones told the review that the word 'trick' was not intended to imply any deception, simply the 'best way of doing or dealing with something.'\n\nThe review found, crucially, the e-mails cannot always be relied upon as evidence of what actually occurred, nor indicative of actual behavior that is extreme, exceptional or unprofessional.\n\nDo you believe in global warming?\n\nIn a statement after the report's release, Edward Acton, Vice-Chancellor of the University of East Anglia, expressed hope that report would put an end to the wilder assertions about the climate science community.\n\nWe hope that commentators will accurately reflect what this highly detailed independent report says, and finally lay to rest the conspiracy theories, untruths and misunderstandings that have circulated, he said.\n\nHe announced that Professor Phil Jones, who had stood down as head of the CRU during the review, had accepted a new post of Director of Research at the unit with immediate effect.\n\nIn a statement, Jones said he was extremely relieved the review was over. We have maintained all along that our science is honest and sound and this has been vindicated now by three different independent external bodies, he said.\n\nIn March, a British parliamentary committee cleared Jones of hiding or manipulating data. A separate review in April by Lord Oxburgh found no evidence of impropriety, but said the scientists involved in the e-mails had been disorganized.\n\nClimate scientist Michael Mann, who was referred to in Jones' email about Mike's Nature trick,' said he hoped Wednesday's report would put the bogus, manufactured scandal behind us.\n\nHuman-caused climate change is a reality, and it's about time we get on to a meaningful discussion about what to do about it, he said.\n\nIn early July, Mann was cleared of any wrongdoing relating to the e-mails in a separate investigation by Penn State University. Mann is best known for creating the Hockey Stick graph, a record of temparatures over the past 1,000 years showing a sharp uptick at the start of the 20th century.\n\nAndrew Montford, author of The Hockey Stick Illusion, said Wednesday's report was pretty much as he had expected.\n\nI don't think anyone was expecting Russell to reach any other conclusions than the one he did. It was set up with a preordained conclusion in mind, Montford told CNN.\n\nBrian Hoskins, director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at London's Imperial College said: It seems to me that we've had a lot of reviews, and yet again the science has come out as remarkably robust. However, it is clear that lessons have to be learnt about the conduct of that science.\n\nThe report referred to the CRU as being in the eye of the storm in generating data necessary to address the issue of climate change. It said times had changed since the unit started 30 years ago and scientists needed to be wary of the new arena of comment on the internet.\n\nScience is no longer done as it were amongst consenting scientists in private, producing scientific papers that only they discussed and only they understood. And instead it becomes part of public debate, Russell said.\n\nOne of the things that's really driven that is what they call the blogosphere. It's the fact that there are lots and lots of challengers and critics who get out there and discuss, argue, make suggestions, call for changes and the scientists find themselves in that debate, he said.
If you've yet to save your first $1,000, take comfort in the fact that you're in good company. An estimated 69% of Americans have less than $1,000 in a savings account, and 34% have absolutely no savings at all.\n\nWhether your lack of savings stems from too many bills or not enough self control, here are five tips to help you finally hit that goal.\n\n1. Create a budget\n\nYou might think you have a decent handle on your finances, but without a budget, you'll have a much harder time tracking your spending and finding room to save. It's estimated that only 41% of Americans follow a household budget, so if you're not one of them, it's time to bust out that spreadsheet and get to work.\n\nFirst, start by listing your different spending categories and figuring out how much you spend on each. Next, add up your one-time annual expenses (like warehouse club renewals or roadside assistance membership) and divide that total into 12 so that you're putting money aside each month.\n\nFrom there, you'll be able to see which spending categories offer an opportunity for savings and which are simply non-negotiable (think rent, your car payment, and health insurance premiums).\n\n2. Make small changes\n\nOnce you have that budget in place, take a look at your negotiable spending categories, like leisure and dining out, and commit to reducing them. Cutting out your daily latte won't make you rich, but it can help you accumulate $1,000 a lot faster.\n\nThe same holds true for brown-bagging your lunch, renting a movie and skipping the theater, or eliminating one restaurant meal per month. This isn't to say that you should never indulge in the little things that make you happy, but rather that you should cut back enough to slowly but surely reach your $1,000 goal.\n\nAs an example, Americans spend an average of $10 each time they go out to lunch. If you pack your own lunch three times a week, spending about $4 instead of $10, then you'll save $70 a month with that one change alone.\n\n3. Sell things you don't need\n\nThat unworn clothing stuffed in the back of your closet doesn't need to sit there taking up space. The same goes for old furniture and unused electronics. If you're willing to put in a little time, you can list your unwanted goods online and take in a little extra cash while freeing up valuable space in your home.\n\nCraigslist is a good place to start if you're new to this particular game, as it's one of the few sites that doesn't charge for a listing or take a cut of your proceeds. You might also try posting your wares on your social media platform, asking friends to share, and seeing if anyone bites.\n\nNot sure how much to charge for your old stuff? Trying searching for similar items online to get a comparison point, and price your items based on their age and condition. eBay is a great place to look for used items and get an idea of their value, whether or not you end up selling your own items on the online marketplace.\n\n4. Work a side job\n\nMany of us work hard enough that the idea of a second job seems largely unappealing. But if there's really no wiggle room in your budget, then you may need to generate more income in order to save some money.\n\nThe good news, however, is that you don't have to get extreme. Working two weekends a month, or a few nights a week, could be enough to help you reach your $1,000 goal. Retailers, for example, often need extra hands on deck during the holidays, while certain hotels and restaurants need additional help during the summer months. If you're willing to do the work, it pays to inquire locally to see what opportunities might be available.\n\nIf you have a talent that you can convert into cash -- whether it's writing, creating works of art, or navigating complex computer issues -- even better. Sites like Upwork and Freelancer are a good place to start if you're not sure how to market your skills.\n\n5. Make it automatic\n\nSome people just aren't good savers by nature. If you're committed to socking away $1,000 this year, then be honest about your habits and overcome them by setting up an automatic savings plan.\n\nAll you need to do is arrange to have a portion of each paycheck directed into a savings account, and you'll eliminate the temptation -- and opportunity -- to spend that cash in the first place.\n\nGenerally speaking, you should aim to save at least 10% of each paycheck, but if circumstances don't allow for that right now (say, you're working to pay off high-interest debt), then aim to set aside $84 a month, which should take you to your $1,000 goal in a year's time.\n\nSponsored Content from The Motley Fool:\n\n• 5 Years From Now, You'll Probably Wish You Grabbed These Stocks\n\n• Kansas Man Turns $10,000 into $8 Million\n\n• Shark Tank Just Revealed a Trillion-Dollar Idea\n\nWhile saving $1,000 is a great start, it's unfortunately not enough for most people. Ideally, we should all have emergency savings that cover three to six months' worth of living expenses, so once you hit that $1,000 mark, don't stop there. Rather, keep using these tips to continue your savings efforts. The more money you manage to put away, the more financially secure you'll be at any stage of life.
(CNN) — If there's one drawback to having an authentic 1920s train experience, it's the way Golden Age passengers bathed on their journeys.\n\nThey didn't.\n\nHence, there are no showers or baths aboard the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express -- the luxurious European sleeper train that's known for its romantic old-world charm and fleet of vintage carriages from the 1920s and '30s. But that's about to change.\n\nBelmond, the company that operates the train, has revealed the designs of the three new Grand Suites to be added to the service in March 2018.\n\nEach of the suites will have a double/twin bedroom, a living area -- which includes a dining area and a sofa that can be converted into an additional bed -- as well as an en suite bathroom with shower, washbasin and toilet.\n\nLike the rest of the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, the interior designs of the new rooms will stay true to the train's opulent historical style.\n\nInspired by and named after three of the destinations the train covers -- Venice, Paris and Istanbul -- the carriages will be furnished individually, from Italian Baroque-style silk and glass lamps in the Venice suite to hand-carved timber and lavish metal details in the Istanbul suite.\n\nOther exclusive perks for guests of the Grand Suites include a dedicated steward, bespoke amenities, complimentary caviar on arrival and free flow champagne during the journey.
Jamie Schwaberow/Getty Images\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. — Remember this moment, this time and place and undeniable paradigm shift in college football.\n\nAll at the hands of the generational quarterback—and a generational ass-kicking.\n\nTrevor Lawrence, Clemson wide receiver Justyn Ross said, has no ceiling.\n\nWelcome to a new world in college football, everyone. A decade of the inevitable is over after Clemson's 44-16 dismantling of longtime king Alabama in the national championship game.\n\nLawrence, Clemson's 19-year-old true freshman wunderkind of a quarterback, has changed the way we look at who owns the game.\n\nDing, dong, the witch, finally, is dead.\n\nThearon W. Henderson/Getty Images\n\nI told the guys, 'Screw the NFL, I'm coming back as a graduate assistant to win a couple more national titles,' Clemson senior wide receiver Hunter Renfrow said. It's all set up now.\n\nIt's all set up because Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney built this program with the idea of competing with, and eventually surpassing, Alabama. It's all set up because the first generational quarterback Swinney recruited (Deshaun Watson) pushed the Tigers to the front of the line with a national title win over Alabama in January 2017.\n\nThe second generational quarterback Swinney recruited (Lawrence) then stood tall at the top of the mountain and left no doubt who is leading and who is following.\n\nMoments after the final seconds mercifully melted away for the most dominant dynasty in the modern era—after Clemson road-graded Alabama by holding the ball for the final 10:02 with a you may as well get used to this drive—Watson was circling the field at Levi's Stadium, looking for someone to hug.\n\nVideo Play Button Videos you might like\n\nIt was beautiful, it was perfect, Watson said when asked about this championship season compared to his.\n\nThearon W. Henderson/Getty Images\n\nThen he was asked about Lawrence, who took the program he left and did the unthinkable: beat Nick Saban and Alabama like no team has ever before.\n\nHe's the next big thing, Watson said.\n\nAnd he still has at least two years remaining at Clemson before he leaves for the NFL and some fortunate franchise winds up with the greatest quarterback prospect ever. Start tanking now, fellas.\n\nTwo awful seasons might just be worth it.\n\nHe just kept making plays, Alabama defensive tackle Quinnen Williams said. Every time they needed it, he made it happen. That dude can play.\n\nAs impressive as Clemson's clobbering of Alabama was, there's a compelling reality that still remains: This program is built to win for the long haul. The only thing that kept Clemson from backing up its 2017 national title the next season was average quarterback play in a College Football Playoff semifinal loss to Alabama.\n\nThen Lawrence arrived, and he was so good from the moment he stepped on campus as a midterm enrollee that there was little doubt where the season was headed. It didn't take long for him to beat out starter Kelly Bryant, and it was a short leap to reaffirming what the staff had known for years: He would change the way people looked at Clemson football.\n\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nI first saw him as an eighth-grader, and you could tell right then he was different. He wasn't like anyone else I'd ever seen, Clemson co-offensive coordinator Tony Elliott said. I remember thinking, 'Man, we gotta get this guy.' He was in eighth grade, you know? He was making throws then that seniors in high school don't make.\n\nJust like he was making throws against Alabama that NFL quarterbacks don't make. From the numbers to the field sideline, deep balls with touch, seam throws with zip and anticipation.\n\nThe coverage was there; the throws were better. At one point, Lawrence had completed 8-of-10 passes on third down for 240 yards in his first game against Saban's famed Alabama defense. Earlier in the week, in a rare moment of self-talk, Lawrence admitted, I feel like I was made for this game.\n\nAfter he cut up the Alabama defense like no quarterback has in Saban's 12 seasons in Tuscaloosa, after Saban called him special and phenomenal, Lawrence reverted back to the philosophy and foundation that Swinney has driven into the heads of his players when speaking of the way he played and how it forced Alabama into its worst loss since 1998: Did you see our receivers and offensive line? What I do doesn't happen without them.\n\nLachlan Cunningham/Getty Images\n\nWant to know why Clemson is the new king of college football? Why the Tigers will begin next season at the top of the mountain and still favored to extend their NCAA record of eight straight seasons of not finishing below their preseason ranking (yes, the NCAA keeps track of these things)?\n\nBecause the generational quarterback—the baby-faced, long-haired assassin—made the biggest game of the season look like seven-on-seven pass skels.\n\nBecause this rare talent—a player one NFL scout told Bleacher Report could be the best NFL draft prospect ever by the time he leaves Clemson—made a game for the ages between two 14-0 teams with more than 40 future NFL players look like a fall Saturday rout of Wake Forest.\n\nBecause Clemson has superstar tailback Travis Etienne and emerging star wideouts Tee Higgins and Ross, and a defensive coordinator (Brent Venables) who had Alabama and its point-a-minute offense misfiring the entire game.\n\nBecause when you have a quarterback who can do just about anything, it raises the level of play for everyone and increases the margin of error. It makes good teams great and great teams nearly unbeatable.\n\nIt makes the inevitable suddenly the vulnerable.\n\nEarlier this week, the Clemson quarterbacks were meeting and game-planning, and what should've been cause for concern (see: the Alabama defense) wasn't. The plays in the passing game were right there, right on game tape, with the right throw at the right time.\n\nAnd the right quarterback.\n\nLachlan Cunningham/Getty Images\n\nAlabama did exactly what Clemson expected: loaded up to stop the run and forced Lawrence to make plays in the passing game. Only there was one big problem with that plan: Lawrence's ability to make every throw.\n\nWe saw it. We knew we could have success, Clemson backup quarterback Chase Brice said. We knew they hadn't played against receivers like we have, and they hadn't played against a guy like Trevor. I stood on the sideline and listened to every call and knew where every ball was going every time. [Lawrence] just kept hitting every big play.\n\nMoments after the championship rout, Swinney stood on the stage at Levi's Stadium and announced that Clemson would enjoy this national championship for a couple of days before the first team meeting for 2019 on Friday.\n\nThat was the first team meeting Lawrence attended in 2018, the first time he met his new teammates, and three months before he threw his first pass in pads during spring practice.\n\nThis one might be a little different this time around, Lawrence said with a smile. It will be his team this Friday.\n\nThe generational quarterback standing on top of the college football mountain.\n\nWith the paradigm shift in college football.
Voters in Switzerland have shocked the political establishment by rejecting a reform plan that would have brought the country's corporate tax system in line with international norms.\n\nThe tax reforms, which were widely supported by the business community, would have removed a set of special low-tax privileges that had encouraged many multinational companies to set up shop in Switzerland.\n\nExperts say the future of Switzerland's tax system is now unclear. The vote result could create headaches for firms that had been banking on their implementation, and deter companies who had been considering a move to the country.\n\nThey do not know what [tax] measures will be available... That is not a very solid basis for making investment decisions, Peter Uebelhart, head of tax at KPMG in Switzerland, said in a video statement.\n\nSwitzerland has come under intense pressure from G20 and OECD nations in recent years to clean up its tax system. The country runs the risk of being blacklisted by other nations if it doesn't change its tax system by 2019.\n\nMany voters rejected the tax reform package over fears it might reduce the amount of revenue collected by the government, according to Stefan Kuhn, head of corporate tax at KPMG in Switzerland. That might have lead to tax hikes on the middle class.\n\nThe current tax system gives preferential treatment to some companies with large foreign operations. International tax authorities say the rules amount to unfair corporate subsidies.\n\nMartin Naville, head of the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce, said it's possible that voters didn't understand the complexities of the reforms. The measures were rejected by 59% of voters.\n\nI think it's a very bad day for Switzerland, Naville said. Clearly, the uncertainty and the credibility in the Swiss [system] has taken a massive hit.\n\nRelated: How Europe's elections could be hacked\n\nSwiss authorities say they will move quickly to create a modified tax reform proposal. Naville said he hopes new rules are devised within the next few months.\n\nAll stakeholders now have to take responsibility to develop an acceptable competitive tax system, and to regain credibility regarding the famed political stability which gave Switzerland such an advantageous position, he said in a statement.\n\nNaville hinted that potential tax reforms in the U.S. and U.K. could tempt Swiss-based companies to relocate, putting more pressure on Switzerland's tax base.

(Photo by Ki Price/Getty Images for Ebay)\n\n(CNN Business) —\n\nWall Street is betting that a looming slowdown in economic growth will prevent the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates this year.\n\nThat's a sharp reversal from just a few months ago when markets were bracing for multiple rate hikes as the American economy cruised ahead. It also contradicts the Fed's signals of two rate hikes this year.\n\nBut investors now think there's a greater chance that the Fed cuts rates to juice the economy than lowers them – despite blockbuster economic numbers released on Friday. The December jobs report showed that US payrolls surged by 312,000 jobs and wage growth accelerated to a very healthy level of 3.3%.\n\nIt was a shockingly good number, across-the-board, said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. But the market will look at it as one more sign that last year was the top. How are you going to do better than that? You probably won't.\n\nIt's more evidence of how investors and economists (especially ones at the Fed) seem to be speaking different languages.\n\n44% chance of rate cut\n\nThe odds of at least one rate hike by January 2020 stood at nearly 70% a month ago, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, which measures probabilities based on futures contracts.\n\nBut fears of a severe slowdown – or even recession – caused investors to rethink things. The odds of a rate cut over the next year plummeted to zero on Thursday, a day when the Dow plunged 660 points.\n\nThe robust December jobs report didn't move the needle much. The odds of at least one rate hike by January 2020 ticked up to 1.8% on Friday, according to CME.\n\nThere is no way the Fed could raise rates under current circumstances, said Brian Rose, senior Americas economist at UBS Wealth Management.\n\nInvestors in the futures market see a 44% chance of the Fed coming to the rescue with a rate cut over that time frame. That's down from 59.3% on Thursday, but well above the 5.2% chance a month ago.\n\nIn other words, Wall Street thinks the Fed is done – at least for now.\n\nIt's absolutely contrary to the Fed's guidance, said Colas. He noted that the two-year Treasury yield, which is very sensitive to rate hikes, is barely trading above the Fed's target.\n\nPowell promises patience\n\nThe central bank indicated at last month's meeting that the economy likely warranted two rate increases in 2019.\n\nJerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, struck a more cautious stance on Friday about future moves.\n\nWhile Powell called the December jobs report very strong, he stressed that the Fed is always prepared to shift the stance of policy if needed.\n\nWe will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves, Powell said at the annual American Economics Association conference. His comments helped lift the Dow 700 points on Friday.\n\nMohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, said it's far too early for the Fed to take a victory lap because the balance of risks remain tilted to the downside.\n\nThey'll keep their options wide open. But they won't say, 'I told you so,' El-Erian told CNN International on Friday.\n\nAnd just because the futures market is pricing in little chance of a rate hike, doesn't mean it's right. Those bets would change significantly if the US economy proves more resilient than investors think.\n\nToday's jobs report shows that the picture can change fairly substantially in a short period of time, said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC.\n\nFaucher said the market might be underpricing the chance that continued solid growth will lead the Fed to raise rates in the middle of the year.\n\nTrouble ahead?\n\nOne reason why the jobs report hasn't shifted Wall Street's thinking on rates much is that hiring is often viewed as a coincidental to slightly lagging indicator.\n\nMarkets are looking ahead – and the future doesn't look as rosy.\n\nFor instance, the ISM manufacturing index, a leading indicator, showed that US factory activity slowed in December at the fastest pace since the Great Recession. While the closely-watched barometer remains firmly in expansionary territory, it also declined to a two-year low due to pressure from China's slowdown and the trade war.\n\nThe bleak ISM report added to other worrying signs. Almost half of US CFOs expect a 2019 recession in the United States. China's vast manufacturing sector tumbled into contraction last month. And Apple blamed weakness in China and trade tensions for a big sales miss.\n\nYou're seeing a synchronized slowdown in the two most important economies in the world, said Colas.

There's no official tally, but there are reports of closures of a day or more in at least a dozen states because so many students and teachers are ill.\n\nAt least 37 children have died due to flu-related causes this season, according to the latest numbers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – and agency officials said there are still many more weeks of flu season to come for most of the country.\n\nThe Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy in suburban Chicago is one of them. For the first time in its 30-year history, the Aurora school closed for almost a week due to the flu. On Friday, January 19 there were 25 students who stayed out of class due to flu-like symptoms. By Monday, 88 students were sick and 23% of the faculty were sick with flu-like symptoms, too. Since the school is a residential campus for 10th, 11th and 12th graders, and since the illness spread so rapidly, school officials decided to close its campus, under advisement of the local hospital and health department. The students, who come from counties all over the state, were sent home as a preventive measure. Classes are expected to start again on January 29.\n\nDue to high level of influenza cases, IMSA will close today Jan 22 and reopen Monday, Jan 29. https://t.co/JeItgmqilO — IMSA (@IMSA_) January 22, 2018\n\nWe all wanted to nip this in the bud before it got worse, said Tami Armstrong, the school's director of public affairs. The cleaning crew, however, did not get the week off. In fact, they got extra work, having to wipe down all the hard surfaces in the dorms and academic buildings to prevent further spread of the flu.\n\nThe Illinois school is not alone.\n\nIn Port St. Joe, Florida, Gulf District Schools Superintendent Jim Norton told CNN the district decided to close school Friday after more than one-quarter of its 1,900 students and one-third of the 150 teachers called out sick this week due to the flu. The schools are scheduled to reopen next week. The announcement on the closing said buildings will be cleaned and sanitized Friday and sick students will be given a change to recover.\n\nSimilarly ,the Russellville School District in Arkansas closed all of its 10 schools Friday January 19 due to the high number of students experiencing flu-like symptoms. Students were back in class on Monday January 22.\n\nIn Oklahoma, the Hugo schools were also closed for a couple of days due to the flu. The district's website said that the schools would be sanitized to keep the flu from spreading. It also offered parents advice on when to know if students were too sick to go to school. A flyer from the Oklahoma Department of Health suggested children might be too sick for school if they have fever, diarrhea or vomiting, rash, cough or sore throat or other conditions and advised parents to talk to the school nurse or administrators about exclusion policies for these or other illnesses.\n\nIn the state of Texas, officials encouraged anyone with symptoms to stay home and to see their health care provider, as antiviral medications may shorten the duration of their illness. Amid an outbreak in San Antonio, one school took that advice and closed for a flu day a couple of weeks ago.\n\nIn Michigan, the Kalamazoo Public Schools website said while most schools were below the health department's 20% flu-related absentee level for closure, as a precaution, all KPS schools will be cleaned and disinfected over the upcoming weekend. Elsehwere in the state on Friday, all Gull Lake Community Schools in Richland were closed due to high illness rates. Activities were canceled, and staff were told not to report, according to the schools' website.\n\nIn Alabama, where the Governor declared a state of emergency on January 11 due to the current flu outbreak, some schools have also been closed including in Huntsville. State health officials asked schools and businesses to consider waiving sick policies.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nWith the pressures to get all the lessons in, a decision to close a school is never easy, but school officials think caution is key when it comes to preventing additional children from getting sick.\n\nIf we hadn't closed when we did, I wouldn't have wanted to be having a conversation with anyone about why more kids were sick and we didn't do our best to keep students safe, said Armstrong of Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy. Their health and well-being is our number one priority.
(CNN) —\n\nCNN Underscored reviews financial products such as credit cards and bank accounts based on their overall value. We may receive a commission through the LendingTree affiliate network if you apply and are approved for a card, but our reporting is always independent and objective.\n\nThe old saying Cash is king might never have been as true as it is right now. While many people like to use their credit card to earn travel points or miles that they can redeem for a once-in-a-lifetime trip, those plans are on hold for many at the moment thanks to the pandemic.\n\nSo, instead of sticking with a credit card that earns rewards for a vacation that isn't happening in the near future, why not consider a credit card that earns you cash back almost instantly? Having money in your pocket today allows you to use that cash on anything you desire — or save it for the future.\n\nInterested? Then check out our list of the best cash back credit cards to decide which one will best fit your needs.\n\nThe best cash back credit cards of 2021\n\nCiti® Double Cash Card: Best overall card for cash back\n\nBlue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express: Best for US supermarkets\n\nChase Freedom Flex: Best for restaurants, including takeout and delivery\n\nCostco Anywhere Visa® Card by Citi: Best for gas purchases\n\nChase Freedom Unlimited: Best for flexibility\n\nInk Business Unlimited Credit Card: Best for small businesses\n\nDiscover it® Cash Back: Best sign-up bonus\n\nU.S. Bank Cash+™ Visa Signature® Card: Best for streaming\n\nBank of America® Cash Rewards credit card: Best for travel\n\nThe information for the Discover it Cash Back, U.S. Bank Cash+ and Bank of America Cash Rewards cards has been collected independently by CNN Underscored. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuers.\n\nWhy did we select these cards as our best cash back credit cards for 2021? CNN Underscored's comprehensive credit card methodology compares every aspect of each cash back credit card to our benchmark credit card to determine which cards can potentially earn you the most cash. So let's dive into the details of each card and see how they stack up.\n\nCiti Double Cash\n\nBest overall card for cash back\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The Citi Double Cash Card is extremely simple, since you earn 2% cash back on every purchase — 1% when you buy and 1% when you pay your statement — all for no annual fee.\n\nThis card is right for: People looking for an easy and straightforward way to earn cash back without having to worry about category bonuses.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 2% cash back on everything — 1% when you make a purchase and another 1% when you pay it off.\n\n18-month 0% introductory rate on balance transfers (13.99% to 23.99% variable afterward).\n\nExpert users can convert the cash back to Citi ThankYou travel points at a ratio of 1 cent per point when combined with the Citi Prestige® Card or Citi Premier℠ Card.\n\nNo annual fee.\n\nSign-up bonus: None.\n\nWhat we like about the Citi Double Cash: When compared to all of the other major no-annual-fee credit cards, the Citi Double Cash offers the highest ongoing flat-rate return on every single purchase. With this card you'll earn 2% in cash back — 1% when you buy something and another 1% when you pay it off — on every purchase you make. There's no maximum on the cash back you can earn, and you don't need to worry about tracking category bonuses.\n\nThe Citi Double Cash also offers a relatively long 18-month introductory 0% interest rate period for balance transfers — a great way to pay off your debt (though make sure you pay it off, because the rate jumps to a variable 13.99% to 23.99% after the introductory offer ends). And you have up to four months after you open the account to make your first balance transfer and still have it qualify for the introductory offer.\n\nRelated: Read CNN Underscored's list of the best balance transfer credit cards.\n\nExperts will enjoy pairing this card with one of the premium Citi ThankYou credit cards, such as the Citi Premier or Citi Prestige. That's because if you also have a premium ThankYou card, you can actually convert your cash back from the Citi Double Cash to Citi ThankYou points and then transfer those points to one of Citi's airline partners or redeem them for airfare at 1.25 cents per point when going through the Citi travel portal with the Citi Premier (though this rate will drop to 1 cent per point after April 21, 2021).\n\nOne thing that could be better: Although the Citi Double Cash card will earn you the most cash back on your everyday purchases, it doesn't have any category bonuses. This can be a downside if you routinely make a large number of purchases in a particular category.\n\nYou'll also find that the Citi Double Cash doesn't come with many perks, such as travel or purchase protections. This is also not the card to use for international purchases, as you'll be charged a 3% foreign transaction fee when you're overseas, which more than offsets the rewards you'd earn.\n\nWhy it's our benchmark card: The ease of use and straightforward top-of-market cash back earning rate of the Citi Double Cash are why CNN Underscored currently uses the Double Cash as our benchmark credit card to compare the features of other credit cards and determine if they're better or worse overall.\n\nYou can read more about our benchmark credit card concept in our credit card methodology guide or dig into our complete review of the Citi Double Cash.\n\nLearn more and apply for the Citi Double Cash Card.\n\nBlue Cash Preferred by American Express\n\nBest for US supermarkets\n\nPHOTO: iStock Earn bonus cash back at US supermarkets with the Blue Cash Preferred credit card.\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express earns 6% cash back at US supermarkets (up to $6,000 per year in purchases, then 1%), making it one of the best credit cards year after year for buying groceries.\n\nThis card is right for: People who spend a significant amount of money at US supermarkets but who also want to avoid high interest rates on their purchases for their first year as a card member.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 6% cash back at US supermarkets on up to $6,000 per year in purchases (then 1%) and on select US streaming subscriptions.\n\nEarn 3% cash back at US gas stations and on transit (including taxis/ride-shares, parking, tolls, trains, buses and more).\n\nEarn 1% cash back on everything else.\n\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 12 months (13.99% to 23.99% variable afterward).\n\nPurchase protection and return protection.\n\nCar rental loss and damage insurance.\n\nTerms apply.\n\nWelcome bonus: Earn a $300 statement credit after you spend $3,000 in purchases on your new card within the first six months after opening the account, plus get a $0 introductory annual fee for the first year ($95 thereafter).\n\nWhat we like about the Blue Cash Preferred: For many Americans, a significant portion of the monthly family budget goes to supermarket and gas station expenses. The Blue Cash Preferred card dials up the bonus cash back on those two categories, creating a go-to in your wallet for these routine purchases.\n\nNot only will you earn extra cash back in the grocery and gas departments, but you'll also earn a significant amount of cash back on all your US streaming subscriptions. This includes over 20 different providers, such as Disney+, HBO, Netflix, Spotify and YouTube TV, among others. And when transit starts to make a comeback, you'll also get a nice return there as well, with 3% cash back on those transactions.\n\nRelated: Earn more rewards on your groceries with these credit cards.\n\nThe Blue Cash Preferred also comes with a solid return protection policy, which can come in handy during the upcoming holiday season. Return protection allows you to return an eligible item within 90 days from the day of purchase if the merchant won't take it back. As long as you used your Blue Cash Preferred to pay for it, American Express will refund the full purchase price (excluding shipping and handling). Claims are capped at $300 per item, up to a maximum of $1,000 per card account per calendar year.\n\nOne thing that could be better: Many of the bonus categories on the Blue Cash Preferred are limited to purchases made within the United States. There's also a 2.7% foreign transaction fee on the card, which doesn't make this an ideal choice for international travel. And the card has a $95 annual fee, which is significantly higher than many other credit cards offering cash back.\n\nThe Blue Cash Preferred currently comes with a $0 introductory annual fee for the first year, then $95 thereafter. But if you prefer a card that never has an annual fee and also offers a strong return on groceries, you might consider the Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express instead.\n\nWhile the Blue Cash Everyday earns a lower 3% cash back at US supermarkets (up to $6,000 per year, then 1%), it has no annual fee. That means if you spend less than $3,166 in grocery purchases annually, it could be a better choice.\n\nRelated: Amex Blue Cash Preferred vs. Amex Blue Cash Everyday.\n\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Welcome bonus, an introductory interest rate on purchases, return protection and car rental damage coverage.\n\nWhere our benchmark card is better: The Citi Double Cash has an introductory interest rate on balance transfers, and its cash back can be converted to Citi ThankYou travel points when combined with the Citi Prestige Card or Citi Premier Card.\n\nLearn more and apply for the Blue Cash Preferred Card.\n\nChase Freedom Flex\n\nBest for restaurants, including takeout and delivery\n\nPHOTO: Chase The Chase Freedom Flex has both fixed and rotating bonus categories.\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The new Chase Freedom Flex credit card offers both fixed category bonuses — including one specifically for dining — and a set of rotating category bonuses, plus cell phone protection as well.\n\nThis card is right for: People who are looking for a no-annual-fee card that earns bonus cash back at restaurants, even if they're just getting delivery or takeout, as well as in several other categories.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards.\n\nEarn 3% cash back on dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible delivery services.\n\nEarn 3% cash back on drugstore purchases.\n\nEarn 5% cash back on quarterly bonuses categories (up to $1,500 on combined purchases).\n\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\n\nCash back can be transferred to airline and hotel travel programs when combined with select Chase Ultimate Rewards cards, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card\n\nCell phone protection.\n\nNo annual fee.\n\nSign-up bonus: Earn $200 bonus cash back after you spend $500 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account.\n\nWhat we like about the Chase Freedom Flex: While you might sign up for the Chase Freedom Flex for its sign-up bonus, it'll likely become one of your long-term go-to cards, thanks to its rotating 5% bonus categories and ongoing 3% category bonuses at restaurants and drugstores.\n\nThe Chase Freedom Flex earns 5% on travel booked through Chase Ultimate Rewards, 3% at drugstores and 3% at restaurants. And even if you're not physically eating out at restaurants right now, you'll still receive the increased cash back on takeout and eligible delivery orders.\n\nBut in addition to those three fixed bonus categories, the card offers a set of 5% bonus categories that rotate each quarter. For the current quarter from January through March, the categories are wholesale clubs, internet, cable and phone services, and select streaming services, The rotating categories are capped at $1,500 in purchases per quarter, so you can earn as much as $75 in bonus cash.\n\nAside from the bonus categories, this card also comes with many unique benefits that differ from most other Chase cards. One of our favorites is cell phone protection. As long as you use your Chase Freedom Flex to pay your monthly cell phone bill, you'll be covered against theft or damage to your phone, up to $800 per claim and $1,000 per year, with a $50 deductible per claim and a maximum of two claims in a 12-month period. This is currently the only no-annual-fee Chase credit card that offers this highly sought-after benefit.\n\nOne thing that could be better: While there's no maximum on how much cash back you can earn in the three fixed bonus categories, the rotating 5% cash back categories do have that $1,500 cap in purchases — after that, you'll only earn 1% cash back in those categories for the rest of the quarter. And you'll need to remember to activate the rotating categories each quarter in order to earn bonus cash back in them.\n\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, category bonuses and cell phone protection.\n\nWhere our benchmark card is better: The Citi Double Cash has an introductory rate on balance transfers.\n\nLearn more and apply for the Chase Freedom Flex.\n\nCostco Anywhere Visa\n\nBest for gas purchases\n\nPHOTO: iStock Earn bonus cash back on gasoline purchases, both at Costco and other gas stations.\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi offers big rewards on many practical purchases, such as 4% cash back on eligible gas purchases worldwide (capped at the first $7,000 in purchases per year, then 1% thereafter), 3% cash back at restaurants and on eligible travel purchases and 2% cash back on all Costco and costco.com purchases.\n\nThis card is right for: Costco members who want strong rewards when buying at Costco and filling up their gas tank.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 4% cash back on eligible gas purchases worldwide, including Costco gas (capped at the first $7,000 in purchases per year, then 1% thereafter).\n\nEarn 3% cash back at restaurants and on eligible travel purchases.\n\nEarn 2% cash back on all Costco and costco.com purchases (other than Costco gas).\n\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\n\nPurchase protection and extended warranty coverage.\n\nNo foreign transaction fees.\n\nNo annual fee.\n\nSign-up bonus: None.\n\nWhat we like about the Costco Anywhere Visa: For those looking to fill up their vehicle's gas tank, the Costco Anywhere Visa offers the most cash back when compared to other top-earning credit cards.\n\nEarning 4% cash back on all gas purchases worldwide for the first $7,000 per year (1% thereafter) can add up quickly and save you some serious money over the course of the year. And aside from the earning potential on gas, earning 3% cash back at restaurants and eligible travel purchases is on par — and many times better — than what you'll see with other cash back credit cards.\n\nThe Costco Anywhere Visa also offers purchase protection, which is a great benefit for all purchases, especially during the holiday season. You'll be covered if your item is damaged or stolen within 120 days of purchase (90 days for New York residents). The coverage is good for up to $10,000 per item and $50,000 annually.\n\nThe purchase protection applies to items you buy anywhere, not just at Costco. But even while Costco has a favorable return policy for most of its products, electronics and major appliances only have a 90-day return window, which makes the benefits of this credit card extra useful.\n\nAlso, with the card's extended warranty coverage, you'll receive an additional two years of warranty on top of the normal manufacturer's warranty for any products you purchase with the card. Again, this extended warranty benefit applies not only to purchases made at Costco, but also to any other retailer as long as you use your Costco Anywhere Visa as your payment method.\n\nOne thing that could be better: One big disadvantage of the Costco Anywhere Visa is that you have to wait a full year to receive your rewards, which are sent in the form of an annual certificate after your February billing statement closes each year. The certificate can be redeemed for Costco purchases or exchanged for cash at your local Costco store, and will expire if it's not redeemed by December 31 of that calendar year.\n\nAlso, although this card doesn't carry an annual fee, to be a card member, you must have a Costco membership, which starts at $60 per year.\n\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Extended warranty, purchase protection and no foreign transaction fees. Also, the Costco card is a Visa credit card, which is accepted at Costco in-store and at costco.com — Mastercards like the Citi Double Cash are not accepted in-store.\n\nWhere our benchmark card is better: With the Citi Double Cash, you receive your cash back on a monthly basis instead of once a year, and you don't have to physically go into a store to exchange your rewards for cash.\n\nRead our complete Costco Anywhere Visa credit card review.\n\nLearn more and apply for the Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi.\n\nChase Freedom Unlimited\n\nBest for flexibility\n\nPHOTO: iStock Cash back earned with the Chase Freedom Unlimited can also be used as points for travel, and at a greater value, when combined with a premium Chase Ultimate Rewards card.\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: If you want to earn bonus rewards on all your purchases but aren't sure whether you'd prefer cash back or travel rewards, the Chase Freedom Unlimited allows you to do both when paired with the Chase Sapphire Preferred or Chase Sapphire Reserve card.\n\nThis card is right for: People who want maximum flexibility in a no-annual-fee credit card.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards.\n\nEarn 3% cash back on dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible delivery services.\n\nEarn 3% cash back on drugstore purchases.\n\nEarn 1.5% cash back on all other purchases.\n\nExpert users can convert the cash back to flexible travel points when pairing the Freedom Unlimited with a Chase Sapphire Preferred or Reserve card.\n\n15-month 0% introductory rate on purchases (14.99% to 23.74% variable afterward).\n\nNo annual fee.\n\nSign-up bonus: Earn $200 bonus cash back after you spend $500 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account.\n\nWhat we like about the Chase Freedom Unlimited: If you prefer cash back now but think that a dose of adventure is in your future once travel returns to normal, the Chase Freedom Unlimited can give you the best of both worlds.\n\nWhen you pair the Freedom Unlimited with a premium Chase Ultimate Rewards credit card, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred or Chase Sapphire Reserve, you can convert your cash back to travel points at a rate of 1 cent per point. Then, you're able to redeem those points for travel at an increased value of 1.25 to 1.5 cents apiece via the Chase travel portal.\n\nEven better, once you've converted the cash back to points, you can transfer them to any of Chase's 13 airline and hotel loyalty partners. This amazing flexibility is why frequent flyer website The Points Guy values Ultimate Rewards points at 2 cents apiece. At that rate, since you're earning 1.5% cash back in all non-bonus categories with the Freedom Unlimited, you could effectively end up with a 3% return on your everyday purchases.\n\nOne thing that could be better: The Citi Double Cash comes with a higher cash back earning rate on everyday purchases, and you can also convert its cash back to travel points in conjunction with a premium Citi card.\n\nBut Citi's travel partners aren't as impressive as Chase's, and while the Double Cash doesn't have any bonus categories, the Freedom Unlimited has the same trio of bonus categories as the Chase Freedom Flex (though you won't receive cell phone protection with the Chase Freedom Unlimited).\n\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, bonus categories, purchase protection, extended warranty protection and an introductory rate on purchases for 15 months.\n\nWhere our benchmark card is better: If you're solely looking to earn flat-rate cash back on every purchase you make, the Citi Double Cash will earn you more on your everyday purchases.\n\nLearn more and apply for the Chase Freedom Unlimited.\n\nInk Business Unlimited\n\nBest for small businesses\n\nPHOTO: iStock Small businesses can earn $750 in bonus cash back when opening a new Ink Business Unlimited credit card.\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: Small business owners can earn 1.5% cash back on all their purchases with the Ink Business Unlimited for no annual fee, and also have the option to convert their cash back to travel rewards down the line.\n\nThis card is right for: Businesses who want flexible cash back rewards from a no-annual-fee credit card.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 1.5% cash back on all purchases.\n\nExpert business users can convert the cash back to flexible travel points when pairing the Ink Business Unlimited with an Ink Business Preferred Credit Card , or a personal Sapphire card.\n\n12-month 0% introductory rate on purchases (13.24% to 19.24% variable afterward).\n\nPrimary rental car insurance.\n\nPurchase protection and extended warranty coverage.\n\nNo annual fee.\n\nSign-up bonus: Earn $750 bonus cash back after you spend $7,500 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account.\n\nWhat we like about the Ink Business Unlimited: If your business is looking for a simple easy-to-understand cash back card, the Ink Business Unlimited is a great, straightforward option. It earns 1.5% cash back on everything your business buys with it, 365 days a year.\n\nAnd if you decide down the line that you'd prefer travel rewards to cash back, you can pair the Ink Business Unlimited with the premium Ink Business Preferred (or alternately, the personal Chase Sapphire Preferred or Chase Sapphire Reserve) and convert your cash back to travel points, then redeem the points for travel or transfer them to any of Chase's 13 airline and hotel loyalty partners.\n\nPlus, right now is a fantastic time to get the Ink Business Unlimited. That's because the card currently comes with the highest sign-up bonus we've ever seen on this card. New card holders can earn $750 in bonus cash back after spending $7,500 in purchases in the first three months after opening the account. That's an unbelievable sign-up bonus for a card that has no annual fee.\n\nOne thing that could be better: You won't want to use the Ink Business Unlimited on overseas purchases, as it charges a 3% foreign transaction fee. And the $7,500 minimum spend requirement to earn the $750 sign-up bonus isn't small, but it should be feasible for any small business that has regular expenses that can be charged to a credit card.\n\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, primary rental car insurance, purchase protection, extended warranty protection and an introductory rate on purchases for 12 months.\n\nWhere our benchmark card is better: If you're solely looking to earn flat-rate cash back on every purchase you make, the Citi Double Cash will earn you more on your everyday purchases.\n\nLearn more and apply for the Ink Business Unlimited.\n\nDiscover it Cash Back\n\nBest sign-up bonus\n\nPHOTO: iStock For its sign-up bonus, the Discover it Cash Back card matches all cash back earned in the first year.\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The rotating categories and cash back match bonus on the Discover it Cash Back card mean you can earn a ton of cash back in the first year you have the card.\n\nThis card is right for: People looking for a card with a great sign-up bonus and who routinely spend money on popular rotating categories — such as groceries, gas stations, restaurants, Amazon.com and more.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 5% cash back in rotating quarterly bonus categories up to $1,500 each quarter (must enroll each quarter to earn 5% cash back).\n\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\n\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 14 months (11.99% to 22.99% variable afterward).\n\n0% introductory APR for 14 months on balance transfers (11.99% to 22.99% variable APR after that) with a 3% intro balance transfer fee, up to 5% fee on future balance transfers (see terms).\n\nNo foreign transaction fees.\n\nNo annual fee.\n\nSign-up bonus: Receive a match of all cash back earned at the end of your first year.\n\nWhat we like about the Discover it Cash Back: Earning 5% cash back on a quarterly basis, up to $1,500 per quarter, allows the cash back to really add up. The current quarterly categories on the Discover it Cash Back card are grocery stores, Walgreens and CVS, while other categories later on the 2021 bonus categories calendar includes gas stations, streaming services, restaurants and more.\n\nOn top of that, all the cash back you earn on the Discover it Cash Back will be matched at the end of the first year for new card holders, making this an ideal card to have if you know you'll be spending a lot on your credit card over the next year. This means those rotating bonus categories are worth 10% in the first year, and all your purchases outside of the bonus categories earn a solid 2% return the first year.\n\nIn addition to a great cash back rewards program, new card holders can also take advantage of a 0% introductory interest on all purchases and balance transfers for the first 14 months from the date of the first transfer, though the rate increases to a variable 11.99% to 2.99% at the end of the 14-month period. There's a 3% intro balance transfer fee that goes up to 5% on future balance transfers (see terms)\n\nRelated: Tight on cash? These credit cards charge 0% interest on purchases.\n\nOne thing that could be better: You won't get paid out on your sign-up bonus until you've had the card for an entire year, whereas many other credit card welcome offers are paid out as soon as you meet the minimum spend requirement. You also need to pay close attention to the cash back calendar and manually activate the categories on the Discover it Cash Back each quarter, online or by phone, before you make purchases in order to earn the bonus cash back.\n\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: No foreign transaction fees or introductory interest on purchases, and the cash back match in the first year equals the earning rate of the Citi Double Cash for everyday purchases and significantly beats it in the bonus categories.\n\nWhere our benchmark card is better: After the first year when the cash back match bonus ends, the Citi Double Cash earns a higher return on everyday purchases.\n\nU.S. Bank Cash+ Visa\n\nBest for streaming\n\nPHOTO: iStock Choose streaming as one of your 5% bonus categories on the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa.\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: Card holders earn 5% cash back in two categories they select from a list — including options like streaming services — every quarter throughout the year, up to $2,000 in purchases per quarter.\n\nThis card is right for: People who want a no-annual-fee credit card that offers the flexibility to earn cash back in the categories that work best for them based on their personal spending habits.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 5% cash back on your first $2,000 in combined credit card purchases each quarter on two categories you choose.\n\nEarn 2% cash back on one other category of your choice.\n\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\n\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 14 months (11.99% to 22.99% variable afterward).\n\n0% introductory APR for 12 billing cycles on balance transfers (13.99% to 23.99% variable APR after that).\n\nNo annual fee.\n\nSign-up bonus: Earn a $150 rewards bonus after you apply online and spend $500 in eligible purchases within the first 90 days of account opening.\n\nWhat we like about the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa: When compared to the other 5% rotating category cards, the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa Signature Card is the only one that allows you to customize your cash back categories to select two that work best for your quarterly spending habits. With the other cards, the increased quarterly categories are selected by the issuer and can't be changed by the card holder.\n\nWith roughly a dozen category options to choose from, the 5% cash back categories on the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa include:\n\nTV, Internet & Streaming Services\n\nCell Phone Providers\n\nDepartment Stores\n\nElectronics Stores\n\nHome Utilities\n\nFurniture Stores\n\nSince streaming services are popular these days, you can select this as one of your two options. And while the Blue Cash Preferred Card by American Express earns slightly more cash back for US streaming services, it comes with a $95 annual fee after the first year, which you won't have to worry about with the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa.\n\nWith the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa, you'll also earn 5% cash back on up to $2,000 in purchases in your two chosen categories during each quarter, where other similar cards cap your cash back at $1,500 during the same time frame. That means you can earn up to an extra $100 cash back per quarter or up to $400 per year.\n\nOn top of the 5% cash back options, you'll also be able to select one category to earn 2% cash back each quarter, with no cap on the amount you can earn. These 2% categories typically includes popular choices such as:\n\nGrocery Stores\n\nGas Stations\n\nRestaurants\n\nOne thing that could be better: You need to activate the cash back categories every quarter on the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa, and you'll only earn the increased 2% or 5% cash back after activation — rewards can't be retroactively applied. This means you truly need to be on top of your credit card and remember the categories that you select on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe 5% cash back options also don't include some more mainstream categories. Instead, everyday purchases, such as buying groceries and filling up your gas tank, are in the inferior 2% cash back bucket.\n\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, selectable bonus categories and an introductory offer on balance transfers.\n\nWhere our benchmark card is better: The Citi Double Cash has a longer introductory offer on balance transfers and earns a higher 2% flat-rate cash back on all your everyday purchases for those who don't want to worry about category bonuses and a maximum cap.\n\nBank of America Cash Rewards\n\nBest for travel\n\nPHOTO: iStock Choose travel as your 3% cash back bonus category on the Bank of America Cash Rewards card.\n\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The Bank of America Cash Rewards credit card allows card holders to select one cash back category — including travel — to earn an increased 3% cash back, but they can change their option on a monthly basis.\n\nThis card is right for: Those looking to increase their cash back for all travel-related purchases without having to pay for an annual fee.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEarn 3% cash back in the category of your choice: gas, online shopping, dining, travel, drugstores or home improvement/furnishings.\n\nEarn 2% cash back at grocery stores and wholesale clubs.\n\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\n\nBank of America Preferred Rewards members earn 25% to 75% more cash back on every purchase.\n\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 12 billing cycles (13.99% to 23.99% variable afterward).\n\nNo annual fee.\n\nSign-up bonus: Earn $200 cash rewards bonus after making at least $1,000 in purchases in the first 90 days of account opening.\n\nWhat we like about the Bank of America Cash Rewards: The Bank of America Cash Rewards card is the only card that allows you to select a category of your choice to earn bonus cash back but where you can change your selection every single month. This allows you to plan ahead and truly maximize your earnings based on upcoming purchases.\n\nThis is also the only no-annual-fee cash back card that will earn you 3% cash back on travel. This includes anything from air travel and hotel stays to car rentals, train travel, tolls and more. While there are other cards that allow you to earn 3x points on travel — such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve card — you're usually looking at a significant annual fee.\n\nWith the Bank of America Cash Rewards, you're capped at a higher $2,500 per quarter to receive the 2% and 3% cash back categories. If you're able to max out the bonus on a quarterly basis on the 3% cash back categories alone, you'll earn you an extra $75 every quarter.\n\nBank of America Preferred Rewards members, which are customers who have at least $20,000 in combined qualifying balances in their Bank of America and/or Merrill investment accounts, can earn an additional 25% to 75% on their rewards earned on the Bank of America Cash Rewards. There are three different tiers, with Gold members earning a 25% bonus, Platinum members a 50% bonus and Platinum Honors members a 75% bonus.\n\nThat means if you're a Preferred Rewards member, you're looking at an increased 3.75% to 5.25% cash back in the 3% cash back categories. Of course, this requires parking a significant amount of money in your Bank of America bank or investment account, but it can pay out extremely well for loyal Bank of America customers.\n\nOn the benefits front, one of the most unique perks of the Bank of America Cash Rewards card is Bank of America's Museums on Us program. Flash your Bank of America Cash Rewards credit card at a participating museum and you'll receive complimentary general admission to more than 225 cultural institutions across the United States on the first full weekend of every month. For museum lovers, this allows you to visit different museums in your city or while traveling for absolutely no cost.\n\nOne thing that could be better: Although the Bank of America Cash Rewards card can earn bonus cash back on your travel purchases, there are very few travel perks that come with this card. If you travel a lot throughout the year and are looking for a card that offers you travel credits, lounge access, complimentary Global Entry or TSA PreCheck and travel protections, you might want to instead consider another travel rewards card, such as the Bank of America®️ Premium Rewards®️ credit card — although it carries a $95 annual fee.\n\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, bonus categories, an introductory offer on purchases and complimentary museum access.\n\nWhere our benchmark card is better: The Citi Double Cash has an introductory offer on balance transfers and earns a higher 2% flat-rate cash back on all your everyday purchases for those who don't want to worry about category bonuses and a maximum cap.\n\nLooking for a credit card that earns travel rewards?

Hong Kong (CNN) The number of confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus has overtaken the 2003 SARS outbreak inside of mainland China, as multiple countries evacuated their citizens from the city at the heart of the outbreak.\n\nAs of Wednesday, there were 6,061 confirmed cases of the virus in mainland China, including 132 deaths, according to Chinese officials. The number of cases grew by around 1,500 from Tuesday, a more than 30% increase. The figures do not include Hong Kong and Macau, both of which have reported a small number of cases.\n\nThere have also been at least 91 cases of the virus reported outside mainland China.\n\nWuhan's Communist Party chief Ma Guoqiang said Tuesday that testing had been streamlined in recent days, leading to a spike in diagnoses. This does not mean the speed of the disease spreading has increased drastically, he added.\n\nAuthorities in China also reported a suspected case of the Wuhan virus in Tibet, previously the only region to have avoided the virus . If confirmed, the spread to Tibet despite the implementation of strict checks on travelers and closing of tourist sites will renew concerns about how easily the virus is transmitted, particularly when people are asymptomatic.\n\nThe semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong, which has reported eight cases of the virus, announced Tuesday it was closing many of its border crossings with mainland China, slashing the number of tourist visas it issues to mainland Chinese visitors, and halving the number of inbound flights from the mainland.\n\nHong Kong has also instructed government employees to work from home for the rest of the week, and requested private companies do the same. The streets and public transport were noticeably quiet on Wednesday morning, the first day back from the Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday vowed to do everything to tackle the demon epidemic.\n\nSpeaking during a meeting with World Health Organization (WHO) director general Tedros Adhanom in Beijing, Xi said the Chinese people are engaging in a serious battle against the outbreak of the new coronavirus.\n\nPeople's lives and health are always the first priority for the Chinese government, and the prevention and control of the epidemic is the most important task at present, so I have been directing and deploying the works myself, Xi added. I believe as long as we can strengthen our confidence, stand together, scientifically prevent and control the epidemic and adopt precise measures, we will definitely defeat this epidemic.\n\nFirst evacuees leave Wuhan\n\nWuhan, the capital city of Hubei province at the center of the virus outbreak, is on effective lockdown and countries have begun repatriating their citizens trapped there.\n\nA flight carrying 206 Japanese nationals arrived in Tokyo Wednesday morning. The passengers are all quarantined on board and those with any pneumonia-like symptoms will be taken to a special medical center for treatment. Passengers without symptoms will be taken to separate hospitals for further screening.\n\nAround 450 more Japanese citizens have not yet departed. Japanese citizens who live close to the Huanan Seafood Market -- pinpointed by Chinese authorities as the likely source of the virus -- and highly populated areas in Wuhan were given priority on the first flight.\n\nA plane carrying approximately 210 US citizens -- mostly diplomats and their families -- has also left Wuhan, according to a State Department spokesperson, bound for Riverside, California via Alaska. More Americans remain in the city, hoping to be evacuated at a later date.\n\nThe plane had originally been destined for California's Ontario International Airport, but officials said late Tuesday that it would instead land at a military base near Riverside. No reason was immediately given for the change in itinerary.\n\nAs of early Wednesday morning, the plane had landed in Anchorage, Alaska, where it will refuel before heading on to the US west coast. The Alaska Department of Health and Social Services said passengers will undergo health screenings there to ensure they are not experiencing coronavirus symptoms before traveling onward.\n\nAfter landing in the US, passengers will be placed in isolation for between three days and two weeks, a California official told CNN earlier. Doctors have previously recommended a two-week quarantine for people exposed to the virus.\n\nSouth Korea and New Zealand are chartering flights to bring their citizens home. More controversially, Australia said it will charter a flight to fetch citizens, but they will be transported to quarantine on Christmas Island, site of a former offshore detention camp for migrants.\n\nVirus spreads worldwide\n\nThe first cases of the coronavirus were detected in Wuhan in mid-December. Since then, the number of confirmed cases has increased exponentially, and infections have been reported worldwide.\n\nHospitals in Wuhan are already massively overstretched, and hundreds of emergency medical personnel have been dispatched to the city to help. Two new hospitals dedicated to treating the virus are also being built on the city's outskirts, due to be operational by next week.\n\nAuthorities in the city said that as of January 27 there were still more than 4,000 Wuhan residents overseas. The Wuhan culture and tourism bureau said that all tour groups were canceled after the lockdown was announced, but groups that left prior to that date were still slowly returning to the city.\n\nMore than a dozen countries have confirmed cases of the Wuhan virus, as authorities struggle to stop its spread.\n\nAcross Asia, many countries have put in extra screening at airports and warned citizens to avoid travel to China. To China's north, neighboring Mongolia has imposed stringent border checks on travelers coming into the country. Indonesia and the Philippines have both introduced extra restrictions on Chinese tourists, while Japan has upgraded its response, allowing authorities to force the suspicious cases for hospitalization and testing.\n\nAround a hundred cases have been reported worldwide, with the most, 14, detected in Thailand, a popular destination for Chinese travelers. Countries with colder climates are more at risk for future spread, as coronaviruses thrive in cold environments and do not transmit as well in sunny, hot locales.\n\nWhile most cases reported outside of China have a direct link to Wuhan, there are indications the virus is beginning to spread within other countries. Three new cases were reported in Germany on Tuesday, including what is believed to be the first human-to-human transmission in Europe.\n\nMultiple countries have advised citizens not to visit China due to the ongoing outbreak. On Tuesday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a level 3 alert advising against all nonessential travel -- its highest alert on a scale of 1 to 3. However, the White House denied reports suggesting it was planning to suspend all flights between the US and China.\n\nCases will continue to spread\n\nWith much of China seeing the type of cold weather ideal for the coronavirus, and uncertainty remaining on just how contagious it is, experts expect the number of cases to continue to rise for several weeks.\n\nSpeaking to state media Tuesday , Zhong Nanshan, one of China's leading respiratory experts and a hero of the 2003 fight against SARS, said he expected the peak to come in up to 10 days.\n\nIt is very difficult to definitely estimate when the outbreak reaches its peak. But I think in one week or about 10 days, it will reach the climax and then there will be no large-scale increases, Zhong said.\n\nHowever, other experts have warned that while the outbreak in Hubei may peak in the coming weeks, other Chinese megacities may see self-sustaining epidemics that continue to spread the pathogen around the country and worldwide.\n\nWe modeled epidemic curves out to August 2020 for all the major city clusters: Chongqing, Shanghai-Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Beijing. Chongqing is predicted to have the largest epidemic due to large population and most intense traffic volume coupled to Wuhan, Gabriel Leung, a leading Hong Kong researcher and public health expert, said earlier this week.\n\nHe said outbreaks in China's largest cities could peak in April or May and gradually slow in June and July.\n\nA laboratory in Australia became the first outside of China to grow the Wuhan coronavirus from a patient sample, it announced Wednesday. Doing so will provide expert international laboratories with crucial information to help combat the virus, the scientists said.\n\nDuring a news conference on Wednesday, Mike Catton, director of the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory said we are proud to have grown the virus in such a short space of time and added they will share this with international colleagues to help with the developments of vaccines and medicines.\n\nCatton added that this successful growth will help us understand the epidemiology of the outbreak.\n\nUPDATE: This article has been updated to reflect the status of a suspected case of the Wuhan coronavirus in Tibet.
Washington (CNN) House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday called Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's supporting a resolution to dismiss the two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump a cover up.\n\nThe dismissing is a cover-up. Dismissing is a cover-up, Pelosi said during an interview on ABC's This Week. If they want to go that route, again the senators who are thinking now about voting for witnesses or not, they will have to be accountable for not having a fair trial.\n\nMcConnell signed onto a resolution from Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri last week to allow for the dismissal of the obstruction of Congress and abuse of power charges against Trump because Pelosi has not yet transferred the articles to the Senate for a trial. Republicans don't have the votes to dismiss the articles.\n\nThe California Democrat, who has so far withheld the articles as congressional leadership disagree on the shape of trial procedures, said in a letter to her caucus on Friday she was prepared to send the articles of impeachment this week.\n\nSpeaker says no 'mystery' on articles of impeachment\n\nRead More
Peniel E. Joseph is the Barbara Jordan chair in ethics and political values and the founding director of the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, where he is also a professor of history. He is the author of several books, most recently,  The Sword and the Shield: The Revolutionary Lives of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.  The views expressed here are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) The victories of the Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff in Georgia put the United States in the midst of truly transformative times.\n\nAmerica's ongoing Third Reconstruction -- a searing effort to literally and figuratively reimagine American democracy as multiracial, antiracist and dedicated to intersectional social justice -- continued Tuesday in the Peach State as the Democratic Senate candidates Warnock and Ossoff defeated Republican incumbents Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue in a runoff election.\n\nWarnock will become the first Black senator to represent Georgia, the home state of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., whose church Warnock presides over and whom the candidate invoked often during his campaign and in his victory speech. It's also a state whose Stone Mountain serves as a violently nostalgic homage to the renewed Ku Klux Klan of the early 20th century.\n\nWarnock is, after South Carolina Republican Tim Scott, just the second African American elected to the US Senate from a Southern state. During Reconstruction, Hiram Revels and Blanche Bruce served brief Senate terms (before senators were elected by popular vote). Crucially, Warnock's victory benefited from the reverse migration of African Americans back South that has followed the Great Migrations of the first half of the 20th century to Northern cities.\n\nThe region is being transformed, political, culturally and economically, by an infusion of residents unbowed by the South's racial past. This wave of change is imbuing the nation with a new self-awareness of its traumatic political past and the opportunities to achieve a different vision of American democracy and society.\n\nEven as Americans struggle to process the horrifying images coming from Washington, DC, of violence at the Capitol, they are also hearing the message of what's happened in Georgia. These victories cannot be muted by riots. They speak loud and clear: America has arrived at a hinge point in our long racial history, an inflection point where history collides with contemporary culture to innovate bold new political directions.\n\ngrassroots political organizing and social movements. Warnock represents the fusion of old and new forms of Southern politics. Atlanta, which once dubbed itself The City Too Busy to Hate, has proven the seeding ground for the kind of political and cultural transformation dreamed of by King but made more readily available in our own time by the combination of demographic changes\n\nRev. Warnock's victory is remarkable in the fact that he consciously ran a campaign rooted in aspects of Martin Luther King's vision of creating a Beloved Community free of racism, economic injustice and poverty. King's I Have a Dream speech referenced Stone Mountain, a living monument to the tattered dreams of White supremacy, as a place where freedom did not yet ring but one day would.\n\nThis moment has been a long time coming, one orchestrated in part through the tireless voting rights advocacy of Black women activists led by Stacey Abrams, the onetime gubernatorial candidate who turned a close loss to Brian Kemp in 2018 into a comeback for the ages . Abrams' political advocacy transcended personal and partisan interests. She proved herself determined to be a service-oriented political and policy leader devoted to a project larger than her individual ambitions -- preserving, protecting and expanding voting rights for Black Americans.\n\nShe received plenty of help. 2020's year of racial and political reckoning, amid a health pandemic that triggered economic devastation and a President and Republican Party openly hostile to honoring election results, helped to galvanize millions of Americans for the first time. The cultural power of a national Black Lives Matter movement inspired people from celebrities to sports figures to become politically engaged.\n\nWNBA players openly endorsed Rev. Warnock , a sign that this New Year is a time for choosing moral sides rather than embracing the kind of neutrality that allows political oppression to grow and expand.\n\nSen. Kelly Loeffler's pointed rejection of the WNBA's racial justice message set stark lines between the two candidates and reflected the cultural divide within the nation. Rev. Warnock was far behind Loeffler when the WNBA's Atlanta Dream started to wear Vote Warnock T-shirts that helped to propel him to the US Senate. The increasing political consciousness of WNBA players was further enhanced by Abrams' position on the board of advocates of the Women's National Basketball Players Association. The players, predominantly Black women, used their athletic platform to spur social change , a move further amplified in the aftermath of George Floyd's killing.\n\nAtlanta's hip-hop artists also played a decisive role in voter turnout, organizing rallies and fundraising in support of Biden and Harris this past November, and then Warnock and Ossoff. Speaking to Rolling Stone, Rapper Young Jeezy explained , If the right people are not in the Senate, it's gonna make it hard for the Biden-Harris administration to do anything they need to do and that they promised to us.\n\nIn truly extraordinary ways, politics and culture have been realigned in service of an expansively inclusive vision of American democracy, one wherein Black athletes, musicians and artists are utilizing their platforms to promote social justice on an unprecedented scale.\n\nThat Georgia, in one fell swoop, could elect two senators, one Black and one Jewish, who will give the Democratic Party control of Congress is not only remarkable, but it echoes the close relationship between these two communities that peaked during the civil rights movement's heroic period. Warnock characterized Ossoff as his brother from another mother and the newly elected Black senator's progressive rhetoric seemed to rub off on Ossoff as Election Day neared.\n\nJUST WATCHED Ossoff wins the Georgia runoff against Perdue, CNN projects Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Ossoff wins the Georgia runoff against Perdue, CNN projects 00:45\n\nFrom Dr. King's relationship with the towering Jewish Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel to the extraordinary numbers of Jewish students who volunteered for 1964's Freedom Summer and locked arms with Black citizens in Selma, Black-Jewish alliances during the civil rights era proved indispensable to achieving the movement's larger goals. In the age of Black Lives Matter, especially since George Floyd's murder, we have witnessed a resurgence of this coalition that is perhaps best symbolized by the dual victories of Warnock and Ossoff. In so doing, this special election illustrated the possible rise of a religious left of Christian and Jewish voters in support of progressive politics in a part of the country long thought to be hopelessly conservative.\n\nBlack voters deserve a special shout-out. Rebuked and scorned historically, abused and traumatized in the present, but in possession of a defiant, faith-fueled dignity, Black folk organized in the face of threats, harassment and potential violence to exercise democratic rights that parts of the nation remain intent on stripping away.\n\nAnd this is not the first time they have displayed such loyalty and love to a country that stubbornly refuses to return these feelings. During America's First Reconstruction after the Civil War, Black men achieved voting rights after 1870 and formed powerful interracial coalitions that led to public schools, better local and national infrastructure, and promised to transform democracy before being repelled through both physical violence and baseless allegations of election fraud of the kind that Trump and Republicans have resurrected today.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWe can see the aftermath of this moment in history still unfolding in the race baiting, unfounded allegations of election fraud and conspiracy theories that have become the hallmark of the modern-day GOP.\n\nGeorgia reminds us that history is not destiny. America always has a choice, an opportunity, a calling to right wrongs, spread justice, do good. 2020's whiplash-inducing days of hope shadowed by racial violence, a global health pandemic and economic inequality might prove to be the growing pains required to become a mature democracy. Tuesday's election outcome illustrates how the national power and resonance of the Black struggle for citizenship and dignity -- in all aspects of society -- holds the key to not just understanding America's past but embracing a more liberated and just future.
You deserve to like your job and to want to go to work each day. Too many people make compromises when it comes to their professional life.\n\nMaybe they sacrifice money for happiness, or maybe it's the other way around. If that's you, and you're not 100% satisfied with your working life, then it's time do something different.\n\nThat's not easy, and in many cases, it's scary. Reward very rarely comes without risk, but if you never take any chances or make any moves, you'll never get anywhere.\n\nYou might try to get a better job in 2018 and fail. However, if that happens, all will not be lost. You will have learned something from trying, and even if you don't get all the way there, odds are you'll be closer to, if not a dream job, at least a better one.\n\n1. Ask for it\n\nIt seems silly, but if what you want is to advance at your current job or with your present employer, you need to speak up. You know what your goals are and where you want to be. Your boss doesn't and he or she may think you are content right where you are.\n\nAsk for a meeting and talk about where you are and where you want to go, Be open to negative feedback and ask what you can do to make your career goals happen.\n\nIt's not likely that you will get promoted simply because you ask for it, but talking could get the ball rolling. Of course, going public with your desires could also lead to you learning that you have farther to go than you think.\n\n2. Plan for it\n\nWhether it's with your current employer or elsewhere, it's best to have a plan. That might be one you create yourself where you plot out the steps needed to obtain a better job or it could be an action plan made with or by your boss.\n\nBe honest in creating your plan and be detailed. Break down any skills you may need or things you clearly need to do in order to get the job you hope for. That might be as specific as get certified in X to something as broad as work on my public speaking skills.\n\n3. Go public\n\nThere are times when a job search needs to be secret. If your current employer won't take it well, then you have to be quiet when you network.\n\nEven if you can't go full-on public, it's still possible to get the word out. Let your closest friends and associates know you're looking to make a move. Attend industry events and make connections. Let those people know what your interests are without specifically saying you are looking.\n\nIt may take subtlety, but there are ways to get word out without your employer knowing you're looking. Of course, every situation varies, so be as bold or as subtle as you need to be.\n\n4. Go for it (with an open mind)\n\nJust because you have one goal in mind does not mean your thinking should consist of getting there or bust. Sometimes there are enjoyable diversions along the way.\n\nHave an open mind and be curious. Sometimes work you never considered is worth pursuing and in other cases an unexpected detour helps you get where you ultimately want to go.\n\nBetter can be a lot of things\n\nA better job is not so easy to define so be open in what you consider. Sometimes, anything different can be better and sometimes a change can show you you're going the wrong way.\n\nRelated links:\n\n• Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy Alert\n\n• This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997\n\n• 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market\n\nMore money or better benefits may be the better that matters now or maybe career satisfaction or locational flexibility is key. For most people, there's no clear answer and sometimes happiness can be found someplace other than where we're looking for it.
Story highlights Susan Antilla: We're enjoying a welcome stretch where women are upending corporate silence on sexual harassment But many harassers still get away with their behavior and lasting change has been hard to come by, she says\n\nEditor's Note: Susan Antilla is an award-winning financial columnist and author of Tales from the Boom-Boom Room: The Landmark Legal Battles that Exposed Wall Street's Shocking Culture of Sexual Harassment. She has written about Wall Street, securities regulation and gender discrimination for The New York Times, Bloomberg, and TheStreet. The views expressed here are her own.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nAn innocent mistake. That's what management of Uber Technologies Inc. reportedly told engineer Susan J. Fowler when she complained in 2015 that her manager was sexually harassing her.\n\nPHOTO: Steve Friedman Susan Antilla\n\nThe boss had sent her a string of suggestive messages. It was clear that he was trying to get me to have sex with him, Fowler wrote Sunday in a stunning 3,000-word essay on her blog that quickly went viral.\n\nFowler took screenshots of the chat session and reported him to human resources. Yessiree, that's sexual harassment all right, HR said. But it was his first offense and he was a high performer, so a warning would suffice, they told her. Just an innocent mistake by a corporate star.\n\nNot to quibble here, but even an HR rookie would know that harassers are not inclined to one-offs. Indeed, Fowler said she later came across other women who'd had similar experiences with the man, who no longer works at Uber.\n\nCEO Travis Kalanick said Monday that he'd hired no less than former US Attorney General Eric Holder to conduct an independent review into the issues Fowler raised. Kalanick had said in a Tweet on Sunday that the behavior Fowler described was abhorrent & against everything we believe in.\n\nIt was an encouraging reaction, but also a head-scratcher. In its dealings with Fowler and the other women she described in her post, did Uber HR go rogue in the face of everything the company's CEO says it believes in? Did the CEO fail to communicate his laudable position to those charged with managing personnel and shaping company culture?\n\nOr, more likely, was this perhaps not the stated priority the CEO says it was? We can only hope that an honest investigation carried out by someone with Holder's experience will produce detailed answers to these questions.\n\nSpokeswoman MoMo Zhou declined to answer specific questions that I sent by email, citing the ongoing investigation.\n\nInvestigating what happened with Fowler and others at Uber is a good thing, but it doesn't change the fact that with the standout exception of employees who the bosses wanted to get rid of anyway, sexual harassers have long enjoyed protection by corporate managements. It isn't just that they often get to keep their jobs. They additionally benefit when, as is common,\n\ncompany policy requires employees to use private arbitration in lieu of suing in court. The tidy arrangement keeps the bad boys from suffering a public record of accusations against them and gives them the opportunity to label their acts of misconduct as first offenses in perpetuity.\n\nAdd to that the standard policy that women who settle their cases agree to remain silent about their experiences and you've got a system that conspires to keep harassers' names securely under wraps.\n\nBy some measures, we're enjoying a welcome stretch where courageous women are upending the corporate cone of silence. Former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson made headlines for months last year after she sued Fox News founder Roger Ailes for sexual harassment. Her case was bolstered by recordings she'd made of Ailes' come-ons and she settled in September for $20 million. Inspired by Carlson's suit, other women came forward with similar accusations against Ailes, including one who spoke in defiance of her confidentiality pact.\n\nCarlson and now Fowler took big chances going public. Lots of women, though, keep their complaints quiet, fearful they'll be blacklisted by future employers. Even for harassment victims willing to endure a public legal battle, though, the ubiquity of mandatory arbitration means many ugly stories go untold.\n\nWhen women assume the risk of going public, it can lead to policy changes. Twenty years ago, a group of female brokers and sales assistants in the Garden City, New York, branch of Smith Barney sued that firm in a sexual harassment and gender discrimination case that became known as the Boom-Boom Room suit, named for a party room in the branch's basement. After initially labeling it an isolated incident – sound familiar? – Smith Barney faced a cascade of similar harassment allegations from branches all over the United States.\n\nSmith Barney paid $150 million in arbitrations and settlements in that case amid rousing talk of real change for women on Wall Street.\n\nBut the policy changes too often lack real staying power. Once the Boom-Boom Room story was no longer making headlines, the old discriminatory policies began to seep back in. By 2005, another lawsuit against Smith Barney was citing discrimination against female brokers. That one settled for $33 million in 2008. And through it all, some harassers held on to their jobs. A male broker who'd attacked a female colleague in Smith Barney's Walnut Creek, California, office in 1990 was at the firm for another 24 years, according to regulatory records.\n\nAt the same time, scholars at the Institute for Women's Policy Research in Washington found that in 2015, women in the securities industry were earning 52 cents for every dollar men made. So much for lasting change, or progress toward equality.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nIs there any solution given a system that favors the employer and the harasser? Yes – and Fowler is Exhibit A. She said on Twitter Sunday night that her revelations led to such a flood of reactions that it shut down her Twitter and Gmail apps. Many of the supporters who stampeded her accounts with attagirls took to social media to say they'd deleted their Uber accounts and suggested others do the same. It took no time for the hashtag #deleteuber – which also swelled in response to Uber's decision to turn off surge pricing during the Taxi Worker's alliance participation in an anti-travel ban protest at JFK – to begin trending on Twitter.\n\nIn other words, money talks and the Internet helps to amplify its voice. Employers have stripped us of many of our rights. But not even an Ivy League band of big-ticket lawyers can figure out a way to stop us taking our business elsewhere when we're sickened by a company's behavior.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.\n\n(The Conversation) Many of us have heard: Don't go outside without a coat; you'll catch a cold.\n\nThat's not exactly true. As with many things, the reality is more complicated. Here's the distinction: Being cold isn't why you get a cold. But it is true that cold weather makes it easier to get the cold or flu. It is still too early to tell how weather impacts the Covid-19 virus, but scientists are starting to think it behaves differently than cold and flu viruses.\n\nAs an associate professor of nursing with a background in public health, I'm asked about this all the time. So here's a look at what actually happens.\n\nMany viruses, including rhinovirus -- the usual culprit in the common cold -- and influenza, remain infectious longer and replicate faster in colder temperatures. That's why these viruses spread more easily in winter. Wearing a heavy coat won't necessarily make a difference.
The Cavs have those infamous T-shirt jerseys. The NFL and NHL are constantly modernizing—or throwing back—their team logos. Even college football, that bastion of traditionalism, has introduced some fire new designs this century.\n\nBaseball? For all of its Iverson-style arm sleeves, its knee-high socks and even the sunglasses, baseball seemingly hasn't wanted to be that cool with on-field fashion. But a new generation is trying to change that, says Tzvi Twersky, the baseball category director at Stance, which recently started its first full season as the official sock of Major League Baseball—on-field knee-highs included.\n\nThe younger guys are getting into it, Twersky says. There might be resistance from some of the older guys or the traditional teams, but as teams have played each other and guys in the minors experienced the socks, it's grown on them. It's a testament to the teams having an open mind and be willing to try something new.\n\nMLB uniforms have barely changed since the Cincinnati Reds became the first professional baseball team in 1869. The button-down jerseys, the pants, the caps, the belts (belts!)—all have changed incrementally, but little has come close to the evolutions in football and basketball gear. As the official switch to Under Armour as MLB's uniform supplier approaches for the 2019 season, baseball franchises are in position to capitalize on new design trends while also invoking nostalgia.\n\n(AP Images/Getty Images)\n\nOftentimes, baseball teams swing and miss badly with new uniforms or reverse course before a look is in style: The huge logos of the '90s have, with the exception of Detroit's new big D throwbacks, largely been replaced; the neon yellow of Kansas City's yesteryear is out in favor of the more subdued alternates from Oakland and Pittsburgh; and let's not even talk about those shorts the White Sox wore during the first game of a doubleheader in '76.\n\nVideo Play Button Videos you might like\n\nMore so than many other sports, America's pastime does have a large group of untouchable classics—the Yankees, Dodgers, Giants, Red Sox and Cardinals, just to name a few.\n\nBut with the good come the bad and unmemorable, and baseball certainly has a few of those.\n\nB/R Mag's effort to Make Baseball Cool Again has already heat-checked 14 bold ideas to change the game with MLB players, surveyed influencers from Ken Griffey Jr. to Bryce Harper and introduced a swaggy 17-year-old who might redesign what a superstar looks like, single-handedly.\n\nStill, we couldn't help taking a crack at fashioning a few new unis of our own. Not to pick on these five clubs, but our intention was to stay true to history—and add a little oomph.\n\nMiami Marlins, with a Fish on Top\n\n(Brian Konnick for B/R Mag)\n\nYes, we know the Marlins updated their logo this season after a complete overhaul in 2011 and that the Giancarlo Stanton jerseys are selling just fine—though they aren't exactly an in-the-club fashion statement. But a stylish city like Miami, with 25 years of franchise history in the books, deserves a more timeless look for the kings of Little Havana.\n\nWithout getting into the whole teal-and-pinstripes vest debacle of the late '90s and early 2000s, we focused on more Marlins blue while relegating that burnt orange to an accent rather than a garish dominant color. The new wordmark stems from art deco, like the hotels on South Beach, and the M is a bit more upright. We even brought back the old fish mascot because, hey, the Edgar Renteria glory days weren't that long ago.\n\nTexas Rangers: Kickin' It Bush Style\n\n(Brian Konnick for B/R Mag)\n\nMore than a dozen MLB teams use red, white and blue, and the Rangers are among the most boring of the bunch. While keeping the same color scheme, we changed their uniforms just enough to make them different—and added a little Lone Star flair.\n\nOur wordmark ditches the block serif for classic cursive similar to the script style of the Dodgers, Royals and Yankees, which the Rangers actually used in the '80s and early '90s—until George W. Bush gave up ownership. The team name would now be red, which hasn't been seen on a Rangers jersey before, across a powder blue jersey (hey, it's working as an alternate in KC) with sleeve stripes. And we've added numbers to the front because, as another blue-jersey'd star of the region would say, why not?\n\nSan Diego Padres: Brown and Yellow, Brown and Yellow\n\n(Brian Konnick for B/R Mag)\n\nFor years, many Padres fans have clamored for a return to the brown and gold of the '60s, '70s and '80s, and we've done here what only the occasional alternate does to hike sales.\n\nYou have the Padres, who may not be hesitant to do things a little bit crazy, a little bit different, Stance's Twersky says. With them, we came out of the gate with tie-dyes and different designs that we work closely with them on, but they can only pull off because they are willing to try things and be receiving.\n\nToday's piping remains, but we've ditched the interlocking S and D for the Tony Gwynn-heyday wordmark, which has the best of the Cardinals and Braves unis in it. Leave the boring, old navy behind and keep it distinctive, San Diego.\n\nChicago White Sox: Just Add Red—and C.R.E.A.M.\n\n(Brian Konnick for B/R Mag)\n\nThe White Sox are not the problem: With a statement logo and a black-and-white simplicity, they've still got the coolest jersey in Chi-town, rocked since an early '90s rebrand by MCs, OGs and MJ himself. But the team's design principles have been erratic, and it's time for something consistent for Chance the Rapper to make truly legendary.\n\nHere, we've emphasized an orangey-red from the '70s and '80s that the team has begun to reintroduce in some alternate looks. (Its old navy accent was a little too Red Sox.) We've also added a little cream for added vintage-meets-C.R.E.A.M. effect.\n\nArizona Diamondbacks: Unleash the Snake!\n\n(Brian Konnick for B/R Mag)\n\nWhen the D-backs first unveiled their purple-and-teal look as an expansion team in 1995, it looked out of place in the conservative color palette of baseball. Flash-forward a couple decades, and we kind of like the all-caps wordmark they unveiled last year. Certainly beats years of an illegible letter A and trying to make a rattlesnake look like the letter D.\n\nStill: Something felt...missing. Gone are the gradients, the shoulders, the dark gray pants. We've brought back copper to pair with sedona red. For a nod to baseball's nostalgia, we've taken inspiration from the Cardinals, who incorporate the bat and birds, and decided to go big on the snake. The Diamondbacks may be a sartorial travesty right now, but that doesn't mean they're too far gone to save.\n\nJoon Lee is a staff writer for B/R Mag.

This week: Make Baseball Cool Again—a manifesto in five parts
(CNN) — Sophisticated is not usually the first word that springs to mind when describing Australia's Gold Coast, a seaside community located 62 miles (about 100 kilometers) southeast of Brisbane.\n\nBrash, yes. Tacky, perhaps. But rarely sophisticated -- until now.\n\nAmong the country's fastest growing cities, the Goldie (as it's affectionately known) has undergone a massive transformation ahead of April's 2018 Commonwealth Games , Queensland's biggest sporting event.\n\nA new recipe of sleek hotels and restaurants, combined with 300 days of sunshine, is luring the travel crowd from all over the world to Australia's holiday playground.\n\nIn the year ending June 2017, the Gold Coast welcomed a record 1 million international travelers , up 7.2% year-on-year.\n\n[The Games] changed everything, Dean Gould, executive director of corporate affairs and strategy for Gold Coast Tourism, tells CNN Travel. Over the last five years, the city has come alive again.\n\nFrom ambitious new towers to swanky speakeasies, here's a look at how good old Goldie is quickly morphing into a dynamic destination\n\nTotal transformation\n\nMost people equate the Gold Coast with one suburb: Surfers Paradise, the most popular beach and where most bars, restaurants and hotels are located.\n\nBut Goldie is actually Australia's sixth-largest city, home to almost 600,000 people and more than 50 suburbs.\n\nIts waterfront sprawl is sunny almost all year round, with 35 miles (57km) of coastline, waterside mansions and roughly 250 miles (400km) of canals -- nearly 10 times more than Venice.\n\nOn paper, it might sound like an idyllic coastal retreat, but the Gold Coast hasn't always been alluring.\n\nUntil recently, Goldie had a less-than-salubrious reputation garnered by high crime rates, out-of-control schoolies (an annual migration of high-school-leaving teenagers looking to party), gambling at Jupiters (Queensland's first casino) and Metre Maids.\n\nThese bikini-clad women were known for putting money into parking meters to help drivers avoid fines along the Glitter Strip, the name locals gave to Surfers Paradise.\n\nThings began to change when the global financial crisis hit in 2008. As tourism arrivals slowed, the Goldie was forced to take stock of its offerings.\n\nA zero-tolerance police policy for public drunkenness during the annual migration of fresh high-school graduates has certainly helped shift the tone, as has an influx of sophisticated bars, restaurants and hotels.\n\nBut the real game-changer was the 2010 announcement that the Gold Coast would host the 2018 Commonwealth Games (April 4-15).\n\nBasically the Olympics for Commonwealth nations, the Games is a major international sporting event that occurs every four years.\n\nBuild it and they will come\n\nThe technicolored Athletes' Village for the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Natasha Dragun\n\nWith a budget of $1.6 billion in the lead-up to the event, the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games Corporation has planned 24 Games venues across the city, including three new builds.\n\nThe games are driving the momentum, but the city's multi-billion-dollar makeover extends beyond the colorful Athletes' Village and upgraded Carrara Stadium, which will host the opening and closing ceremonies.\n\nThe Games has fast-tracked a lot of construction projects, says Gould. But we realized early on that success is not just a highrise. It's about making things accessible, usable and available.\n\nOne way to make the city more usable was by installing a light rail system.\n\nRunning parallel to the area's main beach, it connects most of the major Games venues, as well as Goldie's main attractions.\n\nTravelers can jump on and off as they please, strolling down to the sand in just a few minutes. By April, the line will link to a train station with direct access to Brisbane and, in coming years, an extension will connect the Glitter Strip with the airport.\n\nAnd then there's the cultural precinct, under development on the council's former headquarters in the suburb of Evandale.\n\nOpening in phases, beginning this year, the carbon-neutral building will house a 5,000-person theater. For easy access, it will also be linked to Surfers Paradise via an art-filled green bridge lined with plants.\n\nBrand new beds\n\nThe QT hotel is light-filled and full of surfer whimsy. From QT Gold Coast\n\nBetween the suburbs of Surfers Paradise and neighboring Broadbeach to the south, cranes are busily erecting new hotels and cloud-scraping towers.\n\nComing up quickly is the $712 million Jewel -- a three-tower mammoth that's set to become Australia's largest beachfront mixed-use development. Also in the works are the 89-story Spirit tower, 103-story Orion and 108-story Azzura.\n\n219 apartment-style hotel rooms. Meanwhile, the Avani brand debuted its first Australia property last December, with the opening of Avani Broadbeach and its219 apartment-style hotel rooms.\n\nAnd not to be outdone, The Star -- formerly Jupiters Casino -- has equally ambitious expansion plans. The hotel has spent $275 million to revamp rooms and introduce new dining facilities before the Games.\n\nRelated content Hot new hotels to check into in 2018\n\nThe company has also pledged another $400 million to remodel the city's Sheraton Mirage Resort and construct a 50-suite hotel with a pool cantilevered 16 feet above the street.\n\nBut if you prefer more low-key accommodations, there's always the design-oriented Peppers group, with two fully equipped apartment-style properties on the Coast.\n\nPeppers Soul Surfers Paradise has one- to four-bedroom accommodations with private balconies, while Peppers Broadbeach stretches across two towers opposite the beach in a precinct packed with restaurants and cafes.\n\nA fresh face nearby, the QT hotel is light-filled and full of surfer whimsy. The 297-room property features sleek bathrooms and pops of color that channel the waterside location in Surfers Paradise.\n\nAlso in the neighborhood is The Island .

(CNN) —\n\nOn Tuesday, in a building along the border between North and South Korea, negotiators will sit down face to face for the first time in more than two years.\n\nThat meeting, the latest in a flurry of rapprochement between the two sides, comes after a breakthrough call between Seoul and Pyongyang last week.\n\nAt the South Korean end, were two employees of the Unification Ministry, patiently calling North Korea every day at 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., and never once receiving an answer.\n\nThe welcome break in tensions that have been building on the peninsula amid North Korean weapons testing and saber-rattling rhetoric from Washington, has thrown a spotlight onto the ministry, normally little noticed outside Korea, giving its mission new purpose and importance within President Moon Jae-in's foreign policy.\n\nBut despite its growing prominence, reunification of the two Koreas faces almost insurmountable problems, analysts say, and little support among a younger generation that has never known a unified Korean Peninsula.\n\nBased in an imposing, boxy government building on a tree-lined street near Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul, the Unification Ministry is responsible for all issues pertaining to inter-Korean relations and unification, according to its official website.\n\nImportant work\n\nThis rather bland mission statement masks a sprawling ministry with hundreds of employees and units dedicated to military analysis, negotiations and dialog with North Korea, economic exchanges, and refugee support.\n\nThe Unification Ministry was deeply involved in arranging talks between the two Koreas and joint economic projects like the Kaesong Industrial Park.\n\nAccording to the Yonhap news agency, the ministry's budget for 2017 was $1.02 billion, down 20.5% on the year before, a drop ministers put down to worsened ties between the two Koreas in the last year of the conservative President Park Geun-hye administration.\n\nSupport for the ministry has fluctuated as political moods have shifted in South Korea. Under Park's equally conservative predecessor, Lee Myung-bak, it was even on the chopping block, according to a leaked 2009 US government cable.\n\n(The ministry) survived, largely because progressive forces came to its defense, wrote US diplomat William Stanton, but key liberal officials were fired, staff cut, and it was moved from a standalone building to offices within a larger complex.\n\nAvoiding conflict\n\nThe ministry was founded in 1969 as the National Unification Board, a government body responsible for all issues pertaining to inter-Korean relations and unification, according to its official website.\n\nThis was a period of high tension on the Korean Peninsula. The year before, North Korean commandos had infiltrated Seoul with the intention of assassinating President Park Chung-hee. They came within 100 meters of the Blue House before they were detected and most were killed in a massive gunfight with South Korean guards.\n\nIn the year running up to that incident, the US estimated hundreds of North Korean guerillas had crossed the DMZ, and, as South Korean officials told their US counterparts at the time, the feeling in Seoul was North Korean leader Kim Il Sung had shifted from peaceful unification to the use of force to achieve unification.\n\nWhile Park's government attempted to reassure its allies it was committed to peaceful reunification, the strongman leader – who had seized power in a military coup in 1961 – was widely viewed as unpredictable and hotheaded, and many in Washington feared he was just as likely to spark a second Korean War as Kim.\n\nDespite this, in 1972 both Koreas, after intense negotiations, issued a joint statement laying out their commitment to a peaceful, non-military reunification of the peninsula without depending on foreign powers and without foreign interference.\n\nAccording to Shin Jong-dae, a professor at Seoul's University of North Korean Studies, this was the first document agreed on by both Pyongyang and Seoul since the division of the peninsula in 1945.\n\nIt also established the hotline between the two countries, which, apart from a brief four year interlude between 1980 and 1984, was in regular use until it was cut off in February 2016.\n\nWhile relations between North and South Korea have waxed and waned considerably in the intervening period – declassified cables show North Korea considering unification by force again within years of the joint declaration – the importance of the communication system set up and the work of the Unification Ministry is evidenced by the sudden breakthrough this month.\n\nPHOTO: Handout/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images North Korean officials cross the military demarcation line (MLD) for a meeting with their South Korean counterparts on the demilitarized zone in 2013.\n\nUnification uncertainty\n\nA landmark agreement signed by the leaders of both North and South Korea during a period of improved ties in 2000, hinted towards a possible future federalized state, with little indication how this would be achieved.\n\nThe agreement tied both countries to promoting balanced development of the national economy through economic cooperation and by stimulating cooperation and exchanges in civic, cultural, sports, health, environmental and all other fields.\n\nAnwita Basu, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), said this could involve staged reunification, whereby the North operates as an autonomous region under the overarching governance of the Southern government, but she warned this was incredibly unlikely at the present time, as North Korea dismisses South Korea as a legitimate state.\n\nThe two Koreas fundamental ideological difference make it difficult to conceive a credible reunification strategy, she added. Each want to bring the other under its umbrella and government which frankly is intractable.\n\nThere are scant examples of peaceful reunification, particularly of such different countries.\n\nIn 1990, the Federal Republic of Germany absorbed East Germany and became one country again. While this was a much welcomed and peaceful process, it followed dramatic upheaval and revolution in East Germany which left the government there on the brink of collapse.\n\nThe cost of reunification was massive, estimated at upwards of $100 billion a year in the two decades after 1990, and today GDP, unemployment and other economic indicators show former East German states lagging behind their Western counterparts.\n\nAnother possible model is that of Hong Kong, control of which was handed over from the UK to China in 1997, establishing the principle of one country, two systems, by which Hong Kong retained its political and economic models, but sovereignty and ultimate control passed to China.\n\nThis was once mooted as a potential model for reuniting Taiwan and China, which split at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, but in recent years, one country, two systems has come under increasing strain, with support for it in Hong Kong falling amid Chinese encroachment and shrinking political freedoms.\n\nPHOTO: Handout/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images North and South Korean negotiators shake hands during high-level talks at the demilitarized zone in August 2015.\n\nUnlikely scenario\n\nEither of the above models would require colossal political change in North Korea, currently one of the world's most autocratic countries, ruled by the third-generation of the Kim family which has been in control since the end of World War II.\n\nAt this stage, reunification is a very remote prospect, said Basu, the EIU analyst.\n\nIt's difficult to imagine Kim Jong Un giving up control and allowing his country to be absorbed into South Korea, even with a high degree of autonomy. Nor are South Korea's 51 million people likely to vote to become part of a Kim-ruled united Korea.\n\nA more likely scenario for unification is political collapse in North Korea, brought on by revolution, a military coup, assassination of Kim, or war with South Korea or the United States.\n\nEstimates of the cost of reunification to South Korea range from around $500 billion to several trillion dollars, comparable to the amount spent by Germany since 1990.\n\nModeling the economic costs is incredibly difficult however, as this would be a completely unique event, potentially catalyzed by violent upheaval inside North Korea and the creation of hundreds of thousands of refugees.\n\nThe differences between the economies of North and South Korea are much greater than were those between East and West Germany, wrote academics Sangmin Bae and Martyn de Bruyn in 2010, pointing to South Korea's far greater population, GDP and quality of life.\n\nThis could lead to massive migration (to South Korea), they said. To be sure, the relative costs of unification in Korea would be even higher than the enormous costs in Germany.\n\nMoreover, unlike the Germans, the Koreans fought a bloody civil war, leaving deep wounds on both sides of the border that could act as a major barrier towards reunification and integration of North Koreans into a South Korean-led country, Bae and de Bruyn said.\n\nA more pressing concern, would be the simple integration of North Koreans into South Korea's highly complex economic system said Basu: The newly created country (would) struggle to find a unified national identity … Even today North Korean defectors find it very difficult to integrate into South Korean society. More often than not they are treated poorly and discriminated against.\n\nA Council on Foreign Relations report warned last year a unified Korea could become a constant source of instability or a country preoccupied with internal problems.\n\nThese difficulties, as well as years of North Korean aggression, could explain why South Koreans, particularly younger generations, are less supportive of unification than in the past.\n\nCNN's Paula Hancocks, Taehoon Lee, Sol Han, Stella Ko and Sophie Jeong contributed reporting.
A court in Vietnam on Tuesday sentenced three freelance journalists known for their criticism of government to between 11 and 15 years in prison, after finding them guilty of spreading anti-state propaganda.\n\nPham Chi Dung, Nguyen Tuong Thuy and Le Huu Minh Tuan were convicted of making, storing, spreading information, materials, items for the purpose of opposing the state at a one-day trial in Ho Chi Minh City, the Ministry of Public Security said.\n\nDung established the Independent Journalists Association of Vietnam in 2014, which police said had sought regime change.\n\nDespite sweeping economic reform and increasing openness to social change, Vietnam's ruling Communist Party retains tight media censorship and tolerates little criticism.\n\nThe Party, under the leadership of 76-year-old Nguyen Phu Trong, has intensified a crackdown on dissent ahead of its five-yearly congress due to be held later this month.\n\nRead More
I'm worried about working until retirement age, then not being healthy enough to enjoy it. What's the right balance between retiring early and saving enough?--Maurice\n\nYou don't want to retire in destitution, wishing you'd worked a few more years to save more money. But you also don't want to look back with regret, wishing you had more energy and time to savor your golden years.\n\nFinding a balance is tricky, but some simple rules can get you on the right track.\n\nStart early\n\nIt almost goes without saying: the sooner you start saving, the easier it is to build on that savings.\n\nAs savings earn interest, your money grows even faster as you then earn more interest on your interest. That's called compound interest.\n\nMoney keeps going in the direction you send it. It's easier to increase it then to start it, said Jennifer Lane, financial planner and owner of Compass Planning in Boston.\n\nAutomate your process\n\nIf your company offers a 401(k) match, set up a recurring transfer to meet it -- and then don't touch it.\n\nYou want to enjoy and live your life, so the more you can make automatic and start early is great, says Stuart Robertson, president of Capital One Advisors 401(k) services.\n\nIf you don't like seeing money simply vanish out of your account every month, Lane suggests setting a monthly calendar reminder, prompting you to move some money around. This way, you're the one in control -- but you're still making the process a habit, one that will get easier with time.\n\nAnd automating your process doesn't only lift anxiety -- it also helps curtail unnecessary spending.\n\nOnce it's not in your daily budget and it's in an area you can't really get to, you need to live within your means, Robertson says. You live within that budget.\n\nCheck in\n\nAs your income and your lifestyle change, don't forget to check up on your fund to adjust your contributions.\n\nRecognize hey, you just got a raise, maybe give your 401(k) a raise, too, Robertson suggests.\n\nAccording to Robertson, there are some good milestones to check along the way: Aim to have saved the equivalent of your current salary by age 30. At 40, shoot to have saved three times your salary. And if you want to retire by 55, you'll need to have saved around 12 times your income.\n\nLane suggests reviewing your finances every year, setting aside time to make sure you're saving enough to retire when you'd like. If you're under, boost your contributions. If you're on track, keep going.\n\nCalculator: Are you behind on retirement saving?\n\nKnow that things will change\n\nRemember: none of this is set in stone. As Robertson points out, by the time retirement age rolls around, you may even pick up a side hustle, passion project or other source of income.\n\nMore and more people might want to quit the job or passion they've been doing to earn money over the last 20 to 30 years, but at retirement age they still want to do something productive, he says. So maybe it's not a 50-hour work week and it doesn't earn the same, but it's something you enjoy and you can still bring in income, if you aren't where you want to be in retirement savings.\n\nSo don't obsess over the plan you set -- it can and will change.\n\nThe things you think and feel at 50 are different than the things you think and feel at 20, Lane says.
If you still haven't gotten around to returning your blown-out L.L.Bean flannels from the 90s, then you're too late.\n\nL.L.Bean, the venerable Maine retailer of rustic boots and clothes, is ending its long-running, no questions asked return policy.\n\nThe policy, which has been in place for at least a century, was ruined by a few bad players, according to an open letter to customers.\n\nIncreasingly, a small, but growing number of customers has been interpreting our guarantee well beyond its original intent, says the letter from executive chairman Shawn Gorman.\n\nSome view it as a lifetime product replacement program, expecting refunds for heavily worn products used over many years, he said. Other seek refunds for products that have been purchased through third parties, such as yard sales.\n\nL.L.Bean, which is based in Freeport, still has a return policy. But starting on Friday, the company will only take back products if they are returned within one year of the purchase date, with proof of purchase. If the product is actually defective and the customer tries to return it after a year, the company said it will work out a fair solution.\n\nRelated: Your holiday returns could end up in a landfill\n\nGorman said the change in return policy will only affect a small percentage of returns.\n\nThe rather liberal return policy had been in place since the days of Leon Leonwood Bean, who founded the company back in 1912 as a mail order retailer and maker of hunting boots with unusual chainlink style soles.\n\nThe original intent was that Bean didn't want customers to be dissatisfied with his products.
The Hubei health authority reported that 242 more people died from the coronavirus in Hubei province on Wednesday, raising the death toll in the epicenter since the beginning of the outbreak to 1,310.\n\nThis brings the total number of deaths in mainland China to at least 1,355. The global death toll is at least 1,357, with one death in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines.\n\nHubei authorities confirmed an additional 14,840 cases of the virus in Hubei on Wednesday, which brings the total number of cases in the epicenter of the outbreak to 48,206. The 14,840 figure includes both test confirmed cases and clinically diagnosed cases.\n\nThe government explained they are now adding clinically diagnosed cases in the tally of cases to make it easier for these patients to receive treatment early.\n\nThere have been 33,693 patients hospitalized in Hubei, including 1,437 who are in critical condition, according to the health authority, adding that 3,441 patients have recovered and been discharged.\n\nBy the numbers: The global number of confirmed coronavirus cases has now exceeded 60,015 with the vast majority of cases in mainland China.\n\nChina's National Health Commission is expected to release numbers for all of China's provinces later.
(CNN) The Rev. Raphael Warnock , the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, will be the first Black senator from Georgia, CNN projected early Wednesday, a repudiation of Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler and her adherence to President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Democratic Party appears closer to retaking the US Senate, as Georgia Republican David Perdue narrowly trails in his fight to keep his seat against Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff. Both candidates claimed they would win after all the ballots had been counted, but CNN has not yet called the race.\n\nWarnock is the first Georgia Democrat elected to the Senate in 20 years, and his election is the culmination of years of voter registration drives conducted by former state House Democratic leader Stacey Abrams and other activists. President-elect Joe Biden also won Georgia, the first time for a Democratic presidential candidate since the 1990s.\n\nI am an iteration and an example of the American dream, the senator-elect told CNN's John Berman Wednesday morning on New Day. He added, When I think about the arc of our history, what Georgia did last night is its own message in the midst of a moment in which so many people are trying to divide our country, at a time we can least afford to be divided.\n\nAfter no Georgia Senate candidate received 50% of the vote in November, the races turned to two runoffs. While Ossoff and Warnock ran on a unity ticket, Trump refused to concede his own loss, sparking a fight within the Republican Party and disenchanting some of his supporters, who believed his false claims that the vote was rigged.\n\nTrump's ongoing onslaught against the Republican officials in charge of the elections pressured the two GOP senators to make a choice: Join the President in seeking to overturn the democratic outcome or risk losing Trump supporters, some of whom have become disenchanted with the electoral process. Trump recently appeared to pressure Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on a private call, urging him to find enough votes to reverse the results. Raffensperger refused.\n\nBut despite three recounts and no evidence of widespread fraud, Loeffler and Perdue decided to join the President in objecting to Congress' certification of the Electoral College's results in a final, deluded display of devotion to Trump supporters.\n\nThe American people deserve a platform in Congress, permitted under the Constitution, to have election issues presented so that they can be addressed, said Loeffler in a statement on Monday.\n\nAsked if it was appropriate for her to vote against certification of the electoral votes, Warnock told CNN Wednesday that his opponent has consistently put what she perceives to be her own short-term political interests over the concerns of ordinary people.\n\nWhat is unfolding in the Senate today or in the House, what's unfolding in this moment is a distraction. It's a distraction, he told Berman. These senators know better and the people that I'm talking to all across Georgia are concerned about their lives.\n\nWhile Georgia is a rapidly diversifying state, the Republican candidates came into the Senate runoff elections with an advantage.\n\nIn November, Perdue received over 88,000 more votes than Ossoff, while Loeffler and the other Republican candidates received more votes than Warnock and the other Democratic candidates in the special election (Warnock received most of the vote -- 33% -- overall).\n\nRepublicans hoped their message that Georgia should be a check on Washington would prove successful, noting that if Warnock and Ossoff win, Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer will be in charge.\n\nWe're talking about the future of the country, and we can't just turn it all over to one party, said Eric Tanenblatt, who served as chief of staff to former Republican Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue, before Election Day. That could be wishful thinking on my part. But I do think that that's going to be a big motivator.\n\nBut Republicans are worried that Trump's unwillingness to concede jeopardizes the party's hold on the Senate, even though the state has not elected a Democrat to the chamber since 2000.\n\nHeath Garrett, a campaign manager for former Georgia Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson, told CNN that Trump's attacks on Gov. Brian Kemp and Raffensperger were counterproductive for trying to motivate grassroots, base Republicans to go vote, and said they've threw Perdue and Loeffler off message in the final days of the campaign.\n\nSenator Perdue and Senator Loeffler are being whipsawed by the President on one side and by the Democratic money on the other side, he said.\n\nPerdue and Loeffler had attempted to avoid the intraparty feud sparked by Trump by focusing on Ossoff and Warnock.\n\nPerdue's closing message in a recent video was littered with attacks, saying that if Republicans lose, undocumented immigrants will vote, Americans' private health insurance will be taken away, and Democrats will pack the Supreme Court and defund the police.\n\nWe win Georgia, we save America, Perdue told the camera.\n\nThe Democratic candidates counter that they would demilitarize rather than defund the police, create a legal pathway for undocumented immigrants and support a public option to decrease the number of uninsured. Neither Democratic candidate has advocated adding justices to the court.\n\nThey argued they would do a better job ending the health care crisis over the coronavirus, which has infected more than 20.8 million Americans and killed at least 354,000, in order to reopen the economy. They've pushed policy goals, including debt-free public college and a new Voting Rights Act. And they've attacked the Republican senators for their multi-million dollar stock transactions during the pandemic, alleging that they profited off it. The senators have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nWarnock told CNN Wednesday that he believes tackling the pandemic by effectively distributing the vaccine and passing $2,000 stimulus checks should be the new Senate's top priority.\n\nThe special election was particularly brutal, starting last year when GOP Rep. Doug Collins forced Loeffler, who Kemp appointed to the role in 2019, into a race to the right.\n\nAfter no candidate received 50% of the vote, the runoffs turned even more vicious, as Loeffler portrayed Warnock an anti-police Marxist who would destroy America in the Senate.\n\nWe have to have Georgians come out and vote because we know that Chuck Schumer's radical agents of change are Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, said Loeffler on the campaign trail Monday. They would defund the police. They would lock down our economy. And we have to make sure that we hold the line right here in Georgia.\n\nWarnock has in turn promoted his background from the Savannah projects to the pulpit of Martin Luther King Jr.'s historic church, while firing back at Loeffler.\n\nKelly Loeffler spends tens of millions of dollars to scare you, said Warnock in an ad. She's trying to make you afraid of me because she's afraid of you. Afraid that you understand how she's used her position in the Senate to enrich herself and others like her. Afraid that you'll realize that we can do better.\n\nPerdue, a 71-year-old former Fortune 500 CEO, has dismissed Ossoff, a 33-year-old media executive, saying the Democrat does not know how to create a job. At their debate in the fall, Ossoff called the senator a crook who was fending off multiple federal investigations for insider trading while attacking the health of the people who he represents. Perdue snapped back that the Democrat had worked for the mouthpiece of terrorism and Communist China -- claims Ossoff called ridiculous.\n\nThe Georgia US Senate races have attracted enormous attention due to the stakes for the first years of the Biden administration and the state's shift from red to purple. Dr. Charles Bullock, a University of Georgia political science professor, told CNN that the Senate elections could be the first in which urban Georgia casts more votes than rural Georgia.\n\nWe've seen tremendous enthusiasm in the early voting numbers, both in person and by mail, and we know that while Democrats will have a lead when polls open ...

Wal-Mart is now officially Walmart.\n\nThe company had been known as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. since 1970, but it announced a change in December. That became official today when it filed new incorporation papers in Delaware.\n\nCustomers won't notice the change. The corporate name is different, but Walmart storefronts, advertisements, bags and merchandise dropped the hyphen in 2008.\n\nWhy the switch? It's a nod to the digital era and its biggest rival, Amazon.\n\nWalmart isn't only a retail store anymore. Although it has 11,600 locations around the world, the company Sam Walton founded in 1962 has become an online shopping juggernaut.\n\nThe name change chiefly demonstrates the company's growing emphasis on serving customers seamlessly however they want to shop, Walmart said in a December news release. While our new legal name removes the dash, we're not planning to change the Walmart cheer.\n\nWalmart now owns online brands, such as Jet.com, ModCloth, Bonobos and Moosejaw. It recently bought Parcel, a logistics startup that will offer same-day deliveries for online purchases in New York City. Walmart's digital sales rose 50% in the United States during the most recent quarter.\n\nThe company has also stepped up its grocery business both in stores and online as Amazon becomes a major supermarket player with Whole Foods.\n\nRelated: Walmart is killing Target and making Amazon sweat\n\nWalmart's digital capabilities have helped it keep pace with Amazon (AMZN) and survive the retail slump as more consumers buy products with the click of a button instead of heading to the store.\n\nShares of Walmart (WMT) gained 42% last year while other retailers like Target (TGT), JCPenney (JCP), Macy's (M) and Sears (SHLD)struggled.\n\n-CNNMoney's Paul R.

Transcript: Bush, Kerry debate domestic policies\n\n\n\n\n\nTEMPE, Arizona (CNN) -- The following is a running transcript of the final debate between President George W. Bush and Sen. John Kerry held Wednesday night at Arizona State University.\n\nCBS News anchor Bob Schieffer moderated the debate that focused on domestic policy.\n\nAll answers are linked to the questions in the box to the right.\n\nQuestion 1: Will our children be as safe as we were?\n\nSCHIEFFER: Gentleman, welcome to you both.\n\nBy coin toss, the first question goes to Sen. Kerry.\n\nSenator, I want to set the stage for this discussion by asking the question that I think hangs over all of our politics today and is probably on the minds of many people watching this debate tonight.\n\nAnd that is, will our children and grandchildren ever live in a world as safe and secure as the world in which we grew up?\n\nKERRY: Well, first of all, Bob, thank you for moderating tonight.\n\nThank you, Arizona State, for welcoming us.\n\nAnd thank you to the Presidential Commission for undertaking this enormous task. We're proud to be here.\n\nMr. President, I'm glad to be here with you again to share similarities and differences with the American people.\n\nWill we ever be safe and secure again? Yes. We absolutely must be. That's the goal.\n\nNow, how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it.\n\nI believe that this president, regrettably, rushed us into a war, made decisions about foreign policy, pushed alliances away. And, as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be.\n\nThe measurement is not: Are we safer? The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be? And there are a host of options that this president had available to him, like making sure that at all our ports in America containers are inspected. Only 95 percent of them -- 95 percent come in today uninspected. That's not good enough.\n\nPeople who fly on airplanes today, the cargo hold is not X-rayed, but the baggage is. That's not good enough. Firehouses don't have enough firefighters in them. Police officers are being cut from the streets of America because the president decided to cut the COPS program.\n\nSo we can do a better job of homeland security. I can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we will go after the terrorists.\n\nI will hunt them down, and we'll kill them, we'll capture them. We'll do whatever is necessary to be safe.\n\nBut I pledge this to you, America: I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did, where we build the strongest alliances, where the world joins together, where we have the best intelligence and where we are able, ultimately, to be more safe and secure.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Mr. President, you have 90 seconds.\n\nBUSH: Thank you very much.\n\nI want to thank Arizona State as well.\n\nYes, we can be safe and secure, if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world.\n\nI have got a comprehensive strategy to not only chase down the al Qaeda, wherever it exists -- and we're making progress; three-quarters of al Qaeda leaders have been brought to justice -- but to make sure that countries that harbor terrorists are held to account.\n\nAs a result of securing ourselves and ridding the Taliban out of Afghanistan, the Afghan people had elections this weekend. And the first voter was a 19-year-old woman. Think about that. Freedom is on the march.\n\nWe held to account a terrorist regime in Saddam Hussein.\n\nIn other words, in order to make sure we're secure, there must be a comprehensive plan.\n\nMy opponent just this weekend talked about how terrorism could be reduced to a nuisance, comparing it to prostitution, illegal gambling.\n\nI think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous. I don't think you can secure America for the long run if you don't have a comprehensive view as to how to defeat these people.\n\nAt home, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland. I signed the homeland security bill to better align our assets and resources. My opponent voted against it.\n\nWe're doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports.\n\nBut absolutely we can be secure in the long run. It just takes good, strong leadership.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Anything to add, Senator Kerry?\n\nKERRY: Yes. When the president had an opportunity to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, he took his focus off of them, outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, and Osama bin Laden escaped.\n\nSix months after he said Osama bin Laden must be caught dead or alive, this president was asked, Where is Osama bin Laden?\n\nHe said, I don't know. I don't really think about him very much. I'm not that concerned.\n\nWe need a president who stays deadly focused on the real war on terror.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Mr. President?\n\nBUSH: Gosh, I just don't think I ever said I'm not worried about Osama bin Laden. It's kind of one of those exaggerations.\n\nOf course we're worried about Osama bin Laden. We're on the hunt after Osama bin Laden. We're using every asset at our disposal to get Osama bin Laden.\n\nMy opponent said this war is a matter of intelligence and law enforcement. No, this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected.\n\n(Back to top)\n\nQuestion 2: How did the U.S. end up with a flu vaccine shortage?\n\nSCHIEFFER: New question, Mr. President, to you.\n\nWe are talking about protecting ourselves from the unexpected, but the flu season is suddenly upon us. Flu kills thousands of people every year.\n\nSuddenly we find ourselves with a severe shortage of flu vaccine. How did that happen?\n\nBUSH: Bob, we relied upon a company out of England to provide about half of the flu vaccines for the United States citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated. And so we took the right action and didn't allow contaminated medicine into our country.\n\nWe're working with Canada to hopefully -- that they'll produce a -- help us realize the vaccine necessary to make sure our citizens have got flu vaccinations during this upcoming season.\n\nMy call to our fellow Americans is if you're healthy, if you're younger, don't get a flu shot this year. Help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot, the elderly and the young.\n\nThe CDC, responsible for health in the United States, is setting those priorities and is allocating the flu vaccine accordingly.\n\nI haven't gotten a flu shot, and I don't intend to because I want to make sure those who are most vulnerable get treated.\n\nWe have a problem with litigation in the United States of America. Vaccine manufacturers are worried about getting sued, and therefore they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine.\n\nOne of the reasons I'm such a strong believer in legal reform is so that people aren't afraid of producing a product that is necessary for the health of our citizens and then end up getting sued in a court of law.\n\nBut the best thing we can do now, Bob, given the circumstances with the company in England is for those of us who are younger and healthy, don't get a flu shot.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Sen. Kerry?\n\nKERRY: This really underscores the problem with the American health-care system. It's not working for the American family. And it's gotten worse under President Bush over the course of the last years.\n\nFive million Americans have lost their health insurance in this country. You've got about a million right here in Arizona, just shy, 950,000, who have no health insurance at all. 82,000 Arizonians lost their health insurance under President Bush's watch. 223,000 kids in Arizona have no health insurance at all.\n\nAll across our country -- go to Ohio, 1.4 million Ohioans have no health insurance, 114,000 of them lost it under President Bush; Wisconsin, 82,000, Wisconsites lost it under President Bush.\n\nThis president has turned his back on the wellness of America. And there is no system. In fact, it's starting to fall apart not because of lawsuits -- though they are a problem, and John Edwards and I are committed to fixing them -- but because of the larger issue that we don't cover Americans.\n\nChildren across our country don't have health care. We're the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it.\n\nI have a plan to cover all Americans. We're going to make it affordable and accessible. We're going to let everybody buy into the same health-care plan senators and congressmen give themselves.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Mr. President, would you like to add something?\n\nBUSH: I would. Thank you.\n\nI want to remind people listening tonight that a plan is not a litany of complaints, and a plan is not to lay out programs that you can't pay for.\n\nHe just said he wants everybody to be able to buy in to the same plan that senators and congressmen get. That costs the government $7,700 per family. If every family in America signed up, like the senator suggested, [it] would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years.\n\nIt's an empty promise. It's called bait and switch.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Time's up.\n\nBUSH: Thank you.\n\nKERRY: Actually, it's not an empty promise.\n\nIt's really interesting, because the president used that very plan as a reason for seniors to accept his prescription drug plan. He said, if it's good enough for the congressmen and senators to have choice, seniors ought to have choice.\n\nWhat we do is we have choice. I choose Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Other senators, other congressmen choose other programs.\n\nBut the fact is, we're going to help Americans be able to buy into it. Those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves. We're not giving this away for nothing.\n\n(Back to top)\n\nQuestion 3: With rising costs, how do you keep from raising taxes?\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\n\nSen. Kerry, a new question. Let's talk about economic security. You pledged during the last debate that you would not raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 a year. But the price of everything is going up, and we all know it. Health care costs, as you all talking about, is skyrocketing, the cost of the war.\n\nMy question is, how can you or any president, whoever is elected next time, keep that pledge without running this country deeper into debt and passing on more of the bills that we're running up to our children?\n\nKERRY: I'll tell you exactly how I can do it: by reinstating what President Bush took away, which is called pay as you go.\n\nDuring the 1990s, we had pay-as-you-go rules. If you were going to pass something in the Congress, you had to show where you are going to pay for it and how.\n\nPresident Bush has taken -- he's the only president in history to do this.\n\nHe's also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs -- 1.6 million jobs lost. He's the only president to have incomes of families go down for the last three years; the only president to see exports go down; the only president to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today.\n\nNow, I'm going to reverse that. I'm going to change that. We're going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s.\n\nEvery plan that I have laid out -- my health-care plan, my plan for education, my plan for kids to be able to get better college loans -- I've shown exactly how I'm going to pay for those.\n\nAnd we start -- we don't do it exclusively -- but we start by rolling back George Bush's unaffordable tax cut for the wealthiest people, people earning more than $200,000 a year, and we pass, hopefully, the McCain-Kerry Commission which identified some $60 billion that we can get.\n\nWe shut the loophole which has American workers actually subsidizing the loss of their own job.\n\nThey just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days: $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from China.\n\nI'm going to stand up and fight for the American worker. And I am going to do it in a way that's fiscally sound. I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education.\n\nI have a manufacturing jobs credit. We pay for it by shutting that loophole overseas. We raise the student loans. I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks.\n\nThis president has never once vetoed one bill; the first president in a hundred years not to do that.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Mr. President?\n\nBUSH: Well, his rhetoric doesn't match his record.\n\n[He's] been a senator for 20 years. He voted to increase taxes 98 times. When they tried to reduce taxes, he voted against that 127 times.\n\nHe talks about being a fiscal conservative, or fiscally sound, but he voted over -- he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4.2 trillion.\n\nHe talks about PAY-GO. I'll tell you what PAY-GO means, when you're a senator from Massachusetts, when you're a colleague of Ted Kennedy, pay go means: You pay, and he goes ahead and spends.\n\nHe's proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in America, raises $600 million by our account -- billion, $800 billion by his account.\n\nThere is a tax gap. And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap? The middle class.\n\nI propose a detailed budget, Bob. I sent up my budget man to the Congress, and he says, here's how we're going to reduce the deficit in half by five years. It requires pro-growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of Congress.\n\n(Back to top)\n\nQuestion 4: What do you say to someone who lost his job?\n\nSCHIEFFER: Let's go to a new question, Mr. President. Two minutes. And let's continue on jobs.\n\nYou know, there are all kind of statistics out there, but I want to bring it down to an individual.\n\nMr. President, what do you say to someone in this country who has lost his job to someone overseas who's being paid a fraction of what that job paid here in the United States?\n\nBUSH: I'd say, Bob, I've got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century. And here's some help for you to go get an education. Here's some help for you to go to a community college.\n\nWe've expanded trade adjustment assistance. We want to help pay for you to gain the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.\n\nYou know, there's a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing. We talk about fiscal matters. But perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in America and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works.\n\nI went to Washington to solve problems. And I saw a problem in the public education system in America.\n\nThey were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics.\n\nAnd so we said: Let's raise the standards. We're spending more money, but let's raise the standards and measure early and solve problems now, before it's too late.\n\nNo, education is how to help the person who's lost a job. Education is how to make sure we've got a workforce that's productive and competitive.\n\nGot four more years, I've got more to do to continue to raise standards, to continue to reward teachers and school districts that are working, to emphasize math and science in the classrooms, to continue to expand Pell Grants to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma.\n\nAnd so the person you talked to, I say, here's some help, here's some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.\n\nAnd that's what I would say to that person.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Sen. Kerry?\n\nKERRY: I want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally.\n\nLet me come back in one moment to that, but I want to speak for a second, if I can, to what the president said about fiscal responsibility.\n\nBeing lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nThis president has taken a $5.6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see. Health-care costs for the average American have gone up 64 percent; tuitions have gone up 35 percent; gasoline prices up 30 percent; Medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago; prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year.\n\nBut guess what, America? The wages of Americans have gone down. The jobs that are being created in Arizona right now are paying about $13,700 less than the jobs that we're losing.\n\nAnd the president just walks on by this problem. The fact is that he's cut job-training money. $1 billion was cut. They only added a little bit back this year because it's an election year.\n\nThey've cut the Pell Grants and the Perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college.\n\nThey've cut the training money. They've wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed.\n\nI'm going to do those things, because that's what's right in America: Help workers to transition in every respect.\n\nQuestion 5: Is Bush entirely to blame for loss of jobs?\n\nSCHIEFFER: New question to you, Sen. Kerry, two minutes. And it's still on jobs.\n\nYou know, many experts say that a president really doesn't have much control over jobs. For example, if someone invents a machine that does the work of five people, that's progress. That's not the president's fault.\n\nSo I ask you, is it fair to blame the administration entirely for this loss of jobs?\n\nKERRY: I don't blame them entirely for it. I blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it.\n\nOutsourcing is going to happen.\n\nI've acknowledged that in union halls across the country. I've had shop stewards stand up and say, Will you promise me you're going to stop all this outsourcing?\n\nAnd I've looked them in the eye and I've said, No, I can't do that.\n\nWhat I can promise you is that I will make the playing field as fair as possible, that I will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in America are not subsidizing the loss of your job.\n\nToday, if you're an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas. You get to defer your taxes.\n\nSo if you're looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, Hey, I do better overseas than I do here in America.\n\nThat's not smart.\n\nI don't want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job.\n\nAnd when I'm president, we're going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we're going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent. And we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here.\n\nThe second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field. This president didn't stand up for Boeing when Airbus was violating international rules and subsidies. He discovered Boeing during the course of this campaign after I'd been talking about it for months.\n\nThe fact is that the president had an opportunity to stand up and take on China for currency manipulation. There are companies that wanted to petition the administration. They were told: Don't even bother; we're not going to listen to it.\n\nThe fact is that there have been markets shut to us that we haven't stood up and fought for.\n\nI'm going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the American worker. And I will fight for the American worker just as hard as I fight for my own job. That's what the American worker wants. And if we do that, we can have an impact.\n\nPlus, we need fiscal discipline. Restore fiscal discipline, we'll do a lot better.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Mr. President?\n\nBUSH: Whew!\n\nLet me start with the Pell Grants. In his last litany of misstatements he said we cut Pell Grants. We've increased Pell Grants by a million students. That's a fact.\n\nYou know, he talks to the workers. Let me talk to the workers.\n\nYou've got more money in your pocket as a result of the tax relief we passed and he opposed.\n\nIf you have a child, you got a $1,000 child credit. That's money in your pocket.\n\nIf you're married, we reduced the marriage penalty. The code ought to encourage marriage, not discourage marriage.\n\nWe created a 10 percent bracket to help lower-income Americans. A family of four making $40,000 received about $1,700 in tax relief.\n\nIt's your money. The way my opponent talks, he said, We're going to spend the government's money. No, we're spending your money. And when you have more money in your pocket, you're able to better afford things you want.\n\nI believe the role of government is to stand side by side with our citizens to help them realize their dreams, not tell citizens how to live their lives.\n\nMy opponent talks about fiscal sanity. His record in the United States Senate does not match his rhetoric.\n\nHe voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Sen. Kerry?\n\nKERRY: Bob, anybody can play with these votes. Everybody knows that.\n\nI have supported or voted for tax cuts over 600 times. I broke with my party in order to balance the budget, and Ronald Reagan signed into law the tax cut that we voted for. I voted for IRA tax cuts. I voted for small-business tax cuts.\n\nBut you know why the Pell Grants have gone up in their numbers? Because more people qualify for them because they don't have money.\n\nBut they're not getting the $5,100 the president promised them. They're getting less money.\n\nWe have more people who qualify. That's not what we want.\n\nBUSH: Senator, no one's playing with your votes. You voted to increase taxes 98 times. When they voted -- when they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times.\n\nHe voted to violate the budget cap 277 times. You know, there's a main stream in American politics and you sit right on the far left bank. As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts.\n\n(Back to top)\n\nQuestion 6: Do you believe homosexuality is a choice?\n\nSCHIEFFER: Mr. President, let's get back to economic issues. But let's shift to some other questions here.\n\nBoth of you are opposed to gay marriage. But to understand how you have come to that conclusion, I want to ask you a more basic question.\n\nDo you believe homosexuality is a choice?\n\nBUSH: You know, Bob, I don't know. I just don't know. I do know that we have a choice to make in America and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity. It's important that we do that.\n\nAnd I also know in a free society people, consenting adults can live the way they want to live.\n\nAnd that's to be honored.\n\nBut as we respect someone's rights, and as we profess tolerance, we shouldn't change -- or have to change -- our basic views on the sanctity of marriage.\n\nI believe in the sanctity of marriage. I think it's very important that we protect marriage as an institution, between a man and a woman.\n\nI proposed a constitutional amendment. The reason I did so was because I was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution.\n\nIt has also the benefit of allowing citizens to participate in the process. After all, when you amend the Constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution.\n\nI'm deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States. You know, Congress passed a law called DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act.\n\nMy opponent was against it. It basically protected states from the action of one state to another. It also defined marriage as between a man and woman.\n\nBut I'm concerned that that will get overturned. And if it gets overturned, then we'll end up with marriage being defined by courts, and I don't think that's in our nation's interests.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Sen. Kerry?\n\nKERRY: We're all God's children, Bob. And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, she's being who she was born as.\n\nI think if you talk to anybody, it's not choice. I've met people who struggled with this for years, people who were in a marriage because they were living a sort of convention, and they struggled with it.\n\nAnd I've met wives who are supportive of their husbands or vice versa when they finally sort of broke out and allowed themselves to live who they were, who they felt God had made them.\n\nI think we have to respect that.\n\nThe president and I share the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. I believe that. I believe marriage is between a man and a woman.\n\nBut I also believe that because we are the United States of America, we're a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you can't discriminate in the workplace. You can't discriminate in the rights that you afford people.\n\nYou can't disallow someone the right to visit their partner in a hospital. You have to allow people to transfer property, which is why I'm for partnership rights and so forth.\n\nNow, with respect to DOMA and the marriage laws, the states have always been able to manage those laws. And they're proving today, every state, that they can manage them adequately.\n\n(Back to top)\n\nQuestion 7: How does Kerry handle criticism from Catholic archbishops?\n\nSCHIEFFER: Sen. Kerry, a new question for you.\n\nThe New York Times reports that some Catholic archbishops are telling their church members that it would be a sin to vote for a candidate like you because you support a woman's right to choose an abortion and unlimited stem-cell research.\n\nWhat is your reaction to that?\n\nKERRY: I respect their views. I completely respect their views. I am a Catholic. And I grew up learning how to respect those views. But I disagree with them, as do many.\n\nI believe that I can't legislate or transfer to another American citizen my article of faith. What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesn't share that article of faith.\n\nI believe that choice is a woman's choice. It's between a woman, God and her doctor. And that's why I support that.\n\nNow, I will not allow somebody to come in and change Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe president has never said whether or not he would do that. But we know from the people he's tried to appoint to the court he wants to.\n\nI will not. I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade.\n\nNow, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic. I was an altar boy. I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me.\n\nAnd as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, I'm not running to be a Catholic president. I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic.\n\nMy faith affects everything that I do, in truth. There's a great passage of the Bible that says, What does it mean, my brother, to say you have faith if there are no deeds? Faith without works is dead.\n\nAnd I think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your faith, but without transferring it in any official way to other people.\n\nThat's why I fight against poverty. That's why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth.\n\nThat's why I fight for equality and justice. All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith.\n\nBut I know this, that President Kennedy in his inaugural address told all of us that here on Earth, God's work must truly be our own. And that's what we have to -- I think that's the test of public service.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Mr. President?\n\nBUSH: I think it's important to promote a culture of life. I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters.\n\nI believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life. I understand there's great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions.\n\nTake, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion. It's a brutal practice. People from both political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice. It made a lot of sense. My opponent, in that he's out of the mainstream, voted against that law.\n\nWhat I'm saying is is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws -- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs.\n\nThe last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs. That's great. I appreciate that very much. All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion.\n\n(Continued)
New Delhi, India (CNN) At least 24 people, including one police officer, have been killed in violent communal clashes in the Indian capital between supporters and opponents of a new law that fast-tracks citizenship for non-Muslim minorities from select countries.\n\nThe unrest, which erupted in parts of New Delhi on Monday, coincided with a visit to India by US President Donald Trump\n\nPolicemen stand in front of burned shops in New Delhi following clashes over a new citizenship law on February 24.\n\nAuthorities deployed tear gas, as protesters hurled stones, damaged property and set numerous vehicles and a gasoline pump on fire, according to police, as the violence stretched into its second day.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi's highest elected official, tweeted that police were unable to control situation and instil confidence despite ongoing efforts overnight, and requested that the military be called in and a curfew imposed in affected areas.\n\nAt least 188 people have been treated in hospital, mostly from bullet injuries, and the rest from blunt force trauma, since the violence began.\n\nRead More
(CNN) As years change, so too do the rules we live by.\n\n2020 saw massive protests over police brutality, economic insecurity brought on by the coronavirus pandemic and extreme weather events that again signaled the gravity of the climate crisis. And across the country, state legislatures and local jurisdictions responded to those and other issues with new laws and regulations.\n\nFrom police reform to automatic college savings accounts, here are some of the new rules taking effect in 2021.\n\nPolice reform\n\nAs people took to the streets to demand an end to violence against Black people at the hands of law enforcement, communities attempted to address some of the underlying challenges in a number of ways.\n\nUnits have been tasked with recruiting more diverse candidates to their ranks through mentorship programs, community outreach and affirmative action policies. Departments will also have to report their efforts each year to the Police Officer Standards and Training Council, a body whose makeup is also set to change.\n\nAdditionally, officers in Connecticut who make arrests or regularly interact with the public now have to prominently display their badges and name tags on their uniforms. All officers in the state will have to undergo a behavioral health screening every five years.\n\nIn Missouri, law enforcement officers will have to undergo an hour of training each year on recognizing implicit bias and de-escalating conflicts.\n\nAirport security\n\nYour old driver's license might not be enough to get you through airport security next time you fly.\n\nA security law that was passed after the 9/11 attacks is finally set to go into effect this October, after being delayed a year due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nStarting October 1, travelers will need a REAL ID-compliant driver's license, US passport, US military ID or other acceptable identification to board a commercial aircraft in the US.\n\nA REAL ID is marked by a star on the top of the card. It was born out of the federal REAL ID Act, which established minimum security standards for the issuing of state licenses and their production. Under that act, federal agencies are prohibited from accepting licenses from states not meeting those minimum standards for certain activities.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security extended the deadline for states to comply with REAL ID requirements last year so that leaders could focus their efforts on the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nEmployment\n\nMany low-wage workers around the country will see a boost to their paychecks this year.\n\nTwenty states raised their minimum wage rates in 2021 -- some by pennies, others by a dollar or more. Some of the increases were part of previously scheduled efforts to adjust for cost of living, while others were aimed at moving toward goals like $15-an-hour minimum pay.\n\nIn New Mexico, the minimum wage will increase to $10.50, up $1.50 from the current $9 wage. And in California, the rate for employers with 26 workers or more will rise from $13 to $14 an hour, the highest statewide baseline in the country. In Minnesota, the gain is just 8 cents, to a $10.08 hourly rate for large employers.\n\nThe changes take on added significance after a year in which low-wage workers were hit especially hard by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHigher education\n\nnew law in Illinois aims to chip away at the problem of rising college tuition costs.\n\nAs of January 1, every child born or adopted in the state will have $50 deposited into a college savings account.\n\nThat small investment is part of a new law that establishes the Illinois Higher Education Savings Program, which lawmakers hope will encourage families to start saving for their child's education early and will allow that money to grow.\n\nIn addition to a traditional four-year college, the money can also be used for vocational schools, two-year colleges and other institutions.\n\nEnvironment\n\nHawaii made headlines in 2018 for becoming the first state to ban certain sunscreen sales to protect its coral reefs. Now, that law is finally in effect.\n\nIt's now illegal in the state to sell or distribute over-the-counter sunscreens containing oxybenzone and octinoxate, though wearing them is still allowed.\n\nThe chemicals in those sunscreens help protect the wearer from harmful UV rays.\n\nBut researchers have found that they also cause bleaching, deformities, DNA damage and ultimately death in coral when they're washed off beachgoers or discharged into wastewater treatment plants and deposited into bodies of water.\n\nDelaware residents will now have to take care to bring reusable bags with them when shopping, as part of a new state law aimed at bolstering recycling efforts.\n\nUnder state law, most retailers can no longer offer single-use plastic bags at checkout. Eligible businesses can instead offer bags made of paper, cloth or other reusable -- and they can also choose to charge a fee for them.\n\nEach Delawarean uses about 434 plastic bags and that means nearly 2,400 tons of plastic bags end up in our landfills annually, Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary Shawn Garvin said in a news release\n\nA decrease by the public of plastic carryout bags can mitigate a large portion of this waste, and help our environment by reducing the amount plastic bags on our roads and waterways that can harm us and our wildlife.
Mark Shields is a nationally known columnist and commentator.\n\nMark Shields: Why Newt Gingrich isn't missed\n\nWASHINGTON (CNN) -- What a lousy campaign year. Neither party said what it meant or meant what it said.\n\nLacking either the courage of their convictions or just the convictions, themselves, Democrats did not dare whisper in public what they privately professed to believe: that basic fiscal sanity and fundamental social justice demand an immediate repeal of the future Bush tax-cuts for the Best-Off among us.\n\nRevisionist and cowardly Republicans spent the year waist-high in Denial, fruitlessly rewriting history to insist that the word privatize-- as of Social Security -- had never passed their craven lips. Of course, privatize had been the exact term favored by many Republican pols ... until GOP pollsters discovered that voters, after watching the Dow-Jones drop like a rock, did not react positively to the idea of Kenny Boy Lay and his merry men of Enron managing their retirement savings.\n\nWhat had been an undistinguished political year looked absolutely noble when compared to the dishonorable character defects of the resigned Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, R-Georgia, nationally televised on the October 27 Meet the Press.\n\nFor calculated deceit and deliberate dishonesty, the former speaker showed he is still a master of that sinister art. The program was only two days after the death of Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minnesota, and his wife and five others in a plane crash while on a re-election campaign trip. Former Vice President Walter Mondale was being urged to run for the Wellstone seat.\n\nHere is what Newt Gingrich had to say: Walter Mondale chaired a commission that was for the privatization of Social Security worldwide. Added Gingrich, He chaired a commission that was for raising the retirement age dramatically. ... If you want to raise your retirement age dramatically and privatize Social Security, Walter Mondale is a terrifically courageous guy to say that.\n\nThis is vintage Newt. You begin with one true fact: Mondale did chair a commission at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a respected and thoroughly bipartisan Washington think tank that wrestles with global issues. And, yes, the commission did recommend market based financing for retirement programs for the industrial nations in place of pay-as-you-go.\n\nBut here is where it gets ugly. Mondale led the dissent from the majority views of the commission and strongly opposed (because) some of the commission's findings and recommendations could be interpreted as mandates to fundamentally change Social Security and Medicare.\n\nMondale's dissent rejected any commission plan that might result in the dismantling of social insurance programs and their replacement with funded (e.g. stock market) schemes. Gingrich deliberately and totally misrepresented Walter Mondale's clearly stated position on privatization of Social Security. The former speaker is undeniably bright. What he must have been seeking to do by his Big Lie was to poison the reputation of Mondale and thereby drain the enthusiasm for his candidacy from the army of Wellstone volunteers.\n\nThis is the same Gingrich who days before the 1994 election chose to exploit the horror of Susan Smith, the South Carolina woman who had drowned her two toddlers in the backseat of her car.\n\nHow a mother can kill her two children,14 months and 3 years, in hopes that her boyfriend would like her is just a sign of how sick the system is, observed Gingrich, and I think people want to change. The only way you get change is to vote Republican.\n\nFour years later, Speaker Gingrich led a family values House Republican lynch mob bent on stringing up and impeaching the faithless and lying husband who was the president of the United States and a Democrat.\n\nIt later became public that for more than five years, the married Gingrich had been carrying on a torrid affair with a younger, unmarried Capitol Hill staffer. And to think that Gingrich used to charge his political adversaries were the enemy of normal Americans.\n\nHe has distorted facts and damaged reputations, none more than his own. In his wake Gingrich has left lies, smears and distrust.\n\nWhat a tragic, hurtful and empty legacy for such a smart man.

For example, if a customer is looking for pasta, the app will direct the customer to the correct aisle. As the customer nears the aisle and approaches the type of pasta they chose, a personal avatar — like a banana or an avocado —will light up that directs them to the right one. They'll scan the item to check out, and the system will route the customer to the next item on their list.\n\nThe notion of Kroger having to figure out what digital looks like in store for a grocery shopper is super important, said Jason Goldberg, head of the commerce practice at digital agency SapientRazorfish. He believes the tech could appeal to customers who want more information about the food they're buying, where it comes from, and how to store it in their homes.\n\nShelves at the two tech-enhanced stores will also look much different than traditional stores.\n\nInstead of paper tags for prices and promotions, they will be digital. That creates room for Kroger to sell advertising space to brands, which could provide a new profit stream in the low-margin grocery business.\n\nPHOTO: courtesy Kroger & Microsoft Kroger is working with Microsoft to bring digital shelves, price tags, and advertisements to two pilot stores.\n\nSwitching will help Kroger quickly change prices on products and create deals, instead of an employee manually making the changes. Kroger said it will boost workers' productivity, since employees will be able to quickly locate products for customers' curbside grocery pickup orders.\n\nKroger's (KR) move is a play to keep pace with rivals investing heavily in AI and cashier-less technology to reduce long lines at stores, a frequent pain point for customers.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) reportedly plans to have as many as 3,000 cashier-less Go stores by 2021. Walmart's (WMT) Sam's Club recently opened up a Sam's Club Now in Dallas, Texas, that has shoppers pay with their phones and use them to find products in the store. Walmart has also added detailed digital store maps to its mobile app to guide shoppers to aisles and products.\n\nKroger will try to sell the new technology with Microsoft (MSFT) to retailers in the United States and around the world.\n\nI'm a little skeptical of it, Goldberg said. If I'm Albertsons or Walmart, do I want to buy a digital merchandising solution that was invented by Kroger?\n\nCNN Business' Rachel Metz contributed to this story.

We've just been spoiled.\n\n(CNN Business) —\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are hearing some footsteps behind them today.\n\nA high-profile group of banks, brokerages and market makers revealed plans on Monday to join forces and start their own trading venue called the Members Exchange.\n\nThe launch of the new exchange, backed by power players like Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC), UBS, Citadel Securities and Fidelity Investments, underscores longstanding frustrations with the current system.\n\nIn particular, brokerages and market makers are upset with the cost that leading exchanges charge for access to the lucrative data feeds that are used to monitor stock prices.\n\nThe level of frustration was just so high for many of us that we had to do something more proactive for us and our clients, Vlad Khandros, global head of market structure and liquidity strategy at UBS (UBS), told CNN Business. There's this massive burden on us and our clients.\n\nMembers Exchange, or MEMX, aims to disrupt the exchange business, which is dominated by just a few small players. The goal is to simplify and lower fees by boosting competition and increasing transparency.\n\nOther founding members include Charles Schwab (SCHW), E*Trade (ETFC), Morgan Stanley (MS) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD).\n\nThey're saying, 'We're going to take our ball and start our own thing,' said Joe Saluzzi, co-head of trading at New Jersey brokerage firm Themis Trading and author of Broken Markets.\n\nExchange stocks retreat\n\nSteve Quirk, executive vice president of trading and education at TD Ameritrade, said that market data costs have become quite gaudy.\n\nThe new competition is likely to erode the ability of existing exchanges to keep ramping up fees on brokerage firms and market makers, especially for data feeds. These lucrative data feeds give financial players key insight on market movements. Fee structure can vary based on what types of data is being sought.\n\nBy charging hefty fees for access to that data, exchanges have found a way to juice revenue in recent years.\n\nMembers Exchange does not plan to compete with NYSE and Nasdaq on the separate business of listing stocks. NYSE and Nasdaq regularly vie for bragging rights to say they brought major private companies like Uber and Lyft public in splashy IPOs.\n\nShares of Nasdaq (NDAQ) dropped more than 2% on Monday. IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), which owns the iconic New York Stock Exchange, also retreated nearly 2%.\n\nNYSE declined to comment on the launch of Members Exchange.\n\nWe welcome competition to our transparent, highly regulated equity markets, Nasdaq spokesman Joseph Christinat, told CNN Business. However, with dozens of equity trading venues already in operation in the United States, we are keen to learn more about the value proposition of a new exchange.\n\nAlthough there may be many trading venues, the business is concentrated in the hands of a few powerful players.\n\nSixty-one percent of stock trades took place at just three exchanges in 2018: NYSE, Nasdaq and CBOE, according to research by TABB Group.\n\nNYSE led the way, with nearly one-quarter of the market. Another one-fifth went to Nasdaq. The next-closest player was IEX Group, the exchange that was founded in 2012 in a bid to capitalize on concerns about high-frequency trading sparked by the Michael Lewis novel Flash Boys.\n\nWhile IEX has been slow to gain market share, MEMX could have a leg up. It will launch with the backing of financial heavyweights that can bring their order flow with them.\n\nBrad Katsuyama, IEX CEO and co-founder, said Monday in a statement that IEX expects the industry will change dramatically in the coming years.\n\nThis is the latest affirmation that the exchange business is rife with conflicts of interest and market participants can no longer tolerate the abuses of power, he said.\n\nTABB Group said that 36% of the stock trading volume in 2018 took place off-exchange. That includes action at dark pools — exchanges that allow anonymous trades, often between large institutions. Other off-exchange trading takes place when high-speed trading firms like Virtu purchases retail order flow from brokers and execute the transactions themselves. And sometimes brokers make over-the-counter trades for institutional clients.\n\nMEMX raised $70 million in an initial round of funding and hopes to add new investors at a later date, a person familiar with the matter told CNN Business. The group plans to file paperwork early this year seeking SEC approval to become a national securities exchange.\n\nTrading fees can't go much lower\n\nStill, Saluzzi suspects that mom-and-pop investors will see little change from the entrance of Members Exchange.\n\nTrading fees are already almost zero, said Saluzzi. I don't think the regular investor will see any difference from this. It's purely profit-driven, which is fine.\n\nOne industry executive complained that some of the companies involved in the Members Exchange have been hit with lawsuits and fines for alleged equity trading violations.\n\nFor instance, last year Bank of America Merrill Lynch admitted to systematically misleading clients between 2008 and 2013 about how orders were handled for more than 4 billion shares of stock.\n\nThey're letting the fox build the henhouse, the executive said.\n\nJamil Nazarali, Citadel Securities' global head of business development, disputed that argument by noting the diversity of the MEMX's backers.\n\nThis is a very broad group of partners, including leaders from every aspect of the market, Nazarali said.
Bush seeks boost in volunteerism From Kelly Wallace\n\nCNN Washington Bureau\n\nWASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush, in Philadelphia on Tuesday urging Americans to perform community service, has directed his Cabinet to report within 30 days on ways to boost volunteerism, an administration official said. The directive is part of the president's USA Freedom Corps initiative, detailed in his State of the Union address in January, calling on Americans to give at least two years of service, the equivalent of 4,000 hours, to others. Bush renewed that call in Philadelphia, where he participated in a discussion on volunteerism that was preceded by a tour of the People's Emergency Center, a shelter for homeless women and children. This is a good place to come and start a dialogue, the president said. Societies change one heart, one soul, one conscience at a time, and government can hand out money but it cannot put hope in people's hearts. Bush said volunteerism has increased since his State of the Union address, and said he had instructed government agencies to make it easier for Americans to volunteer. A senior administration official said the president wants federal agencies to review service opportunities and barriers. Lindsey Kozberg, communications director for the USA Freedom Corps, said the goal is to get the federal house in order so that we know where service opportunities exist, we make sure the public knows about those opportunities and we ... break down any barriers or hindrances to volunteer service that exist in our regulations or programs. For example, Kozberg said, Americans might not be aware of volunteer opportunities such as with the National Park Service or Veterans Affairs hospitals. Since the launch of USA Freedom Corps, applications for the Peace Corps are up more than 50 percent and those for the AmeriCorps program, the initiative President Clinton launched to encourage national service, are up nearly 50 percent, the White House said. Almost 20,000 people nationwide have signed up to participate in the Citizen Corps, an effort designed to help local communities fight terrorism, administration officials said.
Former Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar listens during the sentencing phase in Eaton, County Circuit Court on January 31, 2018 in Charlotte, Michigan. Last week Nassar was sentenced in Ingham County to 40 years to 175 years in prison. The number of identified sexual abuse victims of former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar has grown to 265, a Michigan judge announced Wednesday as a final sentencing hearing commenced. Prosecutors said at least 65 victims were to confront Nassar in court, in the last of three sentencing hearings for the disgraced doctor who molested young girls and women for two decades in the guise of medical treatment. / AFP PHOTO / JEFF KOWALSKY (Photo credit should read JEFF KOWALSKY/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nZURICH, SWITZERLAND - SEPTEMBER 22: Harvey Weinstein attends the 'Lion' premiere and opening ceremony of the 12th Zurich Film Festival at Kino Corso on September 22, 2016 in Zurich, Switzerland.

(Photo by Clive Brunskill/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nOn the eve of former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar's sentencing for sexually abusing girls in his care, American gymnast Simone Biles has come forward to say me, too.\n\nI, too, am one of the many survivors that was sexually abused by Larry Nassar, she said Monday afternoon in a Twitter post with the hashtag #MeToo.\n\nThere are many reasons that I have been reluctant to share my story, but I know now that it is not my fault.\n\nNassar was the team doctor for USA Gymnastics through four Olympic Games, treating young hopefuls and gold medal winners. His case illustrates the drive of the #MeToo movement to call out serial predatory behavior and the forces that enable it.\n\nThis experience 'does not define me'\n\nMore than 140 female athletes said they were abused by the once-respected doctor, including Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney, members of the Fierce Five US Olympic gymnastics team that won the gold in 2012. Many said they were pressured into silence by powerful institutions, including USA Gymnastics, the sport's governing body in the United States.\n\nIn response to Biles' statement, the organization pledged unwavering support for Biles and others who have courageously come forward.\n\nUSA Gymnastics is absolutely heartbroken, sorry and angry that Simone Biles or any of our athletes have been harmed by the horrific acts of Larry Nassar, the group said. We are our athletes' advocates. USA Gymnastics will continue to listen to our athletes and our members in our efforts of creating a culture of empowerment with a relentless focus on athlete safety every single day.\n\nBiles, now 20, joined the US Olympic gymnastics team in 2016, winning the individual all-around. Though her statement did not include specific allegations against Nassar, she described experiencing abuse under the guise of special treatment, a recurring claim from Nassar's victims.\n\nThis behavior is completely unacceptable, disgusting, and abusive, especially coming from someone I was TOLD to trust, she said Monday.\n\nShe, too, called out USA Gymnastics for its alleged role in allowing Nassar to prey on young girls for decades.\n\nFor far too long I've asked myself 'Was I too naive? Was it my fault?' I now know the answer to those questions. No. No. It was not my fault. No, I will not and should not carry the guilt that belongs to Larry Nassar, USAG, and others.\n\nAfter hearing the brave stories of my friends and other survivors, I know that this horrific experience does not define me.\n\nDozens of victims expected to speak\n\nNassar faces sentencing on Tuesday in Michigan state court after pleading guilty in November to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct. He faces additional sentencing later this month on three counts of criminal sexual assault involving victims in a neighboring county.\n\nHe worked at Michigan State University from 1997 to 2016 as an associate professor, and he served as the gymnastics and women's crew team physician. In his plea, Nassar admitted to sexually abusing patients under the guise of providing medically necessary treatment in instances as far back as 1998, some of which involved girls under 13.\n\nSeveral days have been set aside in Nassar's sentencing for victim impact statements. At least 88 people are expected to speak, according to the Michigan Attorney General's Office.\n\nAt his plea hearing, Nassar apologized and compared his crimes to a match that turned into a forest fire.\n\nAllegations of a culture of complicity\n\nBiles' teammates and others have repeatedly accused USA Gymnastics of complicity in Nassar's abuse. In 2017, the organization said it would implement 70 policy change recommendations from an independent investigator.\n\nIn a lawsuit, Maroney said USA Gymnastics paid her to be quiet about the abuse, which she said began when she was 13.\n\nUniversity of Oklahoma gymnast Maggie Nichols said she and a coach reported abuse by Nassar to USA Gymnastics in 2015, a few years after Nassar began treating Nichols for a back injury. USA Gymnastics said it hired an independent investigator to look into her allegations.\n\nRaisman said she was first treated by Nassar when she was 15. She called for a thorough investigation of a system that she said enabled a monster to thrive for decades by silencing victims.\n\nOn Monday, Raisman praised Biles for coming forward and vowed to stand with her.\n\nI know we will all get through this together, Raisman said on Twitter.\n\nIn her statement Monday, Biles said she hoped for the kind of reckoning that would prevent serial predators from striking again.\n\nWe need to know why this was able to take place for so long and to so many of us. We need to make sure something like this never happens again.\n\nCNN's Amanda Jackson and Eric Levenson contributed to this report.\n\nCorrection: Earlier versions of this story incorrectly indicated that Biles was a member of the 2012 Olympic team. She was a member of the 2016 team.
New York (CNN Business) Microsoft is rumored to be working on a major redesign of Windows 10 that could bring big changes to the way the PC operating system looks and functions.\n\nWindows 10 could use a refresh. Aside from twice-annual tweaks, Windows 10 been mostly unchanged since its release in 2015 . Six years is long in the tooth for any PC operating system, and a revolution is coming to personal computers that threatens Windows' standing as the dominant productivity operating system.\n\nStill, doesn't exactly have the best reputation for fixing operating systems that ain't broke. So a lot is riding on Microsoft's ability to turn the next iteration of Windows 10 into something hundreds of millions of computer owners will want to keep using\n\nWhat's in the refresh?\n\nMicrosoft updates Windows twice a year, usually adding a few welcome new features (a new screenshot tool, a cleaner Start Menu, etc.). This year's spring update will be another one of those minor updates that adds polish and squashes bugs.\n\nBut in the fall, Microsoft is expected to unleash a full-scale Windows 10 redesign. We know this for a few reasons.\n\nMicrosoft recently posted a job listing on its website that said the company is working on a sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows experiences to signal to our customers that Windows is BACK and ensure that Windows is considered the best user OS experience for customers, according to Windows Latest . The listing remains but the language has since been dialed back quite a bit.\n\nMicrosoft did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThat job post confirmed widespread reports that Microsoft was working on a major Windows 10 user-inferface refresh codenamed Sun Valley, in which Microsoft would release an all-new Start Menu, File Explorer, Action Center and taskbar. Tablet users will also reportedly get a redesigned virtual keyboard with better access to emojis. And Microsoft is expected to give all Windows 10 elements a makeover to align all of the recently tweaked elements of the operating system in a consistent design.\n\nWhy Windows needs a refresh\n\nMost of Windows' recent tweaks have been aimed at specific audiences, particularly gamers and corporate customers. But the PC is back as a consumer staple -- the work-from-home era brought on by the coronavirus pandemic has made productivity cool again. Microsoft wants to ensure its new everyday users are enjoying the experience of using their PCs.\n\nMicrosoft is also looking ahead to a future it's attempting to prepare for: Apple's new M1 chip , which is essentially a custom-built smartphone microprocessor on steroids for Macs, represents a sea change for the PC industry.\n\nApple's new Mac OS Big Sur takes advantage of the new chip by integrating features people have grown accustomed to on their iPhones and iPads. The convergence of smartphones, tablets and PCs is underway.\n\nApple's AAPL Microsoft has its own hybrid device, the Surface Pro X, that runs on a chip with a similar architecture toM1. And it's coming out with Windows 10X this year, an operating system designed from the ground up for nontraditional devices (think foldables, tablets and other computers that don't look like normal laptops or desktops).\n\nStill, this new kind of chip could disrupt the staid PC world, lighting a fire under Microsoft to redesign Windows for new kinds of PCs that it hasn't conceived of yet. So it's about time Windows 10 gets a major refresh.\n\nSad history of Windows updates\n\nIt doesn't appear as though the Sun Valley version of Windows 10 will be the kind of completely new experience of previous new iterations of Windows. That's probably a good thing, as Microsoft has a reputation for delivering a good operating system every other attempt:
Some of us like to escape our Blursday monotony with a breathless page-turner. Others seek out nonfiction to better understand the complex, chaotic world around us. And some of us just can't stop doomscrolling on our phones.\n\nNow is not the time to judge anyone's literary tastes or reading habits -- hey, whatever reading helps you get through this is fine.\n\nThank goodness the publishing industry keeps churning out new books. Like your busy menu of Netflix or Amazon Prime offerings, there's something on publishers' lists for everyone.\n\nHere are 12 intriguing titles coming in the first half of 2021.\n\nFICTION\n\nConcrete Rose, by Angie Thomas (January)\n\nAngie Thomas captivated young adult readers with The Hate U Give, her novel about a Black teen, Starr Carter, who must decide whether to speak out after witnessing her best friend getting shot and killed by police. Now Thomas is back with a prequel of sorts about Starr's father, Maverick Carter, a gang member who tries to go straight after he becomes a father for the first time. Like its predecessor, Concrete Rose poses moral questions as it forces its teenage protagonist to decide what kind of adult to become.\n\nMy Year Abroad, by Chang-Rae Lee (February)\n\nThe acclaimed Korean-American writer's new novel is about an uninspired American college student whose life is transformed when he is chosen to accompany an eccentric entrepreneur on a long, freewheeling journey across Asia. Author Jeffrey Eugenides says Lee's book describes the enticements, mirages, pleasures and catastrophes that attend not only the pursuit of wealth but the pursuit of happiness in all its forms.\n\nA Bright Ray of Darkness, by Ethan Hawke (February)\n\nOne of Hollywood's most literate actors, Hawke is no dilettante when it comes to writing fiction. This novel , his first in almost 20 years, is about a self-destructive young actor making his Broadway debut in Henry IV as his marriage is falling apart. No doubt any similarities between the book and Hawke's own life -- he debuted on Broadway at 21 and endured a messy divorce from actress Uma Thurman -- are coincidental.\n\nOf Women and Salt, by Gabriela Garcia (March)\n\nThis buzzy debut novel by the daughter of immigrants from Mexico and Cuba is a layered saga about three generations of Latinas. It's the story of a troubled Miami woman who travels to Cuba to see her grandmother and grapple with secrets from her family's past. Writer Roxane Gay says Garcia captures the lives of Cuban women in a world to which they refuse to surrender and she does so with precision and generosity and beauty.\n\nLater, by Stephen King (March)\n\nA Stephen King thriller rarely disappoints, and this one , his third entry in the retro Hard Case Crime series, revisits one of his recurring themes: tormented adolescents facing off against evil. (See It, Firestarter, etc.) This time, his main character is a boy with supernatural gifts who is recruited by his mom's boyfriend, a NYPD detective, to help catch a killer.\n\nProject Hail Mary, by Andy Weir (May)\n\nYou may not recognize Andy Weir's name, but you know his work -- he wrote The Martian, which became the popular Matt Damon movie. Weir returns to space once again for this science-based thriller , about an astronaut who awakes in the middle of a long galactic journey to discover his two crewmates are dead and the Earth is facing a disastrous threat. So yes, another story about a man alone in space, facing almost certain doom. Sign us up!\n\nNONFICTION\n\nJust as I am, by Cicely Tyson (January)\n\nA reigning queen of Hollywood, Tyson has radiated grace and dignity onscreen for more than half a century. The actress was the first African American to appear on a TV drama in the 1960s and later survived a turbulent marriage to jazz great Miles Davis. Now, at 95, she's ready to tell her story. ' Just As I Am ' is my truth ... plain and unvarnished, she writes. And here in my ninth decade, I am a woman who, at long last, has something meaningful to say.\n\nA Shot in the Moonlight: How a Freed Slave and a Confederate Soldier Fought for Justice in the Jim Crow South, by Ben Montgomery (January)\n\nOne night in 1897, a mob of armed White men surrounded the Kentucky home of George Dinning, a freed slave who was wrongfully accused of stealing livestock. Dinning fired back in self-defense, killing one of the men. We've all read enough history to know how such stories end, but this one takes a remarkable turn: With the help of a Confederate soldier-turned-lawyer, Dinning triumphs in court, becoming the first Black man in America to win damages after a wrongful murder conviction. Pulitzer-winner Colson Whitehead, author of The Underground Railroad, has praised Montgomery's book as inspiring and terrifying in its timelessness.\n\nHow to Avoid a Climate Disaster, by Bill Gates (February)\n\nGates has been lobbying publicly for years about the need for drastic action on climate change, and now he's collected his ideas into a book . The billionaire philanthropist gathers advice from experts while laying out his vision for technological innovations that could reduce greenhouse gases and stop the warming of the planet. If even some of his plans work, this might be the most important book of the year.\n\nThe Daughters of Kobani: A Story of Rebellion, Courage, and Justice, by Gayle Tzemach Lemmon (February)\n\nLemmon's books, especially Ashley's War and The Dressmaker of Khair Khana, have extolled heroic women fighting sexism in the military and oppression in the Islamic world. Now she's back with  The Daughters of Kobani , a remarkable true story about an all-female Kurdish militia who helped drive ISIS from northern Syria. It's only a matter of time before Hollywood makes a movie about this.\n\nMike Nichols: A Life, by Mark Harris (February)\n\nDirector Mike Nichols shot to fame in the 1960s with the classic movie The Graduate and enjoyed a long career on Broadway and in Hollywood, becoming one of the few entertainers ever to win Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards. Cultural critic Mark Harris chronicles the many highs of Nichols' remarkable life but also his difficult childhood -- he was bullied in school and his father died when he was 12 -- and his later struggles with depression. The book includes reminiscences from hundreds of Nichols' famous collaborators, including Elaine May, Meryl Streep, Robert Redford, Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts.\n\nWomen in White Coats: How the First Women Doctors Changed the World of Medicine, by Olivia Campbell (March)
(CNN) Two new variants of the coronavirus have emerged that seem to make the virus more easily transmitted. But will they stymie vaccination efforts?\n\nOne, first identified in Britain, has popped up around the world. While researchers worried at first that it might have changed enough to evade the protection offered by coronavirus vaccines, the evidence suggests it has not.\n\nBut a second new variant first seen in South Africa may carry changes that would help the virus at least partly escape the immunity provided by some of the current vaccines.\n\nIt has to do with where the changes are, and how they affect the shape and function of the virus.\n\nAll the current vaccines target what is known as the spike protein -- the structure the virus uses to get into the cells it attacks.\n\nThis protein happens to be so important that it is always on display, said Dr. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who is helping lead clinical trials there of coronavirus vaccines.\n\nIt makes sense that our immune system would be focused on that important part of the virus.\n\nIt's a highly recognizable part of the virus, and the vaccines in development all aim to train the body to recognize that flag and attack it.\n\nMutations that change the way that spike protein looks can also help it hide from both arms of the immune system -- the antibodies that attach to a virus and stop it from latching onto cells, as well as the T cells that attack the virus.\n\nThere could be mutations in the spike protein that change it in a way that our antibodies won't be as good. We haven't seen that happen yet, Creech told CNN.\n\nThere were worries that a set of mutations first identified in England -- and now seen to have arisen around the world -- might help the coronavirus evade vaccines. But the evidence now indicates that while those mutations appear to have made the virus more contagious, they have not affected whether the immune system can recognize it.\n\nA variant first identified in South Africa is a little more worrying, however. It has mutations in one particular place on the spike protein, called E484 by viral geneticists, that affect whether the immune system can neutralize the virus.\n\nSeveral studies found mutations there can reduce the neutralization activity by as much as 10-fold.\n\nBut the complex human immune system response might still allow the body to block the virus from a variety of other directions. While the mutation could foil antibodies focused on that particular piece of the spike protein, it won't affect antibodies trained to look for other parts of the virus.\n\nIt is analogous to a key and lock. If that lock changes, maybe the key can't get in, said Scott Hensley, an expert in immunology and molecular biology at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nBut imagine this not as a single door into a room, but 10 different doors. There will be nine other keys that will be able to get you into that room.\n\nThat's because people usually make more than one type of antibody against a virus.\n\nThe human immune system is complicated, and it is likely that most of us have antibodies against multiple targets, Hensley told CNN. It is likely these variants are not going to have a huge effect on the vaccine response.\n\nMicrobiologist Jesse Bloom of the University of Washington and colleagues found strong evidence this is the case.\n\nIn a preprint study posted Tuesday -- one that has not been peer reviewed or published in a scientific journal -- they described how the immune cells and antibodies in blood taken from 11 different people responded in many different ways to mutations in the virus.\n\nFor a few people, mutations allowed the virus to escape so called neutralizing antibodies, which stop the virus from getting into cells. But in blood serum taken from others, even mutant virus was overwhelmed by the variety of antibodies produced.\n\nThere is extensive person-to-person variation in how mutations affect serum antibody binding and neutralization, they wrote.\n\nCreech said a virus really cannot afford to mutate too much.\n\nIf it changes too much, it can't bind to the cell surface now and it's not just a good virus any more, he said. It might evade the immune response elicited by a vaccine, but it also would be unable to infect cells.\n\nAll viruses mutate, or drift. Some do so more than others. Influenza drifts constantly, forcing annual changes to the vaccine mixes used to fight it, while any changes seen to measles have not affected how well the vaccine works.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nScientists hope coronavirus is more like measles than influenza. But Creech and Hensley agree there is a clear solution to defeating any potential mutations in the virus.\n\nThe most important thing that we could do is encourage vaccination, Hensley said.\n\nLet's stop this virus in its tracks. If we could magically get 60-70% of the population vaccinated tomorrow, we wouldn't have to worry about drift because the virus would pretty much go extinct.
Indians are protesting a government plan to tax products that millions of women can't do without.\n\nSanitary pads are set to be taxed at 12% under a new set of national rates set by the government. Thousands of people say the levy should be zero.\n\nThe new rates, released a week ago, are part of a massive overhaul of India's tax code. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is meant to simplify India's complex web of state levies by assigning each commodity a uniform national tax rate.\n\nSome essential products won't be taxed as part of the plan, including condoms and contraceptives. Protesters have questioned why sanitary pads aren't exempt too.\n\nA petition by Indian lawmaker Sushmita Dev, which calls for feminine hygiene products to be tax-free, has been signed by more than 300,000 people.\n\nWe handed over the petition for tax free sanitary napkins under GST to Hnble Finanace Minister with https://t.co/6wA6vdpdZq & youthkiawaaz. pic.twitter.com/sTWBuQ7ikS — Sushmita Dev (@sushmitadevmp) May 18, 2017\n\nThousands more, including several celebrities, have joined another viral campaign making the same demand. The campaign is called #LahuKaLagaan -- which translates to tax on blood.\n\nSanitary Napkins are not a luxury, it is our basic necessity. Say no to taxes on sanitary napkins @arunjaitley #shesaysIndia #LahukaLagaan — Nikita Goyal (@NikitaGoyal03) May 25, 2017\n\nDear @arunjaitley ji. Please abolish the tax on sanitary napkins, for the health of India's female population! #LahuKaLagaan @SheSaysIndia https://t.co/XLKVdEV44P — VISHAL DADLANI (@VishalDadlani) May 1, 2017\n\nThe campaign was launched by a group called SheSays, which aims to end gender-based discrimination.\n\nThe right for women to have access to menstrual hygiene and sanitation is absolute, said Trisha Shetty, the founder of SheSays. Women should not be discriminated against on the grounds of a natural bodily function.\n\nIndia's finance ministry did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe rural poor\n\nSanitary pads, which cost between five rupees ($0.08) and 12 rupees ($0.20) each, are currently taxed at different rates. In some states, the rate can go as high as 14.5%.\n\nThat puts them beyond the reach of millions of impoverished rural women.\n\nWomen are already not on an equal playing field, and on top of that you choose to tax them, said Vidisha Mishra, an expert on gender at Delhi-based think tank Observer Research Foundation.\n\nIt is unfair on a very constitutional level, she added.\n\nA 2011 study by market research firm Nielsen found that only 12% of India's women use sanitary pads.\n\nThe vast majority rely instead on cloths and rags, but sawdust, ashes, leaves and other substitutes are sometimes used, leading to infections. The lack of proper menstrual hygiene and sanitation has been linked to girls dropping out of school and lower productivity in the workplace.\n\nGlobal precedent\n\nThe higher cost associated with products used by women is a global issue.\n\nSeveral U.S. state legislators called for abolishing the tampon tax last year, while the pink tax -- where women pay more than men for similar products -- has also been slammed by activists in several countries.\n\nThe Indian government still has room to change tax rates before a scheduled July 1 deadline.\n\nIf it does, India will join Ireland, Kenya and Canada to become one of the few countries that have made sanitary products tax-free.\n\nThis policy is insensitive, said Mishra. Policy makers are usually men, and for that reason menstruation is not on their mind.
Jamie Squire/Getty Images\n\nGLENDALE, Ariz. — Tyler Dorsey wants everyone to know that he would like to drop the nickname Mr. March.\n\nI don't really care for the name, Dorsey said. I play throughout the season.\n\nDorsey's point is he's been a factor all season, and yes, Dorsey was a really good college basketball player through the first four months of the season. Before the calendar turned to the month of madness, he averaged 12.4 points and shot 42.6 percent from the field and 37.8 percent from beyond the arc.\n\nThose are respectable numbers.\n\nBut over the last seven games leading up to Saturday's contest against North Carolina, Dorsey has gone from good to the best player in college basketball.\n\nIn the postseason, he's averaged 23.6 points and scored 20 or more in seven straight games. In the seven games prior, he didn't reach 20 points once.\n\nHis efficiency numbers mirror a guy who shoots all his shots at the rim and is not a jump-shooter. He has shot 66.7 percent from the field and 65.3 percent from beyond the arc in the NCAA tournament.\n\nOne opponent after another has waited for Dorsey to cool off, and one after another has watched an endless loop of Dorsey jumpers fall through the basket.\n\nWe figured the way he was playing he might not play at that same level after playing the whole [Pac-12] tournament like that, said Iona coach Tim Cluess, who saw Dorsey score 24 points in the opening round. A lot of times guys will do it for a couple games in a row and then come back to earth. He hasn't touched back down yet.\n\nJamie Squire/Getty Images\n\nThe man these coaches could blame—or maybe should have a put a call into (hint, hint Roy Williams)—is Oregon State coach Wayne Tinkle.\n\nBack on March 4, Dorsey no-showed in the regular-season finale in Corvallis, scoring just one point in 20 minutes.\n\nThe next day was an off day for the Ducks, but Oregon assistant coach Kevin McKenna took a trip to Matthew Knight Arena to fetch a leather jacket for his daughter, who had attended an Elton John concert there the night before and left it behind.\n\nMcKenna heard a ball bouncing in the practice gym and peeked his head in. He found Dorsey with a frustrated look on his face as he got up jumpers.\n\nTyler, don't worry about what's going on, McKenna told him. You're going to have a big week here, and we're going to be fine. You're working hard. Your shot is going to go. Don't stress about it.\n\nIt wasn't just that game, Dorsey said. I felt like throughout the season, I could have done more.\n\nDorsey knew he needed to become more aggressive, and he got the opportunity to increase his role when third-leading scorer Chris Boucher tore his ACL in the Pac-12 semifinals against California.\n\nThe role he's playing now is more reminiscent of how he was used at Maranatha High School in Pasadena, Calif., where he averaged 34 points per game as a senior.\n\nHe's a guy that's got to have the ball in his hands, Dorsey's high school coach Tim Tucker said. For them to have three other point guards, sometimes he gets caught as that guy like Kurt Rambis in the Lakers offense standing in the corner just waiting for the ball to come his way. That can kind of kill a kid like him. He's got to be engaged and got to be involved in order to be effective.\n\nAs you've seen in the last seven games, he's got to touch the ball in order for them to keep moving forward.\n\nIf there was another trigger to this ridiculous run, it's that Dorsey has always played his best when doubt from the outside might begin to creep in.\n\nIn the summer of 2015, Dorsey was cut from the Under-19 team for the United States that was scheduled to play in the 2015 FIBA U19 World Championships in Crete.\n\nDorsey figured out a way he could still play in the tournament—his mother Samiais is Greek—and he starred for the U-19 team, leading a run to the semifinals and averaging 15.9 points per game to earn all-tournament team honors. The highlight was 23 points against the U.S. team he had been told he wasn't good enough to make.\n\nI think for him whenever there's a failure, it makes him get back in the lab, and he's going to make you remember that you didn't take him, Tucker said. When they didn't pick him on that U.S. team, he goes to Greece and made them understand that I should have been on this team.\n\nMany outsiders questioned Oregon's chances to make a run in the NCAA tournament once Boucher was lost.\n\nBut Oregon's offense has actually been better without Boucher and a heavier dose of Dorsey.\n\nThe Ducks haven't had to change what they do, either, to accommodate his scoring binge. Getting Dorsey buckets is simple. Simply throw him the ball, and as he likes to say, let him cook.\n\nAccording to Synergy Sports, Dorsey has been the most efficient scorer in the NCAA tournament in transition (1.545 points per possession) and in isolation (1.6). He isn't No. 1 in pick-and-roll situations because of four turnovers, but he's made seven out of the eight shots he's taken—all threes—when working off a ball screen.\n\nI see teams, especially at the end of shot clock, they're backpedaling when he's walking them in and hands down, and he's just pulling up and teeing up shots, Oregon State's Tinkle said. I think guys like that, when they're on this kind of roll, you've got to push into them and make him put the ball on the floor and try to do something inside the three-point line.\n\nOregon State's strategy was to simply not let Dorsey have the ball. The Beavers tried to stay attached wherever he was to try to prevent touches.\n\nBut that's become more difficult now that Dorsey is bringing the ball down the floor more often. Kansas saw its chances at a Final Four berth essentially end because of that.\n\nDorsey walked into two three-pointers to end the first half last Sunday, burying back-to-back threes in a two-for-one situation. The shots took what felt like a manageable five-point deficit at half to 11, the second shot a buzzer-beating bank from 26 feet out that created doubt in the minds of the Jayhawks and their fans.\n\nVideo Play Button McCollum and the Blazers Snapped Postseason Losing Streak for Jennifer Spencer Is the Real Winner of the Boston Marathon Stars Invest in Plant-Based Food as Vegetarianism Sweeps NBA The NBA Got Some Wild Techs This Season Jarrett Allen Is One of the NBA's Hottest Rim Protectors Wade's Jersey Swaps Created Epic Moments This Season NBA Squads Brought the Heat with Bench Reactions This Year Westbrook Makes History While Honoring Nipsey Hussle Nation's Top-Ranked H.S.

He can come off a ball screen. He's got an in-between game. He can spin in the lane and score at the rim as well. And the fact that he's got so many weapons around him that you have to guard, and if you run doubles at him, he's going to make the right decision and kick the ball to open teammates to knock down those shots.\n\nDorsey's performances on the big stage have cooled some of the concerns about his ability to play at the NBA level. Mainly, scouts worry about his size (6'5) for a shooting guard.\n\nHe's proven to be a really good shooter, and the competition in the NBA is intense, and the NCAA tournament is the closest thing to it, an NBA scout told Bleacher Report.\n\nHe's going to be a second-round pick [if he comes out in this draft], and he's going to be a guy who has to go to the summer league and play well to earn a spot at training camp. If the decision comes down to do you want player A or player B, and player B is Tyler Dorsey and you know what he's been able to do in these situations, I think that breaks the tie.\n\n\n\nDorsey does have a track record of proving the doubters wrong. He also thrives in pressure-packed situations and has never been overwhelmed by the moment in this tournament, especially in Kansas City playing in what was like a road environment against Kansas.\n\nBefore that Elite Eight performance, legendary three-point shooter Reggie Miller approached Dorsey during warm-ups and told him to empty the clip.\n\nDorsey put 27 points and six threes on the Jayhawks.\n\nThat put him 10 threes away from tying Glen Rice's NCAA tournament record of 27 threes.\n\nAs the calendar flips to April at this weekend's Final Four, Dorsey will reload and get a chance to get folks to quit calling him Mr. March.\n\nTwo more showings like the previous seven this weekend at the Final Four, and he could trade up from Mr. March to another title.\n\nChampion.\n\nC.J.

(CNN) President Donald Trump, facing the gravest test of his presidency, signaled a de-escalation of tensions with Iran Wednesday in the wake of Iran's retaliatory attacks against Iraqi bases housing US troops .\n\nIran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world, Trump said, striking a somber tone during his White House statement.\n\nAn early warning system worked well and no American or Iraqi lives were lost, Trump said.\n\nTrump appeared to be positioning the US to de-escalate, but offered very little room for Iran to maneuver, essentially sticking to a maximalist approach and demanding that any de-escalation happen on US terms. Reading carefully from teleprompters, Trump announced that his administration would once again slap Iran with more sanctions and demanded that US allies leave the nuclear deal so a new pact can be negotiated.\n\nThe President's remarks set out no basic change from an administration strategy that has sharply ratcheted up tensions over the last year, putting the region on edge and bringing the US and Iran to the brink of war in the first days of the new year.\n\nThe United States will immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime, Trump said, noting his administration is continuing to review other options to respond to the Iranian missile strike on Tuesday.\n\nThese powerful sanctions will remain until Iran changes its behavior, he added. In recent months alone, Iran has seized ships in international waters, fired an unprovoked strike on Saudi Arabia and shot down two American drones.\n\nTrump seemed to keep his options open by explicitly describing American military readiness.\n\nOur missiles are big, powerful, accurate, lethal and fast, he said, a warning tucked into a speech that otherwise indicated an easing of strain.\n\nThe fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it, Trump said. We do not want to use it. American strength, both military and economic, is the best deterrent.\n\nIran fired a number of missiles at two Iraqi bases housing US troops Wednesday local time in retaliation for the American strike that killed a top Iranian general last week.\n\nAhead of Trump's remarks a growing belief emerged among administration officials that Iran deliberately missed areas populated by Americans.\n\nMultiple administration officials told CNN that Iran could have directed their missiles to hit areas that are populated by Americans, but intentionally did not. Iraq did receive advance warning that the strike was coming and was able to take necessary precautions, according to a statement from Iraq's Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi. A US defense official said that Iraq, in turn, gave advance warning to the United States.\n\nIraq's joint military command said there were no casualties among Iraqi military forces.\n\nIran targeted the al-Asad airbase, which houses US troops, and American and coalition forces in Erbil, according to Jonathan Hoffman, a Pentagon spokesperson. Trump had visited al-Asad in December 2018\n\n'All is well'\n\nTrump tweeted Tuesday night that he would make a statement Wednesday morning.\n\nAll is well! Trump tweeted. Missiles launched from Iran at two military bases located in Iraq. Assessment of casualties & damages taking place now. So far, so good! We have the most powerful and well equipped military anywhere in the world, by far! I will be making a statement tomorrow morning.\n\nThe administration officials who discussed Iran's targeting suggested that Tehran's leaders may have intended to send a message rather than take action significant enough to trigger a US military response, a possible indication that the White House is looking for a rationale to calm tensions.\n\nThe attack came days after the US killed top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in an airstrike in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. The administration sought to cast the strike as an attempt to de-escalate tensions with Iran, but Tehran has described it as an act of war and state terrorism. Soleimani had been the second most powerful official in the country.\n\nIn a televised speech to Iran Wednesday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei addressed the missile attacks and said Iran had given the US a slap in the face last night.\n\nHe added that America had cast Soleimani as a terrorist, which was unjust and unfair.\n\nThe Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, an elite wing of the Iranian military with immense political and economic power, said in a statement that the attacks on Iraqi bases were hard revenge for Soleimani's death. The IRGC said any country housing US troops could be subject to hostile and aggressive acts and called on American citizens to demand the administration remove US troops from the region.\n\nIt warned the US: If you repeat your wickedness or take any additional movements or make additional aggression, we will respond with more painful and crushing responses.\n\nAn image taken from video shown on Iran's Sima News reportedly shows the launch of the missiles fired at the Ain al-Asad airbase in Iraq.\n\nIran sent Iraq an official verbal message about the missile attacks shortly before midnight on Wednesday, according to a statement from Mahdi.\n\nHe said that Iraq was told that: The strike would be limited to the whereabouts of the US military in Iraq, without giving the exact location. Iraqi military leaders were warned to take the necessary precautions.\n\nThe prime minister said that Iraq had received no official information on losses from coalition forces.\n\nIn recent days, US bases have been on high alert due because of indications Iran might attack. A US military official told CNN the military had enough warning of the launches to sound alarms and people in harm's way were able to get to safety.\n\nIran warns the US\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted that the response was meant to be proportionate to the American attack that killed Soleimani, framing Iran's attack within international law. The top diplomat also said Iran had concluded its widely anticipated response Soleimani's killing.\n\nIran took & concluded proportionate measures in self-defense under Article 51 of UN Charter targeting base from which cowardly armed attack against our citizens & senior officials were launched, Zarif said. We do not seek escalation or war, but will defend ourselves against any aggression.\n\nThe rockets pose a direct challenge to Trump, who threatened Iran on Tuesday, just hours before the attacks began.\n\nIf Iran does anything that it shouldn't be doing, they will be suffering the consequences and very strongly, the President said.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Soleimani's killing, Trump repeatedly stressed that the deadly drone strike was meant to reduce violence.\n\nWe took action last night to stop a war, he told reporters a day after the attack. We did not take action to start a war.\n\nAfter the strikes Tuesday evening, Trump met in the White House Situation Room with members of his national security team including Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Joint Chiefs chairman Mark Milley, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, and press secretary Stephanie Grisham. CIA Director Gina Haspel attended the meeting remotely.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional breaking news developments.
Couples are spending less on their weddings, but they're still shelling out big money to walk down the aisle.\n\nThe average cost of a wedding was $33,391 last year, down 5% from $35,329 in 2016, according to The Knot's 2017 Real Wedding Study released Wednesday.\n\nThe price tag more than doubles for couples looking to tie the knot in New York City. It's the most expensive city to get married, with the average Manhattan wedding costing a whopping $76,944.\n\nHosting the event just outside the city, will save you a little cash — but not a lot. Couples getting married in North/Central New Jersey spent an average of $62,074, while Long Island couples forked over $61,113.\n\nRelated: To save money, couples are saying 'I do' on Thursdays\n\nCouples spent the least amount of money on their big day out west. New Mexico was the most affordable place to get married with the average wedding costing $17,584, followed by Utah, Oregon and Montana.\n\nA big driver behind the drop in wedding costs is a change in where people are getting married. The venue is the biggest wedding expense with a national average of $15,163.\n\nCouples are increasingly skipping more traditional venues like a hotel ballroom or country club, and hosting their receptions in more unique places like museums, parks or breweries that tend to be cheaper.\n\nCouples are looking for personalization, they don't want the cookie-cutter wedding, said Kristen Maxwell Cooper, editor in chief of The Knot. They want something representative of them and feels more fun.\n\nWeddings are also getting a lot less formal. Black-tie weddings have dropped from 20% in 2009 to 16%.\n\nRelated: Would you do a group honeymoon?\n\nOne tradition has remained fairly consistent: who pays for the wedding. The bride's parents are still writing the most checks, paying 45% of the overall wedding budget, on average. Couples pick up 41% of the tab.\n\nA higher focus on guest experience means couples are trimming their invite list, but spending more per guest. The average number of wedding guests dropped to 136 last year, down from 149 in 2009. However, couples are spending $268 per guest — a 38% increase from 2009.\n\nThey're going beyond a live band for entrainment, and also hiring dance performers, magicians and even a professional doing portraits of guests, according to The Knot.\n\nCouples want the guests they have invited to the wedding to walk away thinking, 'that was an amazing wedding,' said Maxwell Cooper.

Richard Blumenthal (D-CT). Aired 9-10p ET\n\nAired December 6, 2019 - 21:00 ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\n[21:00:00]\n\n\n\nANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: Whatever's going on there, I mean, if you look at the President when he's outside, these - it's clearly it's not a light bulb problem. You can see the line around his face where the makeup, or the tanner, whatever it is, stops. It's a whole system. It's a whole thing.\n\n\n\nBut hey, you heard him say, his Administration's looking to all this, so let's leave it there. Sleep well America, and know that the President is working hard from his Throne Room to get the gridlock unclogged on The Ridiculist.\n\n\n\nAnd that does it for us. The news continues. Want to hand it over to Chris and CUOMO PRIME TIME. Chris?\n\n\n\nCHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST: It is good a metaphor for the state of play as there can be. Anderson, thank you very much. I am Chris Cuomo. Welcome to PRIME TIME.\n\n\n\nNow, as you know, a U.S. Naval base has become a crime scene for the second time in a week. This time it was a Saudi military member named as the murderer. We're waiting on a presser from the FBI. They took over the case.\n\n\n\nNow, one obvious item of interest is motive, specifically, was this an act of terror? And that means something different to the FBI. They have to check certain boxes. We'll see what they say. As soon as it goes live, I'm going to take it.\n\n\n\nWe're also going to look more deeply tonight at how does our government decide who comes here and from where? And are events like this something that they figure in to the calculation?\n\n\n\nAnd Rudy Giuliani is making moves that may be making things worse for this President. We have a big Senate player here tonight with what it all means to him.\n\n\n\nWhat do you say? Happy Friday. Let's get after it.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTEXT: CUOMO PRIME TIME.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCUOMO: All right, like I said, as soon as they tell me that the press conference is ready, I think we should listen to it. Yes, we have a lot of other show planned but, you know, we can get fresh information on this very primary interest of why did this person do this.\n\n\n\nNow, we know what happened at the base in Pearl Harbor, right? They are investigating that as some type of mental health situation. This one seems to be different, all right? So, when the FBI is ready, we will go to them.\n\n\n\nHere's what we know.\n\n\n\nA Saudi Air Force member, a second lieutenant in the Saudi military, is named as the suspected murderer of three. And as many - I think it was eight people went away originally with injuries, a couple of left were waiting for an update on all of their dispositions as well.\n\n\n\nThe suspect had been training three - for two years on the dime of the Saudi government, according to the Pentagon. Now, this is done a lot. There's a lot of training that goes on with international people in America.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump was quick to help distance the Kingdom from the attack.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The King said that the Saudi people are greatly angered by the barbaric actions of the shooter, and that this person in no way, shape, or form, represents the feelings of the Saudi people who love the American people so much.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Now, if you've noticed in the past, this President is slow to excuse people when things happen, but not the Saudis.\n\n\n\nAnd we do know that they are cooperating with the FBI's investigation. Terror, of course, is a great concern here, and is being examined. But we'll have to see if the FBI feels that that's what this was about.\n\n\n\nNow, as we wait for more word, let's bring in CNN Counterterrorism Analyst, Phil Mudd, and CNN Global Affairs Analyst, Aaron David Miller. It's good to see you both.\n\n\n\nPhil, I don't know if you heard my question there. But you were part of this type of process. You also did some work for the Saudis in - individually.\n\n\n\nPHIL MUDD, CNN COUNTERTERRORISM ANALYST: Yes.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: So, what do you understand about how the U.S. government makes these kinds of determinations and whether or not this risk is part of the analysis.\n\n\n\nMUDD: It's got to be part of the analysis. Look, I remember, after 9/11, when I was at - at the Bureau, you have to sit back and look at a couple categories of people there - there are people here who are immigrants from Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n\nThere are not thousands but tens of thousands of students on this base alone. There is hundreds of foreigners. There's a lot of Saudis training in this country on military bases because we obviously sell billions of dollars in military equipment.\n\n\n\nSo, you step back, and say, Look, if you're dealing with tens of thousands of people from the Saudi military, from the student population, you've got to do a risk assessment, look at things like do they have a criminal history. That's what you--\n\n\n\nCUOMO: All right, hold on, Phil, Phil, let me--\n\n\n\nMUDD: Go ahead.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: --let's hold it up because they were just doing introductions. But now we're into the meat of it. Let's listen.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nRACHEL ROJAS, FBI JACKSONVILLE SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE: --grieving along with all of you. We are working tirelessly to find answers to the many questions surrounding what happened today.\n\n\n\nFBI personnel have been here since very early this morning, first, to assist our partners at Escambia County Sheriff's Office and NCIS. And now, we are here as the agency, coordinating this investigation, moving forward.\n\n\n\nThe FBI has available and is providing a wide range of resources, including agents, Intelligence analysts, and professional staff, from multiple field offices, as well as experts from the FBI Laboratory Division, the Evidence Response Teams from numerous field offices, and Victim Services and many more.\n\n\n\n[21:05:00]\n\n\n\nThese resources will likely continue to increase and come into this area over the next several hours and days. Just want to remind everybody here that we are all in this together.\n\n\n\nToday, our Evidence Response Teams began processing what is a large crime scene. Their work will continue tonight and into the morning.\n\n\n\nTheir work is going to be methodical. And it will not, and cannot be rushed. They have only one chance to get this right. And this is what we owe to the families. They will be here to uncover, are going to be our critical answers that we are all seeking.\n\n\n\nWe have also been working side by side throughout the day with our law enforcement partners, with the U.S. Attorney, Larry Keefe, and his team, to push forward in any direction this investigation may take us.\n\n\n\nThat being said, we are not prepared at this hour to confirm what may have motivated the shooter, to commit this horrific act today.\n\n\n\nThere are many reports circulating, but the FBI deals only in facts, and this is still very much an active and ongoing investigation. As soon as we can, we will share more.\n\n\n\nWe are also not yet officially confirming the shooter's name. There is a process of notifications and coordination that is still taking place at this hour. But we will provide that information to you when we can, and as soon as we can.\n\n\n\nUntil then, I want you all to know that we are working this together. We are going to work this around the clock. This is a 24/7 operation. We need to do this for 24/7 because we got to get this right for the community, and everybody gets the answers that they deserve.\n\n\n\nThis is going to take us some time, and we want to thank the public, and we want to thank the media, for your patience. And I know that's a lot to ask, and I do thank you sincerely for taking the patience with this.\n\n\n\nOn behalf of FBI Jacksonville, and obviously, the entire Federal Bureau of Investigation, we offer our support to the families of our innocent victims that was taken today from all of us, and to this entire community.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCUOMO: I mean, a really excellent job of this Agent who is in charge of the scene there, Agent Rojas, conveying a lot of emotion at the hurt that happened because of this murder on this Navy base in Pensacola.\n\n\n\nThe headlines are this. It's a big crime scene. We do know that the shooter traveled around. There are eight people who were hurt, initially. We're waiting for an update on that. They didn't have update information. They asked us to be patient. It's understandable.\n\n\n\nAs for motive, they have no information available at this time. Rojas even said that the name is something they're not confirming.\n\n\n\nSo, the one that you see swirling around out there - you probably know by now, my policy is I don't talk about murderers' names in these situations, whether they're school shootings, or something that's terror-suspected, I don't believe the name is meaningful for us, frankly. But they don't have any new information.\n\n\n\nSo, let's get to the analysis of what we do know now, what the right questions are going forward.\n\n\n\nSo Phil, you were making the point that you actually did at the governmental level weigh in, almost like an actuarial kind of assessment--\n\n\n\nMUDD: Yes.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: --that yes, at some point, one of these people may likely go bad. What - what's that about?\n\n\n\nMUDD: I mean the business of America is business. Whether you're in the university business, or in the corporate business, we open our doors to ensure that America is a cultural center for the world.\n\n\n\nWe want students around the world and businessmen to see America, and to ensure that America allows businessmen and students in, to - to ensure the America - the American economy moves forward.\n\n\n\nSo, you look, and we did this at - at the FBI, and say, if we have tens of thousands, just in Saudi Arabia's case alone, tens of thousands of students coming in, you can't say you're going to close the door to that number of students.\n\n\n\nYou can step back, and say, if we're going to look at that number of students, we got to work it - with the Saudis, and determine things like simple, Chris, do they have a criminal background? Tougher. Let's look at their email or social media accounts, and see if they have any connectivity with people who are of concern.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: This guy was vetted as clean.\n\n\n\nMUDD: It's about risk mitigation. It's--\n\n\n\nCUOMO: This guy was vetted as clean.\n\n\n\nMUDD: Yes.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: One other quick thing, Phil, and I want to get to ADM.\n\n\n\nMUDD: Yes.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: You're not supposed to have gun - as anybody's been around the military, you're supposed to check weapons. You're supposed to check ammunition. This was a hand gun. How hard is it to sneak a weapon onto a base?\n\n\n\n[21:10:00]\n\n\n\nMUDD: Oh, give me a break! This is America. First, the person's been here for a while. You're talking about up to two years, according to reports, in this case.\n\n\n\nSo, if you want to go into a major military base, and ensure that everybody driving onto that base gets a full personal and car check going out of the base, no way, Chris. That's just not going to happen.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: OK.\n\n\n\nMUDD: That's easy.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Aaron, thank you so much. It's great to have you on the show. The President was very quick to help the Saudi King give distance\n\n\n\nhere. And we have no information that this was anything other than one evil act, at this point. But when it comes to Saudi Arabia they do seem to get a wide berth from this President.\n\n\n\nDo you perceive the same? And, if so, what do you see as the basis?\n\n\n\nAARON DAVID MILLER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Oh, there's no question about it, Chris. It would take an atomic crowbar, I think, to separate this President from Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n\nOil money, the prospects of Saudi Arabia, not as an ally, and I consider it more a episodic security partner, and an important partner. But the President, I think, has created a margin of error and freedom of maneuver for the Saudis.\n\n\n\nHaving worked for four or five Administrations, never have I seen this degree of acquiescence or placating of Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: No.\n\n\n\nMILLER: And I think you saw it again today. The President was right to express what he heard from King Salman.\n\n\n\nBut the President could also have said, You know, I have the assurances, firm assurances from the Government of Saudi Arabia, the King himself, that they're going to cooperate, leave no stone unturned.\n\n\n\nThey'll cooperate with the FBI in Riyadh, and we're going to get to the bottom of the motivation and the circumstances in the deaths and woundings of these Americans.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: What is the risk--\n\n\n\nMILLER: That, he did not say.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: What is the risk of the gentility? This is a man, this President, who usually works on gut, as we know. 9/11 may have led this country into Iraq. But there were no Saudis involved than anyone else.\n\n\n\nThis President has talked about Islam hating this country. We do know that the Saudis export about as much money for terroristic activities as anyone in that region. We know what happened with Khashoggi. And in every one of these situations, this President has held off.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think the risk is there?\n\n\n\nMILLER: Well the risk is if - you basically reinforce bad behavior. You create the logic in the mind of an already impulsive and reckless Crown Prince that in fact Mr. Trump and the Administration will have their back, and empirically, that's exactly what the Saudis have concluded. That's the risk.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Something that is important for reminding, Phil. When people look at this, they'll be like, Well the guy is Saudi. He's a Muslim. He must hate us. That's why it's got to be terror. What are you waiting for?\n\n\n\nRemind of what an act of terrorism means to people in the government investigative capacity?\n\n\n\nMUDD: It is really frustrating for people to jump to conclusions. Let me tell you why the Bureau's not.\n\n\n\nYou've got to look for an act that has a political motivation, that is, you know what's inside the person's mind, against civilians, that is non-warring peoples, not the - not a military act overseas.\n\n\n\nSo, especially when you're asking about somebody who is operating, maybe alone, we don't know if this person was operating with somebody else, you've got to understand what they were thinking when they did this.\n\n\n\nDid they want to do this for political purposes? You got to know that. We don't know that yet, Chris.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: We don't even know if he's Muslim, frankly. I'm just talking about the--\n\n\n\nMUDD: Yes.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: --kinds of assumptions. I know that there are - you know, that of course being in Saudi Arabia, there could be a presumption, but we don't know, and there's no reason to jump.\n\n\n\nMUDD: Yes.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Aaron, when - with what's going on right now, in terms of how we are dealing with that region of the world, we don't know that this has anything to do with it. But what is important in terms of how it's handled?\n\n\n\nMILLER: I mean it's - it - I mean, in large part, Chris, it's a - it's a question of - of American credibility.\n\n\n\nAnd it's - it's a willingness on the part of the Administration to understand that relationships in this part of the world have to be reciprocal that you don't simply apply honey in response to a security partner or an ally. Sometimes, it's necessary to - to apply vinegar as well.\n\n\n\nAnd if we don't inject this sort of reciprocity in our relations, we - we end up with a situation where you end up with bad allies, Chris, and worse adversaries. And that is in fact the conundrum that the United States faces in the Middle East today.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: The interesting thing is that, you know, you - you can imagine this President having said, You know, I'm sure you're sorry about this. Who was this guy?\n\n\n\nYou know, why it is he the one who did this? What do you know about him? Tell us what you know right away. Your people are not foreign to you, especially when you send them over here.\n\n\n\nAnd we didn't hear any of that from him. Maybe it's going on behind the scenes. But probably not, and that's the bigger question.\n\n\n\nPhil Mudd, thank you very much.\n\n\n\nMUDD: Thank you.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: ADM, I appreciate it.\n\n\n\nNow, if any other information were to arise, we'll get right back into it, and bring it to you, but that is not expected from what we heard from the FBI. It's a big scene. It's going to take them time. We don't even have any updates on the injured. If I get it, I'll give it to you.\n\n\n\nNow, this question of Well, does this make you rethink what we do? Phil Mudd said, No. We want people in here. We want military training. We want students. We want businessmen.\n\n\n\n[21:15:00]\n\n\n\nLet's ask a politician. Senator Richard Blumenthal has long called for a tougher stance against the Kingdom, not because of this shooting, but for many other reasons.\n\n\n\nThe Foreign Affairs Committee Member on that, and what Rudy Giuliani means to the overall case for impeachment with the newest information, next.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTEXT: CUOMO PRIME TIME.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTEXT: LET'S GET AFTER IT.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCUOMO: I'm sad to report, we've had a pair of shooting sprees on domestic military bases this week, five people lost their lives, murdered, a lot of questions, not a lot of answers at this point.\n\n\n\nThe situation in Pearl Harbor is very different than what we're dealing with in Pensacola, Florida, with this Saudi Arabian man, a military officer, who's been training there.\n\n\n\nWe just took the FBI presser. They're not ready to give us information about motive or whether this has any connection to terror. They said they couldn't event confirm his name.\n\n\n\n[21:20:00]\n\n\n\nConnecticut Senator, Richard Blumenthal, sits on the Armed Services and Veterans Affairs Committee.\n\n\n\nIt's good to have you, Sir, as always.\n\n\n\nSEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): Thank you, Chris.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: I'd like talk to you about how this is being handled because we don't know enough to proceed about what was done and what the response should be.\n\n\n\nBut the president could have put pressure on the Saudi King to give information about this guy. I mean this president has said all of Islam is out to get us. We don't know that the man is Muslim. But it is the predominant religion there.\n\n\n\nBut he goes easy here. He helped them separate themselves from this individual, in this event, as he's done in the past with Khashoggi.\n\n\n\nWhy do you think that happens, this apparent deference, and what does it mean to you?\n\n\n\nBLUMENTHAL: Well, first of all, as you have observed very correctly, the President has given the Saudis a very wide berth. And the exact reasons for it are somewhat a mystery. He has financial interests that may be coming into play.\n\n\n\nOne of the reasons that I, and 200 Members of Congress, have sued the President in Blumenthal versus Trump, and there'll be a hearing this Monday, is that financial interests, taking benefits and payments from foreign governments have been very much a part of this Administration.\n\n\n\nAnd the Saudis have spent a lot of money in his hotels, on his properties in New York. It may be an interest that comes into play.\n\n\n\nBut I've advocated re-evaluating the entire Saudi relationship because of the killing of Khashoggi, their disastrous military campaign in Yemen, using our arms, arguably, to kill civilians, their subjugation of civil rights, and particularly the rights of women, and they're exporting, in many instances, terrorism.\n\n\n\nYou mentioned very correctly, and this point is very profoundly important, their role in the 9/11 case. And I have advocated on behalf of the 9/11 families who still are seeking justice in our courts against the Saudis.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Now, look, we don't know that this shooting has anything to do with any political motive whatsoever. But it would be nice to have the Saudis trying to give everything they know about this individual to us as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\nWe don't know that it's not happening. We just don't know that the President asked for it, at least in his public comments.\n\n\n\nAll right, now on to the world of the known, Rudy Giuliani, I do not believe is the bad guy in this story. I believe he's an agent. I don't know if he's a lawyer, working for the President, but he's an agent.\n\n\n\nHe's now over in Ukraine, making it very public that he is there, looking for dirt about corruption with the Obama Administration, the former Ambassador, the Bidens, it's all going on, and even a tweet that said, If Ukraine doesn't start helping in these events, they're not going to have U.S. help with their own anti-corruption reforms.\n\n\n\nSignificance?\n\n\n\nBLUMENTHAL: Giuliani is apparently continuing to pursue this crackpot conspiracy theory that the Ukrainians, not the Russians, interfered in our 2016 elections.\n\n\n\nAnd not only has that theory been completely debunked, it is, in effect, part of Putin's propaganda. It's a talking point for Vladimir Putin that it was the Ukrainians, not the Russians.\n\n\n\nEven though our entire Intelligence Community says the Russians interfered, the Senate Intelligence Committee, headed by a Republican, says that the Russians interfered. Mueller obviously found a sweeping and systematic interference by the Russians, but Giuliani, in Ukraine right now, is seeking more evidence to support this conspiracy theory.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: And he said in a tweet that the basic construct is exactly what this President's being prosecuted for, politically, right now, which is If Ukraine doesn't step up and help me with what I'm doing, they are not going to get their - the help they want with anti-corruption reform.\n\n\n\nOne, he's speaking for the United States. And two, everybody on the Republican side of the Intelligence Committee said there is no proof that there was any kind of holding them up unless they helped with Biden.\n\n\n\nHe just suggested the same. Did he not?\n\n\n\nBLUMENTHAL: He did. And he is continuing to operate this apparent shadow foreign policy that the three amigos and he pursued, now established in the very powerful evidence that's come before the Intelligence Committee.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: They say it's all hearsay. It's all hearsay and speculation.\n\n\n\nNow, they don't have an answer for why all these people were never corrected in their misbelief about what was going on. It was obviously very apparent, and contagious, and being discussed.\n\n\n\nWhy didn't ever - anybody ever say You're all wrong, except for this mystery September 9th phone call that we don't know ever really happened, where the President used the same language that the whistleblower did, except the whistleblower wasn't public yet.\n\n\n\nThe White House knew about it, used quid pro quo, he used it as well. What does that mean for you in terms of the compelling nature of the case?\n\n\n\nBLUMENTHAL: The compelling nature of the case comes from the President's own words.\n\n\n\nThat July 25th phone call is the smoking gun here, where the President of the United States is asked by the Ukrainian President in one portion, We need those anti-tank missiles.\n\n\n\n[21:25:00]\n\n\n\nThe next sentence, virtually out of the President's mouth, is I need you to do us a favor though.\n\n\n\nWhat's established here is soliciting a bribe. And remember, soliciting a bribe is itself bribery.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: It doesn't have to be effected.\n\n\n\nBLUMENTHAL: It doesn't have to be effected, and it can be an act that would have been done. Anyway, it is soliciting bribery amounts to asking for a favor or a personal benefit in return for performing an official act.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: So, what do you do when the Senate, if there's a trial, and it seems like there will be, and it's obviously controlled by the Republicans, and they have Rudy Giuliani, and others, come in, and just dump tons of information about how Ukraine was the source of interference, and the Bidens and Burisma were thick with corruption, that's what that trial could be about, if they want to. They control the rules. It's just a simple majority vote.\n\n\n\nBLUMENTHAL: Their effort obviously is going to be to distract and distort. That's the meaning of Giuliani's trip abroad insofar as it tries to aid the President's defense. But it's more than distracting.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: He says he'll testify, you know, this new friend of his over there says he wants to come in and talk about it.\n\n\n\nBLUMENTHAL: The question will be whether or not the Republicans in the Senate want that kind of circus and show--\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Why wouldn't they?\n\n\n\nBLUMENTHAL: Which may undermine their position, may demean the solemn and serious effort that's underway, and here's the other point, Chris.\n\n\n\nThis theory, a conspiracy theory that has no basis in fact of law that the Ukrainians somehow interfered in our election is more than a distraction. It is actually dangerous to our national security.\n\n\n\nIt is Putin's talking point, his propaganda and disinformation. And it makes us complacent about the continuing Russian attack on our elections. Nothing could be more serious.\n\n\n\nAnd I hope my Republican colleagues will not only face their constitutional duty, to abide by the facts, and the law, but also avoid this kind of circus and show that I think will backfire on them.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: It was pleasantly surprising to hear Lindsey Graham say exactly that. It was Russia.\n\n\n\nI have to tell you, in the House side, I have to do some real dentistry to get Republicans to say Yes, the Russians did it in 2016. And you're going to be up against that when it comes to the Senate.\n\n\n\nSenator, thank you so much on a Friday night.\n\n\n\nBLUMENTHAL: Thank you.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: For being with us, and an important night as well.\n\n\n\nBLUMENTHAL: My pleasure. Thank you.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: I'll see you soon.\n\n\n\nBLUMENTHAL: Great.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: All right, so there is someone who knows a lot more about the Ukraine showdown than even maybe some Congressional investigators. Has Vladimir Putin been closely listening in on President Trump's calls?\n\n\n\nIt's a big concern. Why? Andrew McCabe explains next.\n\n\n\n[21:30:00]\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTEXT: CUOMO PRIME TIME.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTEXT: LET'S GET AFTER IT.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCUOMO: All right, if you're following Rudy's rovings, he tells CNN he is no longer in Ukraine, but he was there, and we know what he was doing, drawing a lot of attention, and really casting a pretty big shadow over this impeachment situation.\n\n\n\nAnd now let's talk about what it could mean. Let's bring in Andrew McCabe.\n\n\n\nSo, there are two big things to look at in terms of significance. Help me understand why I should care about this first one, which I only kind of care about. So, don't be nice about it.\n\n\n\nThe idea that they were communicating over cell phones, and not secure lines, Russia could be listening, why does that matter a lot?\n\n\n\nANDREW MCCABE, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: OK. So, here's why it matters. The job of every Foreign Intelligence Service is to collect what - what professionals refer to as information about the policies, plans, and intents, of your adversary.\n\n\n\nSo, their job is to go out and collect information about what our leadership is thinking, what they're planning to do, and how they're going to execute those actions. There is no bigger target in the world for policies, plans, and intense information than the President of the United States. He is the Crown Jewel of all targets.\n\n\n\nSo, let's put aside for a moment the question of whether or not the President is actually using a cell phone from the Oval Office, and think about the President speaking to someone else, in a country like Ukraine, who's using a cell phone.\n\n\n\nRight now, we know that Rudy Giuliani is - is supposedly doing that. We have reason to believe from the phone records that he has talked to the President from there before. And we know that Gordon Sondland did that as well.\n\n\n\nUkraine is probably the most thoroughly-penetrated country on earth by the Russian Intelligence Service. They operate almost com - with complete freedom there. Rudy Giuliani is known as a close adviser, and confidant, and counselor of the President.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: How easily can they tap your phone?\n\n\n\nMCCABE: Easily, Chris, very easily. In that part of the world, Intelligence Services have almost unfettered access to cellular service providers, to internet service providers, things of that - that nature.\n\n\n\nAlso, the technology to intercept individual cell phones, that are in use is widely available now, things that were like totally, you know, cutting-edge a few years ago are widely used across Intelligence Services around the globe.\n\n\n\nSo, the idea that Rudy is being covered by a Foreign Intelligence Service, I'd bet the farm on it. And if they are listening to his phone, they now know the private conversations of the President of the United States, and his attorney.\n\n\n\n[21:35:00]\n\n\n\nCUOMO: And my point of emphasis is that all they have to do is watch the news, or read Twitter, and they'll know more than they need to know about what the plans and the intent is right now because Rudy Giuliani said something that I can't believe the President's team wants him to say.\n\n\n\nHe said in a tweet, Hey Ukraine, you're not going to get U.S. help in your anti-corruption reform efforts if you don't help me with what I'm doing with the Bidens.\n\n\n\nHow is that helpful to the President's impeachment case?\n\n\n\nMCCABE: Boy, it's not helpful at all. I mean it really resonates with all of the concerns that are being voiced by the Democratic side, right, so.\n\n\n\nAnd it also undercuts, in a significant way, the President's, one of his primary defenses, which is that he was - he was pressuring Ukraine, not for his own benefit, but rather to address legitimate corruption issues.\n\n\n\nHaving his own personal attorney off the grid doing God-knows-what in Ukraine, talking to people like Andriy Derkach who has a - an extensive historical connection with Russian-backed politicians and Intelligence officials in Ukraine, I mean it's just a perfect storm of - of bad circumstances.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Well you're certainly not going to have a hard time finding Russians in Ukraine, who want to put stink on Ukraine for what happened in 2016. We know that out of Putin's own mouth.\n\n\n\nNow, here's the part I don't get Andrew. This is why we need your mind on this.\n\n\n\nI don't understand how any of this helps the case. Forget about the subtle threat to Ukraine, to step up, otherwise they're not going to get the U.S. help, which is exactly what the President's accused of doing.\n\n\n\nBut even if Rudy's right about everything, Obama was dirty, you can't - you know - you know, the former Ambassador was dirty, the Bidens with Burisma was done a little dirty, even if he's right about all of it, how does it change the case against the President, because it's still how you went about getting that type of investigation done.\n\n\n\nYou should have done it yourself, or in the Senate, with the DOJ. You're not supposed to go to Ukraine, and hold up aid to get it, even if it's true. Isn't that right?\n\n\n\nMCCABE: That is right. That's absolutely right. So - so, why he's doing this? I mean only Rudy knows. But two things I would suggest.\n\n\n\nOne, there is clear political value to the President to just create a distraction, to go, to put up as many false narratives and conspiracy theories to get people thinking about those potential bad things rather than the bad things that the President is alleged to have done.\n\n\n\nAnd the second thing is I do think that there's an element here of Rudy kind of saving himself in a way.\n\n\n\nHe seems to be going like further and further down this rabbit hole, in an effort maybe to find the one, you know, verifiable piece of proof that will show the world that Ah-ha, he was right all along.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: And he may be right. He can be right. And it doesn't change the analysis. That's why I always say, you know, people think it's personal, even though, you know, Rudy basically tried to decapitate me on television.\n\n\n\nBut that I say he's not the problem here. Rudy is the agent. That's all he is. If he's right about all of it, Burisma, the Bidens, Ukraine, fine. Present the evidence. Let's see what we do about it. It doesn't change the analysis. It's not about Rudy.\n\n\n\nMCCABE: Yes.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: It's about how the President went about getting what he wanted, and why. Andrew, I'm out of time. Thank you so much. Have a great weekend. And I appreciate it. You're always a plus for the audience.\n\n\n\nMCCABE: Thanks, Chris.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: All right, something very important has come up. The President's bringing it to our attention, and I pass it along to you right now.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTRUMP: We have a situation where we're looking very strongly at sinks and showers and other elements of bathrooms where you turn the faucet on.\n\n\n\nPeople are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCUOMO: And the Democrats don't have somebody that for sure can beat this guy?\n\n\n\nI want to bring in the Wizard of Odds. That's what they're up against, Wiz. And Democrats are scrambling to find an answer, next.\n\n\n\n[21:40:00]\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTEXT: CUOMO PRIME TIME.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTEXT: LET'S GET AFTER IT.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCUOMO: First, the Democrats seemed to believe that anyone they had could beat this President. Now, it seems they're scrambling to find anyone who can beat this President. But today, we got a good look at what they are up against.\n\n\n\nThis was the President trying to attack the EPA for over-regulating. But he did it like this.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTRUMP: We have a situation where we're looking very strongly at sinks and showers and other elements of bathrooms where you turn the faucet on in areas where there's tremendous amounts of water, where the water rushes out to sea because you could never handle it, and you don't get any water.\n\n\n\nYou turn on the faucet. You don't get any water. They take a shower and water comes dripping out. It's dripping out, very quietly dripping out.\n\n\n\nPeople are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once. They end up using more water. So, EPA is looking at that very strongly, at my suggestion.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCUOMO: At his suggestion! And you wonder why Bloomberg got in! And yet, this President is seen as very formidable to the Wizard of Odds himself, Harry Enten, and here is why.\n\n\n\nDespite what we just heard--\n\n\n\nHARRY ENTEN, CNN POLITICS SENIOR WRITER AND ANALYST: Yes.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: --and the hypocrisy of the fact that his Administration has been hurting water standards, hurting the money for keeping things protected, he's basically attacking over-regulation, big government.\n\n\n\nENTEN: Sure.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: He's still tough to beat not because of how he is, but because of what's gone on, despite him, mostly in the economy. What do we know?\n\n\n\nENTEN: Yes. So, I think this is rather important. First, let me just say, what a Shabbos (ph) conversation, toilets and so on, so forth.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: I know. But let's--\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nENTEN: But OK - ha, ha, ha, hilarious!\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Thank you.\n\n\n\nENTEN: Look, this is basically the yearly job growth weighted each - weighted over each terms last two years. And what we see here is that the winners tend to have very good job growth, right? All of them had at least 1.1 percent or above.\n\n\n\nThe blow-outs, Nixon, 3.6 percent, 4.1 percent for Reagan.\n\n\n\nThe losers on the other hand tended to have pretty poor job growth. Carter and Bush, of course, basically got blown out, and they were below 1 percent.\n\n\n\nSo, what we see here is very clearly what has often been described as It's the economy, stupid! And we see that to be the case. CUOMO: We just got more good job numbers and some income pressure going up that helps the President as well.\n\n\n\nENTEN: Yes, so look, let's put this into some context where the President is versus where the winners versus the losers were.\n\n\n\n[21:45:00]\n\n\n\nSo, the average yearly job growth, again, in those final two years, the Presidents who won re-election, 2.5 percent growth, the Presidents who lost, they averaged 1 percent growth.\n\n\n\nWhere is Trump? Trump over the last year is right in the middle there at 1.5 percent. And I think this is rather important.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: But he sells it as being the best ever.\n\n\n\nENTEN: Well he sells a lot of things at being the best ever, you know. So, that's not too much of a surprise. Sometimes he sells toilet pressures being the best ever.\n\n\n\nBut I think this is rather important is that growth is what's important. It's not the absolute levels. It's basically where you've grown, and basically with the economy at this point, we're kind of running into a wall, since we're near max employment.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: So, you think that the Democrats can use the economy against this President?\n\n\n\nENTEN: I - I - I think that the economy is not the Silver Bullet that he necessarily thinks it is, although it's certainly rather helpful because, you know, if you take a look here, what we see is Trump standing on the economy, his approval rating 55 percent in our latest poll, but that is below his overall approval rating of 42 percent.\n\n\n\nSo clearly, voters are judging him stronger on the economy than overall, which is perhaps why he should be talking more about the economy than about other things.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: But - and this also goes to the point I made on the last panel, which is he sells it as the best ever. It's obviously working.\n\n\n\nENTEN: It--\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Because the number of growth, that growth percentage you're showing, middle-of-the-road, would not justify 55 percent.\n\n\n\nENTEN: Yes. It's certainly working to the extent that if, you know, basically you were to say, OK, if you approve of Trump's job, why is it? Here are the top five reasons. This is rather interesting.\n\n\n\nSo, among those who say they approve of Trump's job, 26 percent say the economy, look at this, jobs and unemployment, 8 percent, getting things done, doing a good job, generally speaking, again, related to the economy, 10 and 9 percent.\n\n\n\nSo, people who approve of the job that the President is doing, they do so because of the economy.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: So, if you are looking to figure out what the best avenue is for change, what is it? Is it to go with the man directly?\n\n\n\nENTEN: Yes, I - I - I think that that's exactly right.\n\n\n\nIf you were to say why should we change this President, look at these, these are Trump's qualities, essentially Presidential qualities, has stamina and sharpness to be a President, could bring the type of change the country needs, so on, so forth, you can read that, you see it up on the screen.\n\n\n\nLook at this. This is so important because on this, yes, what do we see? Majorities all say in fact No, he does not have these qualities.\n\n\n\nMajorities are saying the President doesn't have these Presidential qualities. And that is why, in spite of what they approve of as a strong economy, he is behind, at least in a number of the horserace polls that we've seen so far.\n\n\n\nSo, go after the man, say he's un-Presidential. And that's why I think you saw a lot of good response to Biden's ad this week.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Do you think you could have - you could name another person who could ever win a Presidential election talking about people needing to flush 10 to 15 times?\n\n\n\nENTEN: No. But, you know, perhaps that might be a Student Council election. I should have used that.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: One-of-a-kind, one-of-a-kind.\n\n\n\nENTEN: One-of-a-kind, just like you.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Wiz, thank you so much.\n\n\n\nENTEN: Good Sabbaths. Shalom everyone.\n\n\n\nCUOMO: Probably shouldn't call him The Wiz given the context of that conversation. But I did. It's too late.\n\n\n\nNikki Haley, hopefully, for her, it's not too late, but she's taking heat, and justifiably so. Did you hear what she said about the Confederate flag?

(CNN) — A volcanic island in the middle of South Korea's East Sea, remote Ulleungdo island has long been a popular destination among nature-loving South Koreans. But foreigners are just now catching on.\n\nTo travel there, you'll first have to navigate a 2.5-hour train ride to Pohang or Gangneung port, followed by a 3.5-hour, stomach-churning ferry ride. At the end of the arduous journey? One of the most beautiful islands on Earth.\n\nUlleungdo is peaceful and pristine -- a natural refuge that's home to towering volcanic peaks, fascinating rock formations, cedar wood forests, juniper trees, a few tiny fishing villages and a reputation as South Korea's most spiritual destination.\n\nFor first-time visitors, here's how to make the most of it:\n\nSouth Korea's 'Mystery' island\n\nUlleungdo is nicknamed Mystery Island and is known to be a sacred island for the South Koreans. courtesy Kate Springer\n\nNicknamed Mystery Island for its mystical energy, Ulleungdo is believed to have been formed following volcanic eruptions over 2.5 million years ago.\n\nUlleungdo is known to be a sacred island where rich energy of the land and clear energy of the sky meet, and where yin and yang marry, explains Jang Yunhee, a local guide from Toursungingbong.\n\nFor most of its history, the island has been difficult to access and uninhabited by people, so primitive nature and ecology are well preserved. This has added to the island's spiritual reputation.\n\nBetween 1400 and 1882, Korea's Chosun Dynasty adopted an empty-island policy and ordered islanders to evacuate Ulleungdo for fear of Japanese invasion.\n\nIt wasn't until the 1880s, when the Japanese claimed Ulleungdo as its own, that the Korean government set in motion a resettlement plan to repopulate the island.\n\nArriving in 1883, the first wave of settlers included roughly 54 people. Today, there's just over 10,000 inhabitants.\n\nThroughout the spring and summer, fishing and tourism trades thrive. But come winter, the island more or less grinds to a stop.\n\nUlleungdo is the snowiest place in South Korea -- on this volcanic island, foot-high snow falls are totally normal.\n\nEven though it's difficult to make the ferry journey, due to rough seas, some travelers prefer to visit the island to ski or simply admire the dramatic, snowy mountain scenery.\n\nExplore by land\n\nA pedestrian suspension bridge leads to the outlying island of Gwaneumdo. courtesy Kate Springer\n\nFamed for its diverse ecology, Ulleungdo surrounds visitors with natural beauty.\n\nOne of the best ways to get your bearings is with an easy coastal walk, such as the Gwaneum Island hiking trail.\n\nThe one-hour trek takes travelers over a bright blue pedestrian suspension bridge to an outlying island called Gwaneumdo.\n\nThe short yet steep hike takes you through ancient forests and silvery grasslands, as you make your way toward viewing platforms framing the sea.\n\nGwaneumdo offers one of most beautiful walks in Ulleungdo. It is covered with reed forest, says Jang. There are three popular observatories around the hike, including views of Bamboo Island and Three Fairy Rocks.\n\nFor more experienced hikers, a trek up to Seonginbong -- the island's highest peak at 3,228 feet -- promises a huge payoff on a clear day.\n\nOf the many ways to reach Seonginbong, Jang recommends a walk along the Nari Basin Forest Trail, part of the Nari Basin Geopark.\n\nLocated in the center of the island, the basin was created after a volcano eruption millions of years ago. Today, it's best known for its extensive collection of indigenous flora, Mountain Spirit Mineral Spring, and rare mountain vegetables.\n\nSurrounded by layers of mountains, the Nari Basin is the only flatland in Ulleungdo where many wild mountain vegetables grow, says Jang.\n\nWithin the geopark, you can also admire the cloud fall, layers of clouds which look like waterfalls, and fantastic views in the autumn as the leaves change color.\n\nThen there's Bongnaepokpo Falls, where three tiers of water tumble from a height of 25 meters. The vast majority of hotels and restaurants around the area source their drinking water from this pristine waterfall.\n\nIn the surrounding redwood forest, hikers can cool off in front of a natural air conditioner formed by holes in the boulders.\n\nStand in front of the cave-like crevice and you'll feel a steady blast of cool subterranean air, which maintains a consistent temperature of 4 degrees Celsius all year.\n\nFor the best views on Ulleungdo, Jang suggests a trip to the Seokpo Observatory -- the only spot on the island where you can enjoy both sunset and sunrise.\n\nRelated content 14 of Seoul's quirkiest bars\n\nOn the water\n\nUlleungdo is a popular destination for scuba diving, kayaking, fishing and swimming. courtesy Kate Springer\n\nThe island is home to clear water that's teeming with marine life, so it's no surprise that Ulleungdo has become a hot spot for scuba diving, kayaking, fishing, and swimming.\n\nBefore diving in, we'd recommend taking a scenic boat or fishing tour around the island. From May till November, there are several three-hour tours that depart from Dodong, the main ferry port.\n\nThe itineraries typically zig through dramatic rock formations, stop by an old pirate's cave, and afford excellent views of the landscape along the way.\n\nA few tours also provide opportunities to catch fresh red sea bream, butter fish, mackerel and rockfish with experienced local fishermen.\n\nWith its clear waters and abundant marine life, the island has become the go-to destination in South Korea for serious divers.\n\nUlleungdo attracts divers because of far visibility, large fish and dynamic topography, says Jang. Throughout the year, a 20- to 30-meter range of visibility is guaranteed, and you can often see as far as 50 meters.\n\nJang suggests visiting between August and October to experience the best of underwater scenery. Thanks to the Kuroshio current, you can see tropical fish swimming north with the current.\n\nKayaking is another way for adventurous travelers to freely explore the waters of Ulleungdo.\n\nParticularly in the waters around Gwaneumdo, on the northeastern coast, kayakers will be surrounded by dramatic cliffs, stoney beaches, and fascinating rock formations such as Elephant Rock.\n\nRelated content Seoul: The city where spas never close\n\nWhat to eat\n\nIf budget is no obstacle, we'd recommend eating as much seafood -- especially shrimps -- as possible. courtesy Kate Springer\n\nAs you wander through the tiny fishing villages on the southeast coast, you'll likely notice squid drying in the sun and tanks full of squirming shrimp in the shade.\n\nThis is a land of superlative seafood, so we'd recommend eating as much as possible during your visit.\n\nStart your culinary journey on a high note with a meal at Chungeumho, in the tiny fishing town of Jeodong. At this mom 'n' pop restaurant, you'll find wooden sharing tables wrapped in plastic and cushioned seats pad the floor.\n\nThe restaurant is run by a fishing company with professional equipment that enables them to bring fresh shrimp from the deep sea [about 50 to 300 meters deep] to the restaurant, says Jang.\n\nCalled Dokdo shrimp, these famous shrimp taste sweeter and have great, silky texture.\n\nThey're so fresh, in fact, that these pretty pink crustaceans are presented live tableside before a quick bath in the steamer or fryer.\n\nIf budget is no obstacle, visitors can try all three kinds of Dokdo shrimp: Chicken Shrimp, Flower Shrimp and Peach Flower shrimp, which is the rarest.\n\nNamed after an island that's part of a territorial dispute between South Korea and Japan, Dokdo shrimp recently shot into the spotlight when they were served for President Trump at South Korea's state banquet in November 2017.\n\nThe island is also famed for its wild mountain vegetables. The selection of more 700 varieties is known to lure chefs from all over South Korea.\n\nUlleungdo gets more snow than any other part of Korea, but these mountain vegetables still thrive here, says Jang. As a result, they absorb rich minerals from the wind, sea, and volcanic soil.\n\nOur wild vegetables have a rich flavor and they're abundantly nutritious.\n\nFor those curious about these fibrous herbs and vegetables, Jang suggests lunch at Yayeongjang Sikdang. The open-air cafe sits at the entrance of the Nari Basin Forest Trail, so visitors can sit down for a leisurely san-namul (mountain herb) lunch after a hike.\n\nThere's no menu. Instead, simply choose how many vegetable banchan (side dishes) you'd like to try -- some have been dried, fermented, others marinated in chili sauce or vinegar.\n\nThere's a set menu that includes namul (mountain vegetables), bibimbap, potato pancakes. The vegetables are typically served in tiny white bowls, alongside warm rice, deodeok-root pancakes, seaweed soup and pumpkin rice wine.\n\nThe most popular is allium microdictyon (myungee na-mul in Korean), which is also called Siberian onion, says Jang. But it's difficult to get, because it is rare and very expensive. You normally pickle it, then serve it with grilled beef or raw fish.\n\nAnother must-try food on the island is local tiger beef. Sporting a distinct black and orange hide, these rare 'medicine cows' spend their lives grazing on mountain herbs.\n\nSince the cows grow up eating wild vegetables, the beef has unique flavor, says Jang.\n\nTry it at Ulleung Yakso Sutbul Garden, where an on-site restaurant serves up sirloin and bulgogi, as well as a few other local specialties.\n\nWhere to Stay\n\nThe newly opened KOSMOS Healing Stay is designed to mimic the Yin Yang sign. courtesy Kate Springer\n\nThe island is full of tiny guest houses and a few resorts, but recently opened KOSMOS Healing Stay is by far the most visually striking.\n\nOpened in 2018, the hotel sits on a sheer cliff in the shadow of Songgot-bong mountain (dubbed ice pick peak in Korean).\n\nDesigned by Chanjoong Kim of The System Lab, a Korean architectural firm, the hotel is shaped like a spiral to mimic the Yin Yang sign. It's also the first building in the world to have been constructed by pouring ultra high-performance concrete (UHPC) into a mold on site.\n\nWith this innovative material, the stark white walls are just 12 centimeters thick and have a light, airy feel thanks to high vaulted ceilings. From there, the interiors feature natural volcanic stones, terracotta, and bespoke wooden furniture.\n\nRelated content 50 beautiful places to visit in South Korea\n\nEach room at the villa is dedicated to one of the five elements, and guests are assigned a room based on their personal astrology chart in order to enhance their 'chi', or energy flow.\n\nJang says the hotel has excellent feng shui, thanks to its position between the mountains and sea.\n\nIt is abundantly clear that this mountain holds a strong energy, says Jang.\n\nKoreans believe that a location like this, with a strong chi (energy), can rejuvenate people and help their wishes come true.

We've just been spoiled.\n\n(CNN Business) —\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are hearing some footsteps behind them today.\n\nA high-profile group of banks, brokerages and market makers revealed plans on Monday to join forces and start their own trading venue called the Members Exchange.\n\nThe launch of the new exchange, backed by power players like Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC), UBS, Citadel Securities and Fidelity Investments, underscores longstanding frustrations with the current system.\n\nIn particular, brokerages and market makers are upset with the cost that leading exchanges charge for access to the lucrative data feeds that are used to monitor stock prices.\n\nThe level of frustration was just so high for many of us that we had to do something more proactive for us and our clients, Vlad Khandros, global head of market structure and liquidity strategy at UBS (UBS), told CNN Business. There's this massive burden on us and our clients.\n\nMembers Exchange, or MEMX, aims to disrupt the exchange business, which is dominated by just a few small players. The goal is to simplify and lower fees by boosting competition and increasing transparency.\n\nOther founding members include Charles Schwab (SCHW), E*Trade (ETFC), Morgan Stanley (MS) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD).\n\nThey're saying, 'We're going to take our ball and start our own thing,' said Joe Saluzzi, co-head of trading at New Jersey brokerage firm Themis Trading and author of Broken Markets.\n\nExchange stocks retreat\n\nSteve Quirk, executive vice president of trading and education at TD Ameritrade, said that market data costs have become quite gaudy.\n\nThe new competition is likely to erode the ability of existing exchanges to keep ramping up fees on brokerage firms and market makers, especially for data feeds. These lucrative data feeds give financial players key insight on market movements. Fee structure can vary based on what types of data is being sought.\n\nBy charging hefty fees for access to that data, exchanges have found a way to juice revenue in recent years.\n\nMembers Exchange does not plan to compete with NYSE and Nasdaq on the separate business of listing stocks. NYSE and Nasdaq regularly vie for bragging rights to say they brought major private companies like Uber and Lyft public in splashy IPOs.\n\nShares of Nasdaq (NDAQ) dropped more than 2% on Monday. IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), which owns the iconic New York Stock Exchange, also retreated nearly 2%.\n\nNYSE declined to comment on the launch of Members Exchange.\n\nWe welcome competition to our transparent, highly regulated equity markets, Nasdaq spokesman Joseph Christinat, told CNN Business. However, with dozens of equity trading venues already in operation in the United States, we are keen to learn more about the value proposition of a new exchange.\n\nAlthough there may be many trading venues, the business is concentrated in the hands of a few powerful players.\n\nSixty-one percent of stock trades took place at just three exchanges in 2018: NYSE, Nasdaq and CBOE, according to research by TABB Group.\n\nNYSE led the way, with nearly one-quarter of the market. Another one-fifth went to Nasdaq. The next-closest player was IEX Group, the exchange that was founded in 2012 in a bid to capitalize on concerns about high-frequency trading sparked by the Michael Lewis novel Flash Boys.\n\nWhile IEX has been slow to gain market share, MEMX could have a leg up. It will launch with the backing of financial heavyweights that can bring their order flow with them.\n\nBrad Katsuyama, IEX CEO and co-founder, said Monday in a statement that IEX expects the industry will change dramatically in the coming years.\n\nThis is the latest affirmation that the exchange business is rife with conflicts of interest and market participants can no longer tolerate the abuses of power, he said.\n\nTABB Group said that 36% of the stock trading volume in 2018 took place off-exchange. That includes action at dark pools — exchanges that allow anonymous trades, often between large institutions. Other off-exchange trading takes place when high-speed trading firms like Virtu purchases retail order flow from brokers and execute the transactions themselves. And sometimes brokers make over-the-counter trades for institutional clients.\n\nMEMX raised $70 million in an initial round of funding and hopes to add new investors at a later date, a person familiar with the matter told CNN Business. The group plans to file paperwork early this year seeking SEC approval to become a national securities exchange.\n\nTrading fees can't go much lower\n\nStill, Saluzzi suspects that mom-and-pop investors will see little change from the entrance of Members Exchange.\n\nTrading fees are already almost zero, said Saluzzi. I don't think the regular investor will see any difference from this. It's purely profit-driven, which is fine.\n\nOne industry executive complained that some of the companies involved in the Members Exchange have been hit with lawsuits and fines for alleged equity trading violations.\n\nFor instance, last year Bank of America Merrill Lynch admitted to systematically misleading clients between 2008 and 2013 about how orders were handled for more than 4 billion shares of stock.\n\nThey're letting the fox build the henhouse, the executive said.\n\nJamil Nazarali, Citadel Securities' global head of business development, disputed that argument by noting the diversity of the MEMX's backers.\n\nThis is a very broad group of partners, including leaders from every aspect of the market, Nazarali said.

We were treated to this spectacle in the Atlantic.\n\nStory highlights Plans to impose two-year race cycle One class of boat and lower budgets Five of six teams support vision\n\n(CNN) —\n\nYou wouldn't stage the Super Bowl or the Olympics without knowing where and when the next one will take place.\n\nBut the America's Cup is very different – and has been for over 150 years.\n\nHowever, this could change very soon thanks to a new agreement that could revolutionize sailing's elite event.\n\nDating back to 1851, the battle for sport's oldest trophy has been a moveable feast, with the winner earning the right to call the shots on the venue, timing and format.\n\nIt was a playground of billionaires, where controversy, intrigue and lawsuits were as much part of the drama as cutting-edge yacht design and hard-fought racing.\n\nOn one hand, that is all part of the America's Cup's history and mystique. The alternative view is that model doesn't stack up in a modern commercial world.\n\n'Pivotal'\n\nNow though, five of the six teams competing for this year's title in Bermuda in June have united behind what they call a collective vision that sets out a two-year cycle until 2021, with one set class of boat, a reduction on budgets and a raft of other rule changes.\n\nOracle Team USA skipper Jimmy Spithill, who coined the Super Bowl analogy, said it was a defining moment, while Land Rover BAR's skipper and team principal Ben Ainslie said it was pivotal.\n\nThis agreement provides stability, said Land Rover BAR chief executive Martin Whitmarsh, who has brought a wealth of experience to the competition following almost 10 years as CEO of the McLaren F1 team.\n\nIt gives people an opportunity to plan longer term. It will establish a modern sporting, technical and design challenge within which costs are controlled to provide a much lower entry price which will encourage more teams to be involved and ultimately inspire a larger audience.\n\nREAD: 'Incredible' boats take to the waves\n\nREAD: Car tech drives Ainslie to World Series win\n\nKiwi critics\n\nThe America's Cup is governed by the Deed of Gift, the original protocol that dictates how the competition should run.\n\nOne of the mainstays is that the defender and principal challenger thrash out the details of the next series, including the venue and the type of boat to be used. In the past the Cup has run roughly every four years.\n\nThe teams behind the framework are America's Cup defender Oracle Team USA, Britain's Land Rover BAR, SoftBank Team Japan, Sweden's Artemis Racing and Groupama Team France.\n\nThe one syndicate stalling on the arrangement is Emirates Team New Zealand, which said in a tweet – since deleted – it believes the future America's Cup format should be decided by the defender and the challenger of record as it has historically been.\n\nWhitmarsh said the framework will respect and uphold all aspects of the Deed of Gift. He says the Kiwis have been kept aware of all developments and is optimistic they will eventually sign up.\n\nHowever, should the New Zealand syndicate not concur, and it wins the 35th America's Cup, the framework could be redundant.\n\nRead: America's Cup chief wants 'F1 on water'\n\nRead: Expand America's Cup to 12 teams, says CEO Coutts\n\nSlashing budgets\n\nThe agreement is an attempt to exploit the spectacle of modern America's Cup catamarans flying above the water on hydrofoils at speeds of nearly 50 knots in short 20-minute races in front of stadium crowds and a modern TV and digital audience.\n\nThe 2013 event in San Francisco wowed spectators with its new style of high-speed foiling boats and Oracle Team USA's dramatic fightback from 8-1 down to win 9-8.\n\nThe traditional concept of the Cup building to a crescendo and then going into at best, radio silence while the defender plans the next event will be a thing of the past, Whitmarsh told a news conference at the House of Garrad in London, where the America's Cup trophy was made in 1848. It was donated to the Royal Yacht Squadron for its annual regatta three years later.\n\nTo that end, the framework proposes up to 12 World Series events to begin in late 2017, with the winner going straight to the challenger playoffs – the final race series which will determine who takes on the defender in the 2019 America's Cup.\n\nIn the second year of World Series racing, teams will migrate from AC45F boats to America's Cup Class boats, a variation on the 50-foot catamarans they will race in Bermuda this year, with design tweaks to broaden the wind range they can competitively race in.\n\nTo reduce costs – and entice new entrants to the competition – teams will not be able to build, test or train on AC45F boats.\n\nThe target cost to field a competitive new team is in the $30-40 million range, a significant reduction from current team budgets, Whitmarsh added.\n\nAinslie said it would mean a 50% cut in BAR's current budget of about $90 million, although he added there was no budgetary cap.\n\nCritics suggest standardizing the boat puts potential new teams at a disadvantage because they will lack the reams of data and experience of those already competing. Poaching experts from other teams will come at a high price.\n\nAll the signatories to this new framework agreement appear to have done is try to secure their pay checks for another four years, at the expense of removing the prestige from the America's Cup, the New Zealand Herald reported.\n\n'On the cusp'\n\nThe glamor of the America's Cup will always be there, according to Ainslie.\n\nYes, the old J Class yachts were amazing, but this is a whole new audience, he told CNN.

After virtually ignoring the Bolton manuscript bombshell news through nearly eight hours of their presentation today, President Trump lawyer and Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz argued that John Bolton's accusations do not amount to an impeachable offense.\n\nIf a president, any president, were to have done what the Times reported about the content of the Bolton manuscript, that would not constitute an impeachable offense. Let me repeat: Nothing in the Bolton revelations — even if true — would rise to the level of an abuse of power or an impeachable offense, Dershowitz said.\n\nEarlier today, Jay Sekulow, the President's private counsel, alluded to bombshell allegations over the weekend from former national security adviser John Bolton directly tying Ukraine aid to an investigation of the Bidens. But he suggested it would not be discussed by the team today.\n\nWhat we've done on Saturday is the pattern that we're going to continue today as far as how we're going to deal with the case. We deal with transcript evidence, we deal with publicly available information. We do not deal with speculation, allegations that are not based on evidentiary standards at all, he said.\n\nWhat's this about: The New York Times reported Trump ordered Bolton to keep military aid to Ukraine frozen in a bid to coerce political favors. Since the news broke, some GOP senators are considering the need to have witnesses at the trial.
(CNN) -- Yemeni protesters and military and pro-government gangs clashed in several areas Tuesday, with at least six killed and hundreds more injured, as the future of President Ali Abdullah Saleh remained uncertain.\n\nThe United States has no intention of stopping its military aid to Yemen, despite the unrest, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said Tuesday. The aid, in support of Yemeni counterterrorism efforts, continues to be essential because of the real threat from al Qaeda in the country, he said.\n\nIn Sanaa, the capital, eyewitnesses and field medical teams told CNN that security forces and anti-riot police used batons to attack protesters among 40,000 people marching on Zubairy Street Tuesday evening. In addition, pro-government gangs attacked protesters on Tuesday near a military base.\n\nFour people were killed -- three pro-government demonstrators and one anti-government demonstrator. Windows were shattered on an ambulance carrying some of the 56 injured protesters to a hospital, witnesses said.\n\nThe government forces are killing us, said Abdullah Salem, a youth activist who was at the protest. Saleh and his militia will not succeed, and every blood spilt will be accounted for in international courts.\n\nIn the city of Taiz, meanwhile, at least two anti-government protesters were killed when security forces and Republican Guards fired on protesters, according to medical teams. Hundreds of people were injured, 55 of them from gunshot wounds.\n\nThe security chief in Taiz denied his forces fired on demonstrators.\n\nSecurity forces did not attack protesters, said Abdullah Qiaran. We were dispersing pro and anti-government protesters after we saw that both sides were clashing.\n\nAn estimated 30,000 demonstrators marched near the presidential palace in the port city of Hodeida Tuesday evening, witnesses said.\n\nThe violence comes as the United States is helping to mediate a transition out of office for Saleh, who has been facing popular protests for weeks, according to two Yemeni officials.\n\nThe timing is delicate, officials said, because they want to avoid any steps that could further destabilize Yemen or interrupt counterterrorism efforts in a country that U.S. officials believe is home to some of the world's most active al Qaeda operatives.\n\nThe White House said in a statement Tuesday it strongly condemns the use of violence by Yemeni government forces against demonstrators in Sanaa, Taiz and Hodeida in the past several days. The Yemeni people have a right to demonstrate peacefully, and we remind President Ali Abdullah Saleh of his responsibility to ensure the safety and security of Yemenis who are exercising their universal right to engage in political expression.\n\nThe statement called upon Yemen's government to investigate and hold those responsible accountable.\n\nThe United States strongly supports the Yemeni people in their quest for greater opportunity and their pursuit of political and economic reform that will fulfill their aspirations, the statement said. President Saleh needs to resolve the political impasse with the opposition so that meaningful political change can take place in the near term in an orderly and peaceful manner.\n\nOn Sunday, the state-run Saba news agency reported clashes there caused the deaths of 10 people and injured a number of other demonstrators. According to Saba, witnesses said the opposition had deployed armed militias in the city.\n\nTaiz Gov. Hamoud al-Soufi said protesters had attacked the governor's building and the presidential palace in Taiz, and that he was forming a committee to investigate the incident.\n\nWe express our deep regret for the deviation of peaceful protests, he said.\n\nThe U.N. human rights office on Tuesday called on Yemen to halt the use of force against protesters, citing more than 100 deaths since the protests began.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague also said he was appalled by the reports of further deaths this week.\n\nIn early March, President Saleh promised to maintain maximum restraint in the use of the Yemeni security forces in controlling peaceful demonstrations. We strongly urge him to keep that promise, he said.\n\nEarlier, an Obama administration official told CNN that the United States has been working behind the scenes, trying to determine the best way forward.\n\nWhatever timeline they develop, we can accept -- but it needs to be worked out. That's the problem that's making people anxious, he said. There has to be a path forward, it can't be a situation where he thinks that, week to week, he can sort of continue to hold on without making some kind of accommodation.\n\nSaleh offered to step down by the end of the year after constitutional reforms and new elections, but the opposition, led by the Joint Meeting Parties bloc, is demanding he leave immediately. A plan unveiled by the bloc Saturday called for Saleh to hand over all authority to Vice President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi in the interim. But Saleh is not offering any further concessions, and protests by the opposition continue.\n\nU.S. officials said various groups, including al Qaeda and secessionist elements, are exploiting the political turbulence and splits within the military and security services for their own gain.\n\nThe rapidly deteriorating situation presents a major problem for the Obama administration.\n\nSaleh has been in power since 1978 and has been a staunch U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Saleh argues he should remain in office because he is the only one who can effectively continue that fight against terrorism.\n\nOne U.S. official said Yemen presents a serious challenge for the administration, as the government is preoccupied with political unrest, and little is being done on the counterterrorism front.\n\nA counterterrorism official said there is concern over Yemen's pursuit of terrorists. The ability of what's left of the government to manage internal security which includes (al Qaeda) is in question, said the official. A weakened security system in the country provides an opportunity to be exploited by al Qaeda, the official said.\n\nCNN's Mohammed Jamjoom, Jill Dougherty, Pam Benson and Elise Labott contributed to this report
A palm tree not only brings you memories of vacationing on a tropical beach, it also helps regulate humidity levels.\n\nIf you're still decorating your bedroom, it's not too late to buy sansevieria trifasciata, or snake plant. It removes benzene and formaldehyde in the air and produces the greatest amount of oxygen at night.\n\nIf your house smells, invest in a ficus elastica. The plant absorbs odors and reduces the number of microorganisms and the amount of toxic substances.\n\nAnother plant for cigarette smokers or those who are sensitive to smoke: hedera helix, or English ivy. It is also recommended for those who have asthma.\n\nIf you work in an office in front of a computer or near printers, spathiphyllum wallisii or peace lily can help keep you healthy. They absorb electromagnetic radiation emitted by computers and printers and keep the air moisturized.\n\nIf the air in your home is too dry, you may want to get some ferns. These plants are good at increasing air humidity.\n\nConsider decorating with dracaena plants, which can absorb more than 90% of acetone. It's found in common products such as nail polish remover or household cleaners. Living near a busy road or a facility that manufactures paints, plastics, chemicals, artificial fibers and shoes would also increase your risk of breathing in the toxic gas.\n\nThe Caribbean tree cactus can absorb 80% of ethylbenzene in the air. The toxic chemical can be found in items such as construction materials, electronic products, food packaging, furniture, garden care products and even toys.\n\nThese bromeliads can liven up your house with a hint of red, but they are also great air purifiers when it comes to benzene. The plant can absorb more than 90% of the chemical, which you can find in glue, paint, furniture wax and detergent. You may also breathe it in if you live near gas stations, hazardous waste sites or industrial facilities.\n\nChlorophytum comosum, a kind of spider plant, can take up more than 90% of o-Xylene, found in fuels, and p-Xylene, found in plastic and rubber products. Smokers may also want to keep this plant around: Over a few days, it can absorb 90% of formaldehyde and carbon monoxide, ingredients of cigarette smoke.\n\nAccording to a study by chemistry professor Vadoud Niri and his team at State University of New York at Oswego, houseplants are a good way to absorb volatile chemical compounds in the air. These compounds, commonly found in paints, furniture, printers, cleaning supplies and even dry-cleaned clothes, can have adverse health effects. Some plants are more effective in absorbing certain chemicals than others; crassula argentea (jade plant) is very good at absorbing toluene, emitted by cars, gasoline, kerosene, heating oil, paints and lacquers.\n\nStory highlights You might think air pollution is limited to vehicle emissions For some air pollutants, transportation is only half as important as the chemicals in everyday products\n\n(CNN) —\n\nPicture the causes of air pollution in a major city and you are likely to visualise pollutants spewing out of cars, trucks and buses.\n\nFor some types of air pollutants, however, transportation is only half as important as the chemicals in everyday consumer products like cleaning agents, printer ink, and fragrances, according to a study published Friday in Science.\n\nAir pollution: a chemical soup\n\nAir pollution is a serious health concern, responsible for millions of premature deaths each year, with even more anticipated due to climate change.\n\nAlthough we typically picture pollution as coming directly from cars or power plants, a large fraction of air pollution actually comes from chemical reactions that happen in the atmosphere. One necessary starting point for that chemistry is a group of hundreds of molecules collectively known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs).\n\nA way to reduce pollution in US cities – and traffic, too\n\nVOCs in the atmosphere can come from many different sources, both man-made and natural. In urban areas, VOCs have historically been blamed largely on vehicle fuels (both gasoline and diesel) and natural gas.\n\nFuel emissions are dropping\n\nThanks in part to more stringent environmental regulations and in part to technological advances, VOCs released into the air by vehicles have dropped dramatically.\n\nIn this new study, the researchers used detailed energy and chemical production records to figure out what fraction of the VOCs from oil and natural gas are released by vehicle fuels versus other sources. They found that the decline in vehicle emissions means that – in a relative sense – nearly twice as much comes from chemical products as comes from vehicle fuel, at least in the US. Those chemicals include cleaning products, paints, fragrances and printer ink – all things found in modern homes.\n\nThe VOCs from these products get into the air because they evaporate easily. In fact, in many cases, this is exactly what they are designed to do. Without evaporating VOCs, we wouldn't be able to smell the scents wafting by from perfumes, scented candles, or air fresheners.\n\nWhy climate change is worsening public health problems\n\nOverall, this is a good news story: VOCs from fuel use have decreased, so the air is cleaner. Since the contribution from fuels has dropped, it is not surprising that chemical products, which have not been as tightly regulated, are now responsible for a larger share of the VOCs.\n\nPredicting air quality\n\nAn important finding from this work is that these chemical products have largely been ignored when constructing the models that we use to predict air pollution – which impacts how we respond to and regulate pollutants.\n\nThe researchers found that ignoring the VOCs from chemical products had significant impacts on predictions of air quality. In outdoor environments, they found that these products could be responsible for as much as 60% of the particles that formed chemically in the air above Los Angeles.\n\nStrawberries: Healthy but horrible for the environment\n\nThe effects were even larger indoors – a major concern as we spend most of our time indoors. Without accounting for chemical products, a model of indoor air pollutants under-predicted measurements by a whopping 87%. Including the consumer products really helped to fix this problem.\n\nWhat should we do now?\n\nIf we want to keep air pollution to a minimum, it will become increasingly important to take into account the VOCs from chemical products, both in our models of air pollution and in our regulatory actions.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nIn the meantime, as we spend so much of our time indoors, it makes sense to try to limit our personal exposure to these VOCs. There are several things we can do, such as choosing fragrance-free cleaning products and keeping our use of scented candles and air fresheners to a minimum. Research from NASA has also shown that growing house plants like weeping figs and spider plants can help to remove some of the VOCs from indoor air.\n\nAnd of course, we can always open a window (as long as we keep the outdoor air clean, too).\n\nJenny Fisher is a senior lecturer in atmospheric chemistry at the University of Wollongong.

Sharod Simpson hopes to expand his apparel brand, God Is Dope, into music and movies, he said.\n\nStory highlights Sharod Simpson founded God Is Dope, an apparel line aimed at young Christians Its mission is to generate faith-based awareness through fashion, entertainment and influence\n\n(CNN) —\n\nWhen Sharod Simpson told a friend in the fashion industry he planned to start an apparel line called God Is Dope, he didn't get much support.\n\nHe said that is the biggest mistake you will ever make, Simpson tells CNN. He said there's no way you're going to survive with a name like that. But I just believed in it so much.\n\nJust a few years later, God Is Dope's shirts, hats and sportswear – featuring God Is Dope and Just God. in white or black letters against bold fabrics – have caught the attention of entertainers and athletes. The concept is simple: to generate faith-based awareness through fashion, entertainment and influence.\n\nThe brand says: I believe in God in a cool way, says Kayla MaDonna, 27, at the firm's 2,300-square-foot warehouse in downtown Atlanta. It's a conversation piece that is also aesthetically pleasing.\n\nFaith-based apparel is a rising market with robust competition. But customers say God Is Dope is different because it's an affordable brand that targets young buyers who would otherwise be hesitant to express their spiritually through clothing.\n\nLondon-based creative director Ant Haynes says it's the simplicity of it. It doesn't push anything on you. It just says God Is Dope. That's it.\n\n'I need to take this seriously'\n\nSimpson created the brand concept in 2015, when he was 27. He designed a catchy logo, printed it on a shirt and wore it around town.\n\nPHOTO: Courtesy Sharod Simpson Sharod Simpson founded God Is Dope.\n\nIf I saw 30 people throughout the day, at least 20 people would ask me where I got the shirt, Simpson says. Nothing I ever wore got that type of reaction, so, I thought, I need to take this seriously.\n\nHe cashed in his entire $25,000 in savings and ordered 5,000 shirts. Two weeks later, he admits, anxiety set in when 80 boxes arrived and flooded his small house in Atlanta.\n\nI thought to myself, how am I going to sell all of these shirts?\n\nHe and five friends set up shop on college campuses, in store parking lots and near restaurants.\n\nAnywhere with a crowd, we were there, Simpson says.\n\nWithin a week, sales rocketed. With a healthy stream of revenue, he rented a billboard and plastered the company's logo on it. Its social media following swelled. A flagship store followed.\n\nCelebrity exposure\n\nThen, Reggie Wayne wore the shirt while catching a touchdown pass from Peyton Manning.\n\nAnd Derrick Rose bought a hoodie for his son.\n\nInstagram post not found. Post has been removed or is no longer public.\n\nAnd Janet Jackson wore the shirt on tour.\n\nThe brand is gaining exposure overseas, too.\n\nSimpson's friend, Dane Caston, says he wore the shirt, and people were hitting us up in Indonesia like, 'Can we have the shirts? We just want the shirts.'\n\nSometimes, Simpson is in awe of the brand's success.\n\nPHOTO: Courtesy Sharod Simpson\n\nIdeas are worth so much more than what people can see in the beginning, he said.\n\nDepartment stores and other retail chains have contacted him about putting his apparel in its stores, Simpson says, but he's worried it could dull the brand.\n\nI could sell the line to someone and make enough money to change my life, but I want to keep it organic, he says. You can only find the merchandise at our store and on our website.\n\nAnd he insists God Is Dope is not simply a clothing line, it's a lifestyle – one he plans to transform into music, movies and more.\n\nPeople see hats and shirts right now, he says, but I think in five to 10 years, they'll understand how far this movement will go.
(CNN) A second member of an Oklahoma high school track team has died after a pickup truck struck six team members who'd just started a practice run, officials said Tuesday.\n\nAnd the driver -- arrested on initial charges of manslaughter and leaving the scene -- had lost his own son to a separate car crash in the same city a day beforehand, and appeared to be impaired, police said.\n\nThe pickup, driven by Max Townsend, 57, struck six Moore High School athletes who had just started a run about a half-mile from school Monday afternoon, authorities said.\n\nPolice say they're still trying to figure out what led the crash that has left the community just south of Oklahoma City in mourning.\n\nI assure you: We will find out why and exactly what happened, and how it happened, and then deal with the individual that caused this, Moore police Sgt. Jeremy Lewis said at a news conference Tuesday.\n\nTwo students have died; four have been treated at hospital\n\nThe students were struck around 3:30 p.m. Monday, and preliminary information indicates they were on a sidewalk at the time, Lewis said.\n\nTwo of the six runners have died, police said:\n\n• Yuridia Martinez, a sophomore, died of her injuries Tuesday.\n\n• Rachel Freeman, a senior, died Monday at the scene.\n\nFreeman intended to sign a collegiate scholarship for cross-country on Wednesday, according to Dustin Horstkoetter, the school district's safety and security director.\n\nThe other four injured are, according to Horstkoetter:\n\n• Kolby Crum, a senior who was in critical condition at a hospital Tuesday.\n\n• Joseph White, a senior who still was in a hospital Tuesday for unspecified injuries. His condition wasn't available.\n\n• Shiloh Hutchinson, a junior who was in surgery Tuesday for a broken arm, leg and ankle. Her condition wasn't available.\n\n• Ashton Baza, a sophomore who was released from a hospital Monday after being treated for a broken leg and ankle.\n\nDriver was arrested three blocks away, police say\n\nTownsend was arrested Monday after police found him stopped about three blocks away, Lewis said.\n\nThere were signs of impairment due to the ... field sobriety test that we gave him, and that was part of the investigation ... and why he was arrested, Police Chief Todd Strickland said Tuesday.\n\nTownsend was booked on initial charges of first-degree manslaughter and six counts of leaving the scene of an injury accident, Lewis said.\n\nThe charges can and probably will change, especially as conditions change of the victims, Lewis said.\n\nResults of a blood-alcohol test are pending, according to Lewis.\n\nTownsend was being held Tuesday at a Cleveland County jail, police said. It wasn't immediately clear if he had an attorney.\n\nDriver's son died in a crash on Sunday, police say\n\nTownsend's 29-year-old son, Max Townsend Jr., died Sunday in a separate crash in Moore, Lewis said.\n\nThe younger Townsend's vehicle struck a vehicle, ended up hitting a telephone pole, flipping over, which is what killed him, Lewis said.\n\nThe elder Townsend is not from Moore, police said, without elaborating.\n\nAsked where he was going, Lewis said: He does have family in that area.\n\nWe're trying to ... piece back as far as we can to see Mr. Townsend's conduct and events over the last couple days, Strickland said.\n\nThe high school held a vigil Tuesday evening\n\nMoore High School held a vigil for the victims in its gym Tuesday evening.\n\nThat's going to be one of the first steps as we process and express our feelings and allow students and staff to express their feelings in working through this tragedy together, Superintendent Robert Romines said before the vigil.\n\nThe victims were part of the school's track and cross-country teams and just like any normal day, the kids were out ... running during their practice, said Horstkoetter, the Moore schools safety and security director.\n\nSchool officials have praised students and coaches who were at the scene Monday. Horstkoetter told CNN that they jumped into action, giving first aid and other assistance to those who needed help.\n\nWe live in a really good community and we're going to get through it, Horstkoetter said. This community is strong, and we are resilient but it's tough ... my heart is hurting, it's broken, Horstkoetter said.\n\nSome students who saw the incident were actually pointing out the direction the vehicle continued on, which helped us locate the vehicle four to five blocks away, Lewis said.\n\nAlthough no motive has been established, evidence shows the driver had struck vehicles before and after striking the students, according to Lewis.\n\nThirty mental health specialists -- including 16 from the school district -- were at Moore schools on Tuesday, helping students and staff process the incident, Romines said.\n\nMonday's incident comes more than six years after a massive tornado crushed houses, businesses and two schools in Moore , killing 24 people, including nine children.\n\nWe've obviously faced unspeakable tragedy, Romines said Tuesday. Again, we will continue to hold each other. We will continue to grieve together, and we will continue to work in healing and beginning that healing process.

(Photo by Brendan Smialowski / AFP) (Photo credit should read BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nDonald Trump may not realize it totally yet, but yesterday was the last easy-ish day of his presidency.\n\nBy noon (or so) Thursday, Nancy Pelosi will become the new speaker of the House of Representatives – formalizing the Democratic majority her side won in last November's election. And that will change everything.\n\nTrump has sought to look on the bright side of divided control of government to date – insisting that maybe he will be able to make deals with the new Democratic majority in the House. It really could be a beautiful bipartisan situation, he said at a press conference the day after the 2018 election.\n\nBut the early returns are not promising. The federal government has been shut down for the past 12 days – and there's little reason to believe that will change at any point soon. Trump has dug in on his demand for $5 billion to fund construction of his border wall. Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, are equally dead-set on providing zero dollars for Trump's wall.\n\nAnd this is only the beginning. Starting today, Democrats in the House will make Trump's life a living hell. Efforts are already underway to bring a number of his Cabinet officials before Congress, to extricate his tax returns from his grip and to more deeply probe his business dealings both before and during his presidency.\n\nTrump, a political neophyte prior to the 2016 race, has never had to deal with this sort of opposition before. Sure, Democrats have never been willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. But he never really needed Democrats to do much of anything, either. The Republican majorities in the House and Senate ensured Trump got his tax cuts and two Supreme Court picks. There was no real political penalty for his total unwillingness and inability to work with Democrats.\n\nThose days are now over. Democrats can now do Trump real political damage using the official means of their House majority. While they may not be able to, say, force his tax returns into public view (the jury remains out on that), they can make sure the issue is front and center and create major distractions for a White House that has already shown it can distract itself very well, thank you very much.\n\nTrump claims to understand this, likely with his self-professed titanic intellect. To me, that's like when people who are about to have a baby say they are totally ready for it. As evidence, they point to their nursery being all set up, the Diaper Genie being up and running, and so on and so forth. Then the baby comes – and they realize, like every parent that has gone before them, that no amount of planning or bracing could fully prepare them for their new reality.\n\nThat's Trump and the new Democratic House majority.\n\nThe Point: Look out: It's going to be a mess.
0 of 8\n\nJeffrey McWhorter/Associated Press\n\nAlthough the 2019 College Football Playoff didn't feature overly competitive games in the semifinal round, the four-team setup produced the matchup that seemed likeliest from the start of the season. For the fourth consecutive year, Alabama and Clemson will square off in the playoff. It's the third time in those four years that everything is on the line in the national championship game.\n\nWhile some may be less enthused because the schools are the same, both programs look dramatically different than last year's version. Despite the attrition at both Alabama and Clemson, Nick Saban and Dabo Swinney have continued to reload with future NFLers across the board and maintained elite status.\n\nTheir two previous championship battles were epic displays of playmaking and high-level football, and there's no reason to expect anything less this go-around. This will be the tiebreaker in the championship battle between the two schools. The Crimson Tide won their first matchup 45-40 in 2016, while the Tigers rallied to win 35-31 in 2017.\n\nWe have eight burning questions to consider when it comes to which team will prevail and take home the hardware. Whichever team provides answers for these key areas should expect to win.
SPRINGFIELD, Illinois (CNN) -- Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama introduced Sen. Joe Biden to the nation as his running mate Saturday, telling supporters that he is a leader who is ready to step in and be president.\n\nFor months, I've searched for a leader to finish this journey alongside me and join me in making Washington work for the American people. I searched for a leader who understood the rising costs confronting working people and will always put their dreams first, Obama said.\n\nToday, I've come back to Springfield to tell you I've found that leader, he said.\n\nThe rally is the pair's first joint appearance since Obama announced that Biden, the senior U.S. senator from Delaware, would be his running mate on his Web site and in a text message to supporters early Saturday morning. Watch Obama introduce his running mate »\n\nDemocrats hope that Biden's working-class roots and foreign policy experience will help Obama, who informed Biden of his decision Thursday.\n\nThousands of cheering supporters gathered Saturday for the rally in Springfield, Illinois, where Obama announced his candidacy last year. It will be their only public appearance together before next week's Democratic convention in Denver. Watch what Biden would bring to an Obama presidency »\n\nAs he took to the podium at Saturday's rally, Biden invoked the 16th U.S. president, Abraham Lincoln, who was from Illinois.\n\nPresident Lincoln once instructed us to be sure to put your feet in the right place and then stand firm, said Biden, a native of Scranton, Pennsylvania.\n\nToday in Springfield, I know my feet are in the right place, and I'm proud to stand firm with the next president of the United States of America, Barack Obama.\n\nObama stressed those roots, introducing 65-year-old Biden as still that scrappy kid from Scranton who beat the odds.\n\nHe noted hardships in Biden's life, including the deaths of Biden's first wife and infant daughter in a 1972 car wreck and his struggle to overcome a brain aneurysm in 1988. iReport.com: iReporters ask if Biden was really the best choice\n\nThat's the kind of fighter I want by my side in the months and years to come, Obama said.\n\nKnown for his plain-spoken approach and penchant for speaking from the cuff, Biden wasted little time taking to the traditional vice presidential candidate's role of political attack dog.\n\nJohn McCain ... served our country with extreme courage, and I know he wants to do right by America, he said of his Senate colleague and the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. But the harsh truth is loud and clear: You can't change America when you supported George Bush's policies 95 percent of the time.\n\nHe also seized on a McCain comment from this week when he could not remember how many houses he owns and said McCain was out of touch with the kitchen-table issues that working families face.\n\nIt's a pretty hard experience. He'll have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at, Biden said.\n\nThe McCain campaign quickly pounced Obama for introducing Biden as the next president of the United States before quickly correcting himself to say vice president. Watch McCain's new ad targeting Biden »\n\nBarack Obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor, when he introduced Joe Biden as the next president, McCain spokesman Ben Porritt said. The reality is that nothing has changed since Joe Biden first made his assessment that Barack Obama is not ready to lead. He wasn't ready then and he isn't ready now.\n\nBiden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, brings decades of experience that could help counter GOP attacks on Obama's lack of experience in foreign policy.\n\nBiden abandoned his own White House run after a poor showing in Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses. He also ran for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination but dropped out after charges of plagiarism in a stump speech. Learn more about Biden\n\nBiden is serving out his sixth term, making him Delaware's longest-serving senator.\n\nHe is married and has three children. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Delaware and got a law degree from Syracuse.\n\nOne of Biden's grandfathers was a Pennsylvania state senator, according to the Almanac of American Politics.\n\nBiden will make his first big speech as the vice presidential candidate Wednesday, the third night of the Democratic convention.\n\nAll About Joseph Biden • Barack Obama • John McCain

Aired 9-9:30a ET\n\nAired October 7, 2019 - 09:00 ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\n[09:00:00]\n\n\n\nJIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR: -- Houses attack on the first whistleblower which he'd called hearsay.\n\n\n\nPOPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: Before news broke of that second whistleblower, 90 former national security officials, veterans of both Republican and Democratic administrations issued a letter voicing their support for the first whistleblower. Let me read you part, quote, A responsible whistleblower makes all Americans safer by ensuring that serious wrongdoing can be investigated and addressed thus advancing the case -- the cause of national security to which we have devoted our careers.\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: Now Congress may still be in recess for the week, but that will not slow down this impeachment inquiry. Two more witnesses are expected to testify behind closed doors on Capitol Hill in the coming days.\n\n\n\nHARLOW: And this breaking overnight, the Trump administration ordered U.S. troops to essentially abandon our allies, withdrawing from northern Syria. This clears the way for an invasion by Turkey and leaves behind the Kurdish fighters who fought alongside the U.S. to defeat ISIS. That is incredibly important, we'll get to that in just a moment.\n\n\n\nLet's go to Capitol Hill. Let's start with our congressional reporter Lauren Fox.\n\n\n\nSo, Lauren, the significance of the second whistleblower aside from the very important point that they, according to their attorneys, have firsthand knowledge.\n\n\n\nLAUREN FOX, CNN POLITICS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's right. And that really undercuts the Republican talking point we have heard up here on Capitol Hill, Poppy, that this person, this first whistleblower did not have firsthand knowledge of the phone call that has now become the centerpiece of Democrats' impeachment inquiry. So one of the biggest points about this new whistleblower, of course, is that this person did have firsthand knowledge. Of course, they are working through the whistleblower protection system. That's, of course, very key. Democrats are arguing that this is an important new development.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans are arguing that basically nothing has changed. And I think that that is going to be the tenor for which we go into this week in which we have two State Department officials coming up to Capitol Hill for closed-doors depositions with three committees, the Oversight Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and, of course, the Foreign Relations Committee. So all of that happening this week.\n\n\n\nWe have Gordon Sondland coming tomorrow. Then we have the former ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, who's coming on Friday. She will talk to lawmakers behind closed doors. And I will tell you, Democrats are going to be interested in why she was ousted and if she has any idea about what happened behind the scenes and why she was suddenly let go of that post -- Poppy.\n\n\n\nHARLOW: Right.\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: And of course those are two officials with firsthand direct knowledge.\n\n\n\nHARLOW: Right.\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: Of the events leading up to that decision.\n\n\n\nHARLOW: And that's what Congressman Jim Himes was saying this morning is one of his key questions, you know, to hear from what was it that led to her removal.\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: Yes.\n\n\n\nHARLOW: Was it that she wouldn't go along with this?\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: And the president's line was -- what was it, you know, certain things are going to happen to her or something in that call, pre-staging her eventual removal.\n\n\n\nHARLOW: Lauren, thank you very, very much.\n\n\n\nIt did not take long for the White House to dismiss this second whistleblower. Joe Johns joins us this morning outside the White House.\n\n\n\nSo, even though some of the circumstances here are different, again, a firsthand knowledge being one of them, still being dismissed by the administration?\n\n\n\nJOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Right. Well, the bottom line from Stephanie Grisham over here at the White House is that the president did nothing wrong, so it doesn't matter how many whistleblowers there are out there. But also important to say the president tweeted just this morning once again, discrediting this second whistleblower. You know he has a history of that, it goes all the way back even before Robert Mueller who he went after with a vengeance. The president this morning writing, The partisan whistleblower, apparently referring to the first whistleblower to come forward, was very wrong. The president writes what his, quote, perfect no pressure call with the Ukrainian president was and then apparently referring to the second person, he writes, Bring in another whistleblower from the bench.\n\n\n\nSo now you got the president once again going after the first whistleblower, the second whistleblower. We don't know any of their names at all and we can certainly expect this to continue over the weekend as well. The president also referring to an attorney for the whistleblowers as the same for both, and also indicating that that person is a Democrat supporting both Hillary Clinton and Obama. That's apparently -- apparently a reference to attorney Andrew Bakaj who in fact was an intern for Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer, the two New York senators back in 2001. Back to you.\n\n\n\nHARLOW: All right. Joe Johns, thank you very much for laying all of that out.\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: Well, 90 former National Security officials who we should note worked for both Republican and Democratic administrations have come together, signed an open letter in support of the first whistleblower. That letter says, and we're quoting, Simply put, he or she has done what our law demands. Now he or she deserves our protection.\n\n\n\n[09:05:00]\n\n\n\nFormer director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, is one of the officials who signed that letter. He joins me now live from Washington.\n\n\n\nDirector Clapper, tell us why you and these other officials felt the need to come out publicly in support of this whistleblower's right here.\n\n\n\nJAMES CLAPPER, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, Jim, I think it stems first with my involvement with the intelligence community whistleblower protection program when I served as director of National Intelligence and I was a strong proponent of it for the simple reason that people in the intelligence community must have, should have a legitimate conduit for expressing concerns about wrongdoing and be able to do it in such a way that they are protected and the information they are conveying is protected.\n\n\n\nSo when I was approached about signing such a letter, open letter to the public, about the importance of whistleblowers and the importance of protecting them, I signed on in a heartbeat.\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: That's right. As you know, the president has called for this whistleblower to be outed and you've heard it from some of the president's surrogates, Senator Lindsey Graham as well, and I want to play a short comment from him on FOX News and then ask you a question. Have a listen.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): If the whistleblower's allegations are turned into an impeachment article, it's imperative that the whistleblower be interviewed in public under oath and cross examined. Nobody in America goes to jail or has anything done to them without confronting their accuser. This is Kavanaugh all over again.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: Now Senator Graham, as well as you and I, know that the whistleblower law is designed expressly to protect the identity of whistleblowers so they feel secure in coming and exposing the possibility of wrongdoing.\n\n\n\nDo you see a deliberate effort here by the president and his supporters to discourage future whistleblowers? To make it clear to them that there will be public consequences if they come forward?\n\n\n\nCLAPPER: Well, yes, absolutely. I think, in fact, the statements such as Senator Graham's and certainly the president's about outing the whistleblower is I think casts -- creates a chilling effect on others to come forward if, in fact, the law is going to be summarily violated. I think that would cause others to pause about coming forward. Now it appears that may not have applied here, which is a good thing in the case of this second whistleblower complainant.\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: As you know, the president now has sitting members of this government. You have the attorney general, traveling the world now, meeting with U.S. intelligence partners, trying to find out in his view whether they participated in some sort of Obama administration- led effort to undermine President Trump in the last election here. You also know that John Durham, who is a former prosecutor, senior Justice Department official, he's pursuing his own investigation on the origins of that probe.\n\n\n\nAre you concerned that Barr's or Durham's investigation will find wrongdoing and seek to punish former intelligence officials?\n\n\n\nCLAPPER: Well, I don't -- I don't know. I don't think there was any wrongdoing. I think at the time all of us were trying to navigate a very, very difficult, politically fraught, highly charged situation. I know from my part my main concern was -- were the Russians and the threat posed by the Russians to our very political fabric. And the message I'm getting from all this is, apparently what we were supposed to have done was to ignore the Russian interference, ignore the Russian meddling and the threat that it poses to us, and oh, by the way, mulling off what the then commander-in-chief, President Obama, told us to do, which was to assemble all the reporting that we could, that we had available to us, and put it in one report that the president could pass on to the Congress and to the next administration, and while we're at it, declassify as much as we possibly could to make it public and that's what we did. And --\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: One issue I'm --\n\n\n\nCLAPPER: It's kind of disconcerting now to be investigated for, you know, having done our duty and done what we were told to do by the president.\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: Fair enough. And as you know we're just a little more than a year away from another election which the intelligence community is concerned, and others, Republicans and Democrats concerned that Russia will interfere again, and other officials.\n\n\n\nI wonder, as you see the president, as you see the attorney general, as you see, for instance, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee in the Senate, Ron Johnson, talking about all these possible conspiracies in 2016, who's minding the store now for 2020?\n\n\n\n[09:10:01]\n\n\n\nWho should Americans at home feel confident in to protect the next election from Russian or interference by other countries?\n\n\n\nCLAPPER: Well, I think despite Senator Johnson's statements, the very same institutions that were attempting to protect the country in 2016, and that's the intelligence community, the CIA, NSA, et cetera, as well as the FBI. And those great, you know, men and women of those organizations continue to be vigilant and continue to try to keep the nation safe and secure, particularly as we approach the 2020 election. And I anticipate not only the Russians will be trying to interfere, meddle and influence, but other countries as well who went to school on what the Russians did and the success they enjoyed in 2016.\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: And, of course, we're in a remarkable situation now where the president seems to be inviting countries to do the same.\n\n\n\nDirector Clapper, thanks very much.\n\n\n\nCLAPPER: Thanks, Jim.\n\n\n\nHARLOW: That's saying a lot that others have learned from Russia and he expects that others will do the same.\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: Absolutely.\n\n\n\nHARLOW: OK. We have a lot ahead. Coming up, we'll speak with Congressman Jamie Raskin. He, of course, sits on both the Intelligence and Oversight Committees. Will one or both of the whistleblowers testify? What are they expecting? We'll ask him next. Plus, more on the Trump administration's stunning move overnight, withdrawing troops from northern Syria. What does this mean for the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in the region?\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: Well, they're abandoned again. And talks between United Autoworkers Union and General Motors have taken a turn for the worse, according to a chief negotiator. Is there any end in sight? Enormous political, economic consequences from this. We're going to be live in Detroit.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[09:15:00]\n\n\n\nHARLOW: Well this morning, we are seeing a new strategy by some Republican lawmakers when asked whether they think President Trump asking China last week to investigate his political rival is out of bounds. A number of them are saying the president is just, you know, joking. Listen.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): I don't think it's a real request -- I think he kind of -- I think he did it to gig you guys.\n\n\n\nSEN. ROY BLUNT (R-MO): I doubt if the China comment was serious, to tell you the truth.\n\n\n\nREP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): You really think he was serious about thinking that China is going to investigate the Biden family?\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nHARLOW: With me now, Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland, he of course, sits on the House Oversight and Judiciary Committee. He's very busy these days, congressman, thank you for being there. Let me just begin with that? What is your response to your Republican colleagues who say the president is just joking?\n\n\n\nREP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): Well, do they think he was joking when he withheld $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine, and then sent people over there including Rudy Giuliani, to shake them down to extract from them a commitment to investigate Joe Biden to unleash prosecutors and investigators on Joe Biden? Was that a joke too?\n\n\n\nLook, I think anybody looking at this, any reasonable observer would understand that's a completely absurd defense of the president who now has involved not just Ukraine, but Russia and invited China.\n\n\n\nLook, I think we should step back and ask the question, why is it a big deal to get them involved? Because, you know, I disagree with Jim Jordan about almost everything, but I would defend with my life his right to participate in our politics. But that's not true of Vladimir Putin or Ukrainian prosecutors, Russian spies or Chinese operatives.\n\n\n\nHARLOW: Right --\n\n\n\nRASKIN: They should not be involved in American --\n\n\n\nHARLOW: So --\n\n\n\nRASKIN: Elections.\n\n\n\nHARLOW: So to that -- to your exact point, Congressman Raskin, listen to this, Mike Pompeo who by the way we now know was on that July 25th call between the president of Ukraine and President Trump, here's how he defended it, speaking in Greece over the weekend.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nMIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE, UNITED STATES: Look, nations do this. Nations work together and they say boy, goodness gracious, if you can help me with X, I'll help you achieve Y. This is what partnerships do. It's win-win. It's better for each of us. I don't -- I'm not offended when your Prime Minister asks me, can you help us with X, right? It doesn't bother me a lick.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nHARLOW: It's win-win, it's best for all of us. Do you agree?\n\n\n\nRASKIN: Well, they're confusing international cooperation on economic and military and security objectives with the president converting the office of the presidency into an instrument of re-election, and an instrument of private self-enrichment. That's what this president has done.\n\n\n\nHe's treating the government of the United States as though it's part of his political campaign, and he's putting our national security at risk by trying to use other governments against American citizens. We've never seen anything like this, it's completely unprecedented in the history of our country.\n\n\n\nHARLOW: Here is what Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said over the weekend about the whistleblower who he believes not only needs to testify before Congress, but needs to do so in public. Listen to this.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): If the whistleblower's allegations are turned into an impeachment article, it's imperative that the whistleblower be interviewed in public under oath and cross-examined. Nobody in America goes to jail or has anything done to them without confronting their accuser. This is Kavanaugh all over again.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nHARLOW: He even said, congressman, quote, if that doesn't happen in the house, I will make sure it happens in the Senate. This is those 90 former national security officials just wrote a letter, saying, we must protect the whistleblower. What is your reaction to Senator Graham saying they have --their identity has to be made public?\n\n\n\n[09:20:00]\n\n\n\nRASKIN: Well, the desperation of some of the Republicans is quite extraordinary at this point. It used to be a bipartisan commitment that we protect whistleblowers because we want them to come forward with the truth of the conduct of our elected officials. But we don't have to depend on just this one whistleblower, not only is there another whistleblower who is about to come forward, but everything that the whistleblower said has been corroborated by independent objective evidence including the contemporaneous transcript of -- or memorandum about the phone call that took place on July 25th between President Trump and President Zelensky.\n\n\n\nWe also have objective, verifiable evidence that the president's withholding of the military assistance at the same time in order to create coercive leverage over this vulnerable ally resisting Russian aggression. So, everything the whistleblower has said has been objectively borne out by the testimony of other witnesses and more are coming forward every day.\n\n\n\nAnd you can see already the contradiction in what they're saying. On the one hand, they're saying there's absolutely nothing wrong with what they did, as President Trump puts it, it was a perfect call, it was a perfect strategy. On the other hand, you can't believe the people who establish the reality and the facts of that call and this strategy that unfolded in order to put pressure on Ukraine.\n\n\n\nHARLOW: Congressman, on the impeachment question, obviously you're leading on this front, and you've said that you think articles of impeachment are inevitable at this point, you said that to our Manu Raju. But Elizabeth Warren; Democratic senator running for president in 2020 said over the weekend when she was asked by a reporter, quote, you've seen enough evidence to convict yourself, meaning to convict in the Senate, and she said yes.\n\n\n\nI wonder if you think that it would be more prudent for members of the Senate to wait until they see evidence before saying they are ready to convict. What do you make of her answer?\n\n\n\nRASKIN: Well, but I didn't see the interview and I assume what --\n\n\n\nHARLOW: I can -- let me play it. I have it --\n\n\n\nRASKIN: OK --\n\n\n\nHARLOW: I believe, I think we can play it, just to give -- do we -- if they can get it back in there, we will play it for you just so you can --\n\n\n\nRASKIN: Sure --\n\n\n\nHARLOW: See the totality of what she said. Here it is.\n\n\n\nRASKIN: OK.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You've seen enough evidence to convict yourself?\n\n\n\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, you would vote right now to (INAUDIBLE) --\n\n\n\nWARREN: Look, I think the evidence is clear. When Donald Trump released the transcript and which he solicited a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 elections, he broke the law.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nHARLOW: Your thoughts, congressman?\n\n\n\nRASKIN: Well, what I take Senator Warren to be saying is that the evidence at this point is overwhelming of the president's culpability for perpetrating this plot which was a complete sellout of our constitution. Now, I'm certain -- I don't speak for Senator Warren, but I'm certain her position would be if there's evidence that contradicts it, then obviously, she would change her mind. But at this point, there's no evidence coming forward.\n\n\n\nAll we're getting really is the irrelevant distraction of the president calling people traitors and spies and them complaining about how unfair the process is, and all of these extraneous immaterial arguments. They really don't have any answer to the fact that what the president did is to unleash his operatives to go and to shake down the Ukrainian government in order to get political dirt on American citizens who are, you know, his political rivals and then cover the entire thing up.\n\n\n\nAnd nobody has been able to negate a single element of that story and the evidence piles up every single day as more people come to testify. They're better off doing what they're basically doing now --\n\n\n\nHARLOW: Yes --\n\n\n\nRASKIN: Which is admitting it and saying, well, he wasn't really serious, he wasn't kidding, everybody does it. But all of that, again, is a distraction from a very serious offense against the constitution of the United States.\n\n\n\nHARLOW: I would note the president of Ukraine said at the U.N., I didn't feel any pressure. We have to leave the conversation here, we'll be back to it very soon. Congressman Raskin, always appreciate your time, thank you.\n\n\n\nRASKIN: Thank you for having me.\n\n\n\nHARLOW: You got it.\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: This is breaking news just in to CNN and it's significant as regards to the president. A federal court judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by Trump in an effort to block a subpoena issued by the Manhattan District Attorney's office for eight years of the president's tax returns.\n\n\n\nAnd we are just learning an attorney for President Trump has already quickly filed an emergency appeal. The judge in this case, I mean, his language is scathing here.\n\n\n\nBRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes --\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: He calls Trump's argument a categorical and limitless assertion of the presidential immunity here.\n\n\n\nGINGRAS: Yes, that's right --\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: Yes --\n\n\n\nGINGRAS: And let's go back a little bit just to give some context here. Let's remember now what happened is, this is a back and forth between the Manhattan DA's office and the Trump org and the president himself for quite a while now. And essentially, what they are wanting was eight years of tax returns because they believe there was some business practices that were not legal during those hush money payments prior to the campaign --\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: Right --\n\n\n\nGINGRAS: Right? So, we've been going back and forth with these two sides for a long time.\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: But specific to the Stormy Daniels payments --\n\n\n\nGINGRAS: Exactly --\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: OK --\n\n\n\nGINGRAS: And essentially what happened here is the president argued while he was -- they were trying to get those tax returns, which many people have been wanting to see, that he can't be subjected to any criminality, he can't be under investigation while he is a sitting president.\n\n\n\n[09:25:00]\n\n\n\nAnd as you just read, federal judge says, well, that's not really the case, and he was very strong in his language. It was a very long actual comments as to why they believe that. But let me read it again, he basically said, categorical limitless assertion of presidential immunity that would constitute an overreach of executive power.\n\n\n\nEssentially saying your argument isn't strong enough, and essentially they can go forward --\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: Yes --\n\n\n\nGINGRAS: With this lawsuit that the Manhattan DA's office filed.\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: OK, so they going forward, the president's team has already filed --\n\n\n\nGINGRAS: Yes --\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: An emergency appeal. I suppose we see where that goes. Are they likely to be granted an appeal here?\n\n\n\nGINGRAS: It's not really clear at this moment, but let's also remember that this went so far as to the president's own Department of Justice got involved --\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: Yes --\n\n\n\nGINGRAS: Just last week --\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: Yes --\n\n\n\nGINGRAS: Saying that they wanted to have some sort of skin in this game and have an opinion about what was going on --\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: Right --\n\n\n\nGINGRAS: Between these two sides. So, it's almost like what's going to happen next because things are happening that we haven't seen before.\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: Right --\n\n\n\nGINGRAS: But this is a big ruling by this federal judge --\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: So, it's a big loss? OK --\n\n\n\nGINGRAS: Yes --\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: Brynn Gingras, thanks very much, certainly a story we're going to stay --\n\n\n\nGINGRAS: All right --\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: On top of.\n\n\n\nHARLOW: All right, a stunning turn of events overnight. The president pulling troops, U.S. troops from Syria's border with Turkey, effectively abandoning our U.S. allies there, the Kurdish forces who helped U.S. soldiers in the defeat of ISIS. This is significant, this goes back to why Jim Mattis resigned, we'll have the developments ahead.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[09:30:00]
(CNN) Months after flames and unrest gripped Kenosha, Wisconsin, the decision by county officials to not charge the White police officer who shot Jacob Blake has renewed the city's communal pain and racial divide.\n\nThe Kenosha prosecutor's announcement this week that Rusten Sheskey and other police officers would not face charges in connection with the shooting angered Blake's family and activists -- but it wasn't surprising.\n\nWe expected it, Blake's father, Jacob Blake Sr. said Tuesday. We understood what was going to come when they called in [the] National Guard ahead of the decision.\n\nShortly after the August shooting, the small city of 100,000 people on the Lake Michigan coastline near Milwaukee became another epicenter for demonstrations calling for racial justice. Blake's shooting happened just months after the killing of George Floyd and tensions in Kenosha intensified even more after an armed White teenager fatally shot two men and wounded another during protests in August. However, law enforcement and community members in Kenosha had already been at odds long before Blake's shooting, according to Vaun Mayes, an organizer with Community Task Force MKE, a Milwaukee-based activist group that has joined multiple marches supporting the Blake family.\n\nThe Black community's relationship has always been rocky and (one of) high racial tension, said Mayes, recalling a series of inflammatory comments made by Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth in 2018.\n\nBlake was shot multiple times in the back on August 23 after officers were responding to a domestic incident. Blake survived the shooting but was left paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nFor attorneys representing the Blake family, the district attorney's decision further destroyed the community's trust in the criminal justice system.\n\nWe feel this decision failed not only Jacob and his family, but the community that protested and demanded justice, Attorneys Ben Crump, B'Ivory LaMarr and Patrick A. Salvi in a joint statement.\n\nThis sends the wrong message to police officers throughout the country, they added.\n\nAll the officers involved in the Blake shooting remain on administrative leave, the Kenosha Police Department tweeted late Tuesday.\n\nKenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley said he has called on the US Attorney's Office to do a parallel civil rights investigation that would be a separate investigation with its own conclusion.\n\nKenosha isn't the only tinderbox, scholar says\n\nRacial integration and inadequate police training helped turn Kenosha into a tinderbox last year, said John M. Eason, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who has studied Wisconsin's changing demographics\n\nKenosha is one of Wisconsin's most racially diverse small cities in a state that is predominantly White. The city's population is 11.5% Black and nearly 18% Hispanic, according to US Census data.\n\nProtesters confronted National Guard members near the Kenosha County Courthouse on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Kenosha County Sheriff's Department is about 88% White, the Kenosha News newspaper reported last year.\n\nWhen you rapidly expand your police force and you don't properly train them, the police are basically being used to corral the folks that are seen as invaders, Eason said. They are not there to protect and serve people of color in that situation.\n\nEason's research indicates many more cities across the United States are experiencing similar changes and tensions.\n\nThis isn't the only tinderbox, Eason said. We only think about really small rural farm towns or big cities like New York or Los Angeles but most of America is Kenosha: places that are diversifying rapidly as the country goes through a demographic change.\n\n'We've been shown that we don't matter'\n\nThe Kenosha County sheriff's controversial statements about this summer's protests were preceded by comments he made in 2018 . Beth had addressed reporters in January 2018 following the arrests of five people for shoplifting at a Tommy Hilfiger outlet store in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, and a high-speed chase that led to their arrests.\n\nI'm to the point that I think society has to come to a threshold where there's some people that aren't worth saving, Beth said at the news conference a day after the incident, according to CNN affiliate WTMJ. We need to build warehouses, to put these people into it and lock them away for the rest of their lives.\n\nAt least four of the suspects were Black, according to jail records. The fifth suspect was a minor, the sheriff's department said in a statement.\n\nDays after he made the comments, the sheriff issued an apology saying he should have kept his comments directed toward the incident and should have not allowed my emotions to get the better of me.\n\nPhotos: Police shooting leads to protests in Wisconsin A demonstrator cries during a protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Tuesday, September 1.

This is another reminder that just because racial and social injustice hasn't received as much attention recently, doesn't mean the need to fight against it has gone away.
(CNN) —\n\nThe geographic and demographic separation between the two political parties, and the two Americas, has reached a new peak in the House of Representatives.\n\nIn the 116th Congress sworn in last week, Republicans and Democrats now control districts that represent virtual mirror images of each other across a wide range of key measures, from racial composition and education to income and age, a new CNN analysis has found.\n\nHouse Democrats hold the vast majority of districts with more minorities and more college graduates than the national average, while Republicans are mostly confined to districts with more whites and fewer college graduates than the national average. Likewise, Democrats now control the vast majority of House districts that are younger, more affluent or contain more immigrants than the national average.\n\nThe widening trench between the two sides promises to further narrow the prospect of them reaching any common ground. For the Democratic majority, the new alignment may make it easier for them to reach consensus on many polarizing cultural issues – from immigration to gun control – but may open new splits on economic questions such as taxes and trade.\n\nTo illuminate the differences between the seats each party holds, CNN producer Aaron Kessler used census data to track some of the key characteristics of all 435 House districts. That exercise, employing data from the American Community Survey's 2012-2016 district-level estimates, produced a stark divergence between the 235 House Democrats and the 199 House Republicans (for the purpose of this analysis, CNN treated the North Carolina House seat enmeshed in allegations of voter fraud as vacant).\n\nThe divergence is apparent across every key measure.\n\nIn the new House, just over three-fifths of the Democrats represent districts where the minority share of the population exceeds the national average of 38%. Almost exactly 85% of House Republicans represent districts that are more white than the national average of 62%.\n\nAlmost three-fifths of the Democrats represent districts where the share of adults holding at least four-year college degrees exceeds the national average of 30.3%. Over three-fourths of the House Republicans represent districts with fewer college graduates than average.\n\nNearly three-fifths of House Democrats hold seats where the median income exceeds the national level of $55,322. Two-thirds of House Republicans hold districts where the median income lags below the national level.\n\nNearly 54% of the House Democrats hold seats where the median age is younger than the national level of 37.7. Almost exactly 60% of House Republicans hold districts that are older than the national median.\n\nJust over three-fifths of Democrats represent districts where the immigrant share of the population (the portion of people born abroad) exceeds the national average of 13.2%. Over 90% of House Republicans represent districts with fewer immigrants than the national average. (These numbers do not include the 18 seats in Pennsylvania, where the immigrant population was not available for the state's recently redrawn districts.)\n\nThis deep and consistent separation culminates a sorting-out process that has steadily reshaped the House since the 1990s.\n\nThe tectonic plates have been shifting for a few years now, said Ken Spain, a former communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee.\n\nAs recently as the 2009-10 Congress, there was still substantial overlap between the kinds of House seats each party represented. At that point, Democrats still held nearly half the seats defined as mostly rural in the innovative system developed by the CityLab website to classify districts into six groupings on an urban to rural continuum. Democrats dominated the most urban seats, but the two sides were competitive in suburban areas.\n\nThe Obama backlash vs. the Trump backlash\n\nIn 2010, during the midterm election of President Barack Obama's first term, Republicans swept away dozens of small-town and rural Democrats. Through personal popularity, those Democrats had been holding on to seats with large numbers of blue-collar, older and Christian white voters who usually voted Republican in presidential elections. But they could not survive the backlash among those voters to Obama's aggressive first two years.\n\nThe November 2018 result is the bookend to that election. This election swept away dozens of Republicans from suburban seats with large numbers of minority or white-collar white voters or both who had been increasingly voting Democratic in presidential campaigns. Those Republicans, from Reps. Mimi Walters and Dana Rohrabacher in Orange County, California, to John Culberson in Texas and Barbara Comstock in northern Virginia, could not survive the backlash among their voters to Trump's tumultuous first years.\n\nThe losses for Republicans last fall were concentrated in more affluent and better-educated districts. Democrats won 43 seats that Republicans controlled in the previous Congress, while losing three seats of their own, for a net gain of 40 (pending the North Carolina result). Of the 43 seats that Democrats gained, 31 are in districts that exceed the national average in college graduates, according to Kessler's analysis. Incomes exceeded the national median in 35 of the 43 districts that Democrats captured.\n\nAfter these sweeping gains, Democrats now dominate well-educated and upper-middle-class districts, many of them immersed in the information-age economy and connected to global markets. Before the November election, each party held almost exactly half of the 201 districts where incomes exceed the national median; now Democrats hold 136 of those seats, or just over two-thirds. Before the election, Democrats held 57% of the 182 seats with more college graduates than the national average; after the election, they hold almost exactly three-fourths of those seats (135). Similarly in the CityLab classification system, Democrats gained a net of 35 seats in the three most suburban categories and now lead in them by 166 to 51.\n\nThe election left the GOP in an even more precarious position in diverse America: It now holds only about 1 in 6 of the seats with more minorities than the national average and just 1 in 8 of those with more immigrants.\n\nWhere Republicans are focused\n\nRepublicans still control two-thirds of the House seats where whites exceed their share of the national population. That's less than their three-fourths in the previous Congress, but still much more than in 2009, when the two sides split such seats about evenly. The GOP edge in those seats is a reminder of the big challenges still confronting Democrats in places less touched by economic and demographic change. But in the House math, it isn't nearly enough to overcome the GOP weakness in diverse districts and its erosion in white-collar suburbs.\n\nSpain views the lopsided deficits in those places as the inevitable price of his party's relentless focus under Trump on mobilizing blue-collar and rural whites, especially men. You want to go all in on white votes, white male voters, sure, the reaction to that is massive hemorrhaging with female voters in the suburbs, says Spain, who's now a partner at CGCN Group, a lobbying and communications consulting firm.\n\nWhere Democrats are focused\n\nThe House Democratic caucus now revolves around two principal poles. One is the white-collar suburban areas in which the party advanced in November. The other is heavily minority, lower-income districts mostly inside urban centers. Those two poles become apparent when looking simultaneously at the income and racial composition of the Democratic House districts. The 136 Democratic districts that exceed the national median income split exactly in half between those that are more and less diverse than the national average. But three-fourths of the 99 Democratic districts that lag below the median income contain more minorities than average – a reflection of the Democratic dominance in mostly nonwhite lower-income inner cities.\n\nOverall, with the party's big gains in suburbia, the share of Democrats who hold seats in districts with more minorities than the national average is notably lower in this Congress (61% ) than it was in the last (66%). But that's still a significant shift from the party's last majority in 2009, when it divided almost evenly between districts that were more and less diverse than the national average.\n\nSimon Rosenberg, president and founder of NDN, a Democratic group that studies the political implications of demographic and economic trends, says the new distribution of seats shows that the party's House caucus has finally caught up with the changes in the party that Barack Obama consolidated. Obama built his two presidential victories around a coalition that was younger, more diverse, better-educated and more urbanized – at a point when the Democratic House majority still relied on large numbers of right-leaning blue dog members clinging to mostly white and culturally conservative rural and small-town seats, including many in the South.\n\nIt's fair to say that the House campaign in 2018 executed on a politics that we first saw with Obama in 2007 and 2008: It aligned the House with the way that Obama began to reorient the Democratic Party, said Rosenberg, who consulted with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee through the campaign. There were many people who were saying that Obama's embrace of this new coalition was the cause of Democratic decline in the Senate and the House. It was never true. But what was true was that Democrats had never resigned themselves to having to lean into this new coalition that Obama constructed. Now they did in 2018 – they leaned into it – and look what happened.\n\nA more culturally liberal Democratic Party\n\nDemocratic Rep. David Price, a former legislative aide and political scientist, represents the affluent and highly educated Research Triangle Park area in North Carolina. He says the decline since the party's last House majority in the number of Democrats representing mostly white working-class areas won't diminish the party's interest in addressing wage stagnation and widening inequality. There's still plenty of sense that we need to address the slipping away of the American dream with blue-collar America, he said in an interview. We didn't do it in 2016. But we're not about to concede that or to give it up.\n\nBut Price said that with fewer members representing non-urban working-class districts, the party will likely find it easier to move forward on cultural issues including gun control, gay rights and immigration. Resistance from the moderate coalition of blue dogs made it difficult for the party to act on any of those when Nancy Pelosi last held the speakership, between 2007 and 2010. That change is already evident during the government shutdown fight: Hardly any House Democrats have expressed unease with Trump trying to portray the party as soft on border security, something difficult to imagine a decade ago.\n\nThe number of members in the House who are given serious heartburn by this shutdown over the wall … is considerably less than it would have been in the last (Democratic-majority) Congress, Price says.\n\nThe new fault lines for Democrats may track economic issues. Members from the party's growing suburban center will likely be more hesitant about expensive new government programs, and especially raising income taxes, than their colleagues from lower-income and urban districts. And more of those new members from districts with large numbers of globally connected white-collar professionals may challenge the hostility to international trade that now dominates the party. Those suburban members are going to look at the economic stakes in trade differently, predicts Price, an advocate of expanded trade. That's still really a work in progress, though.\n\nRepublicans retreat to Trump country\n\nFor Republicans, the principal challenge in the new alignment may be that they may further cement the changes in the party's coalition that Trump has accelerated. The GOP House caucus has been pushed back almost entirely into Trump country: mostly white districts with very few immigrants that are also below the national average in education and income. Nearly three-fifths of all House Republicans now hold seats in districts that are below the median income and more white than the national average.\n\nThat means that as the caucus sets its direction, there are very few voices left in the room to worry about how its choices will affect the party's prospects in the upscale suburban areas that broke so sharply against them and Trump last fall. That dynamic has been apparent in the party's near lockstep support for Trump's partial government shutdown over a border wall, which was opposed by two-thirds of nonwhites and college-educated whites in the most recent CNN poll conducted by SSRS.\n\nSpain, who directed communications for the National Republican Congressional Committee during the GOP's 2010 landslide, said Democrats could reopen the door for the GOP in white-collar suburbs if they move too far left on spending or in their response to the agendas of the various minority groups in their coalition. But he acknowledges that recovery won't be easy as long as the GOP under Trump is defining itself so heavily toward the cultural priorities of older and blue-collar white men.\n\nAt some point Republicans are going to have to find an equilibrium if they plan to compete, he says. Clearly there's no sign of that occurring in the immediate future. You want to go with older white men, the counterbalance to that is going to be millennials, females and diversity coming back with a vengeance.\n\nThat action/reaction cycle has now produced a House divided, both demographically and geographically, as deeply and consistently between the parties as any in modern times. It is not just two parties but two Americas that are poised to collide in the 116th Congress.

Hong Kong (CNN) More than a year since the coronavirus pandemic began, while a surprising -- and frustrating -- number of points remain unclear , one thing is certain: the first major outbreak was in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.\n\nWhile scientists are still examining the exact origins of the virus, whether or not it came from bats or another animal, how it mutated to become so infectious and so deadly, and how long it was around before the initial outbreak, that Wuhan was the initial epicenter is undeniable.\n\nEqually undeniable, is how effectively the city has rebounded, just last week hosting a New Year's party as much of the world remains in effective lockdown -- a success that has become a major point of pride in China.\n\nAs the country has moved past its initial mishandling of the virus -- officials appear to have downplayed its severity and the potential for a pandemic, preventing an effective response until too late -- Beijing has reveled in contrasting its own successes with the situation in other countries, particularly the United States.\n\nBut the stain of being the place where the pandemic emerged remains. In recent months, Chinese state media and officials have begun hyping up reports of potential other sources, pointing to research that may suggest -- or can be manipulated to suggest -- that the virus was circulating earlier than first thought and, most importantly, was circulating outside of China.\n\nThis does little to change the fact Wuhan was where the first outbreak occurred, but the chance of blaming another country for the pandemic, just as China was -- largely unfairly -- blamed for the emergence of the coronavirus last year, seems too good to pass up.\n\nMore and more research suggests that the pandemic was likely to have been caused by separate outbreaks in multiple places in the world, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi claimed this month . (China took) immediate actions to carry out epidemiological investigation, identify the pathogen and publicize key information including the genome sequencing of the virus. All this sounded alarm bells across the world.\n\nA cleaner wearing protective gear sprays disinfectant along a production line at an automotive plant in Beijing on May 13, 2020.\n\nWhile Wu effectively dismissed the potential car parts origin theory, it has echoes of far more widely reported claims that the virus could have entered China via frozen foods\n\nFor months, China has been testing and disinfecting frozen products coming from overseas , over fears the virus could reenter the country that way, even as experts remain skeptical about this as a potential source of infection.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) says it is highly unlikely that people can contract Covid-19 from food or food packaging, and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the risk is thought to be very low. Both insist there is no evidence of such transmission, and countries have even threatened to bring a case against China at the World Trade Organization over import restrictions.\n\nChinese experts disagree however, with Wu himself saying in November that more and more evidence is showing that frozen seafood or meat products can bring viruses from outbreak countries into China.\n\nJUST WATCHED See how China disinfects frozen foods for suspected coronavirus Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH See how China disinfects frozen foods for suspected coronavirus 03:03\n\nWhile initially this theory appears to have emerged from an abundance of caution after China had essentially controlled its domestic outbreak and was concerned new infections from overseas could undermine this, it has evolved to present a potential cause of the pandemic itself -- one that would, conveniently, serve to diminish Chinese government responsibility.\n\nAll available evidence suggests that (the coronavirus) did not start in central China's Wuhan, but may come into China through imported frozen food products and their packaging, the People's Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, claimed in November , citing Chinese experts, including Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nWuhan was where the coronavirus was first detected but it was not where it originated, Zeng said, telling another newspaper tracing the virus cannot answer all questions, but it is very likely that the virus had co-existed in multiple places before being spotted in Wuhan.\n\nAs well as speculating about frozen food packaging, Chinese officials and state media have also hyped studies that seem to suggest the virus was circulating outside the country last September or even earlier, even as scientists have criticized the methodology of certain papers and warned against drawing conclusions from them.\n\nStrong claims supported by flimsy evidence get widely reported without the necessary scrutiny and consideration of a wider body of available evidence, Francois Balloux, a geneticist at University College London, wrote in a Twitter thread about several reports of earlier circulation, noting that the evidence for the virus being in Europe as early as August was highly unconvincing.\n\nJUST WATCHED Chinese journalist who covered Wuhan Covid-19 outbreak jailed Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Chinese journalist who covered Wuhan Covid-19 outbreak jailed 02:41\n\nLast month , Global Times, a nationalist Chinese state-run tabloid that has been at the forefront of pushing this and other theories, ran an investigation into a new hypothesis: did the early outbreak in Wuhan originate from imported frozen food?\n\nAlthough it might be too early to jump to conclusions, the possibility that the coronavirus was passed on from cold-chain products into Wuhan, or more specifically, to the Huanan wet market, where the sale of frozen products was once prevalent, cannot be ruled out, the paper claimed, adding that more evidence is needed, and scientists worldwide are urged to join hands to further research this hypothesis and pinpoint the origin of the virus.\n\nSuch research is underway, with a WHO team arriving in Wuhan last month to investigate the origins of the pandemic, after months of negotiation with Beijing, which has been wary of allowing any outside probe until now.\n\nOne member of the team told reporters that the trip was really not about finding a guilty country.\n\nIt's about trying to understand what happened and then see if, based on those data, we can try to reduce the risk in the future, said Fabian Leendertz of Germany's Robert Koch Institute, according to the BBC.\n\nBut China may fear that the WHO investigation -- if it confirms the basic facts of the Wuhan outbreak as currently understood, including that officials failed to recognize the true danger of the virus and tried to suppress reports and gag whistleblowers -- could blow back on Beijing just as the country is working to rehabilitate its image.\n\nBy muddying the water with talk of potential outside origins, regardless of the fact this does not change that Wuhan was where the first major outbreak took place, Beijing's propagandists may hope to undercut any such criticism, or even provide a potential sop for the WHO report to avoid assigning blame.
As the 2010 midterm elections approach, Dave Schechter has been following voting systems and voter irregularity issues for CNN.\n\n(CNN) -- In a previous posting about voting issues, I mentioned J. Alex Halderman, an assistant professor of engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan, whose resume includes hacking into voting machines in the name of exposing security flaws.\n\nAnalysis: Our votes are counted accurately -- aren't they?\n\nAt the time, his best-known exploit involved accessing a supposedly tamper-proof voting machine and getting it to play Pac-Man.\n\nIt turns out that as I was writing that, Halderman and his students pulled off another coup, exposing vulnerabilities in an internet-based system for overseas and military voters that the District of Columbia planned to test in the November election.\n\nWithin 36 hours of the system going live, our team had found and exploited a vulnerability that gave us almost total control of the server software, including the ability to change votes and reveal voters' secret ballots, Halderman wrote on his blog.\n\nThis link is Halderman's how-we-did-it.\n\nAlong the way, Halderman's team collected crucial secret data stored on the server, modified all the ballots that had already been cast to contain write-in votes for candidates we selected, installed a back door that let us view any ballots that voters cast after our attack, and -- best of all -- left a 'calling card' on the system's confirmation screen, which voters see after voting.\n\nOfficial ballot: District of Columbia mock election (pdf)\n\nAfter 15 seconds, the page plays the University of Michigan fight song. Here's a demonstration.\n\nThe Wolverines attack on D.C.'s experiment went undetected, Halderman said, until the fight song (Hail to the Victors) was discovered.\n\nTo be fair, the people running the D.C. pilot program made a couple of weeks available for outsiders to have a crack at their system. While Halderman and his students did their best in the name of protecting the sanctity of the voting process, it appears that there were others with potentially less-friendly motives also taking advantage of the test period.\n\nTestifying before the D.C. Board of Ethics and Elections -- in a virtually empty room, according to news reports -- Halderman dropped this bomb: While we were in control of these systems we observed other attack attempts originating from computers in Iran and China. These attackers were attempting to guess the same master password that we did. And since it was only four letters long, they would likely have soon succeeded.\n\nHalderman's team even changed the D.C. system's password (who uses a four-letter password?) to thwart the foreign intrusions.\n\nGranted, this was a test and only a test of a small pilot program. But the idea of attempts from outside of the United States to compromise the security of the most basic of American rights should worry anyone who cares about the political process.\n\nFlaws in the D.C. system wasn't the only issue making news:\n\n• The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's School of Law spotlights three potential threats: voter registration problems (3 million people were unable to vote in 2008 because of such issues and registration efforts are notably fewer than the last election), ballot security operations (often allegations of voter suppression or intimidation) and voting machines.\n\nAnother read on voter suppression concerns.\n\n• The controversy over the Justice Department's handling of the Black Panther voter intimidation case in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Election Day 2008 has not faded; if anything, it's grown as an issue for political conservatives.\n\n• The Sentencing Project reports that between 1997 and 2010 an estimated 800,000 people convicted of felonies regained their right to vote, as 23 states have, in varying fashions, changed their laws on the subject.\n\n• Concerns remain about U.S. military personnel stationed overseas getting ballots from their home states in time to vote and mail back before Election Day. Several states received waivers from a new requirement that ballots be mailed out by 45 days before the election, to ensure their return on time.\n\n• If you're interested in following current court cases involving voting issues, check out this website from the Moritz College of Law at The Ohio State University.
Kate Maston takes off from third base, barreling toward home plate. Waiting for her arrival is the opposing catcher, a 12-year-old boy who is a year older and almost a foot taller than she. He's also in her way. No big deal. She's quick and she's nimble. She's also unafraid. In a race to beat the throw and the tag, Maston instinctively gets low as she closes in on home plate. So low that she slides her slender 5'0 body feet-first through the catcher's legs. A cloud of red dirt engulfs the catcher and Maston as she touches the plate, setting off an explosion of deafening cheers. High-fives all around. Maston just gave her team a 7-6 lead in the top of the fifth inning.\n\nI'm probably going to lose my voice after this game! Maston's teammate Sammie Singh yells from the dugout.\n\n(Photo courtesy GTB)\n\nMaston is a baseball player. But unlike most stories you hear about girls who play baseball, she is not the lone girl on the team. She's not Mo'ne Davis or Ginny Baker from Fox's short-lived baseball drama Pitch. In her dugout is an entire team full of girls. They are part of Girls Travel Baseball (GTB) and have come to Miami from all over the country to play in the SummerSlam youth baseball tournament against teams full of boys. Maston's efforts put GTB ahead of Genesis, a local and noticeably bigger team in the 12-and-under division (GTB played with 10- and 11-year-olds for this game). Maston was the leadoff hitter for GTB. Her head didn't clear the Genesis catcher's shoulders. Looking on from the dugout as the Genesis players warmed up, the GTB girls had noted his size.\n\nI think he has a mustache.\n\nThat kid is not 12.\n\nHe's not a kid.\n\nIt didn't matter, though. Despite the game being GTB's third matchup in less than 24 hours (the girls lost the first two), the team had no plans of backing down against older boys on that balmy June afternoon.\n\nAfter Genesis jumped out in front with a 6-0 lead in the first inning, the girls' bats got hot in the third. They scored three runs, followed by another three in the fourth. GTB was pumped and chatty. The excitement of the comeback vibrated through the dugout. You look like you ate six energy bars, a coach told one of the girls. Maston's slide into home plate only increased the jubilation.\n\nVideo Play Button McCollum and the Blazers Snapped Postseason Losing Streak for Jennifer Spencer Is the Real Winner of the Boston Marathon Stars Invest in Plant-Based Food as Vegetarianism Sweeps NBA The NBA Got Some Wild Techs This Season Jarrett Allen Is One of the NBA's Hottest Rim Protectors Wade's Jersey Swaps Created Epic Moments This Season NBA Squads Brought the Heat with Bench Reactions This Year Westbrook Makes History While Honoring Nipsey Hussle Nation's Top-Ranked H.S.

In the bottom of the fifth, Genesis tied the game. Then in an act of redemption, the Genesis catcher smacked the ball deep into center field to drive in a runner for an 8-7 win. Time was up.\n\nBut Miami is still a win. Every tournament is. Most girls who play youth baseball are steered away from the sport before they reach double digits in age. As the only all-girls youth travel baseball team in the country, comprised of players from different states, each time GTB takes the field the girls prove it doesn't need to be this way. Ultimately, GTB wants to create a pipeline to the United States women's national baseball team. But it also gives these girls the confidence to dream bigger. Maybe they'll play high school or even college baseball. Or perhaps, one of them will make the majors. For the girls of GTB, their gender doesn't hinder them from believing in the possibilities.\n\nAubrey Evans is sitting in the lobby of GTB's hotel on the morning of the first day of the tournament. Her socks are pulled up to her knees, she's wearing a Dirtbags baseball T-shirt and on the brim of her GTB baseball hat sits a pair of sunglasses. Behind her, some teammates are playing catch.\n\nShe knows she's there to be quizzed about baseball. She sounds like she's answered all these questions before; she probably has. Nearly every member of GTB has had a profile published in their local paper and a few have done radio spots or TV hits. Reporters pop up every so often to ask them about being one of a few girls who play the nation's pastime. Maybe that is why Evans is gruff but patient, not quite bored but not far from it.\n\nHer mood changes, though, when she talks about what it's like to be on an all-girls team that plays teams full of boys. A sly smile crawls across her face, a corner of her mouth kicking up, as she says: Everyone looks at us weird, and they're like, 'Oh, a bunch of girls. We can beat them.' Then once they see us actually beating them, they start to get scared. She loves that feeling, when the boys realize their level of competition. Feels great, she says. Because they're all crying when we strike them out or tag them out. [They] throw their helmets and everything.\n\n(Photo courtesy GTB)\n\nThey're so emotional, Grace DeVinney adds. The girls laugh.\n\nEvans, 13, has been playing baseball since she was four. She is only 5'1, but she is built for the game. There's a video of her at age 11 in Marlins Park, participating in an event with dozens of boys. She stands out because she hit a ball 227 feet into left field. Later that night in Miami, her cheeks streaked with eyeblack, she scores the team's only run in the first game of the tournament.\n\nLike almost every GTB player, Evans is on another travel team, one located in her hometown of Apopka, Florida. She plays with all boys on that one. There are thousands of these youth baseball travel teams throughout the U.S., and most get together regularly to practice and then play in tournaments. GTB doesn't work that way. It has a much smaller pool of potential players because of how girls are squeezed out of baseball. They either get shuffled into softball—a fine sport but one that is different from baseball in mechanics, strategy and rules—or they quit baseball when they are left sitting on the bench.\n\nGTB, however, makes space for girls. The team is run by CEO Robert Saven and Josh DeVinney, the director of baseball operations. The two met and hit it off nearly four years ago because both have daughters who play baseball. When Saven proposed an all-girls travel team to DeVinney, GTB was born. Its vision is simple: Form a team of the best girls out there and let those girls compete at the highest level. The organization will celebrate its two-year anniversary later this summer.\n\nThe original team had eight girls and two boys. GTB now boasts 42 players, all girls between the ages of nine and 16. They are divided into three teams: Maston and her teammates play on an under-11 team nicknamed the Young Guns, Evans and her teammates are on the U13 team called the Prime Team, and there is a U15 team. The organization is constantly expanding and right now, DeVinney has a database of 70 girls. He's hoping to create a U9 team soon.\n\n(B/R Mag)\n\nThis system has its drawbacks. Unlike most youth travel sports teams, these girls do not all live in the same place. To get to Miami, they flew or drove from all parts of Florida, Georgia, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina, Massachusetts, New York and California. The roster is never the same, with school schedules and individual travel budgets determining who can show up each time. Parents are responsible in most cases for paying their kid's way, and GTB plays in a tournament at least once every two months, if not more. Just two weeks after the Miami trip, they met again in North Carolina, where the Prime Team won the championship in its division in the Top Gun baseball tournament. There is chatter about possibly heading to the Bahamas to play later in the summer.\n\nTeams only get to practice together the night before a tournament starts. Sometimes that doesn't work well. The Prime Team couldn't find its rhythm or figure out its chemistry and struggled defensively until about halfway through each game during the SummerSlam tournament. But that same team, then a U12 squad but with a roster similar to the one that traveled to Miami, beat the Puerto Rico national boys team last summer at the Baseball Youth Majors tournament in Kissimmee, Florida. Puerto Rico was the odds-on favorite, the most athletic and experienced team in the division. GTB got down 4-0 in the first inning. But in the top of the fourth, it hit back-to-back home runs. With GTB ahead 5-4, Evans went into the game to pitch. She threw 18 pitches, all of them strikes, across two innings, and GTB came away with a hard-earned win. Since its inception, GTB teams have a combined record of 36-33 with two championships captured by the The Prime Team.\n\nThe time and money investment ($200 for uniforms, about $50 per tournament, plus travel and lodging costs) is worth it to parents because of what GTB has meant for their daughters. Travis Aldrich, whose daughter Chloe plays for the Young Guns—her base hit drove home Maston—has seen a change in his daughter over the last year since she joined GTB. She's definitely much more of a leader, he says, because she sees that she's not such a unicorn at things.\n\nThe night the tournament ends in Miami, everyone who is staying at the hotel is at the pool. Most of the parents lounge around on the deck and order all kinds of food; delivery people arrive in a steady stream over an hour or so. Evans is running around, her eyeblack wearing off but still visible. There are water guns, games of chicken, dashes between the hot tub and pool and people getting tossed into the water. Just inside the building, on the tiled hallway floor, three of the Young Guns—Marnie Baxter, Sarah Langlie and Sadie Zion—have created their own Slip 'N Slide. After a couple of hours in the water, a group of the Prime Team players go inside, gather on chairs in the lobby and chat as they mess around on their phones.\n\nDeVinney says his daughter, Grace, is always melancholy for a few days after each tournament. Zion's mother, Laurette, knows the Miami trip will end with a tearful goodbye. [Sadie is] gonna be hysterical, crying going home tomorrow on the plane, she says.\n\n(Photo courtesy GTB)\n\nThe friendships the girls build and the acceptance they feel as part of GTB are important elements of their experience. Maston's dad, Rich, says that in his daughter's hometown division in Coral Springs, Florida, they've never seen another girl. What I liked about [GTB] was introducing [Kate] to other girls like her, he says. I don't think she thought they existed until she met the team. Abygale Souza, who plays on the Prime Team, has never even met another girl in the state of Massachusetts who plays baseball at the level she does.\n\nThis is a big part of why the organization is so important. You get along, and you can talk normal, Evans says. She immediately adds: Well, I can talk normal with the guys. But it's not that connection. Some of the girls explain that GTB removes the feeling of always being on the outside looking in, the oddball in the mix. Sometimes they use vague language, saying the other girls know what we've been through together or you feel more comfortable playing with people like you.\n\nThere's one other thing about bringing an all-girls team to baseball tournaments, where there are rarely, if ever, any girls playing: It's important for the boys to see it. The night of the first game, as Evans and the rest of the Prime Team played, a boy from another team who had played earlier in the day was standing around, watching GTB. Suddenly, it dawned on him what he was seeing. Oh, it's girls playing against boys? he asked loudly and apparently without first thinking about who could hear him. Heads whipped around. He seemed to realize the importance of his next words. Oh, he paused. Awesome.\n\nIt's the second game of the tournament for the Prime Team, and they're playing the Commanders. GTB starts smoothly, ending its first defensive inning with a whip-fast double play at first and second. The next time the Commanders are up to bat, they smash the ball deep into left field, and the runner on third has a clear path home. Instead of just running across home plate, though, he slows down about six feet out, practically walks in, shuffling across the plate.\n\nThere is immediate anger and chatter throughout the dugout.\n\nHow disrespectful. Of course he did that to us.\n\nThis kind of thing always happens when we play.\n\nWe should hit him the next time he's at bat, show him how we respond to such treatment.\n\n(B/R Mag)\n\nThe girls of GTB are always on the lookout for the hate. They never know if what they are getting is simply bad sportsmanship or if it's intentional because they are girls. Either way, they are always on alert. They once played a tournament in which three teams dropped out when they found out they'd have to play an all-girls team. For a while, GTB submitted rosters with only the girls' first initials and their last names. The girls describe how often they get hit by pitches while at the plate or hit by balls while running the bases (they can't prove they get hit more than the boys, but they all believe it to be true).\n\nThe hate doesn't just happen on the field. After the first game the Prime Team played in Miami, Julie Clines, whose daughter Olivia plays on the team, saw a grown man standing near the field, flapping his arms around, mimicking the girls, saying I'm a girl ballplayer. Clines told the tournament director, but there was nothing he could do. We're used to it, she said, angry but resigned.\n\nThe girls use this type of behavior as motivation. Olivia Clines, 12, loves proving the naysayers wrong. I like beating the boys. I like shoving it in their face when they say, 'Girls can't play baseball,' she says. Then we come out and pitch a no-hitter against them, and they're like, 'What?'\n\nThe Sunday after the tournament, the girls from both GTB teams are standing on the warning track in Marlins Park. They are all wearing their bright green jerseys and dark blue GTB baseball hats. Only a few feet away, some of the Chicago Cubs are warming up. Even though they've been instructed not to bother the players, some of the girls can't resist calling out their names. They wave, take pictures and post on Snapchat.\n\nGTB is there to be honored by the Miami Marlins, who are using the home game to celebrate the 25th anniversary of A League of Their Own, the fictional 1992 dramedy about the first female pro baseball league, which operated in the U.S. from 1943 to 1954. Lori Petty, who played Kit Keller in the film, throws out the first pitch. The girls of GTB are splashed across the Jumbotron as the announcer explains how they are an all-girls baseball team, the legacy of the women from the movie.\n\nAs they waited to be on screen, the girls shoveled dirt from the field into their pockets. Afterward, while walking to a meet-and-greet with Petty, 11-year-old Sadie Zion, says: I brought home a souvenir. It's called dirt. When asked what she will do with the dirt, her teammate, Felicity Fonseca, answered matter-of-factly, Put it in a jar.\n\n(B/R Mag)\n\nOne day, maybe, one of them will return and stand on the field as an MLB player. These girls, however, know what they are up against. The youngest of all the GTB girls is Savannah Strickland, who turned 10 in February. She lives in Tallahassee, Florida, and like all her teammates, she is the only girl on a local travel team. When asked how long she's played baseball, she thinks about it and then says, For as long as I can remember. Strickland pauses and then asks, Can I say something else? Confidently and unprompted, she says, I will want to play baseball until I'm not allowed to play anymore.\n\nShe's only ever known baseball, and she already knows one day someone will stop her from playing.\n\nBut GTB gives these girls hope. Cristen Cox, the mom of 11-year-old Marnie Baxter, said her daughter has played with GTB for four or five tournaments now. In the past she's always talked about, maybe she'll play for the high school, maybe she'll try out, maybe she'll keep up with it, she says. Now, she goes around town saying, 'I'm gonna play for the high school.' I hear her telling adults, people at the batting cages, anyone who asks her.\n\nMaston wants more than that, though—she wants to play in the major leagues. Her dad says that's tough to hear because he knows the odds are slim. She's not deterred. When he tells her, Babe, there's never been anyone that's done it, she responds, Good. I'm going to be the first.\n\nEvans is right there with her. I want to make MLB. I know that's a big dream, but I know we can, she says. We can do it.\n\nJessica Luther is a freelance journalist living in Austin, Texas.

New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley sat for an interview with CNN's Richard Quest on Tuesday.\n\nHere is the transcript of that interview.\n\nRichard Quest: Mr. President, thank you, sir. Much appreciated. There's a lot to talk about, but don't worry, we won't talk about it all. We'll be judicious in our time with you. But here, if you like, are the controversial bits, the sexy bits: The last minutes of the FOMC used the phrase fairly soon. We all know what fairly soon means. If you and I go to have a cup of coffee, we'll have it fairly soon. We could meet for dinner fairly soon. What does fairly soon mean in the context of the minutes?\n\nPresident Dudley: I think it means what it says. It doesn't say it's a week, a month, a couple months. Fairly soon means in the relatively near future. I think the key thing in terms of thinking about monetary policy is -- what are we basically communicating to people in the markets? We've basically been saying that if the economy continues on the trajectory that it's on, slightly above-trend growth, gradually rising inflation, we're going to continue to remove monetary policy accommodation. So let's look at what we've actually gotten. It seems to me that most of the data we've seen over the last couple months is very much consistent with the economy continuing to grow at an above-trend pace, job gains remain pretty sturdy, inflation has actually drifted up a little bit as energy prices have increased. So we're very much on the trajectory that we said -- that we thought we'd be on and we said if we were on that trajectory we're going to gradually remove accommodation. What else have we seen? We've also seen things that should make us even more confident that this is going to continue in the future. After the election we've seen very large increases in household and business confidence, we've seen very buoyant financial markets -- the stock market is up, credit spreads are narrow. And we have the expectation that fiscal policy will probably move in a more stimulative direction. So, put it all together, I think the case for monetary policy tightening has become a lot more compelling.\n\nQuest: And that's obviously fairly soon, which implies sooner rather than later?\n\nDudley: I think that's fair.\n\nQuest: There's also one new wrinkle into this, of course, which is the role of fiscal policy. A large increase in government spending is coming. We know it's coming. The president is going to talk about it tonight. How does the Fed factor in what you know is coming but is not here yet?\n\nDudley: Well, it's hard to actually put it into your forecast yet because we don't know what it is, how big it is or when it's actually going to hit the economy. But we do know that fiscal policy is going to move in a more stimulative direction. So what that says to me is that the risks to the outlook are now starting to tilt to the upside. So while I haven't really built it into my GDP forecast, when I think about the balance of risks -- up or down in terms of economic activity -- I think the fiscal side tends to push things -- the risks to the upside.\n\nQuest: But you can't wait for it to happen, can you? I mean the whole question of monetary lag. I know you've got to think about many of these policies not coming into force until 2018, but you have to plan now.\n\nDudley: Well, look, I think monetary policy is pursued on the basis on the economic outlook. Fiscal policy outlook obviously affects that -- the trajectory of GDP, unemployment and inflation. So that's a factor weighing on us but the fact that we have so little specifics yet about what's going to happen -- it's got to wind its way through Congress -- means I don't put a lot of weight on it in terms of my modal forecast. I just think it makes the risks to the outlook a little bit tilted to the upside at this point.\n\nQuest: And from what you've heard -- and I'll accept that the detail is few and far between -- from what you've heard, are the sort of spending, fiscal plans that you're hearing, are they the right sort in terms of productivity gains that the Fed can live with?\n\nDudley: Well, I think we're going to have to see. To the extent that you reduce the burden of regulation, that should lift productivity growth. To the extent that you pursue greater infrastructure spending, that should lift productivity growth. So those are the aspects of changes on the fiscal side that would actually be supportive to stronger economic activity.\n\nQuest: But, for instance, I'm going to throw the numbers that we've seen -- the $50 billion on defense spending that the president said that yesterday, $50-odd billion on defense. Is that the sort of thing that you find is -- leads to greater productivity as opposed to just shear consumption?\n\nDudley: I wouldn't think that defense spending would have a huge benefit to the productivity growth, but obviously we have to spend money on the military to keep the country safe. Also, if you're increasing spending on military but cutting spending on discretionary or domestic programs, the net effect may not be very powerful in terms of supporting the economy.\n\nQuest: Into this difficult area we have the financial markets. They're on a tear. I mean today could be the 13th record high, we could be in record territory, you know the numbers better than myself. You can't wait for the fiscal plans completely until next year, but you have to take into account what's happening in the markets at the moment, don't you?\n\nDudley: Well, financial conditions are very important in terms of how they influence economic activity. So if the stock market is up, credit spreads are narrow, financial conditions are more buoyant, that's going to tend to make the economy stronger. The important thing for us, though, is not to overreact to every little movement in the stock market. It's got to be something that lasts for a period of time for it to actually affect household and business behavior. So if the stock market goes up, and then goes right back down, it's not going to have much consequence for the economic outlook. But if it goes up and stays up, then that's going to support, presumably, consumption through higher household wealth.\n\nQuest: What do you believe you're seeing at the moment?\n\nDudley: Well, there's no question that animal spirits have been unleashed a bit post the election. Stock market is up a lot. Household and business confidence have increased significantly. There's a survey of small businesses that showed a very large increase in December and sustained that increase in January. So, there's no question that sentiment has improved quite markedly post the election.\n\nQuest: That -- animal spirits or whatever you want to call it -- that market influence. It transmits itself around to the entire economy, doesn't it?\n\nDudley: Well, we would expect to have some consequence for economic activity. But we'll have to see if that actually -- one if the confidence is sustained, and whether it actually materializes in terms of increases in spending. I would say so far we haven't seen much effect of the improvement in confidence actually leading into greater spending. I think the economy is still on about a 2% GDP track, which about what it's been over the last year or so.\n\nQuest: When you hear the president looking for 3 to 4% -- and the Treasury secretary looking for 3% to 4% economic growth -- admittedly not next week, next month, maybe not even next year. But as a medium-term, longer-term goal, do you find that acceptable?\n\nDudley: I think it would be great if we have 3% to 4% GDP growth because that would mean productivity growth is very strong and that would lead to rapidly rising living standards, so that would be good for everybody. The key is, what actually happens to productivity growth.\n\nQuest: Do you find 3% to 4% realistic?\n\nDudley: I would say it's possible. You know, we had productivity growth back in the late 1990s where productivity growth was averaging over 2.5% a year. If we could get back to that kind of level of productivity growth, then I think 3% plus growth would actually be achievable. But that's a pretty high standard to reach for.\n\nQuest: You are no longer the only game in town, to use the phrase. For the last five years, six years, seven years, you -- not you personally but you and your colleagues -- central bankers around the world have been saying 'Hey, c'mon, we can't do this on our own. You're requiring us to do all the heavy lifting.' Well, guess what, you've now got a bit of help from Washington, haven't you?\n\nDudley: Well, I think it is correct that monetary policy has had to do most of the heavy lifting over the last few years. And I think that's unfortunate because monetary policy is a blunt tool. Monetary policy can't allocate resources across the economy. Monetary policy can't do much to affect productivity growth. So I think it's good that the burden is going to be more broadly shared.\n\nQuest: How close do you believe -- and in this I'm not just asking about the Fed but I'm thinking about the Bank of Japan, I'm thinking about the ECB, the BoE -- how close do you believe central banks have come to being out of ammunition?\n\nDudley: I don't think we're close to being out of ammunition. Certainly speaking for the United States, the federal funds rate is now well above zero --\n\nQuest: But if there's another recession and you've got rates down at just about zero, and you've already done QE and the efficacy of QE is starting to dissipate --\n\nDudley: I mean, obviously one can imagine a circumstance when central banks might be ultimately out of ammunition. But that's -- the U.S. is nowhere close to that situation.\n\nQuest: On the question of the Fed and the leadership of the Fed, there's going to be, there's already two seats, there's a third one that's about to become vacant. There's obviously the question of the chair and the vice chair, whether they stay on the board after their terms in office come to an end, entirely constitutionally correctly, this President is going to be able to completely reform the board of the Fed.\n\nDudley: Well the President is obviously going to be able to make some appointment to the board of governors. Of course, remember, the Federal Open Market Committee also consists of the Federal Reserve bank presidents and more importantly than that, the Fed's mandate is set by Congress. Congress wants the Fed to achieve maximum sustainable employment and price stability. So I would expect that whoever gets named to the Federal Reserve is going to try to carry out that task set for the Fed by Congress.\n\nQuest: Oh sir, you know we talk about doves and we talk about hawks when we talk about Fed governors.\n\nDudley: I've heard that.\n\nQuest: And therefore a new president can -- my word, not yours -- manipulate the board?\n\nDudley: I think -- I don't expect that. I think Congress has been very clear about what the Fed's objectives are and people who are named to the board of governors and people who serve on the FOMC try to conduct monetary policy consistent with those goals of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. Right now you'd have to say we're doing pretty well in those objectives. We're pretty close to full employment, and we're pretty close to our 2% inflation objective. So it's not clear why you'd want to change any of that.\n\nQuest: That inflation objective, 1.6% at the moment, you can't -- inflation is one of those things, you dare not let it get ahead, because by the time it gets ahead it's too late to do anything about it. Most people don't seem to understand this, do they?\n\nDudley: Well you mean the long lags of monetary policy?\n\nQuest: Yeah.\n\nDudley: Look, I think it's very clear you don't want to keep monetary policy too accommodative for too long. This is something that Chair Yellen talked about in her testimony. Because if you do, then you're going to have to hit the brakes really hard later, move up rates very sharply and that could actually cause the next recession. So slow and gradual seems to me the right way to proceed, moving monetary policy relatively early to make sure the economy doesn't overheat and that can actually allow you to sustain the economic expansion.\n\nQuest: I need to ask you, one of the biggest issues at the moment is cybersecurity. Now, I emphasize when I mention the Bangladesh case that I'm not suggesting for a moment that anything was wrong. I know the background to that particular case. We don't need to go into the minutiae of the whole SWIFT system, but when we look at the issue of cybersecurity, do you believe it is one of the most significant threats facing us at the moment?\n\nDudley: I think it is one of the most significant threats because we have a lot of people out there that want to do us harm and they're building their capabilities just as we're building our capabilities, so it's little bit of an arms race on both sides. The other thing I think we need to be very conscious of in terms of cybersecurity is we need to really define well the roles and responsibilities of all the different actors. So the person who is making the payment, they need to make sure that their systems are secure. The person transmitting the payment has to make sure that the people that are transmitting payments through their payments mechanisms are well buttoned up. And the person receiving the payment has to be also secure. So it's very important to get those responsibilities well defined and insure that there's an assurance regime to make sure everyone is doing what they're supposed to be doing.\n\nQuest: Do you worry that there are weaknesses in the current system that make the global financial system vulnerable to cybersecurity? Because it's the nightmare scenario, and we're sitting in the building, frankly, where if anything were to happen, financial Armageddon is not far off if something happens to one of the major central banks in the world, or one of the big clearing banks or one of the big investment houses.\n\nDudley: Well it's certainly something to be concerned about. That's why we spend so many resources trying to strengthen our defenses in the cybersecurity space -- both securing the perimeter but also teaching our employees the insider threat.\n\nQuest: But is it taken seriously?\n\nDudley: Absolutely.\n\nQuest: By policymakers, by CEOs, by shareholders, by government leaders?\n\nDudley: I think so. I think so. Because when I talk to other people, the CEOs at major banks, that's the thing they worry the most about too. So it's definitely very, very high up on our agenda -- right at the top of our agenda. And I think it's right at the top of most people's agendas as well.\n\nQuest: As we come to the end here, Mr. President, what is it about this job you enjoy? If you think about it, you're sitting at the top of the financial system, you're the president of the New York Fed, which of course is responsible for monetary policy, the open market policies of the federal government. What is it that you enjoy about it?\n\nDudley: Well, I mean, how I think about it is I spent a long career in the financial industry and I learned a lot about financial markets and learned a lot about the macro economy and to bring all that experience to bear in the context of monetary policy, to try to get good outcomes for the American people, that's challenging but also rewarding when we're close to achieving our objectives.\n\nQuest: But has there been a moment -- because you were here during the crisis --\n\nDudley: Yes, I was.\n\nQuest: Has there been a moment, where you suddenly say 'Ah, I never realized it was that difficult to do that.' Or 'I pontificated as a private economist about why doesn't the Fed do this. Well now I darn well see why they didn't do it. You can't do it' or 'It's too difficult to do it' or 'We tried to do it.' Anything like that?\n\nDudley: Well, I think that, definitely I saw many things during the financial crisis that I never expected to see. There were a couple speeches I gave at the time, basically looking at all of the things that happened in financial markets that are totally outside the realm of our experience. I think when you're on the inside, you are constrained by the fact that the FOMC is a committee and it consists of many different members. So even if you're seeing something, you have to convince your colleagues what you're seeing is actually important. So it's really important to bring along your colleagues so you can rise to the occasion and do what's necessary to actually stabilize the economy. I think one of the things that I brought to bear in terms of the crisis is that I know a lot about financial markets and the people within this institution know a lot about the financial market plumbing and I think that really helped the New York Fed contribute to the Fed's response during the financial crisis.\n\nQuest: Did you ever fear that it was going to get away from you? That this train was going to run out of track?\n\nDudley: Absolutely. But it didn't.\n\nQuest: But you did?\n\nDudley: I definitely worried. There were days in the fall of 2008 that you really didn't know exactly what's going to happen. That's why we pulled out everything -- all the tools at our disposal to help support the economy because we were very, very close to a Great Depression.\n\nQuest: And today?\n\nDudley: Today I think we're in much better shape. I think the regulatory changes put in place post the financial crisis have made the banking system of the United States a lot more secure, higher capital, higher liquidity, a better means of resolving large institutions should they get in trouble. We've addressed some of structural weaknesses in the financial system, for example money markets. Money market mutual fund reform.\n\nQuest: But you don't want those reforms to be taken away -- Dodd-Frank.\n\nDudley: Well, look, I think it's fair that we want to take a look at regulations and make sure we got the cost-benefit right. But if you look at the U.S. banking system today, is it a good thing that we have more capital? That we have more liquidity? Absolutely. We don't want to roll that back. Because we saw in the financial crisis what happens to households and businesses if we don't have a financial system that can do what it needs to do in terms of intermediating flows of credit between savers and borrowers. We really had a fundamental breakdown in our financial system in the fall of 2008, and I don't ever want to go back there. Therefore we certainly need to keep things like capital, like liquidity, like resolution in place so we don't ever have a financial crisis like that again. That was the worst economic environment of my lifetime. It was certainly the worst financial crisis of my lifetime. And I hope to never see one like that again.
New York (CNN Business) Main Street is emerging as a clear winner following the Senate runoffs in Georgia. The outlook is far murkier, on the other hand, for Wall Street.\n\nA change in power in Washington would allow the real economy and job market to recover faster from the worst pandemic in a century . That's because Democrats will likely have enough votes to provide another round of Covid relief to small businesses and lower and middle-income Americans.\n\nIf the Democrats achieve control of the Senate, more aggressive stimulus would likely be pushed through in the short run, leading to a faster revival in the economy, David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.\n\nAfter Democrats' very good night in Georgia, some economists are already penciling in a lower unemployment rate and stronger GDP for this year and next. That's great news for Main Street.\n\nA faster economy and more stimulus should boost the stock market. That thinking helped lift the Dow 500 points , or 1.7%, to record highs Wednesday. The small-cap Russell 2000, which is extremely sensitive to the real economy, spiked 4%.\n\nHowever, a Democratic takeover of the Senate also poses some risks for Wall Street.\n\nInvestors, who had been banking on gridlock in 2021, are suddenly worried about the risk of tax hikes and a crackdown on Big Tech, the superstar of the stock market. Tech stocks, and the market overall, could be hurt if a faster economic recovery allows the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates out of the basement sooner than anticipated.\n\nAnd the prospect of even more spending by Uncle Sam is hurting bond prices, driving the 10-year Treasury rate above 1% for the first time in March. That could just be the beginning, suggesting stocks may finally face competition from boring bonds.\n\nThe impact for stocks is likely to be a net negative, said David Page, head of macro research at AXA Investment Managers.\n\nGDP is stronger under Democrats\n\nHistory supports the idea that Main Street could benefit more than Wall Street from the Georgia Senate runoffs.\n\nOut of all political scenarios, the real economy has performed the strongest since 1948 when Democrats have control of the White House and Congress, according to CFRA Research. With Democrats in charge, GDP has grown at a brisk annual clip of 4.3% over that span -- the only scenario where growth eclipsed 4%.\n\nEven though many would assume Republicans are better for the economy (low taxes, less regulation), GDP grew by a more modest 2.7% when Republicans had unified control of the government, according to CFRA.\n\nThe stock market has done well when Democrats control Washington -- but not as well as when Republicans rule or when there is gridlock. Since 1933, the S&P 500 has averaged 9.8% when Democrats have unified control, compared with 13.6% when there is a Democratic president and split Congress, according to CFRA.\n\nIt's important to remember that Democrats hardly have a super majority in Congress. They lost seats in the House of Representatives and the Senate could be tied 50/50, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris breaking the deadlock.\n\nThat means Democrats won't have enough votes to dramatically raise taxes, enact the Green New Deal or pass other sweeping measures that would rattle Wall Street -- unless they get rid of the Senate's filibuster rules, an idea that has gained some momentum in recent months but that moderate Democrat Joe Manchin opposes.\n\nThe most egregious or expensive policies will not be passed, Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday.\n\nOne big question mark is whether Democrats would try to hike the 21% corporate tax rate, especially in the midst of a shaky economic recovery.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has proposed lifting the corporate tax rate to 28%. However, analysts said it's far more likely the rate will rise to just 25%. That would be a negative for stocks -- but hardly a nightmare.\n\nMore help could be on the way\n\nWhat's clearer is that if Democrats retake the Senate, they will be primed to provide more aid to an economy that may very well need it.\n\nBiden has described the $900 billion stimulus package enacted last month as a down payment -- and he may now have the votes to make that a reality.\n\nWith Democrats in charge of the Senate, Goldman Sachs expects Congress will enact another $600 billion of stimulus in the near term.\n\nOthers on Wall Street are projecting even more help. Jefferies said Wednesday it assumes another $1 trillion of stimulus in the next few months -- a package that would boost GDP growth by about two percentage points over the next two years.\n\nThat relief package would include boosting the $600 stimulus checks to $2,000, extending enhanced unemployment benefits to the end of June and about half a trillion dollars of state and local aid, according to Jefferies.\n\nThe labor market will heal faster, Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies, wrote in a note to clients.\n\nThe unemployment rate could dip below 5% by the end of this year and hit 4% by mid-2022, Jefferies said.\n\nLiftoff for the Fed in 2023?\n\nIf Democrats control the Senate, they may even be able to push through a long-elusive infrastructure package to repair roads, bridges and airports worth trillions of dollars.\n\nThe hope is that all of this expensive aid for the economy will help narrow the gap between rich and poor -- a troubling divide that has worsened during the pandemic.\n\nHowever, investors are already worrying about the goldilocks backdrop that juiced stock prices.\n\nBefore this week, Wall Street was betting the Fed would keep interest rates at zero until at least 2024. Rock-bottom rates hurt savers and suggest economic weakness -- but they essentially force investors to gamble on risky stocks.\n\nYet Jefferies said that with Democrats in control of the Senate, inflation and the economy may be strong enough for the Fed to lift off in early 2023 -- a full year ahead of forecast.\n\nThe bond market is already reacting. Jefferies expects the 10-year Treasury rate could nearly hit 2% by the end of 2021 -- representing the steepest 12-month increase since 2013-2014.\n\nA taper tantrum is now a real risk, Markowska said.\n\nHigher rates would signal a healthier economy. But they will also force investors to think twice before betting on pricey stocks, which may no longer look like a slam dunk.
CNN host Van Jones is the CEO of the REFORM Alliance, a criminal justice organization. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) With one Senate seat secured for Democrats in Georgia and the other Senate race yet to be called, it is already clear that there is a lesson to be learned from the runoffs. It's not just that President Donald Trump has largely undermined and ruined the Republican Party. It is also that progressive grassroots leaders (led overwhelmingly by Black women) have reimagined, recreated and rebuilt the state's Democratic Party coalition.\n\nWe should not stop at denouncing the lack of smarts on the Republican side. We must also praise the real genius of Georgia's activists and organizers. This is not just a story about the final failure of Trump. It is a story of the success of Stacey Abrams -- and many of the unsung, bottom-up, inspirational leaders with whom she has worked for years. They not only helped secure a Democratic Georgia Senate seat, but they helped elect the first Black senator in Georgia, the Rev. Raphael Warnock.\n\nOf course, there is plenty to criticize on the Republican side.\n\nFor example, the GOP ran two candidates who spent their time demonizing their opponents as  radical socialists  rather than offering their own vision to inspire voters. They marched lockstep with Trump, rather than showing independent leadership. Kelly Loeffler made the unwise decision to continually defame and malign the pastor of Dr. Martin Luther King's church. Her attacks on the Rev. Warnock's sermons and ties to other pastors caused a backlash that likely turned out more Black voters who wanted to defend the Black church. The strategy failed for Loeffler.\n\nPoor judgment from Republicans was not confined to candidates in the Peach State. In Washington DC, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was all too happy to play the part of Ebenezer Scrooge at Christmastime. When he blocked the $2,000 Covid-19 relief checks that progressive Democrats and President Trump both demanded, he single-handedly gifted Democrats a winning closing message: Vote for us, and we will get you enough money to survive.\n\nTo top it all off, President Trump has spent the past two months telling lies about the general election outcome. And those lies likely suppressed his own party's voters . He convinced legions of Republican voters that their votes had not counted in November , despite any solid evidence to back up his claims. The GOP in Georgia paid the price, as many Republicans apparently threw up their hands in frustration at the whole system and stayed home. Worse, Trump made it impossible for Republicans to consistently use their strongest potential message -- that voters must help stop Democrats from controlling the White House, House and Senate -- by his refusal to acknowledge that he was going to have to turn the White House over to Biden.\n\nBut all that is still only half the story.\n\nThe other half was how smartly the progressives played their hand.\n\nFirst of all, for years, the best leaders on the ground in Georgia have been putting grassroots organizing ahead of party politics. Georgia organizers built from the base, focusing on a community-oriented, person-to-person approach . They knocked on doors and made phone calls -- for years. The heroes were not national Democratic Party operatives but local leaders and organizations. It was not just Stacey Abrams -- who lost her bid for Georgia governor in 2018 but never stopped working -- though she is at the top of the list.\n\nAll of this work likely produced a major swing toward Democrats.\n\nIt was also a win for Black joy over a certain kind of White rage. So much of our politics since Trump emerged on the scene has been about right-wingers stoking or managing White anger. And so much of 2020 was understandably and inevitably about Black heartbreak -- from the Covid-19 catastrophe to police abuse . But the first election of 2021 was powered by Black joy, instead. I talked to organizers who said they used music, food, dance and fun to engage people at a deeper level. Their efforts helped the Rev. Raphael Warnock to become only the 11th Black US senator in history -- the first in Georgia . (You can still fit a list of every Black senator ever in a single tweet! That's how rare such wins are.)\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nLastly, it was a win for real people over party royalty. A few years ago, the Democrats nominated Michelle Nunn and Jason Carter for statewide elections and lost badly. They were both Democratic Party royalty. On the other hand, the Rev. Warnock is not, yet he won. He was untested as a candidate, but his personal story is compelling and his leadership qualities are authentic. Despite Georgia's painful history -- one sadly blighted with anti-Black and anti-Jewish bigotry -- all Georgians soon will have a Black pastor representing them in the halls of the US Senate.\n\nHow did we get to this seemingly miraculous outcome? It's simple.\n\nTrump lost his election -- and he spent two months lying and whining. Stacey Abrams lost her election -- and she spent two years building a stronger movement. Now, we know whose strategy was better.
Bush: Don't wait for mushroom cloud\n\nCINCINNATI, OHIO (CNN) -- President Bush outlined his case against the regime of Saddam Hussein and called on the Iraqi leader to disarm in a speech to the American people Monday night. Here is a transcript of his speech:\n\nThank you for that very gracious and warm Cincinnati welcome. I'm honored to be here tonight. I appreciate you all coming.\n\nTonight I want to take a few minutes to discuss a grave threat to peace and America's determination to lead the world in confronting that threat.\n\nThe threat comes from Iraq. It arises directly from the Iraqi regime's own actions, its history of aggression and its drive toward an arsenal of terror.\n\nEleven years ago, as a condition for ending the Persian Gulf War, the Iraqi regime was required to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, to cease all development of such weapons and to stop all support for terrorist groups.\n\nThe Iraqi regime has violated all of those obligations. It possesses and produces chemical and biological weapons. It is seeking nuclear weapons. It has given shelter and support to terrorism and practices terror against its own people.\n\nThe entire world has witnessed Iraq's 11-year history of defiance, deception, and bad faith.\n\nWe also must never forget the most vivid events of recent history. On September 11, 2001, America felt its vulnerability -- even to threats that gather on the other side of the earth. We resolved then, and we are resolved today, to confront every threat, from any source, that could bring sudden terror and suffering to America.\n\nMembers of the Congress of both political parties, and members of the United Nations Security Council, agree that Saddam Hussein is a threat to peace and must disarm. We agree that the Iraqi dictator must not be permitted to threaten America and the world with horrible poisons, and diseases, and gases, and atomic weapons.\n\nSince we all agree on this goal, the issue is: How can we best achieve it?\n\nMany Americans have raised legitimate questions: About the nature of the threat. About the urgency of action -- and why be concerned now? About the link between Iraq developing weapons of terror, and the wider war on terror.\n\nThese are all issues we have discussed broadly and fully within my administration. And tonight, I want to share those discussions with you.\n\nFirst, some ask why Iraq is different from other countries or regimes that also have terrible weapons. While there are many dangers in the world, the threat from Iraq stands alone -- because it gathers the most serious dangers of our age in one place.\n\nIraq's weapons of mass destruction are controlled by a murderous tyrant, who has already used chemical weapons to kill thousands of people. This same tyrant has tried to dominate the Middle East, has invaded and brutally occupied a small neighbor, has struck other nations without warning, and holds an unrelenting hostility towards the United States.\n\nBy its past and present actions, by its technological capabilities, by the merciless nature of its regime, Iraq is unique.\n\nAs a former chief weapons inspector for the U.N. has said, The fundamental problem with Iraq remains the nature of the regime itself: Saddam Hussein is a homicidal dictator who is addicted to weapons of mass destruction.\n\nSome ask how urgent this danger is to America and the world. The danger is already significant, and it only grows worse with time. If we know Saddam Hussein has dangerous weapons today -- and we do -- does it make any sense for the world to wait to confront him as he grows even stronger and develops even more dangerous weapons?\n\nIn 1995, after several years of deceit by the Iraqi regime, the head of Iraq's military industries defected. It was then that the regime was forced to admit that it had produced more than 30,000 liters of anthrax and other deadly biological agents. The inspectors, however, concluded that Iraq had likely produced two to four times that amount. This is a massive stockpile of biological weapons that has never been accounted for, and is capable of killing millions.\n\nWe know that the regime has produced thousands of tons of chemical agents, including mustard gas, sarin nerve gas, and VX nerve gas. Saddam Hussein also has experience in using chemical weapons. He has ordered chemical attacks on Iran, and on more than forty villages in his own country. These actions killed or injured at least 20,000 people, more than six times the number of people who died in the attacks of September 11.\n\nAnd surveillance photos reveal that the regime is rebuilding facilities that it has used to produce chemical and biological weapons.\n\nEvery chemical and biological weapon that Iraq has or makes is a direct violation of the truce that ended the Persian Gulf War in 1991.\n\nYet Saddam Hussein has chosen to build and keep these weapons, despite international sanctions, U.N. demands, and isolation from the civilized world. Iraq possesses ballistic missiles with a likely range of hundreds of miles -- far enough to strike Saudi Arabia, Israel, Turkey, and other nations -- in a region where more than 135,000 American civilians and service members live and work.\n\nWe've also discovered through intelligence that Iraq has a growing fleet of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles that could be used to disperse chemical and biological weapons across broad areas. We are concerned that Iraq is exploring ways of using UAVs for missions targeting the United States.\n\nAnd, of course, sophisticated delivery systems are not required for a chemical or biological attack -- all that might be required are a small container and one terrorist or Iraqi intelligence operative to deliver it.\n\nAnd that is the source of our urgent concern about Saddam Hussein's links to international terrorist groups.\n\nOver the years, Iraq has provided safe haven to terrorists such as Abu Nidal, whose terror organization carried out more than ninety terrorist attacks in twenty countries that killed or injured nearly 900 people, including 12 Americans.\n\nIraq has also provided safe haven to Abu Abbas, who was responsible for seizing the Achille Lauro and killing an American passenger. And we know that Iraq is continuing to finance terror, and gives assistance to groups that use terrorism to undermine Middle East peace.\n\nWe know that Iraq and the al Qaeda terrorist network share a common enemy -- the United States of America. We know that Iraq and al Qaeda have had high-level contacts that go back a decade. Some al Qaeda leaders who fled Afghanistan went to Iraq.\n\nThese include one very senior al Qaeda leader who received medical treatment in Baghdad this year, and who has been associated with planning for chemical and biological attacks. We have learned that Iraq has trained al Qaeda members in bomb making, poisons, and deadly gases.\n\nAnd we know that after September 11, Saddam Hussein's regime gleefully celebrated the terrorist attacks on America. Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists.\n\nAlliances with terrorists could allow the Iraqi regime to attack America without leaving any fingerprints.\n\nSome have argued that confronting the threat from Iraq could detract from the war against terror. To the contrary, confronting the threat posed by Iraq is crucial to winning the war on terror.\n\nWhen I spoke to the Congress more than a year ago, I said that those who harbor terrorists are as guilty as the terrorists themselves. Saddam Hussein is harboring terrorists and the instruments of terror, the instruments of mass death and destruction. And he cannot be trusted. The risk is simply too great that he will use them, or provide them to a terror network.\n\nTerror cells, and outlaw regimes building weapons of mass destruction, are different faces of the same evil. Our security requires that we confront both. And the United States military is capable of confronting both.\n\nMany people have asked how close Saddam Hussein is to developing a nuclear weapon. We don't know exactly, and that is the problem. Before the Gulf War, the best intelligence indicated that Iraq was eight to 10 years away from developing a nuclear weapon; after the war, international inspectors learned that the regime had been much closer. The regime in Iraq would likely have possessed a nuclear weapon no later than 1993.\n\nThe inspectors discovered that Iraq had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a workable nuclear weapon, and was pursuing several different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb.\n\nBefore being barred from Iraq in 1998, the International Atomic Energy Agency dismantled extensive nuclear weapons-related facilities, including three uranium-enrichment sites.\n\nThat same year, information from a high-ranking Iraqi nuclear engineer who had defected, revealed that despite his public promises, Saddam Hussein had ordered his nuclear program to continue. The evidence indicates that Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program.\n\nSaddam Hussein has held numerous meetings with Iraqi nuclear scientists, a group he calls his nuclear mujahedeen -- his nuclear holy warriors.\n\nSatellite photographs reveal that Iraq is rebuilding facilities at sites that have been part of its nuclear program in the past.\n\nIraq has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes and other equipment needed for gas centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons.\n\nIf the Iraqi regime is able to produce, buy, or steal an amount of highly-enriched uranium a little larger than a single softball, it could have a nuclear weapon in less than a year.\n\nAnd if we allow that to happen, a terrible line would be crossed. Saddam Hussein would be in a position to blackmail anyone who opposes his aggression. He would be in a position to dominate the Middle East. He would be in a position to threaten America. And Saddam Hussein would be in a position to pass nuclear technology to terrorists.\n\nSome citizens wonder: After 11 years of living with this problem, why do we need to confront it now?\n\nThere is a reason. We have experienced the horror of September 11. We have seen that those who hate America are willing to crash airplanes into buildings full of innocent people. Our enemies would be no less willing -- in fact they would be eager -- to use a biological, or chemical, or a nuclear weapon.\n\nKnowing these realities, America must not ignore the threat gathering against us. Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof -- the smoking gun -- that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud.\n\nAs President Kennedy said in October of 1962: Neither the United States of America nor the world community of nations can tolerate deliberate deception and offensive threats on the part of any nation, large or small. We no longer live in a world, he said, where only the actual firing of weapons represents a sufficient challenge to a nation's security to constitute maximum peril.\n\nUnderstanding the threats of our time, knowing the designs and deceptions of the Iraqi regime, we have every reason to assume the worst, and we have an urgent duty to prevent the worst from occurring.\n\nSome believe we can address this danger by simply resuming the old approach to inspections, and applying diplomatic and economic pressure. Yet this is precisely what the world has tried to do since 1991.\n\nThe U.N. inspections program was met with systematic deception. The Iraqi regime bugged hotel rooms and offices of inspectors to find where they were going next. They forged documents, destroyed evidence, and developed mobile weapons facilities to keep a step ahead of inspectors.\n\nEight so-called presidential palaces were declared off-limits to unfettered inspections. These sites actually encompass 12 square miles, with hundreds of structures, both above and below the ground, where sensitive materials could be hidden.\n\nThe world has also tried economic sanctions and watched Iraq use billions of dollars in illegal oil revenues to fund more weapons purchases, rather than providing for the needs of the Iraqi people.\n\nThe world has tried limited military strikes to destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities ... only to see them openly rebuilt, while the regime again denies they even exist.\n\nThe world has tried no-fly zones to keep Saddam from terrorizing his own people ... and in the last year alone, the Iraqi military has fired upon American and British pilots more than 750 times.\n\nAfter 11 years during which we have tried containment, sanctions, inspections, even selected military action, the end result is that Saddam Hussein still has chemical and biological weapons, and is increasing his capabilities to make more. And he is moving ever closer to developing a nuclear weapon.\n\nClearly, to actually work, any new inspections, sanctions, or enforcement mechanisms will have to be very different. America wants the U.N. to be an effective organization that helps to keep the peace. That is why we are urging the Security Council to adopt a new resolution setting out tough, immediate requirements.\n\nAmong those requirements, the Iraqi regime must reveal and destroy, under U.N. supervision, all existing weapons of mass destruction. To ensure that we learn the truth, the regime must allow witnesses to its illegal activities to be interviewed outside of the country.\n\nAnd these witnesses must be free to bring their families with them, so they are all beyond the reach of Saddam Hussein's terror and murder.\n\nAnd inspectors must have access to any site, at any time, without pre-clearance, without delay, without exceptions.\n\nThe time for denying, deceiving, and delaying has come to an end. Saddam Hussein must disarm himself -- or, for the sake of peace, we will lead a coalition to disarm him.\n\nMany nations are joining us in insisting that Saddam Hussein's regime be held accountable. They are committed to defending the international security that protects the lives of both our citizens and theirs.\n\nAnd that is why America is challenging all nations to take the resolutions of the U.N. Security Council seriously. Those resolutions are very clear. In addition to declaring and destroying all of its weapons of mass destruction, Iraq must end its support for terrorism. It must cease the persecution of its civilian population. It must stop all illicit trade outside the oil-for-food program. And it must release or account for all Gulf War personnel, including an American pilot, whose fate is still unknown.\n\nBy taking these steps, and only by taking these steps, the Iraqi regime has an opportunity to avoid conflict. These steps would also change the nature of the Iraqi regime itself. America hopes the regime will make that choice.\n\nUnfortunately, at least so far, we have little reason to expect it. This is why two administrations -- mine and President Clinton's -- have stated that regime change in Iraq is the only certain means of removing a great danger to our nation.\n\nI hope this will not require military action, but it may. And military conflict could be difficult. An Iraqi regime faced with its own demise may attempt cruel and desperate measures. If Saddam Hussein orders such measures, his generals would be well advised to refuse those orders. If they do not refuse, they must understand that all war criminals will be pursued and punished.\n\nIf we have to act, we will take every precaution that is possible. We will plan carefully, we will act with the full power of the United States military, we will act with allies at our side, and we will prevail.\n\nThere is no easy or risk-free course of action. Some have argued we should wait -- and that is an option. In my view, it is the riskiest of all options -- because the longer we wait, the stronger and bolder Saddam Hussein will become. We could wait and hope that Saddam does not give weapons to terrorists, or develop a nuclear weapon to blackmail the world. But I am convinced that is a hope against all evidence.\n\nAs Americans, we want peace -- we work and sacrifice for peace -- and there can be no peace if our security depends on the will and whims of a ruthless and aggressive dictator. I am not willing to stake one American life on trusting Saddam Hussein.\n\nFailure to act would embolden other tyrants; allow terrorists access to new weapons and new resources; and make blackmail a permanent feature of world events.\n\nThe United Nations would betray the purpose of its founding, and prove irrelevant to the problems of our time. And through its inaction, the United States would resign itself to a future of fear.\n\nThat is not the America I know. That is not the America I serve. We refuse to live in fear. This nation -- in world war and in Cold War -- has never permitted the brutal and lawless to set history's course.\n\nNow, as before, we will secure our nation, protect our freedom, and help others to find freedom of their own. Some worry that a change of leadership in Iraq could create instability and make the situation worse. The situation could hardly get worse, for world security, and for the people of Iraq.\n\nhe lives of Iraqi citizens would improve dramatically if Saddam Hussein were no longer in power, just as the lives of Afghanistan's citizens improved after the Taliban.\n\nThe dictator of Iraq is a student of Stalin, using murder as a tool of terror and control within his own cabinet, and within his own army, and even within his own family.\n\nOn Saddam Hussein's orders, opponents have been decapitated, wives and mothers of political opponents have been systematically raped as a method of intimidation, and political prisoners have been forced to watch their own children being tortured.\n\nAmerica believes that all people are entitled to hope and human rights -- to the non-negotiable demands of human dignity.\n\nPeople everywhere prefer freedom to slavery; prosperity to squalor; self-government to the rule of terror and torture.\n\nAmerica is a friend to the people of Iraq. Our demands are directed only at the regime that enslaves them and threatens us. When these demands are met, the first and greatest benefit will come to Iraqi men, women, and children. The oppression of Kurds, Assyrians, Turkomans, Shi'a, Sunnis and others will be lifted. The long captivity of Iraq will end, and an era of new hope will begin.\n\nIraq is a land rich in culture, resources, and talent. Freed from the weight of oppression, Iraq's people will be able to share in the progress and prosperity of our time. If military action is necessary, the United States and our allies will help the Iraqi people rebuild their economy, and create the institutions of liberty in a unified Iraq at peace with its neighbors.\n\nLater this week the United States Congress will vote on this matter. I have asked Congress to authorize the use of America's military, if it proves necessary, to enforce U.N. Security Council demands. Approving this resolution does not mean that military action is imminent or unavoidable. The resolution will tell the United Nations, and all nations, that America speaks with one voice and is determined to make the demands of the civilized world mean something. Congress will also be sending a message to the dictator in Iraq: that his only choice is full compliance -- and the time remaining for that choice is limited.\n\nMembers of Congress are nearing an historic vote, and I am confident they will fully consider the facts and their duties.\n\nThe attacks of September 11 showed our country that vast oceans no longer protect us from danger. Before that tragic date, we had only hints of al Qaeda's plans and designs.\n\nToday in Iraq, we see a threat whose outlines are far more clearly defined -- and whose consequences could be far more deadly. Saddam Hussein's actions have put us on notice -- and there is no refuge from our responsibilities.\n\nWe did not ask for this present challenge, but we accept it. Like other generations of Americans, we will meet the responsibility of defending human liberty against violence and aggression. By our resolve, we will give strength to others. By our courage, we will give hope to others. By our actions, we will secure the peace, and lead the world to a better day.\n\nMay God bless America.
'Those at the top are not doing their part:' WH looks to raise taxes on wealthy
Story highlights The case was filed by a lumber company in Louisiana The frog spends most of its life living underground in burrows created by gopher tortoises\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday agreed to take up a case concerning the United States Fish and Wildlife Services designation of approximately 1,600 privately owned acres in Louisiana as a critical habitat for a species known as the dusky gopher frog, despite the fact the species currently exists only in Mississippi.\n\nThe case was filed by a lumber company in Louisiana that holds a long-term timber lease on the land that doesn't expire until 2043. Lawyers for the company say the tract of land concededly contains no dusky gopher frogs and cannot provide habitat for them absent a radical change in the land use because it lacks features necessary for their survival.\n\nThey say the service concluded that the designation could cost $34 million in lost development value of the tract.\n\nBut the government argued that if the frogs are translocated to the site in five ponds that are in close proximity to each other that adult frogs could potentially create a metapopulation.\n\nCollette Adkins of the Center for Biological Diversity, who argued in favor of the government's position in the lower courts, described the species is a warty, dark-colored frog with ridges on the sides of its back and when it is picked up it covers its eyes with its forefeet to protect its face until predators taste its bitter skin secretions.\n\nThe frog spends most of its life living underground in burrows created by gopher tortoises.\n\nThe frog experts have made clear that habitat in Louisiana needs to be protected if the frog is going to survive, she said, adding that the frog historically lived in Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi but there are currently only about 100 frogs alive in Mississippi due primarily to habitat loss.\n\nThe Fifth US Court of Appeals ruled against the landowners, holding that they had not established that the Fish and Wildlife Service interpreted the Endangered Species Act unreasonably when it found that the land in Louisiana was essential for the conservation of the dusky gopher frog.\n\nThe case is expected to be argued next term.
Sun flips magnetic field (CNN) -- The poles of the sun's powerful magnetic field have reversed, signaling a time of peak solar activity that could spell trouble for planet Earth, astronomers said this week. The sun's magnetic north and south poles were in their respective northern and southern hemisphere several months ago. Yet since then they have migrated to the opposite sides of the star. The bipolar flip did not take astronomers by surprise. It takes place like clockwork on the sun, once about every 11 years. This always happens around the time of solar maximum, NASA physicist David Hathaway said in a statement. The magnetic poles exchange takes place at the peak of the sunspot cycle. In fact, it's a good indication that Solar Max is really here. During Solar Max or solar maximum, the sun tends to exhibit more sunspots and eruptions, and jettison more solar flares, which send powerful streams of charged particles into the solar system. Solar blasts heading toward Earth can stoke up beautiful auroras in the nighttime sky, and wreak havoc on communications satellites and electrical power grids. Astronomers consider the current solar maximum more powerful than average, but less intense than the last two in 1989 and 1979. Earth's magnetic fields also change places but with much less predictability and frequency. The reversals take place between intervals lasting from 5,000 to 5 million years. The last one happened 740,000 years ago, scientists estimate. Some suggest the planet is overdue for another one.\n\nRELATED STORIES: Solar energy offers relief to power crisis\n\nFebruary 1, 2001\n\nAnother strong solar flare heads toward Earth\n\nJuly 14, 2000\n\nSolar shock wave causes surprise aurora display\n\nApril 7, 2000\n\nSOHO orbiting observatory dubbed history's 'most successful comet-hunter'\n\nFebruary 9, 2000\n\nFebruary 1, 2001July 14, 2000April 7, 2000February 9, 2000 RELATED SITES: The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory\n\nSOLARMAX\n\n\n\nNote: Pages will open in a new browser window External sites are not endorsed by CNN Interactive.\n\n\n\nSearch CNN.com CNNSI.com CNNmoney.com The Web
Do you want to have more money?\n\nSilly question, right? Who doesn't want some extra cash? The good news is, there are simple things you can do in just 20 minutes to avoid wasting your hard-earned dollars. Jump right in and get started to take advantage of the savings.\n\n1. Ask your credit card company for a reduced interest rate or an annual-fee waiver\n\nAre you paying an annual fee on your credit card, have you been charged fees for a late payment, or is your credit card interest rate too high? You may be able to fix these issues simply by asking.\n\nIn one study of almost 1,000 Americans conducted by CreditCards.com, 82% of cardholders were able to get their creditors to waive an annual fee or to reduce the amount of the fee. An even higher number of cardholders -- a full 87% -- were successful in getting a late fee waived. And close to two-thirds of cardholders were able to convince creditors to lower their rate with a simple request.\n\nCards with fees usually charge $25 to $500 annually, with an average fee of around $60, so saving that cash is well worth a quick call. Lowering your interest rate could save much more if you have a high balance.\n\n2. Cancel a service that isn't providing value\n\nAre you paying for a gym membership you aren't using, like around half of all gym members? You could save an average of $480 to $600 annually by calling to cancel. And gyms are just one of many things you may be paying for, even though you're not getting enough value to make costs worthwhile.\n\nCanceling cable and switching to a streaming service, like the new $40 offering from Hulu or the $20 Sling TV package, could save you hundreds of dollars. You could cancel an AAA membership if your car has roadside assistance, cancel paid music services like Sirius and use free alternatives, or drop a membership at Sam's Club or Costco if you're no longer buying in bulk.\n\nAlmost everyone is paying for at least some service they don't need -- you just need to find what your unnecessary expense is and call to cancel.\n\n3. Raise your insurance deductible (if you can cover it)\n\nYour homeowners insurance policy and your auto insurance have deductibles you must pay before the insurer covers your costs. If you have a $250 deductible and a $300 repair bill, you'd pay $250 and the insurer would pay $50.\n\nPolicies with lower deductibles cost more. Depending upon your situation, you may be able to raise deductibles on some or all of your policies.\n\nAnd the more you raise the deductible, the more money you keep in your pocket. Going from a $250 to $500 deductible on car insurance could save you 7% on premiums, while going from a $500 to $2,000 deductible could save you 16% on average.\n\nRaising your deductible is a good idea only if you have money to cover costs in an emergency. One option: Set aside money saved on premiums to pay your deductible if something goes wrong. Drivers nationwide paid average premiums of $1,325 in 2016, so if you pay the average, raise your deductible from $250 to $500, and save 7%, you'd pay $92.75 less each year for auto insurance. Put the $92.75 into savings, and you'll have $250 to cover the higher deductible in just 2 1/2 years. Drivers make claims around once every 17.9 years -- so there's a good chance you'll have time to save up and be able to pocket extra premium savings for many years to come.\n\n4. Optimize your home's energy efficiency\n\nIn the U.S., around half of all energy produced is wasted due to various inefficiencies. You probably have some inefficiencies in your own home that are costing you.\n\nYour water heater, for example, may be set at the 140 degrees Fahrenheit manufacturers generally default to, while the U.S. Department of Energy suggests most residential homeowners should set their temp to 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Lowering the temperature can prevent scalding, slow the mineral buildup that causes corrosion, and save you between 4% and 22% on energy each year -- and it's as simple as turning down the thermostat.\n\nHere are a few other ways to optimize your home to stop wasting money on utilities:\n\nTurn off heated dry on your dishwasher and let the dishes air-dry.\n\nClose vents in rooms that are not being used.\n\nChange your light bulbs to CFLs (compact fluorescent lights).\n\nProgram your thermostat to use less heat and air conditioning when you're at work or sleeping.\n\nUnplug devices like laptops, coffee makers, and cellphones when not in use, as these phantom power users continue drawing electricity while plugged in, costing average households around $200 annually.\n\n5. Optimize your car\n\nOnce you've cut energy costs at home, take your optimization project on the road to reduce what you spend on gas. Lowering fuel costs is a simple process:\n\nInflate your tires to the manufacturer's recommended level.\n\nClean out vehicle air filters every 30,000 to 40,000 miles.\n\nRemove heavy items you're transporting but don't need, including items on roof racks.\n\nInflating tires to the optimum pressure is not only safer, but could also improve gas mileage by an average of 0.6% and as much as 3%. A cleaner air filter could result in a 10% improvement in gas mileage, and help protect your engine. And you'd be surprised how much extra cargo can cost you -- in testing by Consumer Reports, bikes being carried on a roof rack caused fuel economy to fall by more than a third.\n\nRelated links:\n\n• Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy Alert\n\n• This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997\n\n• 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market\n\nYes, gas prices are cheap now -- but that's no reason to waste fuel or money. Like all the activities on this list, optimizing your car takes 20 minutes or less, and the payoff over time could be big.
(CNN) The House of Representatives and the Senate will convene in a joint session of Congress on Wednesday to count the Electoral College votes from the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe vote count on Capitol Hill typically unfolds as a routine formality, but this year a number of Republican lawmakers plan to object to the results from multiple states, triggering what is expected to be contentious debate and votes over whether to reject any objection.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has made false claims of a rigged election and pressured GOP lawmakers to fight back, but there's no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, and the expected objections on Wednesday will not change the overall outcome -- though the process will delay the final affirmation of Joe Biden's presidential victory.\n\nBoth chambers of Congress would have to vote in support of any objection in order for it to succeed and House Democrats, who control the majority in that chamber, will reject any objections, while a number of Republican senators have also said they will oppose objections.\n\nHere's what you need to know about how to watch CNN's coverage:\n\nRead More

The opinions expressed in this commentary are the author's own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) As impeachment comes to a close with the acquittal of President Donald J. Trump, it's fair to ask why Democratic leadership went down this route and what, if anything, they accomplished.\n\nThe answer to the first question is simple enough -- to hold the President accountable for a phone call with the Ukrainian President, in which he made US military aid contingent on investigations into a political rival. But impeachment is not the only tool at Congress' disposal to hold a president accountable. They could have, for example, chosen censure -- which would have been a serious rebuke of Trump's action and might have even garnered some bipartisan support. And yet Democrats opted to pursue impeachment anyway.\n\nDouglas Heye\n\nIn terms of what Democrats actually accomplished, it appears not all that much.\n\nThroughout this process, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats sought the moral high ground, they lost sight of two important realities. First, the impeachment process is a political, not legal, process. In other words, the impeachment trial was not a criminal trial, and if Republican politics favored not bringing forth witnesses and new evidence, then no new witnesses or evidence would be brought. (Of course, had the House slowed the impeachment proceedings down, they could have called upon and subpoenaed additional witnesses.)\n\nAnd, second, Trump would use the outcome of the trial to his advantage -- just as he was able to do the Mueller report by framing it as an exoneration of any and all wrongdoing, despite the report merely saying no collusion could be proved. With a Senate acquittal, get ready for the Trump impeachment exoneration tour -- a tour that will likely only benefit his reelection prospects.
Swanee Hunt , former US ambassador to Austria, is founder of the Women and Public Policy Program at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and founder of Seismic Shift, an initiative dedicated to increasing the number of women in high political office. The views expressed are those of the author. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) On January 3, when members of the 117th Congress raise their hands and swear their oaths, a significant shift will take place. The number of Republican women in the House will more than double from 13 to at least 28 (two races are pending litigation) . For a party historically known as pale, male and stale, this increase is particularly meaningful.\n\nThe number of women on the other side of the aisle -- currently 88 -- has been growing for decades. The first milestone came in 1985, when there were only 12 Democratic women in the House. That year, the pro-choice mega-fundraiser EMILY's List (Early Money Is Like Yeast -- it makes the dough rise) was born, and the Democratic Party began a slow but steady transformation.\n\nThe recent influx of Democratic women into politics was spurred dramatically four years ago by a flagrant misogynist's defeat of one of the most competent presidential candidates in our history. The subsequent Women's March further fueled the surge. EMILY's List was deluged with women streaming through the cracks in the glass ceiling.\n\nAlmost 40% of the House Democrats were female. The gutsy candidates largely supported each other, but further advancing them were party leadership, funders and a legion of like-minded groups. The surge in the Democratic victories of well-funded female candidates was a wake-up call for Republicans that they had to diversify or die. What Dems did in that election cycle became a playbook for the GOP. Existing Republican political action groups, like Value in Electing Women (VIEW) and Winning for Women gained traction as never before.\n\nJUST WATCHED GOP women made electoral gains in the 2020 elections Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH GOP women made electoral gains in the 2020 elections 08:25\n\nWhat a transformation. Several years ago, a Republican changemaker complained to me that the party wasn't putting its thumb on the scale to help women overcome primary hurdles, such as the reluctance of conservative men to back them financially. (That complaint echoed research I had commissioned from a team of political and data scientists.) The lack of female candidates, in turn, exacerbated the exodus of women from the party. Even before Trump, insiders told me that Republican women voters were switching parties for ideological reasons like climate change, immigration reform and health care. In other words, this shift likely wouldn't abate if or when Trump was defeated -- although many women said they blamed the party for supporting him.\n\nIn 2020, with Trump controlling the party, boorish insults and all, and the polls predicting an enormous gender gap , the GOP had few options. They recruited women to run and funded their campaigns. When women voters left, women candidates ran -- and women won.\n\nSo here we are. This week, the House will have a record number of women -- at least 141 -- and the change isn't cosmetic. A number of the new GOP electeds are already emphasizing bipartisanship. Republican Nancy Mace of South Carolina told CNN's Dana Bash that this year's record turnout is a real referendum on Washington DC and a reminder to politicians on both sides of the aisle to find areas where they can work together. People are struggling. And she added that they need solutions.\n\nto avert it. How should the women of both parties approach this challenge as they take their seats in the House? Obviously, each has her own past and personality. But for starters, just be women. Break bread together -- regularly. Former Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulksi famously began a dinner tradition for her colleagues in the 1990s -- and friendships bloomed. Fast forward some 20 plus years. Senator Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, describe how when Gillibrand and her family vacationed in Alaska, Murkowski hosted a dinner party in her friend's honor and Murkowski's husband taught her sons to salmon fish. No wonder that when a government shutdown loomed in 2013, several of the women around that famous dining table came together\n\nAs women fill a quarter of the seats of Congress, the idea that they are more collaborative than men is becoming axiomatic. Hopefully the prophesy will be self-fulfilling, and a buttress to the shift in tone. Women are tired of the bickering, and they want to get stuff done, said Iowa's newly-elected Republican Ashley Hinson. At that same post-election Politico event, Patricia Russo, of the non-partisan Yale Campaign School, said, We're much more easily able to check our egos at the door for the greater good.\n\nResearch backs them up. In a 2016 study by the Center for American Women and Politics, a large majority of 83 Representatives used personal anecdotes to describe how they and their colleagues are more collaborative and results-oriented than men. With notable exceptions, the cross-party women-to-women partnerships have been impressive, especially given the stunning disparity (about four to one) between the Democratic and Republican percentages of women in the two parties. From that point of view, even as an ardent Democrat myself, I see the value of increasing the number of Republican women in the House. What I know is that women at the edge of a political spectrum have told me, in dozens of conversations, that they can often find common cause with women on the opposite edge.\n\nI'm not surprised. I'm accustomed to coaching — and being coached by —thousands of women leaders in war zones who are making life and death decisions every day. They have their fingers on the pulse of their communities. They know which young men have weapons under their mattresses. Ironically, as second-class citizens, they aren't as threatening as their male counterparts. And they don't get stuck on dissent at the expense of solutions. For all that we wring our hands, not knowing how to decrease the scourge of war, the result is a show-stopper: if women play a significant role forging a peace agreement, research shows it's three times likelier to last.\n\nToday, Americans are living in a political war zone. The good news is that our policymakers know how to bridge divides. The tragic news is that we aren't doing it. In the US or worldwide, the value of a diverse group of decision-makers can be dismissed as add women and stir. It's true -- their involvement isn't enough. But women are an essential ingredient for creating compromise.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.

Warlords refuse to have females on their teams he said, matter-of-factly, because they're afraid women will compromise.\n\nBingo.

It reveals an extreme idea that the White House was considering to deal with undocumented immigrants at the border.\n\n\n\nCNN has learned that President Trump personally pushed his ousted homeland security secretary to release undocumented migrants onto the streets of so-called sanctuary cities in order to target his political foes. A source tells CNN that Kirstjen Nielsen resisted that plan.\n\n\n\nCNN has also learned that top Trump adviser Stephen Miller had a big hand in pushing that plan. The Washington Post, which first reported this story, found that this idea came up more than once in six months.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, CNN's Dana Bash gets an exclusive interview with Vice President Mike Pence about the situation at the border and much more.\n\n\n\nBERMAN: He makes a pledge on family separations, which will be interesting to hear what he says on that.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, we're officially in the window where we could see the redacted Mueller report. It could be today, and it would make for a heck of a Friday news dump.\n\n\n\nAll of it can now be viewed through the new filter of the attorney general's stunning comments. He said he believes the Trump campaign was spied on by U.S. intelligence, though he didn't exactly tell us what he meant or provide evidence. President Trump, though, is rejoicing in that statement.\n\n\n\nAnd this morning we're hearing from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who oversaw the Mueller probe. How does he explain William Barr's words and choices?\n\n\n\nLet's begin our coverage, though, with CNN's Boris Sanchez, live at the White House, Boris, with what appears to be an effort to use law enforcement, not to mention human beings as a form of political retribution.\n\n\n\nBORIS SANCHEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, good morning, John.\n\n\n\nFor years, President Trump has railed against the country's immigration laws. But now, according to new reporting, it appears that the White House at least explored the possibility of using those immigration laws to punish the president's political enemies.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nSANCHEZ (voice-over): President Trump is no fan of sanctuary cities.\n\n\n\nTRUMP: My administration is launching a nationwide crackdown on sanctuary cities.\n\n\n\nSANCHEZ: And that's exactly where he wanted to send migrants detained at the southern border. A source tells CNN the White House pressured homeland security officials to release detained migrants into so- called sanctuary cities that limit cooperation with federal law enforcement to protect most immigrants from deportation.\n\n\n\nThe president himself pushed former DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to follow through on his plan, according to a source. Why? In part to retaliate against Democrats who opposed his border wall.\n\n\n\nBut Nielsen resisted, and the DHS legal team eventually produced analysis that killed the plan. The Washington Post reports House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's district in San Francisco was among those targeted. Pelosi firing back saying, quote, Using human beings, including little children, as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump embracing controversial comments from his attorney general, William Barr.\n\n\n\nWILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: I think spying did occur, yes. I think spying did occur.\n\n\n\nTRUMP: I think what he said was absolutely true. There was absolutely spying into my campaign. I'll go a step further. In my opinion, it was illegal spying, unprecedented spying.\n\n\n\nSANCHEZ: A counter-intelligence investigation into a Trump campaign staffer was launched legally through a warrant approved by a foreign intelligence surveillance court.\n\n\n\nNow, as Washington braces for Barr to release his redacted version of the Mueller report, outgoing Deputy Rod Rosenstein is defending Barr's four-page summary of the nearly 400-page report.\n\n\n\nRosenstein telling The Wall Street Journal, quote, He's being as forthcoming as he can, and so this notion that he's trying to mislead people, I think is just completely bizarre.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nSANCHEZ: According to reporting in the New York Times and The Washington Post, this sanctuary cities idea was first brought up last November around the time of the midterm elections in an email from a White House policy adviser to DHS attorneys. It was brought up again in February for ultimately being abandoned, John.\n\n\n\nBoris Sanchez for us at the White House. Yes, brought up at least to times.\n\n\n\nWant to bring in CNN senior political analyst John Avlon.\n\n\n\nAnd John, I want to read the lead from The Washington Post. Rachael Bade, one of the reporters, will be with us a little bit later, which is great to hear from her.\n\n\n\nCNN has matched the story, but The Post broke it. White House officials have tried to pressure U.S. immigration authorities to release detainees onto the streets of sanctuary cities to retaliate against President Trump's political adversaries, according to Department of Homeland Security officials and e-mail messages reviewed by The Washington Post.\n\n\n\nA, that's a heck of a lead. B, retaliate against political adversaries with human beings.\n\n\n\nAVLON: That is the fact of what is being being reported. It is completely insane. Do not accept this as the new normal or just another day in the Trump administration.\n\n\n\nThis is the latest and, in some ways, the most sinister bit of evidence that this president and his administration do not respect the rule of law. And they are being contained by professionals in agencies who try to tell them that their plans to release detainees on the streets of sanctuary cities, small and mid-sized, by the way, to punish their political enemies cannot be done.\n\n\n\n[06:05:11] And for that, they come under intense political pressure. This is deeply, deeply troubling if this is the instinct of the president and his political advisers to try to pull off kind of a domestic Mariel boatlift, to disrupt and undercut his perceived political opponents in America's cities and towns.\n\n\n\nBERMAN: You said they are being contained by other officials there. How does it color the view of what they tried to do, the fact that it didn't happen?\n\n\n\nAVLON: I think that is the cold comfort we can take is that we're living through a civic stress test. But the president's worst impulses, his most autocratic and, you know, vengeful impulses. And those of his senior aides on some of these issues are being contained by administration officials, some of whom are Trump appointees, some of whom are simply people who've dedicated their life to serving the people of the United States.\n\n\n\nBut the system is straining. And we've already seen a degree of retaliation or attempted retaliation against some of these people, particularly in the Office of Legal Counsel.\n\n\n\nSo that is what's troubling. The good news is the system is holding, and the president's worst impulses are being contained, but it is being strained every day by the occupant of the Oval Office.\n\n\n\nBERMAN: I will note that people are clearly leaking to The Post, to The Times, and to us about this about this, posting email messages about this. None have been sent by Stephen Miller, according to The Post, but his name is associated with this. He is thought to be behind some of these notions. And now, more powerful than ever on the issue of immigration.\n\n\n\nAVLON: He has been empowered by the president. He is trying to systematically purge, apparently, policy opponents inside the organization. Again, that word purge. Not one noticeably used in American politics for administrations' on staffers, but that's the degree of the ideological divide.\n\n\n\nThat's the degree of the impulse to say, Break the law on my behalf to punish my political enemies. These are not sentences we say very often in American history. It's happening right now on our watch.\n\n\n\nBERMAN: All right, John. We're going to talk much more about this coming up. Thank you very much.\n\n\n\nCAMEROTA: And meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence getting a first- hand look at the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border. CNN's Dana Bash spoke exclusively with the vice president about the Trump administration's plan for families at the border and much more.\n\n\n\nWatch this.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nDANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: CPB says that family unit apprehensions have increased nearly 375 percent. The spike is incredible. Can you explain how the administration that ran on making sure that this didn't happen let things get to this point?\n\n\n\nPENCE: Well, first, I think the president and I appreciate the fact that people around the country and even many people in the media are now beginning to recognize that we have a genuine crisis at our southern border.\n\n\n\nI heard about it again today here in Nogales. On Tuesday, 4,300 people came across our border illegally along the Southern border in its entirety. The vast majority of those people were families and unaccompanied minors, begin driven by human traffickers and drug cartels that are exploiting these vulnerable families, and they're exploiting loopholes in our laws.\n\n\n\nBASH: We have information that the president has been talking about reinstating the zero tolerance policy. Can you vow, standing here at the border, that family separation will never be reinstated?\n\n\n\nPENCE: The president made it very clear this week we're not rethinking bringing back family separation. But it's absolutely essential to end a humanitarian crisis that really threatens the security of the American people and is creating hardship on both sides of our border. Congress needs to act.\n\n\n\nBASH: The president tweeted last night the following: I think what the Democrats are doing with the border is TREASONOUS, all caps. Their open-border mindset is putting our country at risk. We'll not let that happen.\n\n\n\nI know you generally say that the president has his own style of talking, but to to use the word treason, which is supposed to be punished by death, how do you get from that rhetoric to the kind of working across the aisle that you're talking about that's needed to fix things here?\n\n\n\nPENCE: I think what you hear the president expressing is the frustration of the American people. That last month alone, more than 100,000 people came across our southern border illegally.\n\n\n\nBASH: I just have to ask you about the mayor of South Bend, Pete Buttigieg. He said, I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand that, if you've got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.\n\n\n\nWhat he's saying is he didn't choose to be gay. His creator did. What's your response to that?\n\n\n\nPENCE: You know, I've known Mayor Pete for many years. We worked very closely together when I was governor. And I considered him a friend.\n\n\n\nAnd he knows I don't have a problem with him. I -- I don't believe in discrimination against anybody. I treat everybody the way that I want to be treated.\n\n\n\n[06:10:13] BASH: Do you agree with him that God made him gay?\n\n\n\nPENCE: Well, look, the truth of the matter is that all of us have our own religious convictions. Pete has his convictions. I have mine.\n\n\n\nBASH: Right. Well, he argues that your quarrel is with him as a gay man and that he says, I was born with way, and this is the way God made me. That's just not your belief?\n\n\n\nPENCE: Well, I think -- I think Pete's quarrel is with the First Amendment.\n\n\n\nBASH: How so?\n\n\n\nPENCE: All of us in this country have the -- the right to our religious beliefs. I'm a Bible believing Christian.\n\n\n\nBASH: Julian Assange. I want to ask you about something that Mike Pompeo, when he was the CIA director, said. He called WikiLeaks a non-state house (ph) intelligence service, often abetted by state actors like Russia. Do you agree with that characterization?\n\n\n\nPENCE: Yes, we strongly agree with that. That's why the Justice Department is now seeking extradition. And we're going to bring Julian Assange to justice.\n\n\n\nLook, we're working with Chelsea Manning. Julian Assange was involved in one of the greatest compromises of classified information in American history. It literally put American military personnel at risk, and we'll hold him to account in the American justice system.\n\n\n\nBASH: What about what he did in 2016? The president, when he was a candidate, welcomed seeing WikiLeaks and the information that they got from Hillary Clinton. Has that changed?\n\n\n\nPENCE: Well, I think the president always, as you in the media do, always welcomes information. That was in no way an endorsement.\n\n\n\nBASH: Even though (UNINTELLIGIBLE) said that?\n\n\n\nPENCE: An organization that we now understand was involved in disseminating classified information by the United States of America.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nBERMAN: All right. A lot more to discuss about Dana's exclusive interview with the vice president at the border coming up.\n\n\n\nThis morning, as you heard in that interview, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is behind bars in Britain, facing extradition to the United States for allegedly conspiring to hack into government computers to steal U.S. military secrets.\n\n\n\nWikiLeaks played a key role also, as you heard right there, in the release of DNC and Clinton campaign e-mails in 2016. Back then, President Trump said, I love WikiLeaks. Now he says he knows nothing about WikiLeaks.\n\n\n\nCNN's Nick Paton Walsh live in London with the very latest -- Nick.\n\n\n\nNICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: John, behind me, I think, in the Ecuadorian embassy, they're probably breathing a sigh of relief, maybe even cleaning up after their lengthy unwelcome house guest, even reports from Ecuadoran officials of feces on the walls at some point, damage to the building's infrastructure.\n\n\n\nBut what ahead now for Julian Assange, always a man not to be afraid of the spotlight? Ell, certainly, he has to face a sentencing hearing here in London in probably the next weeks ahead because of the bail he skipped out on here when he hid inside the embassy back in 2012.\n\n\n\nAnd then on May the 2nd, most likely after he's sentenced, he'll have an extradition hearing. That is to face this indictment in the United States, which specifies that he worked with Chelsea Manning to try and crack part of a password that would have enabled Chelsea Manning to masquerade as an administrator in a U.S. computer system during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, classified information here, so she could have downloaded that. Well, he at the time, Bradley Manning, could have downloaded that and then released it through WikiLeaks.\n\n\n\nBut Donald Trump here, President Trump very clear, and we often see this, on how he's very much more ignorant about WikiLeaks than he was simply a matter of years ago. Here's what he said.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTRUMP: WikiLeaks. I love WikiLeaks.\n\n\n\nThis WikiLeaks stuff is unbelievable. It tells you the inner heart. You've got to read it. It's been amazing what's coming out on WikiLeaks.\n\n\n\nThis WikiLeaks is fascinating.\n\n\n\nThis WikiLeaks is like a treasure trove.\n\n\n\nI know nothing about WikiLeaks. It's not my thing. I know nothing really about them. It's not my deal in life.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nWALSH: Now, it is the British court system, though, that will decide whether or not Julian Assange goes to the United States. That process could take months. Frankly, it may even be that whatever sentence he has to serve here in the U.K. for violating that bail is, in fact, expended while he's waiting to learn his extradition fate.\n\n\n\nAnd then it's possible in the United States he will face further charges. Now, there will be intense political debate here. His pretty substantial defense team already using the open court system to make a very clear case that he's a journalist who published information who's being persecuted. The indictment says he conspired to commit a criminal act. It will be up to U.K. judges to decide his fate -- Alisyn.\n\n\n\nCAMEROTA: OK, Nick Paton Walsh, thank you very much for all of that reporting.\n\n\n\nLet's bring in CNN legal analyst Carrie Cordero. She is the former counsel to U.S. assistant attorney general.\n\n\n\nCarrie, great to see you. So yesterday, as John and I were watching this arrest unfold on our air, I kept wondering why that day, why yesterday, after seven years, you know, of him being holed up in that embassy?\n\n\n\n[06:15:06] And I think that we've gotten the answer, which is there was this ticking statute of limitations. I was surprised to hear there is an eight-year statute of limitations for at least one of his charges. And so it sounds like -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- is that why they had to move with alacrity?\n\n\n\nCARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: I think it certainly was a factor. And I think it's important to keep in mind that this case against him and the investigations involving him and the process of extradition, this would have been work that was done behind the scenes by law enforcement and prosecutors and diplomats from the U.S., the U.K. and Ecuador, which was housing him for some time.\n\n\n\nAnd so I think it was a confluence, perhaps, where you had the statute of limitations. The legal process had been under seal. The indictment had been under seal in the Eastern District of Virginia for some time. And then we needed the other factor -- U.S. Law enforcement needed the other factor in play, which was the government of Ecuador finally making the decision to release him to U.K. authorities. CAMEROTA: Yes, and it sounds like their patience really ran out with him. I mean, certainly, we hear Nick Paton Walsh's reporting about the conditions that he was living in.\n\n\n\nLet me read to you the indictment, because I think that it's interesting what we found out that he's being accused of. On or about March 8, 2010, Assange agreed to assist Chelsea Manning in cracking a password stored on United States Department of Defense computers connected to the Secret Internet Protocol Network, a United States government network, used for classified documents and communications.\n\n\n\nSo that is different, right? That's different than just publishing classified documents. That is taking an active role in getting them.\n\n\n\nCORDERO: Exactly right, Alisyn. So the passage that you just put up, that's really the crux of this particular indictment and charge against him.\n\n\n\nJulian Assange is not being charged with publishing classified information. I'll say it again. He's not being charged with publishing classified information. What he's being charged with is being an active participant in a conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse.\n\n\n\nIn other words, he did a specific thing to try to assist Chelsea Manning to crack a password to get unauthorized access into Department of Defense procedures. And so what the Justice Department is going to argue is that is not traditional journalist behavior.\n\n\n\nCAMEROTA: Indeed. Carrie Cordero, thank you very much for all of the legal expertise -- John.\n\n\n\nCORDERO: Thanks.\n\n\n\nBERMAN: Just saying, I prefer posters as wall hangings. Just letting that out there.\n\n\n\nCAMEROTA: That's good. That is more traditional.\n\n\n\nBERMAN: Posters more traditional, to be sure.\n\n\n\nWhat a swirl of controversy surrounding attorney Michael Avenatti this morning. He is fighting back against a new string of new charges. The former lawyer for Stormy Daniels was indicted on 36 counts, including embezzlement prosecutors claim was part of a scheme to steal tens of millions of dollars from his clients.\n\n\n\nOur Sara Sidner live in Los Angeles with the details here. And this is a big, big list of indictments.\n\n\n\nSARA SIDNER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It is. Thirty-six counts, including embezzlement, wire fraud, tax fraud, bank fraud, bankruptcy fraud here. The U.S. attorney for the Central District of California coming out very strongly, condemning the things that he's accused Michael Avenatti of. And one of the things in this case that was stunning to a lot of\n\n\n\npeople as they listened to it were the five people that the prosecutors say Michael defrauded. Five of them were clients of his, they say, who were defrauded of millions of dollars, including a paraplegic client, a client who had won a $4 million settlement that prosecutors say Michael Avenatti took, put into a trust account, as you are supposed to do for your clients, but then drained that trust account of more than $3.5 million, only giving the client somewhere around $125,000, telling him that the full settlement hadn't come in when he had already spent the money.\n\n\n\nHere's a little bit more of what prosecutors had to say.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nNICK HANNA, U.S. ATTORNEY: As it turns out, within months after receiving the settlement proceeds in early 2015, Mr. Avenatti had drained the entire $4 million payment from his trust account, using significant portions of the funds to finance his coffee business, his auto racing enterprise and his own personal lifestyle.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSIDNER: Now, Michael has shot back, saying that he's not guilty of any of the charges against him, and he claims that any moneys owed due to his clients are bogus.\n\n\n\nBut we should mention that, with all of these charges -- and that's just in this case here in California -- that he faces up to 335 -- 335 years in prison. And that does not include the case that the SDNY has against him, which involves Nike, where they have said that he tried to extort Nike.\n\n\n\n[06:20:05] CAMEROTA: My gosh. Sara Sidner, thank you for explaining all of that and laying it out for us.\n\n\n\nAll right. He is not officially in the race yet. But Pete Buttigieg is surging in some new polls. We discuss those next.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBERMAN: All right. New this morning, major movement in the Democratic race for president. Truly from nowhere in the polls, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg appears to be breaking out in two early voting states. Look at these numbers from Iowa and New Hampshire. Pete Buttigieg has launched himself into third place behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, and ahead of some pretty big names.\n\n\n\nJoining us now to discuss, Howard Dean, former presidential candidate, governor of Vermont; Laura Barron-Lopez, national political reporter for Politico; and Joe Lockhart. He is the former White House press secretary for President Clinton and hosts the Words Matter podcast.\n\n\n\nCongratulations on that, Mr. Lockhart.\n\n\n\nGovernor Dean, I want to start with you. And I know it's early. So let's stipulate --\n\n\n\nHOWARD DEAN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's early.\n\n\n\nBERMAN: Polls change.\n\n\n\nDEAN: Really early.\n\n\n\nBERMAN: You know that.\n\n\n\nBut Pete Buttigieg was the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, at zero or minus in the polls to months ago. And now he's ahead of people who have been in the Senate. He's ahead of people who live next door to New Hampshire. There is clearly something happening with this South Bend mayor.\n\n\n\nDEAN: Our core base is young people, people of color and women. And Pete Buttigieg is incredibly attractive to young people.\n\n\n\n[06:25:05] I was supporting him for the Democratic National Committee chairmanship, because that's our core base. And he has gotten his message out there, partly on CNN town meetings and things like that. People like him a lot. I'm shocked at the number of people who come up to me and say, What do you think of this guy?\n\n\n\nAnd I demur, because I have to stay neutral, because I'm running the data project. And they say, Well, I sent him some money.\n\n\n\nYou did? These are people my age. So this is real. He's basically, I think, assured him, as barring some scandal or something, that he's going to be in the first cut.\n\n\n\nCAMEROTA: So Joe, strategically, what has Mayor Pete Buttigieg done better than other people? Why has he leapfrogged?\n\n\n\nJOE LOCKHART, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I agree that it's early. And I think that you've seen several of these candidates get a little bit of a bump around the time of their announcement. It's always the anticipation. Kamala Harris did, certainly. And then settled back down.\n\n\n\nCAMEROTA: And is that what you think is happening here?\n\n\n\nLOCKHART: I actually think it's a little bit more. I think -- I agree with Governor Dean that he touches constituencies he is, in some ways, touches all of the elements.\n\n\n\nIf you look at Iowa and New Hampshire, the votes he's taking from are from Beto supporters but more than anyone, Bernie Sanders supporters, which was surprising when I looked at the numbers yesterday.\n\n\n\nAnd I think what that's about is people tend to look at, like, Sanders as Democrats want an ultra-progressive, a Democratic socialist. I don't think that's it at all. I think the Democratic constituency's much more in the middle.\n\n\n\nI think it's -- I think it's people rebelling against incremental politics, the politics that I think Hillary talked about. We've got to go slow, we've got to make change.\n\n\n\nAnd what Buttigieg is doing here is tapping into this idea that we can think big, Obama-like; we can change the system. We don't have to do it incrementally. And he's doing it in a language that young people understand, and they feel an affinity.\n\n\n\nSo I think the bottom line is I don't know who's going to win. But he's now in, you know, the first tier or 1-B tier and will have to be taken seriously.\n\n\n\nBERMAN: And he's getting some help, maybe, we could put it, from Mike Pence, the vice president of the United States?\n\n\n\nCAMEROTA: Well, he's getting some help from picking a fight with Mike Pence, I would say.\n\n\n\nBERMAN: You know, it's interesting. Because Buttigieg's entry into exploring the race did not, you know, circle around Mike Pence. It was not talking about his own sexuality that much. It really wasn't. It was I'm a Midwest governor. I know how to win in a Trump state. That was his main focus.\n\n\n\nBut day by day, Laura, he does talk more about the fact that he's married, which is something that Mike Pence opposed in his state. And I want to play for you what Pete Buttigieg just told Ellen DeGeneres on a clip that's going to air today.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBUTTIGIEG: I'm not interested in feuding with the vice president. But if he wanted to clear this out, he could come out today and say he's changed his mind, that it shouldn't be legal to discriminate against anybody in this country for who they are. That's all.\n\n\n\nELLEN DEGENERES, TALK SHOW HOST: Yes.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBERMAN: It's interesting. You heard in the interview with Dana Bash, Laura, that the vice president would not say he believes that people are born gay.\n\n\n\nLAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, POLITICO: Right. I think that even though Pete Buttigieg hasn't made this debate with Pence a central part of his campaign, it definitely helps him. I mean, any time that a Democratic candidate can be seen at odds with either the president or with the vice president, it boosts them. And that could be, also, part of why he's surging in the polls.\n\n\n\nAnd again, I think that Buttigieg is really getting attention because of how young he is, because of his policy ideas, as we mentioned earlier.\n\n\n\nBut it's so early that in a month, we could see this drastically change. We could see Warren or Harris be third. And I think that if anyone -- if we pretend to know what is going to happen nine months out, we'll be shocked when -- when the first contest happens.\n\n\n\nCAMEROTA: That's for sure. Understood. Today is just a snapshot of where we are today. It's nothing more. It's not predictive.\n\n\n\nHowever, given that, Governor, where is Beto O'Rourke? After all the excitement and the splash of the Vanity Fair cover, why isn't he in those two states in the top?\n\n\n\nDEAN: Well, he's doing pretty well. But you know, this is a hard, long process. There's two ways of doing this.\n\n\n\nOne is to raise a lot of money, and the other is to be on the ground and set up a great network. He's not going to have any trouble setting up a network, and he's raised a lot of money. The problem is the expectations for -- for Beto were much higher than they were for Pete Buttigieg.\n\n\n\nBut Beto raised $83 million for a Senate race in Texas. Buttigieg, nobody ever heard of. But he's got momentum., and you guys are giving that momentum. I got that ride up, and of course, I got the ride down once I was the frontrunner.\n\n\n\nCAMEROTA: It's a round trip ride we give you.\n\n\n\nBERMAN: Exactly.\n\n\n\nDEAN: Let me say something quickly. Joe is absolutely right, and nobody is talking about this in the media. This party is not moving to the left. All you guys are focusing on, Ocasio and Rashida Tlaib and so forth and so on.\n\n\n\nWe won 40 seats.
Trump to Apple: 'Make your product in the United States'\n\n(CNN Business) —\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Friday he wasn't concerned about Apple's future and again encouraged CEO Tim Cook to move his supply chain to the United States.\n\nHis comments came after the company warned investors this week that its earnings will be badly weakened by a sales slowdown brought on in part by Trump's trade war with China. Apple's (APPL) announcement rattled investors and global markets.\n\nApple makes their product in China. I told Tim Cook, who's a friend of mine … 'Make your products in the United States,' Trump said. China is the biggest beneficiary of Apple — not us.\n\nMy focus is the United States. I want to get those companies to come back, he added. I want Apple to make their iPhones and all of the great things that they make in the United States.\n\nThe iPhone is produced through a complex, global supply chain. Moving it out of China would be extremely difficult and highly unlikely.\n\nMan could be on Mars before Apple is producing more of its iPhones in the United States, just from a supply chain cost perspective, Dan Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush, told CNN Business.\n\nEven if it could be done, costlier American labor and production facilities would seriously jack up the iPhone's cost.\n\nApple buys parts from companies all over the world before shipping them to China, where most iPhones are assembled by Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn.\n\nMemory chips come from Japan's Toshiba, sensors from Germany's Bosch and display modules from Samsung in South Korea. And a number of key components also come from American companies.\n\nApple has maintained that the bulk of the research and design for the iPhone and other devices is done in the United States. But Cook has said that the country lacks the skilled labor needed to manufacture those products.\n\nThe company did not respond Friday to a request for comment from CNN Business.\n\nThe bombshell Apple dropped about its upcoming earnings report has implications far beyond just the one company.\n\nIves, the Wedbush analyst, said that even though he thinks most of Apple's issues are self-inflicted, the quicker and the smoother the US-China talks get settled is good not just for Apple, but for the broader stock market.\n\nApple is a barometer for US tech stocks, Ives said.\n\nKevin Hassett, a top economic adviser to the president, acknowledged Thursday that the trade war is damaging US businesses that have interests in China — and a heck of a lot of US companies will have the same problem as Apple unless a deal is struck to lift tariffs.\n\nHe said he thinks the economic repercussions of those downgraded earnings puts a lot of pressure on China to make a deal.\n\nTrump on Friday made the case that the trade standoff has been a boon for the United States because the Treasury Department has collected tens of billions of dollars worth of tariffs.\n\nHe also said that China is not doing well now, and it puts us in a very strong position.\n\nTrump and Chinese President Xi Jinping reached a tentative trade truce late last year. Talks to try to hammer out a comprehensive deal are schedule for next week.\n\n— CNN Business' Sherisse Pham contributed to this report.
Smart savers work hard to keep the taxman at bay as long as possible. But there's only so much you can do to put off having to pay some taxes. Eventually, the IRS wants its cut -- and it's best either to be prepared for the consequences or to take steps early on to avoid the problem in the first place.\n\nMillions of Americans have tax time bombs lurking among their assets. Often, it's a smart strategy to put these investments to good use, as long as you don't forget about their potential downsides.\n\nHere are three of the most common tax time bombs that you'll find and what you can do to keep them from doing irreparable damage to your finances.\n\n1. Traditional IRAs and qualified retirement plan accounts\n\nPerhaps the largest ticking time bomb from a tax perspective comes from the money that Americans have in IRAs, 401(k) plans, and other qualified retirement plans. 401(k)s have about $5.3 trillion in assets, according to the Investment Company Institute, and total retirement assets amount to $27.2 trillion. That second number includes annuities and traditional pensions, and both figures consist of both traditional and Roth-style IRAs and 401(k) plans. Nevertheless, it's fair to assume that there's somewhere between $10 trillion and $20 trillion in pre-tax assets held in retirement plans.\n\nThe problem with traditional IRAs, 401(k)s, and similar retirement accounts is that when you withdraw money from them, you have to pay income tax on what you pull out, and that reduces the size of your effective after-tax nest egg.\n\nEven if you don't want to withdraw your pre-tax retirement money, these accounts are almost universally subject to required minimum distribution rules that kick in at age 70 1/2. Once you reach that age, you have no choice: You must start withdrawing a portion of your account and paying taxes on it.\n\nWhat's more, the withdrawals you have to include in taxable income can subject other sources of income to tax. The most common example is Social Security, where benefits become taxable if your outside income lifts you over certain threshold amounts.\n\nOne solution is to make greater use of Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k) plan options. Roth accounts let you save after-tax money, with distributions being tax-free in retirement. Not all employers offer Roth 401(k)s, but conversions of existing traditional retirement assets to Roths are generally available.\n\n2. Savings bonds\n\nMany people own savings bonds without even knowing it. As popular gifts from older generations to children, savings bonds differ from most bonds in that they accumulate interest on a tax-deferred basis. You don't have to pay taxes on the income that they generate each year.\n\nThe price you'll pay, though, is that you have to pay tax when you cash in your bonds. Because currently issued savings bonds stop earning interest after 30 years, you either have to cash them in and suffer the tax consequences or allow them to sit without earning any interest at all after their final maturity date.\n\nFortunately, one solution is to take the money from maturing bonds and transfer it into a 529 college savings plan account. Doing so lets you exclude the accumulated interest from taxation. Otherwise, you'll have to pay tax on the entire increase in value from what you paid for the bond and what you received when you cashed it in.\n\n3. Your home\n\nFinally, your personal residence can be a ticking tax time bomb. Most homeowners get the benefit of one of the most lucrative tax breaks on the books: the capital gains exclusion of up to $250,000 for singles or $500,000 for joint filers. What that means is that if a couple saw their home rise in value from $300,000 to $800,000 over their lifetimes, they can sell it and pay no tax at all.\n\nSo how is this a tax trap? The potential problem is that the exclusion is available only for property that's been used as your principal residence during at least two of the five years preceding the sale. There are special rules that reduce that requirement to just one year if you need to leave your home for long-term care in a nursing home or other institution, but failing to meet the requirement can eliminate the exclusion entirely. Moreover, if you decide to change the nature of the home to a nonqualified use -- such as renting it out -- then capital gain that's attributed to the period of nonqualified use can be taxable.\n\nThe solution is to sell your home long before there's any danger of losing the personal residence exclusion. Otherwise, you could turn the most profitable investment of your life into a major tax hassle.\n\nRelated links:\n\n• Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy Alert\n\n• This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997\n\n• 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market\n\nBe tax smart\n\nUsing these strategies wisely can save you huge amounts of tax. Yet by being aware that they can cause unintended problems if you're not careful, you'll be able to take full advantage of these strategies while avoiding the downsides.
Indian film star Rajinikanth gestures as he announces his entry in politics during an interaction session with fans in Chennai on December 31, 2017.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nIndian movie icon Rajinikanth, an actor synonymous with South Indian cinema and star of more than 150 movies, is set to enter politics.\n\nSpeaking on Sunday in the southern city of Chennai, the 67-year-old star dubbed Thalaivar (The Leader) told fans, I am entering politics and we will contest all seats in the next assembly elections.\n\nHe added he would form his own political party.\n\nSeveral of his colleagues from the Indian film industry took to Twitter to congratulate him, including Bollywood heavyweight Amitabh Bachchan who wrote, My dear friend, my colleague and a humble considerate human, RAJNIKANTH, announces his decision to enter politics…my best wishes to him for his success!\n\nSpeculation has been mounting in recent months over when the Tamil film superstar, known for his over the top action sequences and unique dance moves, would make his political debut.\n\nPreviously, he has only been affiliated with political parties in southern Tamil Nadu state.\n\nPHOTO: ARUN SANKAR/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Indian fans of Rajinikanth celebrate after his announcement that he will enter into politics, in Chennai on December 31, 2017.\n\nPolitical instability\n\nTamil Nadu has been mired in political uncertainty since the death of the former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa Jayaram, also a one time film star, in December 2016.\n\nHer death eventually led to a split in her party, the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party (AIADMK).\n\nAddressing his fans, Rajinikanth said, Democracy is in a bad shape right now. All the other states have been making fun of us (Tamil Nadu). I will feel guilty if I don't take this decision now.\n\nIn the name of democracy, politicians are robbing us of our own money in our own land. We need to bring a change from the base…The system has to change. Democracy has been corrupted and needs to be cleansed.\n\nAccording to CNN affiliate CNN News 18, sources close to Rajinikanth have said the superstar may announce the name of his political party and its strategy on January 14, the start of Pongal, an Indian harvest festival.\n\nTruth, work and growth will be the three mantras of our party, added Rajinikanth.\n\nIn 2008, when responding to a fan's question about entering politics, the actor said it would be foolish to think that one is successful in politics due to sheer capability, experience and hard work. It is all a question of time and circumstances. If the time is not right, nothing can help.\n\nPHOTO: ARUN SANKAR/AFP/AFP/Getty Images An Indian fan pours milk on a hoarding of Indian movie star, Rajinikanth, ahead of the release of his Tamil movie 'Kabali' in Chennai on July 21, 2016.\n\nReligious adoration\n\nBorn Shivaji Rao Gaekwad, Rajinikanth had previously worked as a bus conductor in the city of Bangalore before finding fame as an actor in the 1975 movie Apoorva Raagangal.\n\nHe has since starred in some of the country's highest grossing movies across four decades, drawing recognition for his inimitable style and larger than life personality.\n\nThough he has worked primarily in Tamil cinema, his fan base is spread across India, where he is among the country's most popular icons. The level of adoration among his fans is often said to rival that of a religious figure.\n\nSomeone told Rajinikanth, Hey, give us a party this new year.\n\nAnd see what happened. — Ramesh Srivats (@rameshsrivats) December 31, 2017\n\nBefore the release of his most recent movie, 2016's Kabali, his fans poured milk on cardboard images of the actor, an act of veneration usually reserved for Hindu deities.\n\nRajinikanth is today believed to be among Asia's highest paid actors, rivaling leading men such as Jackie Chan and Shah Rukh Khan in box office pulling power.\n\nTamil Nadu's actor-politicians\n\nRajinikanth is not the only Tamil superstar to enter into politics in recent months.\n\nIn November, actor Kamal Haasan announced he too would launch his own party.\n\nThe popularity of both men cuts across social and caste divides.\n\nIn the coming months, India's two main national parties, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the main opposition Congress, will be keen on forging alliances with both actors' respective parties.\n\nFollowing Rajinikanth's announcement, BJP General Secretary P. Muralidhar Rao tweeted, The suspense in politics of Tamil Nadu about Sh. @superstarrajini ji's future action is over! BJP has always welcomed persons with sincerity & commitment to join the politics so as to improve the governance and delivery to poor.\n\nIn a second tweet, he wrote, BJP can express its political opinion only when we come to know about Sh. @superstarrajini ji's party's policies and programs.\n\nMeanwhile, Khusboo Sundar, an actress and National Spokesperson for the Congress party, tweeted, We know that Mr Rajnikanth believes in inclusive democracy and development. We wish him the all the best in his endeavours.. @INCIndia @INCTamilNadu\n\nThe next state elections in Tamil Nadu are due to be held in 2021.
B/R\n\nCongratulations, whiners of the world. Your voices have been heard.\n\nThe best possible matchup for the College Football Playoff National Championship has arrived, and you can't complain enough.\n\nYou're sick of Alabama and Clemson.\n\nYou're sick of Nick Saban's dominance and Dabo Swinney's syrupy Southern accent.\n\nYou're sick of the same ol', same ol' when the games matter most, even though this time around—the fourth straight game between the Crimson Tide and Tigers in the CFP, and the third national title game between the two—might just be the best in the modern era.\n\nWhat? Are we supposed to apologize for playing in this game again? Alabama defensive tackle Quinnen Williams asked.\n\nHe is told the world is tired of Alabama and Clemson sucking the drama out of the playoff. There's Tide-Tigers title game fatigue, you know.\n\nA smile creeps across Williams' face, and Alabama's brash All-American—the very guy who a week earlier in a viral video nearly acknowledged he wasn't so impressed with Oklahoma quarterback Kyler Murray before stopping mid-sentence because that's the last thing Saban wants to hear—just can't help himself.\n\nYeah, well, we ain't tired of being here, he said.\n\nVideo Play Button Videos you might like\n\nDeal with it, America.\n\nIt's not boring; it's beautiful. It's not inevitable; it's indisputable.\n\nThe two best teams in college football, with the two best rosters in college football, with the two best coaches in college football, with 14-0 records, playing for the whole damn thing.\n\nThat's not too much Alabama vs. Clemson. That's a dream matchup.\n\nIt's as good as any faceoff we can imagine: the Steph-KD Warriors vs. the Showtime Lakers or Brady's Patriots vs. the '85 Bears. It's Pep Guardiola's Barcelona vs. Zinedine Zidane's Real Madrid or, heaven help us, Michael vs. LeBron.\n\nStreeter Lecka/Getty Images\n\nI feel like [Alabama] is part of our schedule, Clemson defensive tackle Christian Wilkins said.\n\nAnd what—in this age of fans constantly asking, Who has your team played?—could be wrong with that?\n\nTwo of the three previous playoff games between the teams produced two of the best championship games since the beginning of the BCS era in 1998, when the sport first changed its postseason to get the best possible matchup in the national championship game.\n\nAlabama won the 2015 title despite a remarkable effort by Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson and only after Saban decided mid-game that his vaunted defense couldn't stop Watson and that he should risk an onside kick to change momentum.\n\nThen in the 2016 season, Watson delivered a performance for the ages, driving the Tigers 68 yards in two minutes and completing the game-winning touchdown pass with one second to play. A series earlier, Alabama freshman quarterback Jalen Hurts engineered an unforgettable go-ahead drive that, but for Watson's heroics, would've been the stuff of legends.\n\nYet suddenly the nation is fatigued by all this thrilling history. Even last year's bland semifinal win by Alabama over Clemson can't stain what the Tide and Tigers have brought to the playoff.\n\nBrynn Anderson/Associated Press\n\nFast-forward to 2018, and there's a new dynamic: Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, the Heisman Trophy runner-up and the player who changed the way Saban thinks about offense taking on Clemson freshman quarterback Trevor Lawrence, the player who (like Tagovailoa) beat out a previous starter (Kelly Bryant) who had led his team to the CFP and one day could become the best NFL draft prospect ever.\n\nThat's right, ever.\n\nI don't think that's hyperbole at all, one NFL scout told Bleacher Report. With what he now knows, his physical ability at 19 years old, how he wants to be coached and wants to be great, his ceiling is limitless. He makes throws now that guys in our league can't make.\n\nBut go ahead and complain about Alabama vs. Clemson. You're bored with great and want intrigue or the unexpected or even an upset.\n\nThere won't be an upset. Alabama is favored to win its second straight national championship and fifth in eight years, but almost no one in the coaching fraternity will be shocked if Clemson beats the Tide again for its second national title in three seasons.\n\nClemson is as complete a team as you will see in college football, Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi said. That quarterback has changed everything.\n\nOr as one Power Five coach said: Everyone else thinks they can beat Alabama. Clemson has a lot of dudes on that team that know they can beat Alabama. That's a big deal. They can trade punches with Alabama on the lines of scrimmage, and they'll kill you with the skill guys.\n\nWho would want to watch that, Mr. Fatigue?\n\nForget about sagging ticket sales or the reality that this might be the first CFP National Championship to not sell out. According to TickPick.com, prices for tickets are down 65 percent from last season, and many tickets likely will go for less than face value. And maybe, just maybe, there will be empty seats at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California (that has more to do with geography than interest).\n\nYou're wasting oxygen focusing on that nonsense. Instead, bathe in the glory of a national title game that will feature two teams that rank in the top five in the nation in scoring offense, scoring defense, plays of 30 yards or more and sacks—basically every key stat in the book.\n\nBut here's the best thing about the same matchup over and over again: watching the best players over and over again.\n\nYears from now, we'll look back at this championship game and marvel at the sheer number of NFL players who played. It's not just the potential first-round picks (of which there will be many) but the mid-draft players who could make NFL rosters. Another NFL scout told Bleacher Report the combined figure might be as high as 30 to 40.\n\nGreat players win big games, LSU coach Ed Orgeron said. That's the easiest way to explain it.\n\nSo when you recruit and develop players better than anyone in college football, you're going to have the best players and you're going to play in a lot of big games. Alabama has won 55 of its last 58 games, Clemson 57 of 61. Take away their losses to each other, and each team has been defeated just twice over those spans.\n\nThis doesn't happen often in college football, especially in an era when big-money television deals have given every Power Five school an opportunity to build a winner. Instead of complaining about fatigue, maybe it's time to embrace a college football rarity: two monster programs peaking at the same time.\n\nIt's the two best teams for the last I-don't-know-how-many years. I would think that would make everyone want to turn on the TV, Alabama wideout Jerry Jeudy said. As a player, you want the best team possible on the other side of the ball. You want to prove yourself. They have a great program; we have a great program. It's the heavyweight title, and we're both coming out swinging.\n\nGerald Herbert/Associated Press\n\nIt's no coincidence these programs mirror each other, with dynamic coaches fueling recruiting powerhouses and driven by an underlying philosophy of best player plays. Not the oldest or the previous season's starter.\n\nThe best player. Period.\n\nThat's why Lawrence was named the starter in Week 5 despite Bryant's experience and seniority. Or why Tagovailoa overtook Hurts and a group of true freshmen—Tagovailoa, tailback Najee Harris, wideouts Jeudy, Henry Ruggs III and DeVonta Smith and offensive tackle Alex Leatherwood—became the stars of last year's national championship game despite limited action in previous critical games.\n\nIn fact, Tagovailoa hadn't done enough to supplant Hurts throughout the regular season, but he practiced so well during preparation for last year's semifinal against Clemson that the staff had a series of plays designed for him. Hurts struggled against Clemson's stout defense, but Saban never made the switch.\n\nThen last year's national championship game came around—and the scope and feel of a Saban-coached Alabama team changed.\n\nTua allowed us to do some different things offensively, Saban said.\n\nWhich is the same sort of understatement as saying Alabama has been decent in Saban's 12 seasons. Or that Lawrence has played well for a freshmen, when the reality is Swinney has somehow recruited and developed two generational quarterbacks in the last five seasons.\n\nThings don't just magically happen. There's a lot of hard work, across the board, that goes into winning, Swinney said. If it were easy, everybody would be doing it.\n\nThen what would the whiners of the world complain about?

(Photo by Brendan Smialowski / AFP) (Photo credit should read BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nDonald Trump may not realize it totally yet, but yesterday was the last easy-ish day of his presidency.\n\nBy noon (or so) Thursday, Nancy Pelosi will become the new speaker of the House of Representatives – formalizing the Democratic majority her side won in last November's election. And that will change everything.\n\nTrump has sought to look on the bright side of divided control of government to date – insisting that maybe he will be able to make deals with the new Democratic majority in the House. It really could be a beautiful bipartisan situation, he said at a press conference the day after the 2018 election.\n\nBut the early returns are not promising. The federal government has been shut down for the past 12 days – and there's little reason to believe that will change at any point soon. Trump has dug in on his demand for $5 billion to fund construction of his border wall. Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, are equally dead-set on providing zero dollars for Trump's wall.\n\nAnd this is only the beginning. Starting today, Democrats in the House will make Trump's life a living hell. Efforts are already underway to bring a number of his Cabinet officials before Congress, to extricate his tax returns from his grip and to more deeply probe his business dealings both before and during his presidency.\n\nTrump, a political neophyte prior to the 2016 race, has never had to deal with this sort of opposition before. Sure, Democrats have never been willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. But he never really needed Democrats to do much of anything, either. The Republican majorities in the House and Senate ensured Trump got his tax cuts and two Supreme Court picks. There was no real political penalty for his total unwillingness and inability to work with Democrats.\n\nThose days are now over. Democrats can now do Trump real political damage using the official means of their House majority. While they may not be able to, say, force his tax returns into public view (the jury remains out on that), they can make sure the issue is front and center and create major distractions for a White House that has already shown it can distract itself very well, thank you very much.\n\nTrump claims to understand this, likely with his self-professed titanic intellect. To me, that's like when people who are about to have a baby say they are totally ready for it. As evidence, they point to their nursery being all set up, the Diaper Genie being up and running, and so on and so forth. Then the baby comes – and they realize, like every parent that has gone before them, that no amount of planning or bracing could fully prepare them for their new reality.\n\nThat's Trump and the new Democratic House majority.\n\nThe Point: Look out: It's going to be a mess.
(CNN) There are 15 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the United States. The virus was most recently confirmed in evacuees from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak originated.\n\nThere are more US citizens traveling abroad who've been infected with coronavirus, including at least 24 Americans on a cruise ship in Japan.\n\nThe World Health Organization and the United States have declared the outbreak a public health emergency , but US officials have urged residents not to panic.\n\nThe novel coronavirus, which has sickened thousands and killed more than 1,300 people in China, belongs to a large family of viruses that mostly sicken animals. But this coronavirus, like SARS and MERS, jumped the species barrier to infect people on a large scale, the CDC said.\n\nHere's what we know about the cases in the US:\n\nTexas: 1\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the 15th case of coronavirus on Thursday .\n\nThe patient has been under the 14-day federal quarantine since arriving at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas with other evacuees from China on February 7, the CDC said. The patient is now receiving medical care at a nearby hospital, the CDC said.\n\nCalifornia: 8\n\nCalifornia has more than half of confirmed cases of the virus in the country at eight.\n\nSan Diego County\n\nAn evacuee at the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar was the 14th confirmed case of the novel coronavirus in the United States, the CDC said Wednesday.\n\nThe patient is among a group that was under a federal quarantine order after arriving at the base on a State Department-chartered flight on February 7, the CDC said. The patient was being treated at UC San Diego Health, the CDC said.\n\nThe virus was confirmed Monday in another patient who had arrived earlier at the Miramar base from Wuhan. The patient, who was being cared for at UC San Diego Health, is doing well with minimal symptoms, hospital officials said.\n\nSan Benito County\n\nThe confirmed cases are in a husband and wife, both 57, according to San Benito County Public Health Services\n\nThe husband had recently traveled from Wuhan, China. His wife hadn't -- another case of person-to-person transmission.\n\nThe couple had stayed at home since the man's return from China, according to Dr. Martin Fenstersheib, the county's interim public health officer. But on February 3, the couple was transported from San Benito County to an undisclosed hospital in San Francisco, said Rachael Kagan, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco Department of Public Health.\n\nSanta Clara County\n\nThe ninth confirmed case in the country was identified February 2 as an adult woman who recently traveled to Wuhan, the Santa Clara County Public Health Department in California said.\n\nThe patient is a visitor in Santa Clara County, health officials said, and arrived on January 23 to visit family. She has remained at home ever since, except to seek medical care twice. She has been regularly monitored and was never sick enough to be hospitalized, the statement said.\n\nHealth officials in Santa Clara County on January 31 said a man became infected in China. Upon returning to Northern California on January 24, the man self-isolated and did not leave home, except to seek medical care. He was not sick enough to be hospitalized.\n\nLos Angeles County\n\nDetails are sparse about a confirmed Los Angeles County patient, which was announced on January 26 by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health . The patient is being treated at a local hospital, though the health department didn't disclose how long the person sought treatment after exposure to the virus.\n\nThe patient is a returning traveler from Wuhan, China, the department said.\n\nOrange County\n\nAn Orange County man in his 50s flew into Los Angeles International Airport from Wuhan earlier this month. The county found out January 23, and the CDC confirmed his results that month. He's in a local hospital.\n\nWashington state: 1\n\nThe first confirmed US coronavirus patient, a 35-year-old man , sought treatment at an urgent care center in the state after returning from Wuhan. The urgent care center sent his samples to the CDC, which confirmed he had the coronavirus.\n\nHe entered isolated care at a hospital in Everett, about 30 miles north of Seattle, on January 23. He received treatment in an isolated gurney designed for patients with highly contagious diseases, and a robot took his vitals . He was discharged from the hospital on February 3, according to a statement from Providence Regional Medical Center. He remains in isolation at home undergoing treatment, the hospital said.\n\nHe's in stable condition, said Dr. George Diaz, the man's physician and an infectious disease expert. There's no evidence that he transmitted the virus to anyone else.\n\nIllinois: 2\n\nThe two Chicago patients, a woman and her husband in their 60s, were discharged February 6 from a hospital and are in isolation at their home under guidance from the CDC and the Illinois Department of Public Health, AMITA Health St. Alexius Medical Center spokesman Timothy Nelson told CNN.\n\nWith it being an uncomfortable situation, the care and services we've received have been great. Everyone's been very kind and very respectful, the patients, who were not publicly identified, said in a statement from the hospital. This has been the best health care experience we've ever had, but we're definitely looking forward to getting home and getting life back to normal.\n\nThe woman's case was the first travel-associated case in the US. She was diagnosed a few days after she returned from Wuhan on January 13.\n\nHer husband , who did not travel to China, was diagnosed in late January. His was the first case of person-to-person transmission of the virus in the US, the CDC confirmed.\n\nArizona: 1\n\nThe state health department confirmed that the patient is an adult member of the Arizona State University community, though it didn't release the patient's age or gender.\n\nThe patient called their health care provider when they began to experience mild respiratory symptoms. The CDC confirmed the coronavirus on January 26.\n\nThe patient isn't hospitalized, but is self-isolated at home, the department said.\n\nStudents at the university petitioned the administration to cancel classes , saying they felt unsafe with a case of the virus on campus.\n\nMassachusetts: 1\n\nOn February 1, officials confirmed a student in his 20s at the Boston campus of the University of Massachusetts had the virus.\n\nThe student had returned from Wuhan on January 29. He sought medical treatment after his return and has been isolated ever since. The few close contacts he had have been identified and monitored for symptoms.\n\nThe case poses no increased risk to other students on the schools' campus, the medical director of the Boston Public Health Commission told reporters Saturday. He's doing quite well in quarantine at his home and is being monitored by public health nurses.\n\nWisconsin: 1\n\nThe 12th confirmed case was announced on February 5 by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services . The adult patient has a history of travel to Beijing and was exposed to known cases while in China. The person is isolated at home and doing well, the department said.\n\nWisconsin health officials maintained that the threat to the general public remains low.\n\nWho's still at risk\n\nThe CDC is monitoring 600 people who have recently returned from Wuhan under federal quarantine, the first mandatory quarantine in more than 50 years\n\nThough health officials have confirmed person-to-person contact, they maintain the immediate risk to the public is low.\n\nThere are more than 570 confirmed cases of coronavirus and two deaths in more than 25 countries and territories outside mainland China. Worldwide, more than 60,000 people have been infected.\n\nWhat's being done\n\nRestrictions apply to US citizens who have been in China's Hubei province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, in the two weeks before their return to the United States. Upon their return, those citizens will be subject to a mandatory quarantine of up to 14 days, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said January 31.\n\nLast month, the US State Department raised its China travel advisory to Do Not Travel and warned that it could put travel restrictions into effect with little to no advance notice. The CDC recommended US citizens to avoid nonessential travel to the country.\n\nIf you are a traveler who has recently returned from the impacted area, we want you to be vigilant with the symptoms and signs of this coronavirus, said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.\n\nLocal health officials are cracking down on misinformation related to the virus, including fake reports of confirmed cases and conspiracy theories about its spread. The most accurate information comes from county, state and federal health departments and is updated regularly as officials learn more.\n\nOtherwise, the CDC encourages people to follow flu season protocol: Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, avoid ill people and stay home and avoid public situations if they're ill. A coronavirus vaccine would take at least a year to reach the public.

The items consist of ingredients already on the menu, so walk-in eaters can also order the bowls.\n\nThe diet bowls include:\n\nWhole30 Salad Bowl: Romaine lettuce, carnitas, fajita veggies, tomato salsa and guacamole\n\nPaleo Salad Bowl: Romaine lettuce, barbacoa, fajita veggies, green salsa and guacamole\n\nKeto Salad Bowl: Romaine lettuce, carnitas, red salsa, cheese and guacamole\n\nDouble Protein Bowl: White rice, black beans, chicken (full portion), steak (full portion), red salsa, romaine lettuce and sour cream\n\nAll three of these diets follow strict rules and are growing in popularity.\n\nThe ketogenic diet includes low-carb, high-fat foods that force the body into a state of ketosis — when you burn fat, instead of carbohydrates, for energy. Whole30 cuts out sugar, grains, dairy and legumes for 30 days, and paleo is modeled after eating habits in the paleolithic era.\n\nThe move toward diet food is another step in Chipotle's reinvention, as it works to recover from a series of health scares at its restaurants.\n\nThe new bowls are latest change under CEO Brian Niccol, the former head of Taco Bell, who has turned the restaurant around after a number of people got sick during multiple outbreaks of foodborne illness in recent years. The most serious was an E. coli outbreak in 2015 that sickened 60 customers in 14 states.\n\nIn 2018 the company closed 2,000 locations to retrain staff on food safety.\n\nChipotle stock skyrocketed 40% last year and is one of the top-10 performers in the S&P 500 since Niccol joined. He also started testing a slew of new items, like milkshakes, beefed up its digital offerings and launched a new advertising campaign.

The fear factor surrounding self-driving cars appears to be slowly receding.\n\nAAA released a study Wednesday showing that 63% of Americans are afraid of riding in a self-driving vehicle, down from 78% the previous year.\n\nThis is the third year that AAA has polled the U.S. population on how people feel about autonomous vehicles. The prior two years had shown a consistent level of discomfort.\n\nIt's great to see the easing of fears, Greg Brannon, AAA's director of automotive engineering and industry relations, told CNN Tech. The reality is consumers need to not be afraid of these technologies because they hold the promise to save lives.\n\nRelated: Self-driving cars will change your life more than you can imagine\n\nBrannon pointed to increased media attention on self-driving vehicles and the growing prevalence of features such as adaptive cruise control for triggering the shift. Automakers from GM (GM) to Tesla (TSLA) offer these features, which use limited elements of autonomous technology to reduce the driving burden on motorists.\n\nThey're also a small taste of the future of transportation, in which steering wheels and gas pedals disappear as vehicles become fully automated.\n\nAdvocates of self-driving technologies point to them as a way to reduce the huge number of people killed in motor vehicle crashes worldwide each year. That number stood at 1.25 million in 2013, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nAdvocates also expect autonomous transportation to improve the mobility of the extremely young and old, who are unable to drive vehicles today.\n\nBut the AAA study found that older Americans were less likely than younger people to be comfortable riding in or sharing the road with a fully autonomous vehicle. The findings also showed a gender gap, with 73% of women afraid of riding in self-driving cars, compared with 52% of men.\n\nThe survey gathered the views of 1,004 adults in the continental U.S. in early December.\n\nRelated: GM just introduced a self-driving car without a steering wheel\n\nThe autonomous vehicle industry has taken steps to increase comfort and understanding of the disruptive technology. Waymo, the self-driving arm of Google's (GOOGL) parent company, launched a campaign last year entitled Let's Talk Self-Driving to educate the public about the vehicles.\n\nMany experts predict the technology is likely to be broadly deployed across the country by around 2020. Waymo announced in November that it was removing test drivers from the driver's seats of its Chrysler Pacificas operating in the Phoenix area.\n\nIt also announced this week that it's expanding tests to Atlanta, an indication that its vehicles may be available in another region before long.

But he bluntly expresses his displeasure with the Trump circus, US foreign policy failures, and the state of television news.\n\nIn our day-to-day whirlwind and hostage status as prisoners of Donald Trump, I think — like everyone else does — that we miss so much, Arkin says.\n\nHe's far from the only person in a national newsroom to feel that way. But he is spelling it out in no uncertain terms.\n\nArkin has worked for NBC on and off for three decades, sometimes as a military analyst, sometimes as a reporter and consultant. He describes himself as a scholar at heart, and he has authored numerous books about national security, most recently Unmanned, subtitled drones, data, and the illusion of perfect warfare.\n\nFriday will be his last day at NBC, according to his internal memo on Wednesday. It was shared with CNN by one of the recipients, and NBC confirmed its authenticity.\n\nThe network had no comment on his departure.\n\nArkin is a sharp critic of what he calls perpetual war and the creeping fascism of homeland security.\n\nPHOTO: Alex Wong/Getty Images Military analyst William Arkin speaks during a taping of 'Meet the Press' at the NBC studios December 12, 2004 in Washington, DC. Arkin joined a roundtable discussion on the current situation of the war in Iraq.\n\nIn his farewell memo, he said the American press is not aggressive enough about covering military engagements.\n\nI find it disheartening that we do not report the failures of the generals and national security leaders, he said. I find it shocking that we essentially condone continued American bumbling in the Middle East and now Africa through our ho-hum reporting.\n\nHe said that most of his critiques of NBC apply to the rest of the news media, as well.\n\nYears ago, he said, particularly as the social media wave began, it was clear that NBC (like the rest of the news media) could no longer keep up with the world. Added to that was the intellectual challenge of how to report our new kind of wars when there were no real fronts and no actual measures of success.\n\nArkin is inclined to agree with some of Trump's isolationist instincts, though he called Trump an ignorant and incompetent impostor.\n\nAnd yet, he wrote, I'm alarmed at how quick NBC is to mechanically argue the contrary, to be in favor of policies that just spell more conflict and more war.\n\nStaffers at NBC might object to that line — pointing out that the network doesn't take an institutional position in favor of any policy. But Arkin is describing the impression he takes away from the news coverage and commentary.\n\nHe also said in the memo that the Trump age led NBC to start emulating the national security state itself — busy and profitable. No wars won but the ball is kept in play.\n\nIn the memo, Arkin called himself a difficult guy, and gave NBC a lot of credit for keeping him in the corporate family for so long.\n\nHe said he is leaving because his expertise, though seeming to be all the more central to the challenges and dangers we face, also seems to be less valued at the moment. And I find myself completely out of synch with the network, being neither a day-to-day reporter nor interested in the Trump circus. He is working on multiple books and other projects.\n\nHere is the full text of Arkin's memo.\n\n—-\n\nJanuary 4 is my last day at NBC News and I'd like to say goodbye to my friends, hopefully not for good. This isn't the first time I've left NBC, but this time the parting is more bittersweet, the world and the state of journalism in tandem crisis. My expertise, though seeming to be all the more central to the challenges and dangers we face, also seems to be less valued at the moment. And I find myself completely out of synch with the network, being neither a day-to-day reporter nor interested in the Trump circus.\n\nI first started my association with NBC 30 years ago, feeding Cold War stories to Bob Windrem and Fred Francis at the Pentagon. I became an on-air analyst during the 1999 Kosovo War, continuing to work thereafter with Nightly News, delighting and oftentimes annoying in my peculiar position of being a mere civilian amongst THE GENERALS and former government officials. A scholar at heart, I also found myself an often lone voice that was anti-nuclear and even anti-military, anti-military for me meaning opinionated but also highly knowledgeable, somewhat akin to a movie critic, loving my subject but also not shy about making judgements regarding the flops and the losers.\n\nWhen the attacks of 9/11 came, I was called back to NBC. I spent weeks on and off the air talking about al Qaeda and the various wars we were rushing into, arguing that airpower and drones would be the centerpiece not troops. In the new martial environment where only one war cry was sanctioned I was out of sync then as well. I retreated somewhat to writing a column for the Los Angeles Times, but even there I had to fight editors who couldn't believe that there would be a war in Iraq. And I spoke up about the absence of any sort of strategy for actually defeating terrorism, annoying the increasing gaggles of those who seemed to accept that a state of perpetual war was a necessity.\n\nI thought then that there was great danger in the embrace of process and officialdom over values and public longing, and I wrote about the increasing power of the national security community. Long before Trump and deep state became an expression, I produced one ginormous investigation – Top Secret America – for the Washington Post and I wrote a nasty book – American Coup – about the creeping fascism of homeland security.\n\nLooking back now they were both harbingers for what President Obama (and then Trump) faced in terms of largely failing to make enduring change.\n\nSomewhere in all of that, and particularly as the social media wave began, it was clear that NBC (like the rest of the news media) could no longer keep up with the world. Added to that was the intellectual challenge of how to report our new kind of wars when there were no real fronts and no actual measures of success. To me there is also a larger problem: though they produce nothing that resembles actual safety and security, the national security leaders and generals we have are allowed to do their thing unmolested. Despite being at war, no great wartime leaders or visionaries are emerging. There is not a soul in Washington who can say that they have won or stopped any conflict. And though there might be the beloved perfumed princes in the form of the Petraeus' and Wes Clarks', or the so-called warrior monks like Mattis and McMaster, we've had more than a generation of national security leaders who sadly and fraudulently have done little of consequence. And yet we (and others) embrace them, even the highly partisan formers who masquerade as analysts. We do so ignoring the empirical truth of what they have wrought: There is not one county in the Middle East that is safer today than it was 18 years ago. Indeed the world becomes ever more polarized and dangerous.\n\nAs perpetual war has become accepted as a given in our lives, I'm proud to say that I've never deviated in my argument at NBC (or at my newspaper gigs) that terrorists will never be defeated until we better understand why they are driven to fighting. And I have maintained my central view that airpower (in its broadest sense including space and cyber) is not just the future but the enabler and the tool of war today.\n\nSeeking refuge in its political horse race roots, NBC (and others) meanwhile report the story of war as one of Rumsfeld vs. the Generals, as Wolfowitz vs. Shinseki, as the CIA vs. Cheney, as the bad torturers vs. the more refined, about numbers of troops and number of deaths, and even then Obama vs. the Congress, poor Obama who couldn't close Guantanamo or reduce nuclear weapons or stand up to Putin because it was just so difficult. We have contributed to turning the world national security into this sort of political story. I find it disheartening that we do not report the failures of the generals and national security leaders. I find it shocking that we essentially condone continued American bumbling in the Middle East and now Africa through our ho-hum reporting.\n\nI'm a difficult guy, not prone to either protocol or procedure and I give NBC credit that it tolerated me through my various incarnations. I hope people will say in the early days that I made Brokaw and company smarter about nuclear weapons, about airpower, and even about al Qaeda. And I'm proud to say that I also was one of the few to report that there weren't any WMD in Iraq and remember fondly presenting that conclusion to an incredulous NBC editorial board. I argued endlessly with MSNBC about all things national security for years, doing the daily blah, blah, blah in Secaucus, but also poking at the conventional wisdom of everyone from Matthews to Hockenberry. And yet I feel like I've failed to convey this larger truth about the hopelessness of our way of doing things, especially disheartened to watch NBC and much of the rest of the news media somehow become a defender of Washington and the system.\n\nWindrem again convinced me to return to NBC to join the new investigative unit in the early days of the 2016 presidential campaign. I thought that the mission was to break through the machine of perpetual war acceptance and conventional wisdom to challenge Hillary Clinton's hawkishness. It was also an interesting moment at NBC because everyone was looking over their shoulder at Vice and other upstarts creeping up on the mainstream. But then Trump got elected and Investigations got sucked into the tweeting vortex, increasingly lost in a directionless adrenaline rush, the national security and political version of leading the broadcast with every snow storm. And I would assert that in many ways NBC just began emulating the national security state itself – busy and profitable. No wars won but the ball is kept in play.\n\nI'd argue that under Trump, the national security establishment not only hasn't missed a beat but indeed has gained dangerous strength. Now it is ever more autonomous and practically impervious to criticism. I'd also argue, ever so gingerly, that NBC has become somewhat lost in its own verve, proxies of boring moderation and conventional wisdom, defender of the government against Trump, cheerleader for open and subtle threat mongering, in love with procedure and protocol over all else (including results). I accept that there's a lot to report here, but I'm more worried about how much we are missing. Hence my desire to take a step back and think why so little changes with regard to America's wars.\n\nI know it is characteristic of our overexcited moment to blast away at former employers and mainstream institutions, but all I can say is that despite many frustrations, my time at NBC has been gratifying. Working with Cynthia McFadden has been the experience of a lifetime. I've learned a ton about television from her and Kevin Monahan, the secret insider tricks of the trade and the very big picture of what makes for original stories (and how powerful they can be). The young reporters at NBC are also universally excellent. Thanks to Noah Oppenheim for his support of my contrarian and disruptive presence. And to Janelle Rodriguez, who supported deep expertise. The Nightly crew has also been a constant fan of my too long stories and a great team. I continue to marvel as Phil Griffin carries out his diabolical plan for the cable network to take over the world.\n\nI'm proud of the work I've done with my team and know that there's more to do. But for now it's time to take a break. I'm ever so happy to return to writing and thinking without the officiousness of editorial tyrants or corporate standards. And of course I yearn to go back to my first love, which is writing boring reports about secret programs, grateful that the American government so graciously obliges in its constant supply. And I particularly feel like the world is moving so quickly that even in just the little national security world I inhabit, I need more time to sit back and think. And to replenish.\n\nIn our day-to-day whirlwind and hostage status as prisoners of Donald Trump, I think – like everyone else does – that we miss so much. People who don't understand the medium, or the pressures, loudly opine that it's corporate control or even worse, that it's partisan. Sometimes I quip in response to friends on the outside (and to government sources) that if they mean by the word partisan that it is New Yorkers and Washingtonians against the rest of the country then they are right.\n\nFor me I realized how out of step I was when I looked at Trump's various bumbling intuitions: his desire to improve relations with Russia, to denuclearize North Korea, to get out of the Middle East, to question why we are fighting in Africa, even in his attacks on the intelligence community and the FBI. Of course he is an ignorant and incompetent impostor. And yet I'm alarmed at how quick NBC is to mechanically argue the contrary, to be in favor of policies that just spell more conflict and more war. Really? We shouldn't get out Syria? We shouldn't go for the bold move of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula? Even on Russia, though we should be concerned about the brittleness of our democracy that it is so vulnerable to manipulation, do we really yearn for the Cold War? And don't even get me started with the FBI: What? We now lionize this historically destructive institution?\n\nEven without Trump, our biggest challenge as we move forward is that we have become exhausted parents of our infant (and infantile) social media children. And because of the cycle, we at NBC (and all others in the field of journalism) suffer from a really bad case of not being able to ever take a breath. We are a long way from resolving the rules of the road in this age, whether it be with regard to our personal conduct or anything related to hard news. I also don't think that we are on a straight line towards digital nirvana, that is, that all of this information will democratize and improve society. I sense that there is already smartphone and social media fatigue creeping across the land, and my guess is that nothing we currently see – nothing that is snappy or chatty – will solve our horrific challenges of information overload or the role (and nature) of journalism. AndI am sure that once Trump leaves center stage, society will have a gigantic media hangover. Thus for NBC – and for everyone else – there is challenge and opportunity ahead. I'd particularly like to think and write more about that.\n\nThere's a saying about consultants, that organizations hire them to hear exactly what they want to hear. I'm proud to say that NBC didn't do that when it came to me. Similarly I can say that I'm proud that I'm not guilty of giving my employers what they wanted. Still, the things this and most organizations fear most – variability, disturbance, difference – those things that are also the primary drivers of creativity – are not really the things that I see valued in the reporting ranks.\n\nI'm happy to go back to writing and commentary. This winter, I'm proud to say that I've put the finishing touches on a 9/11 conspiracy novel that I've been toiling on for over a decade. It's a novel, but it meditates on the question of how to understand terrorists in a different way. And I'm undertaking two new book-writing projects, one fiction about a lone reporter and his magical source that hopes to delve into secrecy and the nature of television. And, If you read this far, I am writing a non-fiction book, an extended essay about national security and why we never seem to end our now perpetual state of war. There is lots of media critique out there, tons of analysis of leadership and the Presidency. But on the state of our national security? Not so much. Hopefully I will find myself thinking beyond the current fire and fury and actually suggest a viable alternative. Wish me luck.
How this Austin brewery is getting creative with its space during the pandemic\n\nThis company makes sure you never run out of coffee\n\nBeatrice Dixon speaks onstage during ESSENCE + New Voices Entrepreneur Summit And Target Holiday Market at West End Production Park on December 15, 2019 in Atlanta, Georgia. (Photo by Paras Griffin/Getty Images for ESSENCE)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nIt started with a trip to the dentist.\n\nIt was 2012 and Simon Enever had gone in for a cleaning. As he sat with his mouth open, his dentist started ranting about how people approach brushing and flossing as chores and often did these two basic things wrong.\n\nI asked the dentist why he felt his patients were getting these simple habits wrong, and he put it down to two things: That people did not like their oral care routine enough to want to invest time or energy in improving it, and most brands were more focused on selling expensive gimmicks rather than on guiding simple good habits, he recalls.\n\nThe dentist's rant struck a chord. An industrial designer, Enever realized there was an opportunity to create a product that provides a better way to take care of one's teeth.\n\nAs a designer, my job [is] to make things more enjoyable, he says.\n\nEnever, who is now 31, teamed up with his friend, Bill May, a fellow industrial designer, and the two spent a year gathering insights from dentists. Enever says he was shocked to learn that the average person brushes their teeth for only one minute instead of the recommended two and that most people wait around nine months to change their worn out electric toothbrush heads, rather than the dentist recommended three months.\n\nWe wanted to make a toothbrush that was accessible, desirable, and wanted by the 80% of people that have not ever upgraded or been bothered to upgrade their toothbrush [to an electric one], says Enever. By taking out all of the features that really didn't make a big difference and focusing on the ones that really did, we could make something much more simple, affordable, and hopefully enjoyable to use.\n\nSimon Enever came up with the idea for Quip while sitting in a dentist's chair.\n\nWhat the two came up with is an electric toothbrush with a clean, no-frills design.\n\nThe battery-operated Quip uses sonic vibrations (where the motor vibrates the bristles back and forth) instead of rotations, providing a higher level of cleaning. Each brushing is automatically programmed to last two-minutes and consists of 30-second intervals so that users can cover each zone in the mouth. Quip is meant to be portable and has a holder that can be attached to the wall with a suction cup. The starter kit costs $25 for a plastic model and $40 for a metal version. For a $5 fee, subscribers are sent a new brush head every three months.\n\nWe wanted to make a toothbrush that was accessible, desirable, and wanted by the 80% of people that have not bothered to upgrade their toothbrush. Simon Enever\n\nThe first shipment went out in November, 2015. To date, the Brooklyn-based startup has sold more than one million toothbrushes and has more than one million subscribers. Enever declined to disclose annual revenue or whether the business is profitable.\n\nCreating an 'oral care ecosystem'\n\nAs novice entrepreneurs, Enever and May struggled to get funding at first. Pitching Quip at the beginning was a bit of a challenge, says Enever.\n\nBoth were transplants to New York — Enever had moved from the United Kingdom and May from Virginia — and they lacked contacts in business and investing circles.\n\nFor the first six months, we were piecing together $10,000 here, $20,000 there, says Enever. I think we had maybe $50,000 of funding for the first six months.\n\nThey also faced rejection many times.\n\nOral care isn't a cool or a sexy industry, he says. We probably had 70 to 80 'no's' from investors, even through the first two or three years of our launch we were still struggling to raise money despite growing fast and acquiring users and members that were really passionate about the product.\n\nEventually investors began to take notice of Quip's market momentum, helped in large part by the brand's heavy use of social media platforms like Facebook.\n\nFacebook was not just used as a marketing tool from the beginning. [It] was one of the most important user support tools. It really helped us from the very early days to understand how people were reacting to our products, says Enever.\n\nTo date, the company has raised more than $62 million from both angel and institutional investors, including Sherpa Capital and Brainchild Holdings.\n\nLooking ahead, Enever and May want Quip to become an oral health care ecosystem.\n\nEnever says he wants Quip to help people improve every aspect of their oral care routine — from the products they use at home every day, to the professional dental services they need every six months, and everything in between.\n\n[This] will be through products beyond just the toothbrush and toothpaste, investing further in content and services that help guide and track better technique and healthy habits, and continuing to simplify and modernize the experience of accessing quality professional care services when and where you need it, says Enever.\n\nIt's a bigger prospect [and] if we get it right, it will be around, hopefully, forever.
Painted across the finished mural are the words No hay hoja que muera ... sin otra que nazca, or No leaf dies ... without another being born.\n\nThe Punta Santiago mural project was part of the launch of Save the Children's long-term resilience plan for the area.\n\nChildren in Punta Santiago add color to the plants in the new mural.\n\nThe painting project expanded beyond the floor to cover the bleachers and walls.\n\nThe mural, designed by artist Okuda San Miguel, is first outlined throughout the gym.\n\nAn old gymnasium in the Ciales municipality of Puerto Rico is marked for a colorful makeover.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nWith paintbrushes in hand, residents of the Ciales municipality are trying to dab color – and hope – back into their community blown drab by Hurricane Maria.\n\nThey paint in the daylight. There isn't electricity to run lights at night. Basic necessities like food and water are still not getting through. Leaves have still not grown back. But the people of this town in Puerto Rico's mountains show growing resolve as their vibrant mural takes shape across the walls and floor of an old gymnasium.\n\nThe mural was a symbol for hope for the community, explains Casey Harrity, Save the Children's team leader in Puerto Rico. It is a chance for everyone to take part in the rebuilding, to be agents of change themselves.\n\nThe children especially took to the project and the idea that they could make things better. Their brush strokes and tiny handprints reflect their commitment to the work and the message.\n\nSo many kids have had this energy awoken in them that has been dormant, says Jenith, a local resident. a lot of desire to keep moving forward.\n\nEvents like this aim to strengthen the hearts of Puerto Ricans, whose resiliency is being tested by the slow recovery. Hundreds of thousands still do not have power, and those with electricity face blackouts. Rain still soaks the thousands who wait for government-issued tarps to temporarily replace the roofs blown away five months ago.\n\nBut blue and green tarps dotting the landscape are not inspiring colors of hope. Instead, buckets of paint, brought by charities like Save the Children and Apartial, are helping communities create murals that spread encouragement.\n\nIn Punta Santiago, for example, on the southeast coast of Puerto Rico, a new mural shows the vibrant foliage that has yet to return to the countryside. The Spanish phrase written on the skyline translates to there is no leaf that dies without another that is born.
Canada, Taiwan, India, Editor's Note — This story is part of a series highlighting superlatives of countries and cities around the world. Click here for pieces on Italy France , the United States Hong Kong and Mexico , and watch for upcoming installments featuring other countries.\n\n(CNN) — For such a small country -- it ranks 109th in the world for total area , right behind Iceland -- South Korea sure is in the news a lot.\n\nOccasionally that news is grim -- something to do with a troublesome cousin across the border.\n\nSometimes it's pure mainstream pop -- a bunch of cute singers taking down Lady Gaga on the world stage.\n\nSometimes it's just plain astonishing -- no one throws out the first pitch at a baseball game with as much panache as South Koreans.\n\nFrom the weird to the wonderful to sci-fi stuff from a Samsung galaxy far, far away, here are things South Korea pulls off more spectacularly than anywhere else.\n\n1. Wired culture\n\nWant to see what the future looks like?\n\nBook a ticket to the country with a worldwide high 82.7% Internet penetration and where 78.5% of the entire population is on smartphones (as of 2013).\n\nWhile they're chatting away on emoticon-ridden messenger apps such as Naver Line or Kakao Talk, South Koreans also use their smartphones to pay at shops, watch TV (not Youtube but real-time channels) on the subway and scan QR codes at the world's first virtual supermarket\n\nHyundai plans on rolling out a car that starts with your smartphone in 2015.\n\nSamsung in the meantime has been designing a curved phone.\n\nCrazy displays of technology already in place but not yet distributed can be seen (by appointment) at T.um, Korea's largest telecom company SK Telecom's future technology museum\n\nT.um , Jung-gu, Euljiro 2-ga 11, Seoul; +82 2 6100 0601\n\n2. Whipping out the plastic\n\nSouth Koreans became the world's top users of credit cards two years ago, according to data from the Bank of Korea\n\nWhile Americans made 77.9 credit card transactions per person in 2011 and Canadians made 89.6, South Koreans made 129.7.\n\nIt's technically illegal for any merchant in the country to refuse credit cards, no matter how low the price, and all cabs have credit card machines.\n\nAll that flying plastic makes Seoul one of our top shopping cities in the world.\n\n3. Workaholics\n\nSouth Koreans are so used to studying -- the country has the highest education level in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, with 98% of the population completing secondary education and 63% with a college education -- they can't get out of the habit once they reach the work force.\n\nAccording to this quirky map from thedoghousediaries , Brazil sets the standard for FIFA World Cup titles and North Korea leads in censorship, but South Korea takes the crown for workaholics.\n\nYou can see it in any Korean city, where lights in buildings blaze into the late hours as workers slave away.\n\nAccording to 2012 data from South Korea's Ministry of Strategy and Finance, South Koreans work 44.6 hours per week, compared with the OECD average of 32.8.\n\nAnd according to a study released in August 2014, along with Tokyo residents, Seoulites get the least amount of sleep of any residents of major cities in the world, just less than six hours a night.\n\n4. Business boozing\n\nWhen they're not working, Koreans are celebrating their latest deals or drowning their sorrows in soju.\n\nWhile many leading companies are trying to curb the working/drinking culture, there are still plenty of bosses who drag their teams out for way too many rounds of soju/beer/whiskey bombs.\n\nThose who opt out are considered rude or hopelessly boring.\n\nYes, Japan and a few other countries can stake reasonable claims to this title, but South Korea has stats to back up the barroom brag.\n\nJinro soju was the world's best-selling liquor last year , for the eleventh year in a row, with its home country accounting for most of the sales.\n\nThe South Korean distilled rice liquor manufacturer outsold Smirnoff vodka, which came in second by 37.48 million cases.\n\n5. Innovative cosmetics\n\nWhen it comes to makeup and cosmetics, South Koreans can't stop experimenting with ingredients or methods of application.\n\nSnail creams (moisturizers made from snail guts) are so 2011.\n\nNow it's all about Korean ingredients such as Innisfree 's Jeju Island volcanic clay mask and fermented soybean moisturizer.\n\nAt VDL , Korea's latest trendy cosmetics line, products change monthly.\n\nRight now, they're pushing hair shockers -- neon tints for hair -- and nail polish with real flowers in it.\n\nJust as Korean men are less wary of going under the plastic surgery knife (see point 10) than their foreign counterparts, they also snap up skincare products and, yes, even makeup, namely foundation in the form of BB cream.\n\nSouth Korea is by far the largest market for men's cosmetics, with Korean men buying a quarter of the world's men's cosmetics -- around $900 million a year , according to Euromonitor.\n\n6. Female golfers\n\nThe Economist posed a million-dollar question in 2013.\n\nWhy are Korean women so good at golf?\n\nThe rankings were staggering.\n\nOf the top 100 female golfers in the world, 38 were Korean.\n\nOf the current top 25 , 9 are Korean (10 if you count Seoul-born Lydia Ko, who calls New Zealand home).\n\nInbee Park, 25, is the second-ranked player in women's golf and was the youngest player to win the U.S. Women's Open.\n\nIn January, Ko, 14, set the record for the youngest woman to ever win a professional golf tournament.\n\nChalk it up to crazy Korean competitiveness or to the Tiger Mom/Dad theory (golfer Se-Ri Pak's father is infamous for making her sleep alone in a cemetery every night to steel her nerves), but the phenomenon certainly begs study.\n\nWidely thought to be a response to Korean domination of the sport, the U.S.-based LPGA passed a requirement in 2008 mandating that its members must learn to speak English , or face suspension.\n\n7. Starcraft\n\nOne country's hopeless nerds are among another's highest earning celebrities\n\nStarcraft is actually a legitimate career in South Korea, with pro gamers raking in hundreds of thousands of dollars in earnings in addition to endorsements.\n\nSince the game launched in 1998, nearly half of all games have been sold in South Korea, where boys, girls, men and women drop by for a night of gaming in giant video game parlors.\n\nThere are cable channels devoted solely to the games, and the culture has led to approximately 14% of Koreans between ages 9 and 12 suffering from Internet addiction, according to the National Information Agency.\n\nTo try to crack down, the government passed a ban dubbed the shutdown law or Cinderella law two years ago, prohibiting anyone 16 and younger from game websites. The ban has been widely ignored.\n\n8. Flight attendants\n\nFlight attendants from airlines around the world come to Korean airlines' training centers to learn proper airborne charm.\n\nAsk anyone who's ever flown a Korean airline and dare them to say the service isn't the best they've ever had.\n\nIt's not just the sweet smiles that greet every little request, but the almost comical looks of suicidal despair when they somehow run out of bibimbap in the row before yours.\n\n9. Blind dates\n\nWhen's your next sogeting (blind date)?\n\nThat's one of the most frequently asked questions of any Korean single.\n\nThe standard answer is the epic horror story that was the last blind date, often involving a crippling Oedipus complex or intolerable physical flaw.\n\nFollowed immediately by a chirpy, Why, do you know someone you can set me up with?\n\nDue to the high volume of blind dates, when Korean make up their minds, they move quickly.\n\nAccording to data compiled by South Korea's largest matchmaking company, Duo , the average length of time of a relationship from the (blind) first date to marriage is approximately 10.2 months for working people, with an average of 62 dates per couple.\n\nIn a survey conducted by Duo, working singles interested in marriage say they typically go on two blind dates a week.\n\nThey should know. Of the top four matchmaking companies in Korea (there are 2,500 companies in the country), Duo has a 63.2% marketshare.\n\n10. Plastic surgery\n\nWhether it's a lantern jaw, wide forehead or long teeth, there's no feature doctors can't beautify in the Asian capital for cosmetic surgery.\n\nRussians, Chinese, Mongolians and Japanese flock to South Korea on plastic surgery medical tours, not only for the skill of the surgeons, but for the good deals.

The data showed that the decrease was most striking at the postgraduate level.\n\nHollie Chandler, a senior policy analyst with the Russell Group, said in a statement that it was fair to assume that uncertainty over Brexit and the UK's future relationship with Europe could be a significant factor.\n\nThe drop in postgraduate research courses is especially troubling – these students contribute directly to the UK's research capacity, she said, adding that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, uncertainty felt by prospective European students will only get worse.\n\nIn the letter to lawmakers, university leaders reiterated that 50,000 EU staffers, 130,000 EU students and 15,000 UK students studying in Europe are starting the new year facing significant uncertainty about their futures.\n\nProfessor Janet Beer, president of Universities UK, warned in a statement that world-leading academics and researchers may turn their backs on the UK for countries with access to EU funding programs.\n\nThe UK is the most successful country for hosting European Research Council grantees, who have won a number of prestigious prizes, including Nobel Prizes. Germany is the biggest competitor for these grants.\n\nWe are home to one of the best research systems in the world, attractive to stellar academics, top students and global partnerships, and we must not let this be compromised by a no deal Brexit, Beer said.\n\nProfessor Nancy Rothwell, president and vice-chancellor of the University of Manchester, said university research at the forefront of science and medical breakthroughs are only possible through EU research collaborations, on projects led by UK universities.\n\nRothwell added that the university's vital and transformative research programs risk being disrupted, such as its proton-beam therapy for cancer patients, which provides more precision when targeting tumor sites and minimizes tissue damage.\n\nShe said that the risks of a no-deal Brexit would mean a serious setback for the fields of discovery and many more.
Story highlights Tom Kawczynski reportedly said people of different races should voluntarily separate He said he'll fight for white civil rights\n\n(CNN) —\n\nA town manager who made headlines with his internet posts that called for racial segregation and bashed Islam has been fired.\n\nTown officials in Jackman, Maine, terminated Tom Kawczynski's employment at a meeting Tuesday, CNN affiliate WABI reports.\n\nKawczynski runs a website for an organization called New Albion, which says it seeks to promote traditional Western values emphasizing the positive aspects of our European heritage and uniquely American identity.\n\nBut Kawczynski was accused of promoting racism after posts surfaced in which he reportedly said that people of different races should voluntarily separate from each other. He also said Islam was a danger to the West. The original post was removed, but he addressed the controversy in later posts on the website.\n\nCNN reached out to Kawczynski for comment. He said in an email that he was only interested in commenting in a live television interview.\n\nAfter the meeting in which he was fired, Kawczynski said he has a right to free speech.\n\nWith respect to the New Albion movement, which it is my honor to lead, I would say that we are a cultural movement. We are open to all ethnicities, all races and I reject categorically the suggestion that I am a racist, he said, according to WABI. No citizen, without regard to what their office is, should have to give up their right of free expression or their freedom of assembly.\n\n'Nothing of this community'\n\nKawczynski's beliefs and ideas don't represent the community's, a Jackman resident told WABI.\n\nHis views were of nothing of this community, said Meg Welch, who manages a couple of hotels in town. If he thought he was going to come here and change all that with his New Albion religion, culture or whatever it is, it's not going to happen.\n\nIn a new post on his website, Kawczynski said he was probably leaving town, and that he was going to fight for white civil rights.\n\nOfficials in Jackman – a small community in northern Maine of just under 1,000 people located near the Canadian border – say, as far as they're concerned, this matter is over.\n\nThe Board and Mr. Kawcyznski have agreed on the details of ending their agreement, the town said in a statement. The Select Board intends to move forward to do what is necessary to sustain a vibrant community such as Jackman.

The adverse consequences of the shutdown are wide and growing.\n\nThe closure of key government agencies comes as American business owners are struggling to deal with the fallout of President Donald Trump's trade wars, as well as increased market volatility and growing economic uncertainty.\n\nTrump has said the shutdown could last for months – or years – and while it most immediately affects government workers and federal contractors who aren't getting paid, it has created severe challenges for businesses that depend on government data, licensing or other functions.\n\nFarmers, for example, would normally be looking to a monthly report on the supply and demand of agricultural products around the world to help determine what to plant next season. But the next report won't come out as scheduled on January 11 if the US Department of Agriculture remains unfunded.\n\nBusinesses that rely on monthly export and import data missed an update Tuesday because the Commerce Department isn't fully operating either. And US businesses that import steel and aluminum and are seeking an exclusion from Trump's tariffs may have to wait longer to hear if their application has been approved, because those applications are also handled by the Commerce Department.\n\nThe shutdown also poses challenges for industries that need approval from the federal agencies temporarily shuttered. Pending company mergers, for example, are being slowed because the Securities and Exchange Commission isn't fully staffed.\n\nBreweries trying out new craft beers are stuck, too, because the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which must sign off on all new labels and packaging, has been shut down.\n\nThe list of nuisances goes on. The Internal Revenue Service isn't staffed to take questions from employers that must send out W-2s to workers by the end of January, or businesses who have questions about changes under the new tax law.\n\nEmployers will also have to wait until the shutdown is over to use the online E-Verify system to confirm whether applicants have a legal right to work in the United States. It doesn't prevent someone from starting to work, but prolongs the on-boarding process – and opens up the risk that companies may have to let go of employees who don't later pass the check, even if they've already started working.\n\nTrump's efforts to overhaul the global trading system has already strained some business owners and farmers. He's said that he wants foreign countries to change their practices and treat Americans fairly, but despite what the President has often suggested, it's not China that's paying for the tariffs but US importers. The duties have raised the price of goods ranging from foreign steel and aluminum to Chinese-made semiconductors and luggage for American companies.\n\nSome businesses, like Missouri-based Cap America, have had to start paying a 10% tariff on a majority of their inventory because it comes from China. The company made most of their baseball caps in-house (and was appropriately named) until 2001, but it became cheaper to buy them from China. Now, about 89% of the caps sold in the United States comes from China. Cap America then embroiders them here.\n\nIn December, the company had to set prices for 2019 without knowing if there would be a 10% or 25% tariff on their imports. Trump had threatened to raise the tariff rate to 25% on January 1, but put off the hike while he and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day truce that ends in March.\n\nPhil Page, chairman and CEO of Cap America, said he doesn't expect to know how his price increase will affect demand until the end of the first quarter.\n\nIt's the uncertainty that causes the most stress in this situation, he said.\n\nRetaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries have closed off some markets to American farmers. China stopped buying American soybeans for about six months, though purchases restarted in December. Mexico put tariffs on American pork and Canada imposed duties on beef.\n\nA new trade deal struck between the United States, Mexico and Canada to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement has offered some reassurance to farmers that markets to the North and South would remain open to trade.\n\nBut even though Trump and his counterparts signed the deal in December, it must still be approved by Congress where leaders from the Democratically controlled House have voiced concerns about its labor and environmental provisions.\n\nLawmakers are expected to wait for an economic impact study before taking a vote, but it's unlike that will come before mid-March. It's being done by the US International Trade Commission, which has suspended investigative activities during the shutdown. Plus, Trump has threatened to withdraw from the original deal in the meantime, which could invite more tariffs on US goods and risk an economic shock.\n\nDespite the new trade deal, the retaliatory tariffs will remain in place while Trump keeps duties on foreign steel and aluminum. Many businesses and farmers have urged the administration to lift those taxes.\n\nIn the interim, the US Department of Agriculture has offered some financial aid to farmers hurt by the tariffs – but it's not processing new applications during the shutdown. The agency said Tuesday that it would extend the application deadline by the number of days the government remains shut down, but won't pay out money until Congress votes to reopen.\n\nUncertainty is a problem, said Brian Duncan, who grows corn and soybeans and raises hogs in Illinois. We deal with enough uncertainty, the weather, the wind, snow, you name it. When you add more layers of uncertainty, it makes business more difficult.\n\nCNN's Vanessa Yurkevich contributed to this report.
Story highlights Nespresso coffee makers are seriously impressive In particular, the Nespresso Vertuo coffee and espresso maker offers a budget-friendly alternative to buying cafe coffee each day\n\n(CNN) —\n\nIf there's one topic people love to debate, it's coffee. Cold brew or French press? Is it ethical to buy from major coffee chains? Which country of origin produces the best beans? And, the list goes on.\n\nSince I love coffee, but want to avoid overcomplicating the matter, I'm leaving those questions up to the coffee connoisseurs of the world. Instead, when choosing a brewer, I went with the Nespresso ($249.95; surlatable.com) for several reasons we're about to discuss.\n\nThese stylish coffee makers have taken the coffee industry by storm and it's easy to see why. When I bought my Nespresso in the winter of 2017, I understood that I'd made the right choice for my lifestyle (and bank account), since I hardly missed those pricey lattes I used to buy on my way to work.\n\nThe reason folks will sometimes forgo at-home coffee makers is that they can be slow to brew and incapable of making a quality-tasting cup of joe. I needed a coffee machine that produces coffee quickly. With the Nespresso, I get exactly that - and it still tastes like a luxury experience.\n\nWhen it comes to setup and performance, that's where the Nespresso really shines. In the mornings, when I'm in a hurry, I can set up and brew a full cup of coffee in about a minute. Then, when it comes to cleanup, the convenient coffee capsules keep the mess enclosed, meaning the machine requires little to no maintenance on a daily basis.\n\nBelow, we've included step-by-step photos so that you can see for yourself just how easy the process is.\n\n1.

Bernie Ecclestone has been removed as F1 chief executive following Liberty Media's takeover.\n\nStory highlights Liberty Media completes $8B F1 takeover Bernie Ecclestone replaced as chief executive\n\n(CNN) —\n\nAfter almost four decades at the helm of Formula One, Bernie Ecclestone has been replaced as chief executive of the organization after Liberty Media completed its $8 billion takeover.\n\nChase Carey, vice chairman of 21st Century Fox, has been appointed to succeed the 86-year-old, although Ecclestone has been given an honorary role as chairman emeritus and will serve as an adviser to the new board.\n\nI'm proud of the business that I built over the last 40 years and all that I have achieved with Formula One, Ecclestone said in a statement released by Liberty Media.\n\nAnd would like to thank all of the promoters, teams, sponsors and television companies that I have worked with.\n\nI'm very pleased that the business has been acquired by Liberty and that it intends to invest in the future of F1.

Washington (CNN) The test for what the Republican Party will be in the wake of Donald Trump's presidency is coming in a little over 24 hours and on the heels of Georgia Senate runoffs that will finally determine the balance of the US Senate.\n\nBut the price Republicans could pay for defying Trump and certifying the results of a fair and free election is already coming into clear view.\n\nThe bottom line: The divide you are seeing rip through the Republican Party right now isn't between conservatives and moderates. This isn't the Freedom Caucus vs. leadership. It's not even as simple as members who might run for President in 2024 vs. those who will not. What you are seeing right now is a gamble members are taking on whether the GOP can finally shake Trump going forward or whether there is no way to win the White House again without him on their side.\n\nRepublican aides and members opposed to this effort are watching this play out and hoping that voters will have moved on from Trump in the next several years. The hope is that this vote does not become a litmus test for whether outside groups wage primary challenges against those who were not loyal to the President in his last days in office. Only time will tell how consequential this vote will really be. Still, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has warned members that for him, it is one of the most important of his career.\n\nThe heartburn for members right now\n\nthe For four years, and with exception of a few Republican members who have been more outspoken against Trump on a consistent basis, rank-and-file members have fallen in line behind Trump.\n\nMcConnell has undoubtedly been an ally, pushing through three Supreme Court justices for the President, remaking the courts and orchestrating a massive tax overhaul. Lawmakers gave Trump money for a wall. They waited out every impulse, tried hard not to see bombastic tweets, and now, if members aren't with the President on overturning the election, they are being ridiculed and attacked by him as if they never walked the line for him in the past.\n\nRepublican members and aides who had considered themselves allies of Trump on Capitol Hill aren't surprised the President demands loyalty, but they're clearly frustrated by the position they are in.\n\nIt is disappointing this vote has become the exclusive litmus test for whether or not a member of Congress stands with President Trump, Sen. Kevin Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota, said in a statement. One would have a hard time finding a more fervent, consistent, longstanding supporter of this President than I have been since he first announced his candidacy.\n\nAs one Republican aide put it to me, every member who is following Trump down this path to overturn the election has to remember that it will all be for nothing if they ever disagree with Trump down the line.\n\nIf you get on the Trump Train, it's not a buffet where you get to pick and choose what to take and what to leave. You are force fed everything, the aide said.\n\nWhat we know about Wednesday\n\nA joint session of Congress will convene at 1 p.m. ET. Members are being encouraged to watch the proceedings remotely given the pandemic, but it's just as likely that the chamber will be packed. Leadership offices have warned there is little they can do to discourage members from showing up for what is expected to be a historic moment.\n\nThe expectation is that Vice President Mike Pence will preside over the session. He was spotted meeting with the Senate's parliamentarian Sunday. Then, the four tellers: Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Republican Rep. Rodney Davis of Illinois and Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California will read and tally the votes from every state in alphabetical order.\n\nThis can be sped up if there is agreement: The entire process, for example, took just 40 minutes in 2017.\n\nAt each state, the vice president, in his role as the president of the Senate, will call to ask if there are any objections. If there is an objection it will have to come from one senator and one member of the House and be turned over in writing. At that point, the joint session breaks up, and both chambers debate separately for up to two hours. They will then vote on the objection and resume the joint session.\n\nGiven the safety protocols in the House of Representatives for voting, we expect that this process will take much longer for the House to get through every time the joint session is interrupted. Only twice have there been a formal Senate and House objection to the the tally. Once in 1969 and once in 2005. Both objections were voted down.\n\nWhat we still don't know\n\nWe still don't know how many official objections there will be. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican of Missouri, has made it clear he will object to at least Pennsylvania's results, but a source familiar with his thinking has said he is still reviewing whether he will object to other states as well. There is a long list of House members willing to sign onto objections from senators, but a senator has to sign on to make it a viable debate.\n\nWithout knowing how many states might be objected to, there is no way to predict how long Wednesday will go. We may get more clarity on Tuesday, but we may have to watch this play out in real time. I am told by a Senate GOP source that Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and the 11 members who signed a statement Saturday saying they will support objections are still considering whether they will object to particular states or merely vote for the objections that Hawley brings. The outcome of the Georgia election could also factor into senators' thinking: If GOP Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue both win, does that change the calculus for whether members want to challenge the state of Georgia, for example? Will members be ready to move on more quickly?\n\nThere's still a lot we don't know about how Wednesday will unfold. The mechanics of the day, while clearly spelled out by law, give individual members a lot of power over how long they can drag this out.\n\nOne last thing to remember\n\nFor years, McConnell has managed to keep his conference together through fights over the Supreme Court, a tax overhaul and even the passage of some of the largest stimulus packages in the country's history. He's legendary for his ability to use arcane Senate procedures to realize his political ambitions. The failure to repeal and replace Obamacare one of the only true defeats McConnell has suffered in his Senate tenure.\n\nBut the vote Wednesday was always outside his control. While he privately urged his members to stay away from it, cognizant it could affect members up for reelection in 2022, McConnell has largely told members to vote their conscience now that the vote will occur. Members and aides say McConnell has been a sounding board for members on the fence, but he realizes he cannot ultimately control the whims of every office. That's never been his style.\n\nThe breakdown in the Senate\n\nThose Republicans voting against a challenge:\n\nRob Portman of Ohio\n\nShelley Moore Capito of West Virginia\n\nTom Cotton of Arkansas\n\nLisa Murkowski of Alaska\n\nMitt Romney of Utah\n\nPat Toomey of Pennsylvania\n\nMike Lee of Utah\n\nKevin Cramer of North Dakota\n\nMitch McConnell of Kentucky\n\nJohn Thune of South Dakota\n\nRoy Blunt of Missouri\n\nJohn Cornyn of Texas\n\nSusan Collins of Maine\n\nBen Sasse of Nebraska\n\nJohn Hoeven of North Dakota\n\nThe Republicans voting for a challenge:\n\nTed Cruz of Texas\n\nJosh Hawley of Missouri\n\nRon Johnson of Wisconsin\n\nJames Lankford of Oklahoma\n\nCynthia Lummis of Wyoming\n\nJohn Kennedy of Louisiana\n\nSteve Daines of Montana\n\nMarsha Blackburn of Tennessee\n\nMike Braun of Indiana\n\nBill Hagerty of Tennessee\n\nTommy Tuberville of Alabama\n\nRoger Marshall of Kansas

(Photo by STR / AFP) / China OUT (Photo by STR/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nWhen Xi Jinping ascended the stage in the Great Hall of the People in March, officially the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, the country's future seemed his to shape.\n\nJust months earlier, he had been re-appointed General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, the country's most powerful position. Now he had begun a second term as the nation's president and secured the scrapping of term limits on the post – effectively allowing him to rule for life. Just two members of the National People's Congress voted against the change, out of 2,980.\n\nNine months later however, storm clouds are gathering.\n\nChina's economy has faltered in the face of US President Donald Trump's ongoing trade war, and tensions with Washington have spread to political and military issues.\n\nThere have even been rumors that Xi himself has come in for criticism behind closed doors for failing to adequately handle Trump and his policies.\n\nI don't think Xi's position is in any way under threat but he has a lot of enemies and critics and the collapsing relationship with the US is a stick they can use to beat him with, Richard McGregor, a senior fellow at Australia's Lowy Institute, told CNN.\n\nUnfortunately for Xi, the trade troubles come ahead of possibly his most important year yet. The Chinese leader must navigate a series of critical and controversial dates for the Communist Party, including the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.\n\nAt the same time, the clock is ticking on his trade truce with Trump, reached during their face-to-face meeting in Argentina early December, with just over two months left to bridge the gap between the two sides.\n\nXi's handling of events in 2019 could determine the future of China's economy and his place in the pantheon of Communist Party leaders.\n\nCommunist legacy\n\nEvery ten years, a series of important or controversial anniversaries creates a perfect storm for Beijing.\n\nFor Xi and the Communist Party, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1 will be a seminal occasion.\n\nThe party will celebrate both its economic success and its unexpected longevity – surpassing the lifespan of the Soviet Union, the one-time communist superpower which collapsed in 1991 after 69 years.\n\nRana Mitter, director of the University China Centre at Oxford University, told CNN that in the lead-up to the anniversary, Beijing would focus on glorifying the leaders of the Communist revolution.\n\nXi will seek to tie his current achievements to their legacy, he said.\n\nPHOTO: AFP/Getty Images Chinese Communist leaders Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, pictured four years before the People's Republic of China was founded. Experts say Xi will seek to tie his legacy to the former Chinese leaders.\n\nThis year also marks the 100th anniversary of the May 4th student protests in China, which were mainly a response to the betrayal of the country by Allied powers in the Treaty of Versailles following World War I – but which the Communist Party now claims as a precursor to its own creation.\n\nAnniversaries for the Chinese government aren't only about celebration and ceremony. They're often used as highly symbolic milestones for progress or new policies.\n\nFor instance, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party in 2021 has been set as the date for China to create a moderately well-off society.\n\nThere's obviously a sense that there will be a reckoning, a calculation up to this point of how the first 70 years have gone and plans for the next 70 years, Mitter said.\n\nPHOTO: AP Photo/Ng Han Guan Xi stands in a car to review the army during a parade commemorating the 70th anniversary of Japan's surrender during World War II in Beijing in 2015.\n\nCrackdown looms\n\nNot all important dates next year will be occasions to celebrate – there are some Xi would rather the world forgot.\n\nJune 4 marks 30 years since the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing, which caused possibly thousands of civilian deaths across the city in 1989 following pro-democracy protests.\n\nThere are few more sensitive events in China and no one on the mainland will be allowed to mark the occasion publicly. Any attempt to do so will quickly be shut down.\n\nAs in recent years, even the most roundabout references to the event get censors worked up and maybe even lead to arrests, Jeff Wasserstrom, Chancellor's Professor of History at UC Irvine, told CNN.\n\nWhile images of a man standing before a line of tanks are shown and described in various newspapers outside the mainland, on the Chinese internet even the word 'today' may be treated as subversive content.\n\nPHOTO: JEFF WIDENER/AP A Chinese man stands alone to block a line of tanks heading east on Beijing's Cangan Blvd. in Tiananmen Square on June 5, 1989.\n\nThis year also marks 20 years since Beijing's brutal crackdown on Falun Gong practitioners began and 60 years since the Dalai Lama fled Tibet, both occasions which the government will hope pass without mention.\n\nBut it isn't only sensitive dates which threaten to cause a headache for Xi in 2019. After decades of unprecedented growth across a number of fronts, the economy is slowing.\n\nAttempts to tackle soaring debt levels across the country have led to a slowdown in infrastructure and investment spending, while GDP growth rates have also slowed.\n\nEven the Communist Party's usually relentlessly positive official statements have become tinged with increasingly grim language.\n\nThe readout from the top-level Central Economic Work Conference in December spoke of profound changes in the external environment and added the party had worked hard to meet difficulties. In Communist Party bureaucrat speak, this is the equivalent of a warning klaxon.\n\nThese achievements were hard won, the readout said. As China's unchallenged leader on all matters economic, it will be Xi's job to turn the ship around.\n\nPHOTO: WANG ZHAO/AFP/Getty Images China's President Xi Jinping arrives for a celebration meeting marking the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening up in Beijing on December 18.\n\n'The Chinese would take hardship again'\n\nWhile Xi faces extensive domestic problems and challenges in 2019, it could be external factors which weigh the heaviest on him.\n\nBeijing faces growing pushback from the United States across a range of fronts, from economic to politics and the military.\n\nThroughout 2018, Trump steadily ramped up US tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods while demanding Beijing end its massive fiscal support for industrial research and development.\n\nCurrently the trade war is on hold until March 1, following personal negotiations between Trump and Xi. This leaves the Chinese President with a stressful start to the year – trying to placate the US while not giving too much away.\n\nEven if Xi can end the trade crisis, the Trump administration has opened new fronts in its disputes with Beijing, including a growing presence in the South China Sea and pushback over Chinese economic espionage.\n\nThere have been hints Xi may not expect a quick resolution to the Trump trade standoff. In a key speech in the Great Hall of the People on December 18, he seemed to be trying to prepare his domestic audience for a more lengthy dispute, warning how greatness was achieved through hardship.\n\nCables leaked to the New York Times, revealing details of a China summit with the European Union, quoted Xi as saying, China (has) been through poverty and hardship when it was under the blockade. The Chinese would take hardship again.\n\nWasserstrom said Trump's opposition to China's economic development might be the one silver lining for Xi in a difficult situation.\n\nEconomic times are going to get tougher in China and this leads to discontent. But now there's an ability to blame a lot of those hard times on the US, he said.\n\nTrouble brewing\n\nIronically it was Xi's victory in removing presidential term limits which has left him vulnerable as the trade war intensifies.\n\nIn the past two years, power in China has increasingly been concentrated in the hands of the Communist Party. Inside the party, Xi has clearly consolidated his control.\n\nNowhere was this more apparent than in his removal of term limits. But by placing himself so clearly at the top of the pyramid, experts said Xi has left himself vulnerable to criticism when things go wrong.\n\nThe Party Secretary is responsible for the relationship with the United States and the way it's run off the rails exposes Xi to a lot of criticism, McGregor, the Australian China expert, told CNN.\n\nThere is a growing impression in Beijing, and among experts, that the Chinese government underestimated Trump, believing they had the US leader under control after waging a charm offensive in 2017.\n\nTrump's rapid action against China has left its leaders reconsidering their approach to international diplomacy, with some questioning Xi's tough rhetoric and aggressive stance in recent years.\n\nMeanwhile, economic liberals are beginning to use the Trump tariffs as an excuse to push for greater liberalization of China's economy, contrary to Xi's desire for greater state and party control.\n\nHeading into the new year, the Chinese leader must maintain a delicate balance between conciliation, patriotism, pro-market reforms and government control as pressure grows on him.\n\nIf Xi fails to lead his country successfully through the coming troubles, his dreams of a lengthy spell at the top could be cut short, Mitter said.\n\nMaking it possible to have more than two terms doesn't make it certain that person will have more than two terms, he said.

(GREG BAKER/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nIf this is the cup I must take, I will drink with no regret.\n\nBenny Tai was defiant and emotional as he faced the court. Outside, he and his fellow defendants raised their fists and supporters displayed yellow umbrellas, the symbol of Hong Kong's beleaguered pro-democracy movement.\n\nThat movement is looking shakier than ever, as Tai and others begin the new year facing possible jail time – up to seven years in prison – for their roles in inspiring the 2014 Umbrella Movement, when tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the semi-autonomous Chinese city demanding elections free of Beijing's interference.\n\nSeveral thousand people – including former Umbrella leaders – took part in a traditional New Year's march Tuesday, warning of shrinking freedoms and issuing a call for greater democracy. They were joined by a small group of pro-independence demonstrators, some of whom said they faced harassment and intimidation ahead of the gathering.\n\nOn Wednesday, a spokesman for the Hong Kong government reiterated its zero tolerance on 'Hong Kong independence'.\n\nPolice and organizers estimated the crowd to be roughly half that of last year's march, which will be a concern for the pro-democracy camp as they face a difficult 2019. The prosecution of Tai and his co-defendants could pale in comparison to what some fear will happen if the Hong Kong government, under pressure from China, moves to pass a hugely controversial anti-sedition law.\n\nCritics say this could criminalize swathes of opposition figures, ranging from pro-democracy activists and separatists to religious minorities and media figures critical of Beijing.\n\nPHOTO: ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Baptist minister Chu Yiu-ming, 74, law professor Benny Tai, 54, and sociology professor Chan Kin-man, 59, shout slogans with supporters before entering the West Kowloon Magistrates Court in Hong Kong on November 19, 2018.\n\nTai, a mild-mannered Hong Kong University professor with a round clean-shaven face and thin-rimmed glasses, was a marginal political figure when, in January 2013, he proposed a civil disobedience campaign to pressure the government to introduce universal political suffrage — a long overdue promise of Hong Kong's de facto constitution known as the Basic Law.\n\nUnlikely icon\n\nJoined by fellow professor Chan Kin-man and Reverend Chu Yiu-ming, Tai launched Occupy Central with Love and Peace later that year, with a protest date set for October 2014.\n\nWe shall be like preachers communicating enthusiastically with different communities to convey universal values such as democracy, universal and equal suffrage, justice and righteousness, he said at the time, adding he hoped Hong Kongers will be willing to pay the price.\n\nHong Kongers were willing, and then some. In late September 2014, a student boycott movement led by Joshua Wong's Scholarism and the Hong Kong Federation of Students (HKFS) attempted to occupy Civic Square, a traditional protest venue outside Hong Kong's legislature. After police used pepper spray and later tear gas on the mostly teenaged protesters, thousands of outraged Hong Kongers took to the streets.\n\nThe demonstration spiraled from there, with pro-democracy protesters occupying main roads in parts of the city for months, shutting down traffic and defying police and counter-protesters' attempts to remove them.\n\nPolice were finally able to clear the last protesters in December 2014, after 79 days.\n\nPHOTO: Paula Bronstein/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images 2014's Umbrella Movement was a pivotal moment for Hong Kong's democracy movement.\n\nPyrrhic victories\n\nIf the Umbrella Movement was a high point for Hong Kong's democrats, it's been largely downhill from there.\n\nEven apparent opposition successes, such as those in September 2016 legislative elections, have turned out to be pyrrhic victories. Multiple lawmakers elected that year have since been turfed out of office on dubious legal grounds.\n\nWong, along with HKFS leaders Nathan Law and Alex Chow, was briefly jailed in 2017, and continues to face the threat of further prison time. Other activists have also faced court hearings, as analysts warned of a deliberate slow drip of prosecutions designed to sap the pro-democracy movement.\n\nRestrictions on political speech have grown, with the pro-independence Hong Kong National Party led by Andy Chan officially banned under public security laws, the first time these had been used against a political organization.\n\nIn the wake of that ban, Victor Mallet, a Financial Times journalist from Britain who had hosted a speech featuring Chan, had his application for a visa renewal rejected — a move which many saw as a blow against press freedom.\n\nPHOTO: ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Activists hold flags which read Hong Kong Independence and Hong Kong Is Not China during a gathering outside the government headquarters to mark the fourth anniversary of mass pro-democracy rallies, known as the Umbrella Movement, in Hong Kong on September 28, 2018.\n\nPolitical litmus tests are increasingly becoming the norm. The latest victim was Eddie Chu, who was recently barred from standing in a local poll because an election official ruled that he had defended independence as an option to Hong Kongers, even though he himself disavowed separatism. Bizarrely, Chu currently sits in the city's top legislature – raising questions over whether he can retain that position if deemed unsuitable to run for a more junior one, or if he will become the latest pro-democracy lawmaker ejected from office.\n\nThese repeated setbacks have had an impact on the broader opposition movement, and protest fatigue is also a factor in a city which has become famous for them. Numbers at anti-government demonstrations have fallen and many in the pro-democracy camp are seemingly at a loss on the way ahead in the face of an increasingly aggressive establishment.\n\nIn November, the opposition camp flunked a major test when its candidate failed by a wide margin to hang on to the legislative seat of Lau Siu-lai, who had herself been expelled in 2017. As a result pro-democracy lawmakers were unable to regain veto power in the city's legislature, a development which could clear the way for the government to introduce its controversial anti-sedition legislation.\n\nPHOTO: ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Protestors take part in a National Day pro-democracy rally in Hong Kong on October 1, 2018.\n\nWorrying future\n\nArticle 23 of the Basic Law instructs the local government to enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the Central People's Government … and to prohibit political organizations or bodies of the Region from establishing ties with foreign political organizations or bodies.\n\nAn attempt to implement such a law in 2003 drew half a million people onto the streets, demanding the resignation of Hong Kong's first Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa. He stepped down less than two years later. The protest is often pointed to as an example of the greater political freedoms which Hong Kongers enjoy compared to mainland Chinese.\n\nPHOTO: PETER PARKS/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Trams sit stranded as hundreds of thousands of people block the streets in a huge protest march against a controversial anti-subversion law known as Article 23 in Hong Kong in 2003.\n\nSince then, Article 23 has loomed over Hong Kong politics, either a bogeyman or a panacea depending on one's ideological bent. While the immediate effects of an anti-sedition law are likely overstated by its opponents (the police are probably not going to start rounding up pro-democracy legislators), it could have a major psychological and chilling effect in curbing a famously truculent body politic.\n\nSelf-censorship, while difficult to measure, is also seen as an increasing problem. As the cost of dissent has risen in Hong Kong, there are signs of a growing wariness among some sectors of society.\n\nIn November, two events featuring Chinese dissidents were called off amid apparent fears of repercussions from Beijing. One eventually went ahead after strong public pressure on the event venue to change course.\n\nPHOTO: ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Article 23 of Hong Kong's Basic Law, an anti-sedition clause, has long loomed over the city's politics.\n\nChu, the lawmaker barred in December from standing in a local poll, accused the government of moving the goalposts to intimidate people against speaking out, lest their comments be used against them one day.\n\nThe political logic … comes from the Cultural Revolution, where everyone had to be thought police, he added.\n\nIn his closing statement to the court in December, Tai said the Occupy movement was ultimately intended to pursue justice and he had no regrets about standing up for Hong Kong's future.\n\nThe purpose of civil disobedience is not to obstruct the public, but to arouse public concern to the injustice in society and to win sympathy from the public, he said.\n\nI am not afraid or ashamed of going to prison. If we were to be guilty, we will be guilty for daring to share hope at this difficult time in Hong Kong.\n\nThe court will hand down its verdict on April 9, 2019.
(CNN) As the Rev. Raphael Warnock makes history by being elected the first Black US senator from Georgia , he's thinking of the remarkable journey of his mother.\n\nVerlene Warnock spent her summers picking cotton and tobacco as a teen in Waycross, Georgia, in the 1950s before becoming a pastor.\n\nBecause this is America, the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else's cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator, Warnock said in a speech shortly after midnight Wednesday.\n\nHer story was not uncommon. In the Jim Crow South, many poor Black people built savings by working in the fields because it was almost impossible for them to own land, said Karlos Hill, chair of African-American studies at the University of Oklahoma.\n\nAt 82, Verlene Warnock still preaches at Bible and Prayer Ministries , her church in Savannah.\n\nAnd her son, the 11th of 12 children, is going to Congress.\n\nRaphael Warnock edged incumbent Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler in a hotly contested race that could dictate which party controls the Senate. Throughout his campaign, Warnock has described his candidacy, and his family's story, as encapsulating the American dream.\n\nHis father, the late Rev. Jonathan Warnock, was also a Pentecostal pastor and a World War II veteran who salvaged abandoned cars. He and his wife of 42 years struggled to raise their 12 kids in public housing in the coastal city of Savannah, which Warnock says taught him the value of hard work.\n\nThe man who saw the value in a junk car that another person had thrown away during the week preached to people who themselves felt discarded, Warnock told CNN last month.\n\nWarnock's triumph\n\nWarnock followed in his father's footsteps and is a senior pastor at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King served as co-pastor. Black voters in Atlanta, the cradle of the civil rights movement, and its suburbs turned out in big numbers to help him win the seat.\n\nWarnock, 51, will become the first Black Democrat to represent a Southern state in the Senate.\n\nIn an election year marked by bitterness and division, the election of a Black Southerner to the Senate is stunning, Warnock said.\n\nThat's why I love this country so much and I refuse to give in to the forces of cynicism, he said. It takes hard work. Change is slow, often it comes in fits and starts.\n\nWarnock said he plans to return to the pulpit Sunday mornings to preach even after he goes to Washington.\n\nThe last thing I want to do is become disconnected from the community and just spend all of my time talking to the politicians ... I have no intentions of becoming a politician, I intend to be a public servant, he said.\n\nMany Black Southerners still picked cotton well into the 20th century\n\nWarnock's victory is a sort of a full-circle moment for his mother, who overcame discrimination in the Jim Crow South.\n\nSlavery had long been abolished, but many Black Americans in the early 1900s worked as sharecroppers -- tenant farmers who labored on plantations in exchange for housing and food.\n\nAnd some Black people in states such as Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina and Louisiana were still picking cotton in the mid-1900s despite mechanization.\n\nThe system often left Black workers in debt to landowners and vulnerable to being exploited, Hill said.\n\nYou had in many instances Whites who owned the land, who owned the tools of production, the seeds to cultivate the cotton crop, Hill said. The only thing that Black people brought to the table was their labor. Often times, the White landowner would not give them their fair share from the proceeds of the sale of the cotton.\n\nLaborers who worked in the fields were paid based on how much cotton they picked, keeping many Black families in poverty with limited options to succeed, he said.\n\nMore than half a century after she left those fields, Verlene Warnock's son is set to become one of the most powerful men in the South -- and the country.
(CNN) —\n\nThe race to court Hillary Clinton has begun.\n\nThe former secretary of state and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee has talked about the 2020 election with Sen. Kamala Harris, Sen. Cory Booker, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, according to two sources close to Clinton, and there are plans for her to talk with other contenders.\n\nThe meetings with Clinton are a sign that potential Democratic presidential candidates see value in her endorsement. Clinton maintains a devoted group of supporters around the country (she won over 65 million votes just two years ago) and a strong fundraising network.\n\nThe sources close to Clinton tell CNN that the five Democrats she has met with and others waiting for a meeting are asking for her support if they run.\n\nPeople are direct in saying they want her support, the source said. Others are reaching out.\n\nThe assumption among people around Clinton is that the former nominee will sit out the Democratic primary and get behind the eventual nominee, but one source cautioned that things could change based on how the primary plays out.\n\nSpokespeople for Harris, Warren, Booker and Garcetti declined to comment. A spokesperson from Hickenlooper did not respond to CNN's request for comment.\n\nAxios was first to report that some potential Democratic candidates were meeting with Clinton.\n\nNick Merrill, Clinton's spokesman, also declined to comment on the substance of the meetings.\n\nI won't comment on private discussions she's had except to say that she's more than happy to talk to anyone considering a run about the challenges (as well as the great things) that go with it, and lessons learned on what to watch for in this next cycle (aside from Vladimir), Merrill said.\n\nCNN's MJ Lee and Rebecca Buck contributed to this report.
Stephy Chung , CNN Written by\n\nThere are plenty of unusual museums in the world -- museums for sex, museums for ice cream, museums for hair. But they all rely on a tried-and-tested formula: presenting (mostly) inanimate objects on white walls, atop plinths or in glass boxes.\n\nThen there is the altogether different proposition put forth by experimental Japanese art collective, teamLab. Comprised of self-described ultra-technologists -- which includes designers, computer scientists, engineers and programmers -- the group, in collaboration with Tokyo-based urban developer Mori Building, plans to open a 107,000 square-foot museum (10,000 square meters) in Tokyo covered entirely with digital works.\n\nInteractive, digital art by the collective, is expected to fill and move across the walls and floors. According to teamLab's communications director, Takashi Kudo, it will make for an immersive experience.\n\nEvery day will be a different experience, he said in a phone interview. There are different monitors and projectors (and) people can become part of the work. It's borderless and transcends boundaries.\n\nWhen you create something, there are already boundaries. If you make it on canvas, there are boundaries; if you make a sculpture, you can't change it. But for digital (art), you can always change, because the digital world doesn't really exist. We want to really bring people inside our artworks.\n\nRooted in nature\n\nImmersive digital experiences are relatively new to the established art world, but teamLab has been exploring the field for more than 15 years.\n\nTh museum, which will open to the public this week, will expand upon ideas and technologies used from the collective's previous work, which includes interactive installations shown in galleries as far afield as London, Sydney and Istanbul.\n\n'Ultra-technologists' to open digital-only museum in Tokyo\n\nMost recent among teamLab's portfolio is Walk, Walk, Walk: Search, Deviate, Reunite, which opened at the National Gallery Singapore earlier this month. Inside the installation, visitors are invited to stroll among cherry blossoms and bamboo forests, passing digital pedestrians who change direction and respond to real-life movements.\n\nThe multidisciplinary collective has also chosen to operate outside of standard museum spaces, projecting its work outdoors. In A Forest Where Gods Live, teamLab took over an Edo-period pleasure garden, using lights, projections, sensors and sound as tools (and rocks, trees and plants as canvases). The exhibition included a giant, simulated waterfall, and thousands of azalea bushes that lit up to greet visitors.\n\nSuch installations reflect the collective's mission to explore the relationship between humanity and nature. From landscape paintings to ikebana (flower arranging), Japanese art has long looked to its surroundings for inspiration. The group's new, permanent space, to be located in Tokyo's Odaiba district, will continue to explore these concepts, through new works.\n\nWe try to find the relationship of the human and the world, Kudo said, explaining that the distinction between the two is blurry. In Japan, nature, and humans (are together as) one part of nature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 20 – Mifuneyama Rakuen Park A Forest Where Gods Live (2017) by teamLab was set in a large, beautiful park in Kyushu, southern Japan. Credit: teamLab\n\nArt's digital frontier\n\nSo while teamLab has its eyes firmly set on the future, its connection with nature arguably makes the collective part of a longstanding tradition.\n\nThis unique approach puts teamLab at the vanguard of an art world that is still feeling out the potential risks and rewards of going digital. Art that can be more easily packaged and sold -- such as virtual reality software -- can be just as easily copied, free of charge.\n\nThe permanent museum space, to be named Mori Building Digital Art Museum teamLab Borderless, will open in the summer of 2018. By collaborating with teamLab, we hope this 'digital art museum' will become a new destination for tourists, art lovers and museum-goers, and also reinforce the appeal and status of Tokyo, said Mori Building project manager Ou Sugiyama. Credit: teamLab\n\nInteractive installations may work in a museum setting, but questions remain over how to price and sell artworks that are often highly experiential, according to Peter Boris, executive vice president of Pace Gallery, which has hosted four teamLab exhibitions in recent years.\n\nAlthough we do sell teamLab monitor-based works in the gallery, large-scale environments are too big for all but a few collectors, corporations or museums, he said in an email interview.\n\nSo with large-scale installations, we are not so much selling objects as we are selling an experience.\n\nThe production costs of building the immersive environments, and the tech team required to make it work, are really substantial -- often millions of dollars. The business model becomes more like entertainment, movies, theater, music (so) we have made it work by selling tickets.\n\nPace London exhibited teamLab's Transcending Boundaries, in 2017. teamLab expressed a sense of wonderment about the new digital world that was not rational, said executive vice president of Pace Gallery, Peter Boris, of first coming across teamLab's works. It was calm, undefended, and joyful. Credit: teamLab\n\nNonetheless, for teamLab's Takashi Kudo, this makes digital production no different from any other artistic process.\n\nWe think this is craftsmanship, he said. We're creators (and) we believe in experiencing something that can change our way of thinking, our values -- something that can give us dreams for our future.\n\nWe don't know if our output is 'art' or not. Maybe that will be decided in 100 years. But we try to create something we believe in.
Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n\nNew York Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge crushed his 30th home run of the 2017 season Friday night against the Milwaukee Brewers to pass Yanks legend Joe DiMaggio for the most homers by a rookie in team history.\n\nThe Yankees celebrated the feat on social media:\n\nJudge is putting together a remarkable rookie campaign. Along with his 30 home runs, his batting average is hovering around .330, and he's closing in on 70 runs batted in, which places him firmly in the Triple Crown race with the All-Star break coming next week.\n\nThe 25-year-old right fielder always possessed elite power potential, but it was hard to predict this type of season was on the horizon.\n\nIn 84 at-bats across 27 games with the Yankees last season, he posted a miserable .179/.263/.345 slash line with four homers. While it was a small sample size, he looked light years away from becoming a top MVP candidate.\n\nThat's exactly where he'll stand heading into the second half.\n\nBefore that, however, Judge will put his pop on display in the Home Run Derby. Pete Caldera of NorthJersey.com noted the slugger is trying not to treat it as a high-profile contest, though.\n\nVideo Play Button Videos you might like\n\nI'm just going to take normal BP, I'm not going to try to change anything, Judge said. I feel like my BPs have felt good, [a] nice, easy swing, not too hard.\n\nIt would be difficult to consider anybody else the favorite, even reigning champion Giancarlo Stanton, based on the first half the Yankees outfielder has put together.
(CNN) —\n\nThe US Air Force Academy mismanaged its sexual assault prevention and response program during the 2017 academic year and failed to comply with the military's victim assistance and advocacy policy, according to the Department of Defense's annual assessment of service academies released Wednesday.\n\nOverall, the Pentagon's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office's assessment found that reporting of sexual assault at the service academies increased in the 2017 school year – documenting a total of 112 reports of sexual assault, up from 86 reports received in the prior year.\n\nMost of the reporting increase occurred at the US Military Academy following a change in reporting policy and the relocation of its victim assistance office, according to the DOD.\n\nWe are absolutely committed to making the Academies safe, Robert Wilkie, under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness, said in a press release. It is imperative that these future officers understand how eliminating sexual harassment and assault advances our ability to protect the nation.\n\nBased on feedback from focus groups involving 188 cadets/midshipmen, and 107 faculty, and staff participants, the report revealed that most cadets and midshipmen knew how to report and obtain support should they experience a sexual assault.\n\nBut while it concluded that the US Military Academy and US Naval Academy were in compliance with Pentagon policies that govern sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention, victim assistance and advocacy, investigation, accountability, and assessment, the report determined that the mismanagement of victim response programs at the Air Force Academy did not meet that standard.\n\nSexual assault prevention and response program mismanagement at the US Air Force Academy put it out of compliance with Department and Air Force victim assistance and advocacy policy, the report said. Given this discrepancy, the Air Force Academy is in partial compliance overall.\n\nAllegations late in the academic year prompted a commander directed investigation at the Air Force Academy which disclosed significant evidence of mismanagement and unprofessionalism that negatively impacted victim advocacy and assistance rendered to a number of cadets, the assessment stated.\n\nWhile the Air Force Academy investigated and took steps to correct these problems, greater oversight of response programs and personnel is required at all three Academies, it said.\n\nThe DOD report did not detail the specific nature of these problems.\n\nResponding to the report, the Air Force deputy director of public affairs, Capt. Matthew Chism, said in a statement: As expected as a result of the Academy's finding and reporting misconduct on the part of individuals within its Sexual Assault Prevention and Response office, the Academy was found not in compliance in one of the five goals assessed in the report, the goal of victim assistance and advocacy.\n\nWe are confident that we have addressed the issues in the SAPR office at the Academy and will continue to scrutinize our efforts and remain transparent as we strive to develop a culture of dignity and respect at the Academy, he added.\n\nThe report also noted that compliance with policy does not guarantee effective programs and practices and identified several actions for each academy to better address the issue.\n\nProvide cadets and midshipmen with prevention skills and education that are both relevant to their current circumstances and their future roles as officers.\n\nEnhance preparation of military officers and senior enlisted leaders so they may more effectively promote and teach about climates of dignity and respect.\n\nEnact an oversight process for the assistance rendered by Sexual Assault Response Coordinators and Victim Advocates.\n\nOperationalize the Department's sexual harassment definition for the academy environment and expand services and support for cadets and midshipmen who desire to address it.\n\nEstablish or enhance a centralized data assessment and reporting resource.\n\nReducing the number of future sexual assault victims requires new approaches and resources above what are currently provided for response programs, the report said, adding that service academies are unique environments that require programs tailored to their specific circumstances.\n\nNew initiatives require a sustained effort and a long-term view to give such efforts the best chances for success over time, the report concluded.\n\nCNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report
Story highlights You're more likely to stick to a resolution by implementing small changes Mansour suggests you leave a pair of sneakers at the door as a reminder to work out\n\nEditor's Note: Stephanie Mansour is a weight-loss and lifestyle coach for women and author of Step It Up With Steph blog. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the author.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nAlready having a hard time keeping your New Year's resolutions?\n\nThe National Institutes of Health says you're more likely to stick to a change in your routine by taking one small step at a time – so break down your resolutions into bite-size chunks.\n\nIt's helpful to envision your overall goal, but putting one foot in front of the other is easier than jumping in with two feet. Here are some simple tips to get you back on track.\n\nPHOTO: Courtesy Stephanie Mansour Stephanie Mansour\n\nFirst, keep your health on the forefront of your brain. You can do this by integrating health and fitness into your everyday life.\n\nFor example, how many times a day do you walk in and out of your house? Put an extra pair of gym shoes by the door. They'll remind you that all you need to do is put on workout clothes, lace up and hit the gym or work out at home.\n\nSpeaking of working out at home, break down your workout plan into small parts. Instead of committing to an hour a day at the gym, make 30 minutes your goal. Reduce the length of your workout to make it less intimidating.\n\nIf you're constantly snacking on unhealthy foods, that's a problem. Try this: place an obstacle between you and those snacks. Line up water bottles on a shelf in the fridge, blocking fattening leftovers or desserts that you find yourself going back to multiple times a day.\n\nYou can do this in your pantry, too. Place water bottles in front of bags of chips, crackers, or cookies.\n\nThen drink a full bottle before eating something unhealthy.\n\nIf you're a nighttime eater, try this trick: Make eating less enticing by putting something on your hands, such as lotion. You can even paint your nails instead. You wouldn't want to ruin your fresh manicure by digging into a bag of chips, and you wouldn't want to eat candy that tastes like lotion.\n\nFinally, focus on positive affirmations. Studies show that saying positive things to yourself helps improve your body image and self-esteem.\n\nWrite out a positive affirmation on a sticky note. Place these notes on your bathroom mirror or someplace that you look at daily. Then, you are in essence training your brain to think positive thoughts about yourself.
New York (CNN Business) Apple has been fighting gravity for years, and it's starting to lose the battle.\n\nThe iPhone is by far Apple's most important product, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the company's sales last year. But iPhone sales have flatlined since 2015, frustrating the millions of investors in one of the market's most widely held stocks.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook has a plan: Bump up the iPhone's price and sell customers services and other devices, like Apple Music and the Apple Watch, to go with them. Cook's strategy has paid off. Apple set sales and profit records a year ago, and it eclipsed a $1 trillion market valuation in August.\n\nApple may need to eat some humble pie for a while. I'm not saying they'll turn into Dell, but they may have to cut prices.\n\nBut gravity is starting to win. In November, the company rattled investors when it decided to stop breaking out iPhone sales — not exactly a sign of strength. On Wednesday, Apple ( AAPL ) warned that it would miss its sales target for the previous quarter , mainly because of weak iPhone demand in China.\n\nApple's stock has fallen 36% since October 3. By last week, Apple had fallen behind Amazon ( AMZN ), Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Alphabet ( GOOGL ) in market value. Apple has lost $500 billion in market value over the past three months.\n\nIt's not time to panic: Apple remains a healthy company and could survive on inertia alone for years. Despite its revised outlook, Apple still expects to report $84 billion in quarterly sales. That's a ton of money: That single quarter would be enough to rank No. 33 in last year's Fortune 500.\n\nStill, it's lower than last year's holiday quarter, and investors demand growth. If Apple wants to grow again, it's time for a new plan.\n\nTim Cook (right) has extracted every last penny out of the iPhone that Steve Jobs created, but it's time for Apple to come up with a new plan.\n\nApple's innovator's dilemma\n\nCook's predecessor, the late Steve Jobs, was a product genius. He knew what consumers wanted before most knew they wanted it. During his second stint as Apple CEO, from 1997 to 2011, he oversaw the revitalization of Macintosh, the music-industry-altering iPod and the world-changing iPhone.\n\nWhen Jobs died in 2011, skeptics believed the company's unprecedented run of success would quickly end.\n\nCook, Jobs' top lieutenant, was an operations guru, building Apple's network of partners into the world's most respected supply chain. He was an expert at maximizing the company's efficiency, but there was only so much blood he could squeeze from the stone before Apple would need another big product, critics argued.\n\nThe skeptics were wrong. Cook has done a masterful job extracting every last penny out of the iPhone money-printing machine that Steve Jobs created. A year ago, Apple reported a record $88.3 billion in quarterly sales, and it generated $20.1 billion in profit — the best quarterly earnings of any American company in history. Apple has $237 billion in cash, more than the annual economic output of many medium-sized European nations.\n\nBut after Jobs died, Apple failed to deliver a groundbreaking innovation that came close to matching the iPhone's success. The Apple Watch is the most successful new product Cook's team devised. It is selling relatively well, but it's such a small business that Apple didn't bother breaking out Watch sales (even in those heady days when Apple used to break out segment revenue). Data tracker IDC estimates Apple sold about 20 million watches last year.\n\nApple has been accused of lacking innovation for most of the Cook era. The company's frustrated marketing chief Phil Schiller famously exclaimed, Can't innovate anymore, my ass! when introducing the new Mac Pro in 2013. Ironically, Apple still sells the same, now-very-outdated Mac Pro five years later. The MacBook Air had gone four years without an update until October, and the iPhone 8 was essentially the same phone (with improved guts) as the iPhone 6, 6S and 7.\n\nYou're not going to pluck a Steve Jobs out of a genie jar, said Laura DiDio, tech industry analyst at ITIC. Apple needed to make some moves.\n\nLacking a next big thing, Cook went with the next best thing: He banked on the iPhone's continued success.\n\nTrouble with the iPhone\n\nDespite dozens of successful smartphone competitors, Apple's iPhone remains a runaway hit.\n\nBut iPhone sales have stagnated — Apple sold fewer iPhones in each of the past three years than it sold in 2015, when Apple debuted the iPhone 6. If iPhone sales fell last quarter, they will have dropped in six of the past 12 quarters.\n\nA spokesman for Apple declined to comment.\n\nThe problem isn't unique to Apple. The entire smartphone market has shrunk in each of the past four quarters, according to IDC.\n\nChina isn't the full picture, said Nigel Vaz, emerging markets and Asia-Pacific CEO of Publicis, a digital consultancy. The mobile market is maturing, and customers can no longer be relied upon to upgrade every time a new iPhone is released.\n\nThe mobile market is maturing, and customers can no longer be relied upon to upgrade every time a new iPhone is released. Nigel Vaz, emerging markets and Asia-Pacific CEO of Publicis\n\nApple has few places left from which it can extract growth. The Chinese market is shrinking because of a slowing economy, and other developed markets are reaching saturation.\n\nThere's some weakness outside of China as well, Cook admitted in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday. I would have liked to have done better in some of our developed markets.\n\nIndia is an obvious growth market, with 900 million people still without smartphones. That's a lot of potential iPhone customers. Yet Apple refuses to price the iPhone for the Indian market , yielding market share — and mind share — to low-cost phone makers including Samsung, Oppo and Xiaomi.\n\nTo make up for flat sales, Apple has raised the price of the iPhone . Last year, Apple introduced the iPhone X, the first dramatic change to the iPhone since the iPhone 6. It came with a significantly heftier price tag: $999. That was $300 more expensive than the iPhone 8. The iPhone XS Max starts at $1,099.\n\nThe pricing experiment has been an astounding success: IPhone revenue was up 18% last year despite flat unit sales.\n\nBut Apple can't hike prices forever. At some point, customers are going to reach their limit and will refuse to pony up so much money for iPhones. Alternatively, customers will keep their older iPhones longer or buy year-old or two-year-old iPhones that Apple sells at a discount.\n\nThat's already happening in China, which Cook blamed on a souring macroeconomic environment. Evidence suggests it's starting to happen in the United States, too. The average selling price of an iPhone soared 23% last year, turning off some potential customers, said Gene Munster, Apple analyst with Loop Ventures, in a blog post last week.\n\nThe price hike did not take, Munster said. IPhone demand was not as price-elastic as Apple imagined.\n\nBut in other markets, Cook blamed Apple-specific problems that the company can control. We're not going to sit around waiting for the macro to change, Cook told CNBC. We're going to focus really deeply on the things we can control.\n\nThe items Apple can control, Cook said, were services — part two of his master plan to grow without a big new product.\n\nThe services solution ... and problem\n\nTo make up for the innovation stagnation, Cook & Co. went all-in on the company's services business , which includes the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. It started selling Apple Care insurance as a part of a package that let people buy new iPhones every year. And Apple opened its own studio, developing exclusive content for its products, including Carpool Karaoke and a Shark Tank-like show called Planet of the Apps starring Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nJust as investors hang on to services as Apple's life preserver in the choppy seas, it is going to float away. Benjamin Schachter, analyst at Macquarie Capital\n\nIn his interview with CNBC Wednesday, Cook pointed out that Apple hit sales records for each of its various services. He also said Apple started a trade-in program, which helps people reduce the purchase price of new iPhones.\n\nServices and Apple's products-not-named-the-iPhone, Mac or iPad are the company's fastest-growing businesses. Services grew 24% last year, and other products, including the Apple Watch, Apple TV and HomePod, grew 35%. But those two business units combined only made up one fifth of Apple's total sales.\n\nApple is famous for its walled garden approach to software, for the most part limiting its software and services to customers who buy its hardware. To maintain its services momentum, Apple is loosening up its restrictions on who can use them. Apple announced in November that Apple Music would become available on Amazon's Echo speakers. And Sunday, Samsung said it will put an iTunes app on its smart TVs\n\nBut services can't keep growing in a straight line forever. Apple is dealing with some high-profile defections, including Netflix ( NFLX ), which recently dealt Apple a blow by refusing to allow new customers to sign up for the service on the App Store, preventing Apple from collecting those lucrative commissions. And China's crackdown on video games is a huge threat to Apple. China represents 40% of Apple's App Store revenue — 90% of which is from video game sales, according to Macquarie Capital.\n\nEven if those challenges weren't present, services just isn't a big enough business to offset the slowdown in iPhone sales.\n\nJust as investors hang on to services as Apple's life preserver in the choppy seas, it is going to float away, said Benjamin Schachter, analyst at Macquarie Capital.\n\nWithout a next big thing, Apple will continue to rely on the iPhone as its cash cow. But when your cash cow stops growing, you're in trouble.\n\nFrustrated with a languishing stock price, Microsoft asked Steve Ballmer (left) to step aside. In 2014, it promoted Satya Nadella to CEO.\n\nThe Microsoft answer\n\nApple's iPhone dilemma is similar to the situation Microsoft found itself in earlier in the decade.\n\nGenerating the bulk of its sales from Windows and Office, Microsoft was loathe to disrupt its money-making machine. Microsoft notoriously killed off a tablet device that would have beaten Apple's iPad to the market by years. The reason: It didn't run Windows.\n\nCEO Steve Ballmer wanted to protect the legacy of his predecessor, the legendary Bill Gates. But the handwriting was on the wall: The PC boom was over, and customers weren't buying new computers every few years the way they had in the past.\n\nBallmer, a career salesman and — much like Cook — an operations expert, had a decision to make: Continue focusing most of Microsoft's resources on a slowly sinking ship or invest in growth areas to change the company's direction.\n\nBallmer chose neither. He directed Microsoft to buy Nokia's cell phone business for nearly $8 billion in 2013, hoping to leverage Nokia's huge customer base to make Windows as prevalent on smartphones as it was on PCs. The bet was a tremendous failure.\n\nMicrosoft was super late to the smartphone game. App makers didn't want to develop for Windows Phone. Android and iPhone customers weren't interested in switching. Microsoft wrote down virtually the entire value of its purchase two years later.\n\nFrustrated with a stock price that had languished for more than a decade, Microsoft asked Ballmer to step aside. In 2014, it promoted Satya Nadella, head of Microsoft's nascent cloud division, to run the company.\n\nNadella took Microsoft in a different direction. He started giving Windows away for free, providing customers with smartphone-like updates twice a year. He made Office available — also for free — on the iPad. And he shifted Microsoft's focus to the cloud.\n\nFive years later, Microsoft passed Apple to become the most valuable company on the stock market. It is neck-and-neck with Amazon for cloud superiority, powering everything from corporate email servers to Pixar movies.\n\nThe next big thing\n\nThe key difference between Microsoft and Apple is Microsoft was a diverse business even when it was focused mainly on its consumer products. It took a decade, but Microsoft's bet on the cloud fully materialized.\n\nApple, on the other hand, is almost exclusively a consumer business. Its three main products — iPhones, Macs and iPads — make up 80% of Apple's sales. So what product can Apple develop to snap it out of its growth funk?\n\nApple has taken some big swings at self-driving cars. It swiped talent from Tesla ( TSLA ) and put a few dozen test cars on the roads in California. While Apple lags behind Alphabet's Waymo , Uber and some carmakers, there is plenty of room for competition to develop a promising technology that could revolutionize transportation for the world.\n\nNotably, Apple wasn't the first company to develop smartphones, tablets or music players — it just made them better than anyone else. It could try to replicate that feat in the self-driving car space.\n\nCan't innovate anymore, my ass! Phil Schiller, Apple's head of marketing, in 2013\n\nIt also has an opportunity to expand its push into the enterprise space. Corporate computing remains a Windows-based world, but iPads, iPhones and Macs are slowly becoming welcomed by IT departments as Apple enhances its security and IT protocols.\n\nApple partnered with IBM ( IBM ) in 2014 to help Apple make headway selling to corporations. In May, the companies announced that the partnership will include machine learning technologies. IPhones installed with IBM's Watson app will allow repair shops, for example, to point an iPhone camera at a broken piece of equipment, and the iPhone will determine what and how the item should be fixed. That kind of technology could open up Apple's products to new customers.\n\nSo could price-cutting. Apple is wildly profitable, but it has resisted cutting its prices to go after cost-conscious customers. That's a Steve Jobs legacy: Jobs wanted Apple's products to scream luxury. If Apple products remained out of reach for some consumers, Jobs saw that as a good thing — iPhones became status symbols.\n\nIt's unrealistic to expect a new iPhone-like innovation every year, said DiDio. Apple may need to eat some humble pie for a while. I'm not saying they'll turn into Dell, but they may have to cut prices.\n\nIn the meantime, the next big thing for Apple could be the same thing — just at a lower price. If it's seeking growth, one way to do that is address a new market.\n\nApple is obviously in no imminent danger of collapse. But the tech graveyard is filled with tombstones of former technology giants that failed to innovate: AOL, Yahoo, Gateway, Nokia...\n\nTim Cook could continue to successfully lead Apple for some time. He has done a phenomenal job leading the company. But unless he has a new plan to grow the company, his winning streak may be cut short.
