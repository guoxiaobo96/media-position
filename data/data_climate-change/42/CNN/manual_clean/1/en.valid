a vote against the objections is to accept the decision of the people but defy the grassroots of the gop and fail a fealty test to trump, likely inviting a primary challenge in the near future.
the construction and industry sectors also saw sizable emission increases.
travelers in less trafficked areas of the world often find businesses that won't take mastercard or visa, much less american express. peru offers an extra twist: occasionally shops refuse these cards despite displaying signs advertising them.
warren: where trump is right now is a nightmare
the new research indicated that us power sector emissions as a whole rose by 1.9% and that the transportation sector held its title as the largest source of us emissions for the third year running, due to a growth in demand for diesel and jet fuel offsetting a modest decline in gasoline use.

but this intraparty split will carry over to other questions. as trump weighs in, unbound by any sort of official responsibility, his sway over the party will be tested.

when former president trump tweets in favor of something, will republicans pay attention?
democratic presidential candidate elizabeth warren participates in a climate crisis town hall hosted by cnn in new york on september 4, 2019.
there will be so much more covid. the beginning of biden's presidency will likely be judged more for what he does to kickstart the use of covid vaccines than for any large policy proposals. the country is at war with the disease and, as he prepares to take office, thousands of americans are dying each day. he's promised to move heaven and earth to get vaccines out to americans, something more easily said than done as he navigates public skepticism of vaccines.
few senate republicans want to make this choice, which is why party elders had tried to shield themselves from it. but now that hawley has decided to object, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has made it clear to lawmakers he's giving them room to vote their conscience, according to a source familiar with a thursday conference call on which mcconnell asked hawley -- who was not in attendance -- to explain his rationale.
that said, the norte chico people of peru built a civilization 5,000 years ago and the centuries that followed saw the emergence of other significant cultures, such as the paracas and the moche.
after three years of decline, climate-change-causing carbon emissions rose sharply in the united states last year, according to new research.
3. there's more to peru than incas
of course, community college, which groves now attends, can offer a chance to learn about white privilege, too. but it might have been a great learning opportunity for groves to leave home and to live somewhere else for a bit. when i taught first year students at depaul university, i witnessed and encouraged this process with students in a new environment, reckoning with what they thought they knew, firsthand.
school leaders who have not already done so should take a long hard look at these instagram accounts, which detail painful experiences of social exclusion, overt racism and academic discrimination. real change requires more than just discipline for the offenders. schools need to proactively teach anti-racism without doing more harm -- which means they need training in the best methods to do so.
the inca trail largely consists of stone stairs -- often steep ones -- and those stone stairs weren't meant to be covered by mortals. the result is that the steps feel quite high for those who don't answer to kobe or lebron.
one year later, those words seem like something from a different era. covid rages, impeachment feels like a footnote to history and, rather than suffer trump's sabotage, biden will soon be president.
porters race ahead to the night's camp and assemble everything before parties arrive, then cook and serve multiple-course meals, in certain cases on white linen table clothes. the result after a hard day's walk is that you feel like you've stepped out of deliverance and into howard's end. speaking of porters ...
along the famed trail you'll often be reminded of the peruvian proverb: when the road is long, even slippers feel tight.
machu picchu porters are even tougher than the trail. sean cunningham
finding the student who is imprudent about using a slur on social media focuses all the anger on that student. what about the student who anonymously leaves a note in a locker? what about the student who keeps other kids off the team? what about the kids who quietly make it so uncomfortable for outsiders that some extracurricular activity is completely closed to kids of a certain ethnic group, religion or gender? what about a school counselor who systematically counsels black students away from ap or honors classes?
what you can actually do to slow the climate crisis
too often, finding offenders and outing them becomes the focus, instead of how the adults -- the educators and parents -- can support black, indigenous and students of color and give all students a thoughtful education. it allows too many communities to smugly point fingers and not to look at themselves.
another challenge with canceling someone for racial ignorance, particularly in a case like groves, who expressed deep regret for her behavior, is where do they go? how do they move forward? as the times story points out, groves posted in support of black lives matter as a senior and yet had used the n-word as a 9th grader. (a black friend of groves told the times groves had apologized about the offensive post long before it went viral. the friend defended groves in a snapchat post: we're supposed to educate people, not ruin their lives all because you want to feel a sense of empowerment.)
lima is peru's largest city by far. it's home to more than a quarter of peru's roughly 30 million people, has wonderful food, the beautiful miraflores district (where you can drink while overlooking beaches lined with small rocks that form eye-catching patterns each time the tide rolls out) and excellent museums.
while most international travelers land in peru's current capital, many immediately continue on to the country's former capital, cuzco, in their rush to get to machu picchu.
the lack of strategy in the country's decarbonization efforts, the research says, has contributed to the gap in meeting the goal set in the paris agreement on climate change, a landmark 2015 accord that the us trump administration has promised to abandon.
there will be a split in the gop. a vote for the objections trump wants is a vote for conspiracy theory over fact and against the democratic will of the country.
carbon emissions increased 3.4% in 2018, marking the second-largest annual gain in more than two decades, according to preliminary power generation data analyzed by the rhodium group, an independent economic policy research provider.
that noted, peruvians tend to put great stock in u.s. dollars, so even if an establishment doesn't take credit cards and you don't see an atm, you may still be able to buy dinner or souvenirs. make sure your u.s. and other foreign currency is in pristine shape -- many merchants and hotels will reject torn or overly worn bills.
ilulissat, greenland - july 20: an iceberg floats through the water on july 20, 2013 in ilulissat, greenland. as greenlanders adapt to the changing climate and go on with their lives, researchers from the national science foundation and other organizations are studying the phenomena of the melting glaciers and its long-term ramifications for the rest of the world. in recent years, sea level rise in places such as miami beach has led to increased street flooding and prompted leaders such as new york city mayor michael bloomberg to propose a $19.5 billion plan to boost the citys capacity to withstand future extreme weather events by, among other things, devising mechanisms to withstand flooding.

someone shared it with galligan a few years later, when both he and groves were seniors. galligan kept the video and after groves had chosen a college, he posted the video publicly. as he later described it to the times, the video taught someone a lesson.
in addition to incorporating anti-racist teaching into the curriculum, schools must hold young people accountable for racist actions in the immediate setting where they occur and later offer a thoughtfully planned restorative process that offers a chance for students to learn, heal and understand the impact of their actions.

(cnn) in recent years and especially since the death of george floyd, high school and college students have been using social media to expose everyday racism they confront at school. a r ecent story in the new york times about two high school graduates from virginia was particularly dramatic.
was the incan era a highlight of peruvian history? unquestionably. but when peruvian museums boast artifacts from before christ, focusing exclusively on atahualpa and his predecessors is akin to being so impressed by books that you conclude world history began with the gutenberg press.
groves told the times that the clip began as a private message and that she is disgusted that such a word came out of her mouth. at the time, she said, i didn't understand the severity of the word, or the history and context behind it, because i was so young.
there will be a show january 6. cnn's jake tapper reported thursday that as many as 140 house republicans could vote to throw out electoral votes from swing states. that's a strong majority of the republicans in the house trying to overturn the election and swear fealty to the president.

he will also travel to georgia for his last political rally as president, when he encourages voters there to show up for the all-important january 5 runoff and protect republicans' senate majority. there are, as of this writing, two developing complications for trump. he's spent months attacking the electoral system as fraudulent, particularly in georgia , where he lost. and one of the republican candidates, sen. david perdue, will have to quarantine after coming into contact with someone who tested positive for covid-19.
most tourists come to peru to see machu picchu or other inca ruins, with maybe a few catholic churches thrown in for balance. this makes it easy to conclude, there were the incas, then the spanish came, which brings us to where we are now.
when the us geological survey announced a major discovery of oil and natural gas underneath texas and new mexico in december, interior secretary ryan zinke called it a gift.
at the g20 meeting in argentina, just days after the release of that dire climate report, us diplomats insisted on noting that the united states reaffirmed its intention to withdraw from the paris accord.

his administration has since made a series of policy and diplomatic decisions or statements that appear to run counter to all of the warnings in the report. none is designed to reduce fossil fuel emissions, as the report said is needed to combat extreme climate change.
accounts have been suspended for less than what trump does on a daily basis and the social media companies will come under immediate pressure to censure trump, perhaps by suspending his account.

if just reading this makes your knees swell, you may be in trouble. in addition, while altitude sickness tends to be exaggerated, there'll come a moment when you're going up a hill and find that your lungs have betrayed you.
shortly after galligan posted the video, groves' acceptance to the university of tennessee's cheer team was revoked. according to the times, under pressure from their students, alumni and the public, the university encouraged groves to withdraw, which she did.
in lima, internationally famed la mar is a great place to try it, but ceviche is prepared differently throughout the country, from humble street stalls to elegant restaurants.
the proof of these divides is already evident in the scrutiny biden has faced from progressives in the selection of his cabinet.
there will be a split among democrats. it's much easier to be united in pursuit of power than it is to stay united in power. trump, to his credit, was able to effectively marshal republicans, often through fear and bullying, during his time in office. as president, it's unlikely biden will use those same tactics. and he'll have to contend with progressives on the left who want more attention to big problems like climate change and inequality that require systemic change the moderates in his party have less interest in pursuing. a year from now, it will be much easier for republicans to focus on biden's policies -- and he's likely to be a relatively moderate president -- in a way to aggravate and turn off progressives. vermont sen. bernie sanders won't quietly let biden take the moderate route. neither will massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, new york rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez or the congressional black caucus.
the university of tennessee told local media that groves withdrew voluntarily. her lawyer (who is also a cnn legal analyst) contested that characterization, saying she was forced to withdraw or her offer of admission would be rescinded. the case does nothing to change the wider culture of racism on college campuses. that change will take a lot more work than singling out one student.
cnn's john sutter, julia jones, and gregory wallace contributed to this report.
there will be something new. think back to the beginning of 2020, when covid was not yet known to be in the country, and the overriding political story was the historic impeachment of trump for pressuring foreign governments to help him taint biden.

the interior department then proposed to cut protections that benefited the sage grouse, a grassland bird that lives in the great plains and western states, which could allow for expanded oil and drilling. the plan would remove protections on nearly 9 million acres of protected habitat.
how to prepare? the easiest method is drink lots of water, get plenty of sleep and ease off the booze -- just imagine how your mother would like you to conduct your life at every elevation and you'll be fine. you can also consume stimulating coca leafs, whether in tea or by chewing them.
available in numerous brands at varying prices, pisco is usually consumed in cocktail form, meaning other ingredients largely hide its nuances, which can be a good thing for novices unaccustomed to pisco's blowtorch nuances.
throw in the chance of heavy rains -- test your waterproof gear pretrek to make sure it's just that -- and the trail can feel less like vacation than boot camp.
educators and parents need to focus on character over consequences. when a very few kids receive an outsized consequence and many others escape notice, the message can all too easily become a smug see we got that racist over there -- or, worse don't get caught -- instead of examine your bias and do the right thing.
in general, peruvians like their soles (the currency is the nuevo sol) in small denominations: a fifty (roughly $20) is ok, but denominations of twenty and under are better to ensure merchants can make change.
loudoun county may be notable for the previous failures of some of their educators to lead by example. unfortunately, they are not alone. too many high schools are unsafe environments where students who are targeted for their racial identity are left to fend for themselves. it should surprise no one to see young people wielding their skills on social media as a weapon or a shield when they have been otherwise ignored.
(cnn) — with a climate that ranges from desert dry to tropical lush to freeze-your-north-face-off in the andes, peru packs a ton of diversity between its sea level elevation pacific beaches and the 22,204 foot top of its highest mountain, nevado huascaran.
the loudoun county school district -- one of the wealthiest counties in the country -- commissioned a report , presented to the superintendent in june 2019, which showed a pattern of students and teachers using racial slurs widely and disproportionate disciplinary measures meted out to white and black students, who spoke of their growing sense of despair that racist events, large and small, are ignored and school leaders do not believe their reports of mistreatment.
it'll be an aggravating vote for those senate republicans running for reelection in 2022, when the party is defending more senate seats than democrats.
whether you're on your own or traveling like an english lord in the colonies, you'll encounter porters on the inca trail. these men tend to be farmers or laborers looking to earn extra money.
twitter and facebook have taken to marking as suspect the posts in which he spreads outright falsehoods about his election loss, but it may soon become difficult for those companies to justify allowing him to spread them at all.
it is especially important for students who have been targeted to be heard and to be able to participate in the restorative process in a way that prioritizes their safety.
this follows a global carbon project report in december that said global carbon emissions were estimated to rise by 2.7% for all of 2018.
in november, the administration released its fourth national climate assessment outlining the dire environmental and economic impacts of climate change, stating that thousands of americans could die and gross domestic product could take a 10% hit by century's end.
when galligan posted the video on social media, in june 2020, both he and groves were seniors and had spent four years steeped in the culture of heritage high school in leesburg, virginia, which students of color there say was, as the times described it , rife with racial insensitivity, including casual uses of slurs.
the effects of such a move, were it to occur, would be interesting not only to see if his power to influence is clipped without his platform, but also to hasten gop scrutiny of section 230, a provision of telecom law that separates the companies from the content users publish on their sites.
5. cash is king, ideally in small bills
one problem with making someone like groves emblematic of broader racism harbored within an institution is that it risks absolving others of examining their own behaviors. it makes her the exception, instead of recognizing what she said as a symptom of the prevailing climate at her school and in her school district.
galligan, whose mother is black and father is white, told the new york times that he and other students had endured years of racist harassment. when students like galligan and classmate muna barry (also quoted in the times sharing her experiences as a black student) are in the position where reporting racism doesn't bring about real change, educators have failed.
there will be calls for sanity. nebraska sen. ben sasse criticized those who would object to the electoral votes of pennsylvania, and perhaps other states, when they're counted january 6.
there's pisco. there's ceviche. and, yes, there's that famous trail. don't worry, we'll get to all of those. first, some things you may not already know:
the president has brought his drama show back to washington early , perhaps realizing his time in the white house is down to days and counting. he's also hoping to pressure republican lawmakers to back his wild and inaccurate claims of fraud when the electoral votes that seal his exit are counted in what's normally an antiquated ceremony.
college can be a time for kids with white privilege to ask hard questions about how we live and the history of housing discrimination that produced environments like loudoun county and countless other communities in america. and about the ways that racism stokes fears that can put their black classmates' lives at risk
in fact, the inca were a bit like mitt romney's bain capital: they had a knack for taking control of long-established things and making them their own. the incan state didn't emerge until the 1200s. it became an empire in the 1400s, and its final sovereign emperor died in 1533, officially ending the period of constructing the buildings and roads that lure visitors to this day.
peru is a mountainous land, and you have to handle heights if you're going to cuzco, machu picchu and other landmarks of incan culture.
there will be a majority in the senate. we just don't know yet which party will have it. that depends on what happens in georgia's twin us senate runoffs tuesday. if the two republican incumbents -- sens. david perdue and kelly loeffler -- win, republicans will have 51 votes and control access to the senate floor. given mcconnell's expertise in obstruction and interest in the 2022 midterms, a 51-seat majority could be biden's biggest presidential headache. if the democratic challengers -- jon ossoff and raphael warnock -- win, the resulting 50-50 tie won't give democrats much wiggle room to pass legislation, but it will give them the ability to get measures on the senate floor with vice president-elect kamala harris able to break ties as president of the senate.
expect to see trashcans in bathrooms next to the toilet.
there will be a reckoning over the president's twitter account. even after he's left office, the president will have access to his twitter account. it's been his preferred mode of communication while in office. the problem for the soon-to-be former president is that he may not be given the same deference by social media companies out of office as he's been given as leader of the free world.
they carry up to 20 kilograms (44 pounds) of gear -- the weight limit is a recent development, they used to handle positively spine-shattering loads -- and they carry it fast. some actually run along the trail, somehow avoiding shredded ankles as they navigate uneven, wet stones just to ensure all's ready before the tourists stagger into camp.
i have been urging my colleagues also to reject this dangerous ploy, sasse wrote in a six-part facebook post , after sen. josh hawley, a missouri republican, said he would be the senator who forced votes on the objections.
heritage high school officials did not respond to the times' requests for interviews.
8. the inca trail is genuinely difficult
in december, the environmental protection agency proposed relaxing regulations for newly built coal-fueled power plants, which, combined with another proposal to replace the obama-era clean power plan, would overhaul the way coal-fired plants are built and regulated.
see how candidates stood out in 7 hours of climate talk
president trump's tweets in favor of $2,000 stimulus checks got several gop senators to endorse the idea, although mcconnell effectively killed it
most of the increase last year was directly attributable to an increase in economic growth, said trevor houser, who leads rhodium group's energy and climate team, but he added that it does not have to be the case that a rising economy results in rising emissions.
still, mcconnell went on to tell his colleagues that even with a career as long as his, the vote would mark one of the most significant, perhaps the most significant, he'd ever cast -- and that it would mark the same for each senator on the call, two people familiar with the call told cnn.
10. porters are the toughest guys in the country
this story comes at a time when many schools, like other public institutions, are struggling to address their failures to address systemic racism. and while a very public outing and shaming of a few students here and there might offer some sense of justice, it, unfortunately, lets too many students, parents and educators -- really the whole community -- off the hook.
galligan has said he does not regret his actions. their story has drawn an uproar of commentary in response, especially on social media, and among other media outlets, some referring to galligan as vindictive for his lack of regret about the consequences groves has faced. the times has also come under criticism for amplifying the story.
his ability to navigate the demands of the groups that rallied behind his campaign, and navigate around republican obstruction, will determine whether he can get anything done in the white house.
students at many predominantly white private high schools and colleges across the united states, and at some public schools, have shared on instagram examples of racism from other students as well as their teachers. many of these conversations focus on students and alumni supporting one another, and validating the difficult experiences they have gone through.
depending on the company guiding you on the trail, it's possible to get porters to carry your tent, sleeping bag, food and ... well, they'll essentially carry everything, including you, should your body completely fall to pieces.
houser said affordable technology exists to grow the economy while reducing emissions, but that requires policy to deploy those technologies in the market. and we've seen a freeze in that kind of policy at the federal level over the past few years.
according to the times, one student, jimmy galligan, shared in june 2020 a three-second snapchat video of his classmate, mimi groves, using a racial slur. groves had first sent the video message to a friend in 2016 when she was 15 and had just gotten her learner's permit. in the video, she looks into the camera and says, i can drive, [racial slur].
fresh, raw fish marinated in citrus juices and spiced with chili peppers and sometimes other tongue-tingling spices, ceviche is peru's most popular dish, a must-try for any visitor.
a true education in racial inequity would help any young teen understand how the word and the system that produced it have destroyed black lives before things ever got to this point and help them reckon with the both the reality of white privilege and their role in it.
watch out for this stuff -- pisco goes fast. sean cunningham
a previous version of this op-ed listed an incorrect month and year for when jimmy galligan posted the video of mimi groves. it was posted in june 2020.
2. you're gonna love the ceviche
a lot of the reaction to the times story has focused on the cost to groves for something she did at 15: admission to her dream college and sports goals she'd pursued for years.
it's an easier vote in the house, where objections to the election are destined to fall against the larger number of democrats in that chamber.
after the report published, the district released a plan to fight systemic racism and issued a formal apology for the district's history of segregation. in june 2020, the school board also put out a statement following the death of george floyd affirming their commitment to a safe, empathetic, respectful, and supporting learning environment for every student, acknowledging that loudoun county is not immune from the effects of systemic racism and noting that even as we work for positive change, we recognize that harm is done by racist and hate-filled statements and acts.

9. there are ways to ease your inca pain
the move sent a political signal that the trump administration is intent on shoring up the coal industry and other energy interests, and environmentalists worry that the proposed rule suggests the epa will set new standards that would weaken the requirements that the agency uses to regulate other types of pollution.
warren: this is what fossil fuel wants us talking about
president trump has at times denied the basic science of climate change, which states that burning coal, oil and natural gas produces emissions that trap heat in the atmosphere, warming the planet. but it has become increasingly clear that warming is happening faster than previously thought and with worse results.
the museo larco and its erotic gallery is devoted to sculptures from more than a thousand years ago celebrating sexual congress in all of its least procreative forms. reproductions of these works pop up all over peru, notably in the form of a bottle of pisco shaped like a fellow in an extremely good mood.
while peruvian plumbing handles your waste, it doesn't do toilet paper, which must be put in the bin next to the bowl. some bathrooms have signs stating this rule, others assume you know: remember and spare yourself begging for a plunger in broken spanish.
trump, who has called climate change a hoax, has rejected the report's conclusion that climate change could be devastating for the economy, saying, i don't believe it.
6. altitude adjustment amounts to common sense
the most famous cocktail is the pisco sour, consisting of lime juice, simple syrup, egg white, ice and angostura bitters. there are assorted variations, such as the coca sour for those who feel the pisco sour requires more bitterness.
peru's beverage of choice is pisco, a brandy made from grapes. it's also adored in chile, inspiring an epic rivalry over which nation is its true birthplace.
