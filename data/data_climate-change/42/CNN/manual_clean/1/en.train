Twenty-two years ago, this committee held four days of hearing on the first incident of tread belt separation in radial tires. The tire was the Firestone 500, a radial developed for passenger vehicles. Although the 500 had a very high rate of failure at the time of the hearings -- there were 15 deaths and 16 injuries, ultimately 41 deaths resulted -- in contrast, there are already 88 fatalities attributed to the tread belt separation in the Firestone ATX series of tires we are looking at today, and the number continues to grow.

Opening statements are now being heard in the committee room. John Dingell from Michigan has the floor. Let's listen. (JOINED IN PROGRESS) REP. JOHN DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN: ... Bridgestone/Firestone announced August 9 as the second largest tire recall ever. It is surpassed only by Firestone's recall of 14.5 million tires in 1978. The recall in 1978 lead to hearings where this committee disclosed many of the same problems that are involved with the recall today. Then, like now, tread belt separations on Firestone tires were involved in accidents causing serious injury and death. Then, like now, many of Firestone's problems related to its client in Decatur, Illinois. The recent recall came about only after Ford Motor Company, whose vehicles were equipped with many of the recall tires, was given access to Firestone's claims data in late July, and was able to link 46 deaths and a large number of claims to accidents involving three 15- inch models of Firestone tires: ATX, ATXII and Wilderness AT. Since August 9, the number of fatalities attributed to these tires has grown to 88, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Time, then, is of the essence.", "augmented": []}

MICHAEL G. OXLEY (R), OHIO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We are here for a hearing on the most serious of issues: highway safety. Every day, drivers rely on their vehicles and tires to carry them to destinations a mile or hundreds of miles away. They want to get where they're going and back safely. And the encouraging fact is that fatality rates have fallen in relation to vehicle miles traveled. Today we confront something out of the ordinary: a proportionally high number of accidents, some of them tragically fatal, principally involving Ford Explorers and Firestone tires. So the job of the two subcommittees here today to make sure that drivers and their families feel secure. My hope is that the Commerce Committee will be able to look at the Firestone recall situation in the detail it deserves. What caused these accidents? Was there a trend that could have been identified much earlier? What needs to be done in response? There will be questions about engineering, product quality and data review today.

More is riding on this hearing, however, than the reputations of Firestone and Ford. Countless Americans are on the road today picking up their kids, driving to work, and the last thing that should worry them is the quality and the soundness of their tires. It is unconscionable that so many have been placed in this kind of situation. Today, almost one full month after the recall was announced, neither Firestone nor NHTSA, the government agency responsible for tire safety, has been able to identify why these tires are failing and why serious accidents are occurring. Consumers, therefore, have justifiably expressed a great deal of concern for their safety and for that of their loved ones, as well as a lot of frustration about the way this story has unfolded. Every day there seems to be some new disclosure, fostering apprehension that Firestone may not yet have control of the problem. The concern was compounded by a recent full-page ad placed by Firestone in major countries -- in major papers around the country assuring consumers that it acted appropriately but acknowledging it does not know what's causing the tires to fail. In order to restore public confidence, Firestone must identify the root cause of its failure problem, and quickly and fully disclose their findings.", "augmented": []}

Today I'm going to ask Firestone and Ford to join with me in calling for and cooperating with an independent review of these tire failures worldwide to determine the cause of the failure and to propose solutions and report back to this committee and the public by the end of the year. In the meantime, I believe the recall should be widened to include all 15- and 16-inch Firestone tires, as has been done in Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. We here in the United States deserve to be treated no differently than people in other parts of the world. We deserve an answer to the many questions that will be raised here today. I'm afraid that Firestone, Ford and NHTSA can't find the answers. Let's join together to call for and support a fully independent review of this situation so that we can find the answers. The public deserves an answer, this committee deserves an answer, and most of all, the families of the 88 people who've lost their lives deserve an answer.", "augmented": []}

Firestone alleges that consumers drive too fast, under-inflate their tires, drive in hot climates, overload the vehicle, and don't do proper maintenance Then, as now, Firestone Decatur plant showed up as a source of an unusual amount of failing tires. Then, as now, Firestone cannot explain why other brands of tires don't have the same failure rate. Then, as now, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, NHTSA, standards for tire strength were and are grossly inadequate. In fact, they have not changed those standards since 1968, long before there were steel-belted radials and the popular sport utility vehicles. There are a few new wrinkles. This time, the tires are found mainly on one company's vehicle: the Ford Explorer SUV and light trucks. And Firestone has two new factors to blame: hot climates, which stress its tires, and high ozone, which degrades its tires. The other change is that Ford, until recently, had agreed that -- with Firestone, that there was nothing wrong with the tires.

The documents the committee has received, along with the news reports, indicate that all these parties knew a great deal more in 1998 and 1999 about tire failures than the Houston television station did. They just ignored it. We also are going to hear from a number of witnesses that the number of failures was so small that no one could have been expected to pay attention. Yes, the numbers begin small, but because the propensity of the SUVs to rollover when a tire fails, the cost in deaths and injuries was inordinately high and increasingly at an alarming rate. Both Ford and Firestone should have known and should have watched this particular vehicle more closely. With less than 6,000 vehicles in the entire country of Saudi Arabia, there were 18 accidents in Saudi Arabia, including seven fatalities in 1999. The U.S. had four. And there was another large group in Venezuela. Despite what anyone says about the conditions in all these countries, one fact remains: Other tires under same conditions did not fail. That should have alert everyone. It alerted the State Farm Insurance Company, it alerted the Center for Auto Safety. Unfortunately Ford, Firestone and NHTSA failed to act.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Consumers can also take little comfort from Firestone's explanation of why it took so long to identify the Firestone failure problem. According to Firestone, the problem eluded them because manufacturers never properly analyzed data and personnel claims to identify defects or problems with tires. They say the university of claims data is simply too small. But a staff examination of the records, revealed since 1995 Firestone had reports on more than 1,600 lawsuits, property claims and personal injury claims involving their recalled tires. I must say I find it curious that Firestone did not regard 1,600 claims as significant when it took only 21 claims for State Farm Insurance Company to decide that a potential problem existed. Records available to the committee also indicate that some in Firestone, in apparent contradiction of its statements to committee staff and others, analyzed their claims dated 1998. These Firestone analyses show that the claims were especially high for ATX tires, and the claims were highest for tires produced at the Decatur, Illinois, plant. Contrary to Firestone's other assertions, at least one other American tire company, Goodyear, says it routinely looks at all its customer data, including claims data, to identify defect or failure trends with its tires. Whatever else we learn at the hearing today, we hope that we will find that all involved will find the need for more open and detail communication regarding these critical products and how they perform in the field.", "augmented": []}
