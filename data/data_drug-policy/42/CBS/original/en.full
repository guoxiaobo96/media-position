{"original": "when mcdonald's (mcd) told employees at company-owned restaurants three years ago that they were getting a raise, workers cheered. ceo steve easterbrook said at the time that the enhanced compensation package, including better benefits, would make a real difference in workers' lives."}
{"original": "three years later, mcdonald's efforts haven't kept pace with increasing minimum wages."}
{"original": "mcdonald's move to boost pay came in april of 2015, as union-led protests that came to be known as the fight for $15 were sweeping the nation. under pressure from activists, the company said that it would set the starting pay for 90,000 workers at company-owned restaurants in the u.s. at one dollar over the local minimum wage. the announcement generated a raft of generally positive headlines, with easterbrook touting his desire to build a progressive burger company."}
{"original": "mcdonald's publicity stunt has turned out to be a sham, kuper, an employee at a mcdonald's restaurant in chicago, said in a statement emailed by fight for $15."}
{"original": "most mcdonald's restaurants are independently operated as franchises, with the owner setting the wage structure rather than leaders at the company."}
{"original": "for its part, mcdonald's doesn't dispute that pay at its restaurants hasn't kept pace with local wages. instead, it contends that the company never intended to continuously keep raising wages so that it remained at least $1 above the minimum wage."}
{"original": "the increase announced in 2015 was applicable to the local wages on july 1, 2015, and was not a policy thereafter, terri hickey, a spokesperson for mcdonald's said in an email."}
{"original": "mcdonald's never promised that it would always keep wages $1 above the minimum, but executives did indicate a commitment to higher wages."}
{"original": "shortly after the sweetened pay package was announced in april 2015, for example, chief financial officer kevin ozan told analysts in an earnings call that boosting worker pay would enhance our competitiveness in the marketplace by helping mcdondald's attract and retain the best employees."}
{"original": "that same month, easterbrook echoed that theme in an op-ed in the chicago tribune. i believe the time is right to take a first step in rewarding our team members who work so hard every day, he said. wage is just one part of the equation. getting people started on the road to success by providing the skills, training and opportunities they need to continuously improve is also important."}
{"original": "the fight for $15 campaign provided to cbs moneywatch recent pay stubs for 16 mcdonald's workers in three major metropolitan areas showing cooks and cashiers earning hourly wages significantly below a dollar above the minimum."}
{"original": "in los angeles, where the minimum hourly wage is $12, workers at mcdonald's corporate-owned stores make as little as $12.62 an hour. in san jose, california, where the minimum wage is $13.50, workers at corporate-run mcdonald's make as little as $14.10."}
{"original": "kuper earns $11.40 an hour in chicago, where the minimum wage is $11. that would mean an hourly rate of $12, or just under $25,000 a year working full-time, if mcdonald's was to keep a buck ahead of the local wage mandate."}
{"original": "protests over wages were planned tuesday at mcdonald's stores in metro areas including chicago, los angeles and san jose, california, fight for $15 said."}
{"original": "san francisco -- san francisco's buses, trains and transit shelters will no longer display advertising that includes political messages, cbs san francisco reports."}
{"original": "the san francisco municipal transportation agency board voted unanimously -- and without discussion -- to approve a new advertising policy that prohibits ads concerning public or political issues."}
{"original": "the revised policy also prohibits ads that include profanity, violent images and descriptions, and ads that are insulting, disparaging, degrading, demeaning or otherwise offensive, as well as those that are viewed as potentially harmful or disruptive."}
{"original": "political ads have caused controversy for muni -- the transportation agency -- in the past. most notably, a series of anti-muslim ads posted by the american freedom defense initiative in recent years have been denounced by city officials."}
{"original": "these ads have generated complaints from our customers and our operators and have distracted from our ability to run the transit system, muni finance manager gail stein said wednesday in a presentation to the board."}
{"original": "muni officials have in the past said they could not turn down political ads based on content, without risking first amendment lawsuits."}
{"original": "the changes adopted, however, are based similar policies adopted successfully by other transit agencies around the country."}
{"original": "stein said advertising provides around $20 million in annual revenue for muni."}
{"original": "philip scheffler, cbs news' first television street reporter, a documentary producer and the executive editor at 60 minutes for many years, died thursday in new york-presbyterian/cornell weill medical center. he was 85 and lived in manhattan. until recently he also spent much of his time in essex, connecticut, where he had a home for decades."}
{"original": "scheffler retired from 60 minutes in june of 2003 and had served as a consultant to cbs news up until a few years ago. he was a friend and mentor to jeff fager, executive producer of 60 minutes. phil was a guiding force behind the success of 60 minutes for more than two decades, said fager. don hewitt often said he couldn't have done it without him. he was a first-class journalist, an admirable human being, and a great friend to many of us. we will miss him very much."}
{"original": "scheffler was a reporter and producer for cbs news for the first half of his 52-year career. he became the senior producer at 60 minutes in 1980, handling the day-to-day responsibilities - essentially the right hand of the broadcast's executive producer don hewitt. hewitt named him executive editor later. in this capacity, scheffler had a direct hand in producing every 60 minutes report broadcast from 1980 to 2003 - a period during which 60 minutes was the number-one program in america five times."}
{"original": "scheffler oversaw the reporting from the field and handled most of the producers' journalistic issues, enabling hewitt to focus almost exclusively on shaping the newsmagazine's stories. when tempers flared in the screening room between hewitt and one of his correspondents, such as mike wallace or morley safer, it was the professorial scheffler, sporting a bow tie and close-cropped beard, who played referee."}
{"original": "phil scheffler, 1964 cbs photo archive"}
{"original": "before his senior positions, scheffler produced 60 minutes stories over nine seasons for wallace, safer, harry reasoner and dan rather. his first story with safer was after attica, a look inside a maximum security prison in colorado broadcast after the horrible riots in the new york prison in 1971."}
{"original": "hewitt hired him in march of 1951 as a copy boy for douglas edwards with the news, which hewitt directed and produced. debuting in may 1948, that broadcast was the first network television news program, and in 1951, scheffler became its first street reporter."}
{"original": "his first field assignment was to ask people whether they thought gen. dwight eisenhower should enter politics and run for the republican presidential nomination. but reporting was only one of the hats worn by early television news people like scheffler. out of necessity, he also invented a makeshift news teleprompter."}
{"original": "hewitt wanted his anchor, edwards, to look at the camera instead of his script when reading the news, so he had scheffler make cue cards. my first job at cbs television news, recalls scheffler, was to hand print douglas edwards' copy on two-by-three-foot cue cards. then, when we were on the air, i would hold them up next to the camera lens and move them up a line at a time for doug to read. my arms were always tired and sore, so i asked don if the camera could move in closer. he put on a wide-angle lens and moved the camera to within 10 feet of doug, and i started typing the copy using wide adding-machine paper and a huge-type typewriter. it was the first crude teleprompter, but i didn't have the wit to develop it! said scheffler in 2001."}
{"original": "philip scheffler, 1981 cbs photo archive"}
{"original": "in 1953, scheffler was drafted into the army and served his two years. during this period, he convinced his superior officer that he could put the army on television - as long as he could get a few weekends off to film the piece! the result was a feature series in weekly installments he helped produce and write for cbs in which a korean war recruit was followed through basic training at new jersey's fort dix. scheffler returned to cbs and continued working as writer, reporter and producer for the nightly network news and other regularly scheduled cbs news programs through the 1950s."}
{"original": "the news program, eyewitness, was scheffler's next stop, where he served as associate producer and on-air reporter for the half-hour weekly from 1960 to 1963. he briefly served as an associate producer on the cbs evening news with walter cronkite, where he covered the kennedy assassination, before joining the documentary unit in 1964. there, scheffler became a producer of documentary and special news broadcasts, including cbs special reports and cbs reports. he produced more than 100 of them, including: after 10 years: the court and the schools (1964), on school integration; cbs reports: robert f. kennedy (1967), on sen. kennedy and his political ambitions; and the cities (1968), about the nation's urban crisis."}
{"original": "philip scheffler, 1981 cbs photo archive"}
{"original": "scheffler's assignments took him to 47 states and to 50 foreign countries, including vietnam. he traveled there for six assignments during the war; his output included three two-hour specials on american policy in southeast asia, where we stand in vietnam (1967), where we stand in indochina (1970), and the changing war in indochina (1971)."}
{"original": "cbs news broadcasts that scheffler worked on, especially 60 minutes, have received the industry's highest recognition, including the peabody, dupont and emmy awards. in 1981, he received the alumni award for distinguished contributions to journalism from the columbia university graduate school of journalism, from which he received a master's degree. as an adjunct professor, he once taught classes there as well."}

{"original": "sonoma, calif. -- video footage of the violent takedown of a teenage girl by a sonoma county sheriff's deputy last year has been publicly released."}
{"original": "cbs san francisco reports that the sonoma county sheriff's office released video footage from the body-worn cameras documenting the arrest of gabrielle lemos on june 14, 2015, as well as subsequent recordings of her telephone calls from jail."}
{"original": "the sheriff's office released the video and audio recordings thursday, only after they were introduced as an exhibit in sonoma county superior court, making them public information."}
{"original": "according to the sheriff's office, deputy marcus holton was in a rural area of sonoma county when he happened upon a parked pickup truck and trailer that was blocking the road. as he investigated, he heard a woman screaming from the house nearby. he saw a man walking quickly towards the pickup truck from the house with several women yelling at him. one of the women was crying. based on what he saw and heard he suspected he had encountered a domestic related incident."}
{"original": "the body cam videos, which were posted thursday evening to the sonoma county sheriff's office youtube channel, shows deputy holton investigating why the truck is stopped with the motor running in the middle of a rural road in petaluma, and why there is yelling."}
{"original": "in the videos, four women are arguing with deputy holton for several minutes and then another deputy arrives on scene. the verbal confrontation continues for several more minutes with the family demanding a female officer."}
{"original": "holton then takes down gabrielle as she is walking away, apparently ignoring his orders to stop."}
{"original": "holton's body camera fell off during the confrontation."}
{"original": "as gabrielle is loaded into the back of the cruiser, you can see blood on her face."}
{"original": "gabrielle has since filed a civil rights case against the sonoma county sheriff's office. shortly after doing so the sonoma county sheriff's office filed charges against her."}
{"original": "gabrielle's attorney, izaak schwaiger, wrote on facebook thursday: here is the video of a sonoma county sheriff's assault on an innocent girl. share far and wide."}
{"original": "one of the jail phone call audio recordings is of gabrielle speaking to her mother michelle lemos, describing what happened after she left her mother's house in the back of the cruiser."}
{"original": "the contents of the conversations on the video and in the audio recordings contains explicit language."}
{"original": "the sonoma county sheriff's office released the following statement:"}
{"original": "deputy holton was well within his authority and sheriff's office policy to investigate this matter for a possible criminal violation. his conduct and that of the other deputies involved has been reviewed by sheriff's office administrators and we are confident they acted honorably and appropriately during this tense rapidly evolving situation."}
{"original": "after dropping for three years in a row, u.s. carbon emissions spiked in 2018, demonstrating how hard it can be to move away from fossil fuels while the economy is growing."}
{"original": "preliminary data from the rhodium group, a research consultancy, found that emissions rose 3.4 percent last year. that's even as americans' reliance on coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, hit a 40-year low."}
{"original": "while a record number of coal-fired power plants were retired last year, natural gas not only beat out renewables to [replace] most of this lost generation but also fed most of the growth in electricity demand, the report said."}
{"original": "natural gas, which has become a cheap and attractive competitor to coal, is cleaner-burning, but it is still a fossil fuel, emitting about half the carbon dioxide that coal does. earlier studies have found that switching over all the world's coal plants to natural gas would do little to curb climate change."}
{"original": "the trump administration's rollback of environmental laws and decision to withdraw from the paris climate accords play a role in the increase. but the main culprit is last year's spike in economic growth. between 2007 and 2015, u.s. emissions came down 12 percent as utilities brought on clean-energy technology and the great recession dampened demand for power. in 2016 and 2017, emissions still decreased, but more slowly. last year, as the economy expanded at the fastest pace in 15 years, boosted by tax cuts and other measures, emissions also grew at a record-setting pace."}
{"original": "so long as the economy is growing, that dynamic isn't going to change without a lot of breakthrough technology innovations or federal policy actions, john larsen, one of the report's authors, told greentech media."}
{"original": "the transportation sector was the largest source of carbon emissions last year, with a slight drop in gasoline demand more than offset by increased trucking and air travel. transport-sector emissions grew 1 percent last year, the same as 2017, according to rhodium. in this sector, increases in efficiency—doing more with less power—and a move toward electric transport is beginning to make a dent, although a small one."}
{"original": "the largest emissions growth was in sectors that don't get much attention outside climate policy circles: industry and buildings. the industrial sector added 55 million metric tons of carbon last year, more than four times its annual average in the past decade, because of an uptick in industrial activity. the sector is predicted to grow its gassiness and to become the leading carbon emitter in texas within three years, according to rhodium."}
{"original": "absent a significant change in policy or a major technological breakthrough we expect the industrial sector to become an increasingly large share of us greenhouse gas emission in the years ahead, the report found."}
{"original": "emissions from buildings increased by 54 million tons last year, a sevenfold increase from its typical rate of increase. that's partly because of weather, with a colder winter requiring more heating, but rhodium expects population growth to keep driving emissions in this sector."}
{"original": "the prospect of reducing emissions by up to 28 percent from their 2005 levels—as the u.s. would be required to do under the paris climate agreement—will require a radical shift. it would mean cutting emissions at nearly double the pace of their 2007-to-2015 decline. that prospect, while not impossible, would require an immediate policy shift or a technological breakthrough, rhodium found."}
{"original": "the u.s. was already off track in meeting its paris agreement targets. the gap is even wider headed into 2019, it said."}

{"original": "washington - delta air lines can't get eight new aircraft in the air. roughly a million government employees and contractors aren't being paid. some americans who are trying to start small businesses face delays in obtaining the required tax identification number from the irs."}
{"original": "as the partial government shutdown moves through its fourth week with no end in sight, the economic blow is hitting not only federal workers but also businesspeople, households and travelers across the country. and while the damage to the overall economy so far remains slight, economist foresee real damage if the shutdown drags into february or beyond."}
{"original": "even if the shutdown is over by the end of the month, the hit to growth will be material, ian shepherdson, chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics, said in a research note."}
{"original": "shepherdson projects that after growing for nearly 10 years, the economy might even contract in this year's first quarter if the shutdown lasts through march. other forecasts are less dire. mark zandi, chief economist at moody's analytics, thinks if the shutdown extends that long, the economy would slow by 0.5 percentage point but would remain on solid footing."}
{"original": "s&p global estimated the u.s. economy had lost $3.6 billion as of jan. 11. if the shutdown continues. the loss could soon exceed the $5.7 billion mr. trump is asking for the proposed border wall, s&p global estimated."}
{"original": "that may seem like pennies for the world's biggest economy, but it means a lot to those workers trying to cover their household costs without their paychecks, beth ann bovino, the s&p global chief economist, wrote in a report."}
{"original": "for now, though, the shutdown is rippling through the economy in ways that are not always visible, making it hard to fully assess its consequences. complicating the task is that much of the economic data the government normally provides — from retail sales to home construction to the nation's gdp — has been suspended because the agencies that compile it remain closed."}
{"original": "with national parks shut down and some travelers suffering through long security lines and in some cases partial airport closures, for example, many americans are having to decide whether to cancel travel and vacation plans."}
{"original": "it is now plainly evident that the shutdown is affecting air travel, and when that happens, damage to the overall u.s. economy will shortly follow, said jonathan grella, a spokesman for the u.s. travel association, a trade group."}
{"original": "some companies are pointing to specific problems: delta said tuesday the shutdown is costing it $25 million a month in government travel. delta ceo edward bastian said with the federal aviation administration partially closed, delta will also likely delay the start date of eight new aircraft."}
{"original": "the securities and exchange commission, which oversees public stock offerings, is mostly closed because of the shutdown. as a result, some companies that had been planning initial public offerings in coming months, including uber and lyft, are likely facing delays. marianne lake, chief financial officer for jpmorgan chase, said the bank could lose out on fees from ipos and merger and acquisition deals that would be delayed if other shuttered agencies can't approve them."}
{"original": "for small companies, too, the effects are increasingly making a mark. edward farrer, an executive at principal manufacturing, a manufacturer in broadview, illinois, said when the shutdown took effect, his company had nearly won approval for a request to the commerce department to import specialty steel from europe free of u.s. tariffs. commerce is among the now-closed government departments."}
{"original": "we think we'd got it to the goal line and were waiting for an approval, but everything is at an impasse because of the shutdown, farrer said."}
{"original": "principal manufacturing uses mainly american-made steel in the parts it sells to automakers and other industrial companies. but it imports some steel from europe that it uses to make a component for auto underbodies. last spring, it asked the trump administration to exclude that steel from the 25 percent tariffs the white house imposed on steel imports. commerce was considering the request as part of a process the administration had established for companies that say they can't obtain the steel they import from elsewhere."}
{"original": "for now, farrer said principal is paying the tariffs, which typically cost it tens of thousands of dollars a month. it wants to keep doing the work, so the company is eating the cost, farrer said. but we can't do it forever."}
{"original": "neil bradley, chief policy officer at the u.s. chamber of commerce, said the chamber has heard from members that have been unable to obtain an employer id number from the irs. that number is needed to open bank accounts and file tax returns."}
{"original": "eric smith, an irs spokesman, said most u.s.-based businesses can obtain the numbers online, but paper applications aren't being processed."}
{"original": "the most hard-hit by the shutdown, of course, are government workers themselves, who missed their first paychecks friday, and contractors that work closely with the government. many have had to cut back on purchases, lowering overall consumer spending."}
{"original": "among them is pearl fraley of greenville, north carolina, a consumer safety inspector for the food safety inspection service. fraley, 53, helps ensure the safety of the nation's food supply by monitoring slaughter processing plants -- a job she has held for over 15 years."}
{"original": "fraley's position is deemed essential, so she has to go to work even though she isn't being paid. she and her co-workers were told in an email that if they work 40 hours, they aren't eligible for unemployment benefits under north carolina rules -- even though they're receiving no pay."}
{"original": "fraley said she feels like an indentured servant and said her stress level is over the top."}
{"original": "i can't pay my rent, she said. i can't pay my car payment or insurance. i have money for gas to go to work and for food."}
{"original": "for now, her 25-year-old daughter is contributing some of the money she earns from working at mcdonald's. mcdonald's doesn't typically pay enough for someone to actually live on, fraley noted."}
{"original": "moody's zandi said the shutdown could inflict longer-term damage on the government — and ultimately on the economy — in ways that might not be obvious. he noted, for example, that some demoralized federal employees, particularly those with vital skills in such areas as cybersecurity, might quit for jobs in the private sector. federal agencies may also have a harder time recruiting young workers."}
{"original": "government workers have options, zandi said, particularly with unemployment low and many employers desperate to fill jobs. this could be quite debilitating to the government."}
{"original": "for 16 years, presidents have sat for interviews ahead of the super bowl, a tradition that began when cbs sportscaster jim nantz interviewed then-president george w. bush in 2004."}
{"original": "last year, ahead of the big game, president trump spoke with face the nation moderator margaret brennan in the blue room of the white house. the president discussed the fight over border security funding, his disagreements with the intelligence community, the situation in venezuela and the fight against isis in syria."}
{"original": "here were some of the big moments from mr. trump's super bowl interview last year:"}
{"original": "during his pre-super bowl interview with face the nation, mr. trump said he wanted to leave troops and an unbelievable and expensive military base in iraq to keep an eye on iran as it continued to build upon its nuclear capabilities."}
{"original": "trump said the united states has spent a fortune on the al asad air base in western iraq and that the united states should hold on to it."}
{"original": "one of the reasons i want to keep it is because i want to be looking a little bit at iran because iran is a real problem, he said in the cbs interview. flash forward one year, that very same base came under attack as iran launched more than a dozen missiles in retaliation for the u.s. killing top military leader qassem soleimani."}
{"original": "all i want to do is to be able to watch. we have an unbelievable and expensive base built in iraq. it's perfectly situated for looking at all over, different parts of the troubled middle east, rather than pulling up, he said."}
{"original": "not having to agree with intelligence chiefs on global threats:"}
{"original": "after u.s. intelligence chiefs seemed to be at odds with mr. trump on several topics during congressional testimony on the threat posed by russia and north korea, he called them naive and suggested they might need to go back to school."}
{"original": "but on face the nation, the president indicated it was more the questions and answers about the worldwide threats report that troubled him, and he went on to tout the success of u.s. efforts around the globe."}
{"original": "my intelligence people, if they said in fact that iran is a wonderful kindergarten, i disagree with them 100 percent. it is a vicious country that kills many people, he said."}
{"original": "when pressed on the intelligence community's assessment that iran was technically in compliance with the iran nuclear deal, trump said he doesn't have to agree with his intelligence chiefs."}
{"original": "i have intel people, but that doesn't mean i have to agree. president bush had intel people that said saddam hussein in iraq had nuclear weapons, had all sorts of weapons of mass destruction. guess what? those intel people didn't know what the hell they were doing, and they got us tied up in a war that we should have never been in."}
{"original": "a very good chance the u.s. would be able to make a deal with north korea:"}
{"original": "at the time, mr. trump told margaret brennan that there was a very good chance the u.s. would be able to make a deal with north korea to give up their nuclear weapons program."}
{"original": "they think it's historic. and we'll see what happens. now that doesn't mean we are going to make a deal. but, certainly, i think we have a very good chance of making a deal, he said."}
{"original": "but two fizzled summits later, north korea still appears poised to fast-track their nuclear capabilities."}
{"original": "trump's feelings on his son playing football:"}
{"original": "mr. trump said he would have a hard time allowing his 12-year-old son barron to play football amid growing concerns over the safety of the sport."}
{"original": "i just don't like the reports that i see coming out having to do with football — i mean, it's a dangerous sport and i think it's really tough. i thought the equipment would get better, and it has. the helmets have gotten far better but it hasn't solved the problem, mr. trump said."}
{"original": "i hate to say it because i love to watch football, he said. i think the nfl is a great product, but i really think that as far as my son — well, i've heard nfl players saying they wouldn't let their sons play football. so, it's not totally unique, but i would have a hard time with it, he added."}
{"original": "at the time of the interview, the nfl announced that concussions were down 29 percent in 2018, from 190 a year ago to 135 the 2019 season."}
{"original": "mr. trump's relationship with the nfl has been fraught with tension during his time in office. amid growing protests against racial injustice led by nfl players on the sidelines of pro games, the president has said players should be forced to stand as the national anthem played, claiming players were being disrespectful to the american flag and service members."}
{"original": "senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and minority leader chuck schumer spoke about impeachment and foreign policy as the senate convened on friday, after president trump authorized a strike that killed iranian military leader qassem soleimani."}

{"original": "mcconnell took a veiled shot at democrats who have expressed skepticism about the strike, urging them to withhold judgment until the administration had provided more information."}
{"original": "i recommend that all senators wait to review the facts and hear from the administration before passing much public judgment on this operation and its potential consequences, mcconnell said, adding that the administration would be briefing senate staff on friday, and would provide a full briefing to the senate next week."}
{"original": "lawmakers are divided over the strike, with democrats arguing it could lead to an escalation of violence in the middle east and republicans praising mr. trump for taking decisive action. schumer was not informed of the strike before it occurred, cnn reported."}
{"original": "in his speech, schumer said that it was important for the president to consult with congress before making critical foreign policy decisions."}
{"original": "it is paramount for administrations to get an outside view to prevent groupthink and rash action, schumer said. the administration did not consult in this case."}
{"original": "he questioned the legal basis for conducting the operation, as well as how the administration plans to avoid a larger and potentially endless conflagration in the middle east."}
{"original": "it is my view that the president does not have the authority for a war in iran, schumer said."}
{"original": "meanwhile, lawmakers remain at an impasse over mr. trump's impeachment trial. schumer has called for witnesses from the white house, including acting chief of staff mick mulvaney, but mcconnell has rebuffed the request."}
{"original": "after addressing the strike against soleimani, mcconnell slammed the impeachment inquiry spearheaded by house democrats."}
{"original": "democrats have let 'trump derangement syndrome' develop into a kind of partisan fever, mcconnell said. he argued that senators have a right to think politically during an impeachment trial, despite swearing an oath of impartiality."}
{"original": "although the house voted to impeach mr. trump in december, the senate is still waiting for the house to send the articles of impeachment."}
{"original": "mcconnell accused house democrats of developing cold feet by choosing not to immediately send the articles to the senate, and said they were searching desperately for some new talking point on impeachment."}
{"original": "house speaker nancy pelosi has so far declined to send the articles to the senate. she said in december she wants to wait to see the process that's set forth in the senate before appointing the house impeachment managers who will act as prosecutors in the senate trial. the house is also expected to vote on a resolution designating the impeachment before delivering the articles."}
{"original": "speaking on the senate floor friday, mcconnell said it's a non-starter for pelosi to hand-design the senate trial. he also called out out schumer for campaigning in 1998 on opposition to president clinton's impeachment, responding to the accusation that mcconnell has prejudged mr. trump's case."}
{"original": "one symptom of trump derangement syndrome is a bad case of amnesia, mcconnell said with a small grin. he also noted that senate rules do not allow an impeachment trial to begin until the house sends the articles."}
{"original": "their turn is over. they've done enough damage, mcconnell said about the house. it's the senate's turn now to render sober judgment as the framers envisioned. but we can't hold a trial without the articles."}
{"original": "in a statement responding to mcconnell, pelosi gave no indication of when the house would transmit the articles to the senate."}
{"original": "today, leader mcconnell made clear that he will feebly comply with president trump's cover-up of his abuses of power and be an accomplice to that cover-up, pelosi said. every senator now faces a choice: to be loyal to the president or the constitution. the gop senate must immediately proceed in a manner worthy of the constitution and in light of the gravity of the president's unprecedented abuses."}
{"original": "schumer also countered in his speech that mcconnell was trying to defend holding an impartial, unfair trial."}
{"original": "as all eyes turn to the senate, the question before us is: will we fulfill our duty to conduct a fair impeachment trial of the president of the united states, or will we not, schumer said. he also said that mcconnell has not provided one good reason that the senate should not hear from public witnesses."}
{"original": "there is only one precedent that matters. there has never, never in the history of our country been an impeachment trial of a president in which the senate was denied the ability to hear from witnesses, schumer said, calling mcconnell an executioner of a fair trial."}
{"original": "when you are accused of something you don't suppress evidence would exonerate you, schumer said, questioning why the administration would not want witnesses to appear before the senate. he added, scathingly, that if the senate did not allow impeachment managers to call witnesses, the impeachment trial will be a nationally televised meeting of the mock trial club."}
{"original": "the constitution does not delineate how the house should execute its powers of impeachment, saying only that the house shall have the sole power of impeachment. after impeachment, it falls to the senate to try the president and vote on whether he should be removed from office."}
{"original": "the push for legalized marijuana has moved into utah and oklahoma, two of the most conservative states in the country, further underscoring how quickly feelings about marijuana are changing in the united states."}
{"original": "if the two measures pass, utah and oklahoma will join 30 other states that have legalized some form of medical marijuana, according to the pro-pot national organization for the reform of marijuana laws. nine of those states and washington, d.c. also have broad legalization where adults 21 and older can use pot for any reason. michigan could become the 10th state with its ballot initiative this year."}
{"original": "utah and oklahoma already are among 16 states that allow for use an oil called cannabidiol, or cbd, a compound from cannabis that doesn't get users high but can treat a range of health concerns."}
{"original": "justin strekal, political director for norml, is confident the utah and oklahoma measures will pass."}
{"original": "america's appetite for cannabis is not going away, strekal said. we are in the death rattles of prohibition."}
{"original": "marijuana legalization efforts have faced some pushback from religions before — including in 2016 in arizona and nevada from the mormon church, and the same year from the catholic church in massachusetts. but not to the scale they could face this year in utah, where mormons account for about two-third of the population, said matthew schweich, executive director of the pro-legalization marijuana policy project."}
{"original": "mormons have long frowned upon marijuana use because of a key church health code called the word of wisdom, which prohibits the use of alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs."}
{"original": "the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints came out against the proposal this month, saying in a statement drugs designed to ease suffering should be tested and approved by government officials first. the church said it respects the wise counsel of doctors, and commended the utah medical association for opposing it. the association has accused organizers of trying to disguise their intention of simply paving the way for legalizing recreational marijuana."}
{"original": "utah gov. gary herbert told middle school students in january that he thinks medical marijuana will someday be legalized in the state but in march he announced his opposition to the ballot question, which he argues lacks safeguards for the growing and distribution of marijuana."}
{"original": "advocates remain confident that they've crafted a medical marijuana measure that respects the mormon church and culture while providing much-needed relief for people with chronic pain, schweich said. his washington, d.c.-based organization helped draft the measure."}
{"original": "unlike other medical marijuana states, utah's proposal would not allow pot smoking or for residents to grow their own, schweich said. it would create a state-regulated growing and dispensing operation to allow people with certain medical conditions to get a card and use the drug in edible forms like candy, in topical forms like lotions or balms, as an oil or in electronic cigarettes. proponents turned in the signatures monday to get the measure on the ballot in november."}
{"original": "it's a question of compassion, schweich said."}
{"original": "oklahoma will vote in june on its proposal that would allow doctors to recommend that patients receive a medical marijuana license allowing them to legally possess up to three ounces of the drug, six mature plants and six seedlings."}
{"original": "ted lyon, a 78-year-old mormon, is a supporter because he saw in the past decade how medical marijuana helped two of his neighbors in provo — one with multiple sclerosis and another who has seizures. he said he wouldn't support the drug's legalization for recreational use."}
{"original": "lyon, a retired professor at mormon-owned brigham young university, said he's afraid the church's opposition will have a chilling effect on members of the faith but said he remains hopeful there are enough progressive-leaning mormons who will see the benefits."}
{"original": "in 10 years, the church may say something different, lyon said. this is not an eternal banishment of medical marijuana. my father was a good historian, and he used to say, 'if you don't like something in the church, just wait a while because it will change.'"}
{"original": "nathan frodsham, a 45-year-old married mormon father of three, is hoping the measure passes so he can get off opioids and back to using the vaporized form of marijuana that he used when he lived in seattle after his doctor recommended trying for his painful osteoarthritis in his neck."}
{"original": "frodsham wasn't discouraged by the mormon church statement, which he notes doesn't go as far in opposition as when the church explicitly asked members to vote against full marijuana legalization in arizona and nevada. he said marijuana is a natural plant and that the religion's health code doesn't single out cannabis as being prohibited."}
{"original": "i think there's some room for interpretation on this, said frodsham."}
{"original": "the 4,500-member utah medical association isn't against the idea of legalized medical marijuana but has numerous concerns with an initiative it thinks is too broad and doesn't include necessary regulatory measures, said michelle mcomber, the group's ceo."}
{"original": "we want to be very careful about what we bring into our state, mcomber said. this is an addictive drug."}
{"original": "president donald trump narrowly defeated hillary clinton in pennsylvania in 2016 by less than 1%. to win in the upcoming election, he or the 2020 democrat will need support from a crucial group of voters in the swing state: suburban women."}
{"original": "eight women across the political spectrum from suburbs outside of philadelphia told cbs this morning co-host anthony mason what they thought about mr. trump, the democratic candidates and issues like the economy and foreign policy. here's what they had to say:"}
{"original": "four of the women said they could not vote for mr. trump. one of them, melinda wolff, said she doesn't like to be labeled as either a democrat or a republican, but describing a candidate she would vote for, said, i want somebody i can look up to, somebody that has dignity, somebody that's not bullying."}
{"original": "maryellen digregorio, who flipped from voting democrat to voting for mr. trump in 2016, said she doesn't see trump as bullying."}
{"original": "i see him challenging because the ridiculous that goes on sometimes, she said. i thought it was refreshing to find a businessman who made himself a millionaire want to work for me."}
{"original": "i do have to ask, don't you think he's very thin-skinned? cynthia sabatini, an independent who is registered as a republican, asked digregorio about mr. trump."}
{"original": "listen, my husband's thin-skinned and a whackadoodle, and i'm still with him 26 years, she said."}
{"original": "sabatini said she thinks a politician needs to be thicker skinned and not excoriate those who disagree with him."}
{"original": "julia bohnenberger, a registered republican who said she voted for mr. trump because he was the most qualified candidate, said part of mr. trump's appeal is that he punches back at people."}
{"original": "past republicans, she said, have failed because they've taken the high road and they've been buried by it."}
{"original": "i'm not saying that this necessarily appeals to me, but i think trump appeals to a lot of people because he punches back, she said."}
{"original": "mary lou doyle, who plans to vote for mr. trump in the 2020 election, said the president isn't everyone's cup of tea, without a doubt."}
{"original": "i don't like everything he says, she said. i don't need him to be like me. i need to be safe, and i need to be able to know that my economy for my friends, my family is solid."}
{"original": "charrele robinson-brown, a democrat with some conservative ideals, was the only democrat in the group who had chosen who she will vote for. she said she has picked former vice president joe biden."}
{"original": "asked why, she said, honestly, the lesser of the evils."}
{"original": "he's got past experience, digregorio pointed out."}
{"original": "wolff said she will vote for who can best beat trump."}
{"original": "debbie morse, a democrat, agreed with wolff. and i do think biden's probably at the top of the list, but i'm still looking at the other candidates also."}
{"original": "nelly jimenez, an independent who said she will not vote for mr. trump, said she is concerned she'll have to vote for the less evil of the democratic party or whoever else shows up."}
{"original": "i am disappointed. i don't have choices. i don't feel that i have someone who's going to move me, she said."}
{"original": "sabatini argued jimenez could write in a candidate instead. i did a write-in in 2016, she said. my family took issue with me that i was complicit in trump's election … but it was a matter of conscience."}
{"original": "mr. trump's international policy has been bold and effective in ways that we never anticipated. getting rid of isis, getting rid of soleimani, getting rid of al-baghdadi, bohnenberger said."}
{"original": "i will tell you personally, i'm a zionist, she added. for a president to so boldly stand for israel is very important to me, and i'm a christian, by the way."}
{"original": "bohnenberger also said strong borders were important to her."}
{"original": "jimenez said she was concerned about the way people and children have been treated at the u.s.-mexico border."}
{"original": "there is a lot of issues for me there about racial profiling, she said. the issue of the border is one that i can't forget or forgive."}
{"original": "robinson-brown agreed. i think that donald trump is allowing people to make the decision to mistreat people at the border, to have racially charged marches, she said."}
{"original": "robinson-brown said she likes that mr. trump takes hard stances on some things, but, she said, he's not taking the hard stance on the racial issues, which are very close to me because i'm a black female."}
{"original": "we need for him to take a hard line … and say, 'hey listen, we don't act like that here,' she added."}
{"original": "i like the fact that my portfolio looks pretty nice right now. i can make my taxes next year 'cause as time goes by cost of living does not match the cost of really living, digregorio said."}
{"original": "sabatini questioned the tax cuts under mr. trump."}
{"original": "economic fairness is very important to me, she said. i'm not a bernie sanders supporter, i'm not an elizabeth warren supporter, but i believe that the tax act of 2017 was skewed in favor of the half of the 1%."}
{"original": "and the corporations as well, added doyle."}
{"original": "as homeschooling, business closures and working from home become the new normal in america, experts warn one group is already feeling the economic pain of the coronavirus more than anyone else: women, particularly working mothers."}
{"original": "as of monday evening, 33 states had announced mandatory school closures, impacting at least 32.5 million students in kindergarten through 12th grade. in states that haven't ordered closures, cities have taken matters into their own hands. new york city's public school system, the largest in the nation, announced on sunday evening it would be closing all 1,800 of its schools and telling all 1.1 million students to stay home."}
{"original": "we do know that when illness strikes, when medical needs arise, women tend to be the primary caregivers in families, particularly for children, said jessica mason, a senior policy analyst at the national partnership for women and families, in an interview with cbs news. so the need to care for children when a school is closed, it is most likely to pose a disproportionate burden on women."}
{"original": "carrie duran, a 48-year-old single mother of three in new hampshire, found out her daughters' school was closing last thursday, throwing a wrench into her part-time job as a legislative aide, something she told cbs news that she largely can't do from home. duran, who describes herself as very low income, said she's worried about providing lunches to her daughters, an expense normally covered by their school, and medication for her youngest, who has special needs."}
{"original": "your mind goes to places of an apocalyptic level, duran said. i'm a rational human being but protecting my family comes first."}
{"original": "carrie duran's three daughters: isabella, marisole and katie. carrie duran"}
{"original": "for now, duran has a food pantry she's used to feed her daughters, but she's worried about her ability to pay rent on april 1 if she's unable to work."}
{"original": "it's so scary because it's not, 'what if, what if, what if,' she said. it's 'when.'"}
{"original": "about one in five working americans are employed part-time, and women make up nearly two-thirds of that work force, according to a report from the national women's law center. part-time workers are the least likely to have access to benefits, or continue to be paid during a downturn. women are twice as likely as men to work part-time, making coronavirus-related business closures particularly devastating to mothers."}
{"original": "for decades, critically important public programs and structures have been starved of funding, and efforts to ensure that women have adequate income, health care, worker protections, support for caregivers, and nutrition and housing assistance have been met with relentless resistance, said fatima goss graves, head of the national women's law center, in a statement to cbs news on tuesday. those efforts have placed women and their families at unconscionable risk from the covid-19 crisis."}
{"original": "as congress grapples with legislation to help families get through the covid-19 outbreak — both medically and financially — graves' group recommended politicians prioritize three things in order to help mothers in particular: stabilize state governments and find ways to provide income to families as soon as possible. the organization also recommended protecting frontline workers; about 80% of healthcare workers are women, making them particularly vulnerable to the virus."}
{"original": "members of both parties have recognized the importance of helping single and low-income mothers in the federal response to the crisis. a preliminary aid package passed by the house establishes paid leave for some workers and includes hundreds of millions of dollars in emergency spending to provide food for mothers and pregnant women who lose their jobs, as well as provisions for states to help families with children who rely on schools for lunches. proposals to provide direct cash payments to americans to alleviate the crisis have also attracted widespread support on capitol hill."}
{"original": "arleja stephens, a single mother in washington, d.c., relies on her job as an hourly security guard at the smithsonian to support her four children. but last week, she found out on the news that the museum would be closing. for stephens, that meant she was out of a job. stephens's first reaction was to call her insurance company so she could start working for a rideshare company like uber or lyft, even though the work would put her at risk of exposure."}
{"original": "i'm going to do whatever i have to do to take care of my children, stephens said during a telephone interview with cbs news last week."}
{"original": "during the interview, stephens found out she'd be getting two weeks of pay while the museum was closed. she's expecting to use those funds, plus her $1,000 emergency savings, to take care of her family. in the meantime, she'll be applying for services like unemployment insurance and food stamps to make ends meet."}
{"original": "as long as it doesn't go past this month, i will be good, stephens said. after that, rent is due."}
{"original": "rampant speculation and a virtual gold rush of so-called icos -- or initial coin offerings -- have u.s. securities regulators issuing a chorus of warnings about the dangers of investing in cryptocurrencies."}
{"original": "investors should go beyond the headlines and hype to understand the risks associated with investments in cryptocurrencies, said joseph p. borg, president of the north american securities administrators association (nasaa) and director of the alabama securities commission on thursday. cryptocurrencies and investments tied to them are high-risk products with an unproven track record and high price volatility."}
{"original": "investor interest in the cryptocurrency market is understandable."}
{"original": "even though the u.s. stock market is rising rapidly, the standard & poor's 500 index's 20-plus percent gain in 2017 pales in comparison to how the major cryptocurrencies performed last year. bitcoin, for instance, now sells for roughly $15,000 -- some 15 times its year-ago value. litecoin is worth nearly 60 times its year-ago value, and ethereum's ether has had a similar run-up."}
{"original": "yet these currencies have also suffered dizzying drops. one day last november, bitcoin's value dropped 20 percent in less than two hours, and its value remains some 30 percent below the november highs. some say this rise is proof of a bubble, and its pop is certain to decimate investors."}
{"original": "however, bubble or no, investors have a wide array of reasons to be skeptical about investing in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. specifically:"}
{"original": "although the people who mine and bank cryptocurrencies maintain they have nearly unbreakable security, in numerous instances their vaults have been breached. indeed, fortune magazine maintains that cryptocurrencies are far more likely to be stolen than real currency. hacking took down a south korean bitcoin exchange, swiped $64 million from a slovenian bitcoin mine and has caused some to question the viability of some of the more recent entrants into the cryptocurrency market."}
{"original": "investors have learned the hard way that there is generally no recourse if your cryptocurrency disappears."}
{"original": "when you buy euros or dollars, you can hold them in your hand -- inspect them, use a special light to make sure they're legitimate. cryptocurrencies are traded in cyberspace, and few consumers are sophisticated enough to discern whether they're real or fake."}
{"original": "that's a nearly irresistible draw to crooks, who regulators fear are already nipping around the edges of the market, convincing gullible consumers to invest in nonexistent currencies. indeed, the texas state securities board on thursday asked for an emergency cease-and-desist order against a british company called bitconnect, which is soliciting investors with promises of massive monthly returns. that's because it hasn't registered with state securities regulators, nor even provided an office address."}
{"original": "regulators shut down a similar dubai-based cryptocurrency operation in december."}
{"original": "what makes most currencies valuable is investor faith in what backs them. the u.s. dollar, for instance, is backed by the full faith and credit of the u.s. government, which -- if all else fails -- has the ability to tax its citizens to pay its debts. cryptocurrencies have no such government backing, and when they're deposited in vaults, they're also not insured by the federal deposit insurance corp."}
{"original": "if investors suddenly lose faith in the ability of bitcoin's hierarchy to control the amount of currency issued or keep it safe, the value could drop to nothing overnight."}
{"original": "generally speaking, you accumulate money to buy things. however, the number things you can buy with cryptocurrencies is severely limited. bitcoin, the oldest and best-established of these currencies, brags that 100,000 merchants accept it as a form of payment."}
{"original": "but about 36 percent of those are other tech companies -- websites, hosting registrars and vpn services. if you pull those out, you have less than 70,000 merchants willing to accept bitcoin, worldwide. finding one of those merchants isn't very hard, but it's not as easy as, say, finding a merchant that will accept your visa card, which is good at roughly 29 million establishments. and can get you real cash at 2.3 million automated teller machines."}
{"original": "zacks investment research said the biggest risk for cryptocurrencies are governments themselves. why? they could simply outlaw cryptocurrencies, and they might if the currencies ever become a threat to managing monetary policy."}
{"original": "to clarify, governments (normally through central banks) encourage -- or slow -- economic growth by managing their money supply. when the u.s. was in the depths of recession, the federal reserve pumped money into the financial markets to encourage spending, and thus, economic growth. because cryptocurrencies circumvent this management, they could impair countries' ability to manage their economic health."}
{"original": "crytocurrencies are currently a relative blip in the world currency markets, accounting for less than 1 percent of the world's cash. thus, they have yet to create any significant risk to a major financial system. however, if they did, governments have the right to make the currency illegal and force users and investors underground."}
{"original": "few governments have so far acted to restrict -- or outlaw -- cryptocurrencies, but they could. china, in fact, already has."}
{"original": "if you choose to invest in these products, please ask questions and demand clear answers, securities and exchange commissioner jay clayton recently urged investors."}
{"original": "emphasizing that you could lose everything you put into cryptocurrencies, nasaa's borg added that this market is not for the faint of heart."}

{"original": "after an emergency meeting on saturday, the national education union, which represents over 450,000 education workers, called on prime minister boris johnson's conservative government to move learning online for at least two weeks. it also told members they have a legal right not to have to work in an unsafe environment of accelerating coronavirus cases, hospital admissions and deaths."}
{"original": "we are doing our job as a union by informing our members that they have a legal right to refuse to work in unsafe conditions which are a danger to their health and to the health of their school communities, said kevin courtney, the union's joint general secretary."}

{"original": "climate activists who have worked with president joe biden see his day 1 executive actions on climate policy as a promising start. but it's just that, a start — they have specific policy goals for his administration."}
{"original": "mr. biden signed executive actions wednesday afternoon to rejoin the paris climate accord, direct federal agencies to consider revising vehicle fuel economy and emissions standards, and cancel permits for the construction of the keystone xl pipeline — all reversals of policies put in place by president trump."}
{"original": "sunrise movement, a progressive, youth-led group, had a seat at the table during the biden transition as its co-founder and other allies sat on the climate task force, started as a policy team meant to bridge senator bernie sanders' climate platform with biden's after sanders dropped out of the race for president."}
{"original": "since that time, the biden team has made multiple concessions, said sunrise political director evan weber. weber credits the group and other progressives for convincing the administration to create the office of domestic climate policy, and said it led the push to nominate representative deb haaland as interior secretary."}
{"original": "the climate team as a whole has some of the strongest progressive bona fides across the administration which speaks to the climate movement's growing power, weber said."}
{"original": "tiernan sittenfeld, senior vice president for government affairs at the league of conservation voters, told cbs news that the biden team is the most pro-climate in history."}
{"original": "not that the obama administration wasn't committed and wasn't pro-environment, [but] i think that this administration is so clearly prioritizing this, she said."}
{"original": "expectations couldn't be higher for the administration. while there's obvious relief amongst climate activists that democrats are back in the white house and in control of congress, none are taking their foot off the pedal."}
{"original": "we need to see a lot more administrative progress coming over the next days and weeks and every day of this administration, said sittenfeld."}
{"original": "this week, the league of conservation voters published its policy priorities for the biden-harris administration and 117th congress, a 38-point agenda broken into categories ranging from immediate action (announce commitment to protect 30% of our lands and waters by 2030), to first 100 days (tighten epa and doj enforcement of polluters harming frontline communities), and beyond (establish mandatory requirements to reduce agricultural runoff that causes harmful algal blooms.)"}
{"original": "sunrise sent its own memo to the incoming biden administration tuesday evening. obtained exclusively by cbs news, the top priorities for the incoming biden administration reads like a fiery plea addressed directly to the president:"}
{"original": "use your bully pulpit: this is your fdr moment. you have said you want to have an fdr-sized presidency, and much of what was accomplished in that time was done by fdr taking a leading role in corralling the nation into action and taking bold executive action."}
{"original": "the tone is unrelenting. sunrise's political director said lessons learned from the last democratic administration contribute to that approach. many on the progressive left fault president obama for not doing enough to combat the climate crisis. weber, a student-activist during the obama years, recalled going from excitement and turning into extreme disappointment."}
{"original": "young progressives learned that you can't take these promises at their face value and that the work does not end after an election, he said. we're definitely gonna ask nicely at first and when demands aren't met, we'll change tones and tactics."}
{"original": "sunrise believes it can apply pressure when it needs to. the group has grown exponentially since it began in 2017. today there are 477 active chapters across the country with approximately 87,000 members. weber told cbs news that they've seen more than 100 of those chapters launched since the pandemic began."}
{"original": "they plan to mobilize their hundreds of chapters and lean on specific targets in congress, including democratic senate leadership and moderates such as senators joe manchin and kyrsten sinema. there will be social media pushes, ad buys, and in-person rallies. thursday will mark a day of action when sunrise members plan to rally outside members' local offices — both democrat and republican."}
{"original": "there is an activated, energized, mobilized base of young people that really, really wants change and will reward politicians and defend politicians who are allies ... and will punish and go after people who are standing in the way of progress, said weber."}
{"original": "also this week, organize for justice, a sister organization of the progressive pac justice democrats, plans to release two short documentaries to usher in the decade of the green new deal. the short films will highlight workers on the front lines of the climate crisis who call on president biden and democrats to enact a policy agenda centered on climate, jobs and justice."}
{"original": "justice democrats communications director waleed shahid told cbs news that he believes mr. biden has the will to enact lasting climate policy and be a once-in-a-generation american president. however, that optimism, shahid warned, will not lead to complacency."}

{"original": "new york --the foreign minister ofnorth korea says in an interview with the associated press that his country is ready to halt its nuclear tests if the united states suspends its annual military exercises with south korea."}
{"original": "he also defended the country's right to maintain a nuclear deterrent and warned that north korea won't be cowed by international sanctions."}
{"original": "foreign minister ri su yong, in his first interview with a western news organization, held firm saturday to pyongyang's longstanding position that the u.s. drove his country to develop nuclear weapons as a deterrent. at the same time, he suggested that suspending the military exercises could open the door to reduced tensions."}
{"original": "if we continue on this path of confrontation, this will lead to very catastrophic results, not only for the two countries but for the whole entire world as well, he said. it is really crucial for the united states government to withdraw its hostile policy against the dprk and as an expression of this stop the military exercises, war exercises, in the korean peninsula. then we will respond likewise."}
{"original": "ri, who spoke calmly and in measured words, a contrast to the often bombastic verbiage used by the north's media, claimed the north's proposal was very logical."}
{"original": "stop the nuclear war exercises in the korean peninsula, then we should also cease our nuclear tests, he said, during the interview, conducted in the country's diplomatic mission to the united nations. he spoke beneath portraits of kim il sung and kim jung il, north korea's two previous leaders."}
{"original": "if the exercises are halted for some period, for some years, he added, new opportunities may arise for the two countries and for the whole entire world as well."}
{"original": "dprk is the acronym for north korea's official name, the democratic people's republic of korea."}
{"original": "ri's proposal, which he said he hoped u.s. policymakers would heed, may well fall on deaf ears. north korea, which sees the u.s.-south korean exercises as a rehearsal for invasion, has floated similar proposals to washington in the past but the u.s. has insisted the north give up its nuclear weapons program first before any negotiations. the result has been a stalemate between the two countries that ri said has put the peninsula at the crossroads of a thermonuclear war."}
{"original": "sanctions, he said, won't sway the north."}
{"original": "if they believe they can actually frustrate us with sanctions, they are totally mistaken."}
{"original": "ri, in new york to attend a united nations' meeting on sustainable development, said the possibility of conflict has increased significantly this year because the exercises have taken on what pyongyang sees as a more aggressive and threatening tone -- including training to conduct precision decapitation strikes on north korea's leadership."}
{"original": "this year's exercises are the biggest ever, involving about 300,000 troops. washington and seoul say they beefed up the maneuvers after north korea conducted its fifth nuclear test, in january, which also brought a new round of tough sanctions by the u.n. down on pyongyang's head. the exercises are set to continue through the end of the month."}
{"original": "pyongyang, meanwhile, has responded with a series of missile launches and statements in its media that the country has developed its long-range ballistic missile and nuclear warhead technologies to the point that they now present a credible deterrent and could even be used against targets on the u.s. mainland, though not all foreign analysts accept that claim."}
{"original": "ri's comments to the ap came just hours after north korea launched what was believed to be a submarine-launched ballistic missile in its latest show of defiance as the u.s.-south korea exercises wind down."}
{"original": "ri also used his presence at the u.n. conference as a forum to denounce washington, saying in a brief statement that while north korea is contributing to the objectives of global sustainable development by taking measures to double its production of grains to solve its food problem by 2030 and by reforesting 1.67 million hectares (4.13 million acres) of mountainous areas, it is doing so under the most adverse conditions due to outside forces."}
{"original": "in the interview, he stated that the united states has used its power to get other countries to join in pressure on north korea."}
{"original": "a country as small as the dprk cannot actually be a threat to the u.s. or to the world, he told the ap. how great would it be if the world were to say to the united states and the american government not to conduct any more military exercises in the korean peninsula ... but there is not a single country that says this to the u.s."}
{"original": "these big countries alone or together are telling us that we should calm down, he said. for us this is like a sentence, that we should accept our death and refuse our right to sovereignty."}
{"original": "ri said north korea is not encouraged by the thawing of relations between washington and cuba or iran."}
{"original": "we're happy for the cuban people and the iranian people that they have reached successes on their path to pursuing their own goals and interests, he said. but he added that those cases differ totally from the u.s.-north korea relationship."}

{"original": "the dorns expect to join the growing ranks of african americans who do not own their homes, a rate that was nearly 30 percentage points higher than that of whites in 2016, according to a new report."}
{"original": "the person who bought the house, we lost all of our memories, said dorn, a pastor and case manager with the city health department. he put the furniture out on the street, and it was just devastating to my family."}
{"original": "the nation's homeownership rate appears to be stabilizing as people rebound from the 2007 recession that left millions unemployed and home values underwater, according to the report by harvard university's joint center for housing studies. but it found african americans aren't sharing in the recovery, even as whites, asian americans and latinos slowly see gains in home-buying. the center said the disparity between whites and blacks is at its highest in 70-plus years of data."}
{"original": "experts say reasons for the lower homeownership rate range from historic underemployment and low wages to a recession-related foreclosure crisis that hit black communities particularly hard. in 2004, the pinnacle of u.s. homeownership, three-quarters of whites and nearly half of blacks owned homes, according to the harvard study."}
{"original": "by 2016, the african-american homeowner rate had fallen to 42.2 percent and lagged 29.7 percentage points behind whites, nearly a percentage point higher than in 2015."}
{"original": "now, a lack of affordable housing and stricter lending are making it harder for first-time buyers to obtain what traditionally has been considered an essential part of the american dream and a way to build wealth."}
{"original": "it has always been historically and systemically harder for blacks, and we were seeing there a little bit of progress, and now we're back at square one, said alanna mccargo, co-director of the housing finance policy center at the urban institute, a think-tank focused on inner-city issues that published a similar report."}
{"original": "an ap analysis of u.s. census bureau statistics shows some pockets of the midwest and california had the lowest homeownership rates for african americans, while some areas of the south had the highest."}
{"original": "low inventory adds to the problem, said jeffrey hicks, incoming president of the national association of real estate brokers, which was founded in 1947 to promote fair housing opportunities for minorities. the atlanta area has only about 30,000 properties for sale through real estate agents, compared with approximately 100,000 about 13 years ago, he said."}
{"original": "you had subdivisions going up everywhere in terms of newer homes, hicks said. we haven't seen that resurgence of new housing stock."}
{"original": "african americans snapped up homes at the peak of the housing bubble, lured by generous lending and a glut of affordable properties, housing experts say. lenders also targeted minorities, pushing riskier subprime loans even when applicants qualified for lower-interest loans."}
{"original": "graciano de la cruz, 70, grew up in san francisco, the child of a filipino father and an african-american mother. in 1960s, the city condemned his mother's house for redevelopment in the historically black fillmore neighborhood. she was given a housing voucher and became a renter, losing any equity she could have passed to her children."}
{"original": "he and his wife, buena, who is filipino-american, must now sell their own home of two decades to pay off a debt that stemmed from a pick-a-payment loan with world savings bank in august 2006."}
{"original": "they asked for a loan with a fixed rate, but the lender said an adjustable-rate package would meet their needs. the initial monthly payment for the pick-a-payment loan was about $1,700."}
{"original": "then her health declined, and he lost his job. in 2014, wells fargo (wfc), which had purchased world savings, issued a notice of default. by then, the monthly payments had mushroomed to roughly $3,000."}
{"original": "i can't sleep, de la cruz said. i fear i might get a knock on the door, and the banker will come up with sheriff's agents talking about, 'you got to leave now.'"}
{"original": "the pick-a-payment loans drew wide government scrutiny. in 2010, wells fargo agreed to pay $24 million to end an investigation by eight states, including california, into whether lenders later acquired by the bank made unsustainable mortgages without disclosing the terms."}
{"original": "wells fargo has vowed to help create more than 250,000 new african-american homeowners to address declining homeownership. but spokesman alfredo padilla said the bank could not find a way to help the couple."}
{"original": "dorn, the 60-year-old pastor, says chase (jpm) misapplied a payment he made in 2008 and then failed to keep proper records. he made several payments on a modified trial loan, which the bank then denied."}
{"original": "in 2015, the home he bought for $168,000 in 1996 was sold for $482,000. in may, the new owner sold it for $850,000."}
{"original": "chase spokeswoman suzanne alexander said foreclosure is always the last option, pursued only when other avenues are exhausted."}
{"original": "yet there are bright spots in the homeowning front."}
{"original": "the new haven metro area in connecticut, for example, reported an increase in black homeownership from 2010 to 2015. georgia's albany area, which is predominantly african american, saw a 15 percent increase from 2005 to 2015."}
{"original": "in detroit, a largely african-american city wracked by foreclosures, the mayor last year announced a financing program to make home-buying easier. previously, banks couldn't provide loans for more than a home's appraised value, which wasn't enough to cover needed repairs or renovations."}
{"original": "and in jacksonville, florida, 32-year-old natasha jones recently bought her first home, a three-bedroom listed at $135,000. the single mother of three worked with a member of the nonprofit neighborworks america, which supports community development, to clear up her credit and save for a down payment on a wells fargo-financed loan."}

{"original": "the janet yellen era is over."}
{"original": "jerome powell, yellen's successor as federal reserve chair, is stepping directly into the spotlight on tuesday when he appears before congress for the first time in his new role. and the stakes could hardly be higher."}
{"original": "stocks are just recovering from one of the most harrowing declines on record -- with prices falling more than 10 percent at their lows. leading the tumble were fears over rising wages, higher inflation and increasing interest rates. some dovish comments from powell's fed colleagues (talking up the specter of more bond-buying stimulus in the next recession, for instance) have since calmed nerves."}
{"original": "but the underlying trends remain, with wage inflation set to rise further. and that means markets could be set for another wave of selling in the weeks to come."}
{"original": "bank of america merrill lynch's chief investment strategist michael hartnett advises investors to prepare for higher volatility to persist. his bull & bear indicator remains deep in sell territory because excess optimism continues on risk assets, and thus the pain trade for stocks and credit [is] still to the downside."}
{"original": "his team expects the incoming economic data to be stagflationary/policy hawkish resulting in another risk-off bout of selling. the consequence of a multitude of structural factors -- higher inflation, a tightening labor market, fiscal malfeasance in washington, fed rate hikes, trade tensions -- is captured in the way the u.s. dollar has been trending lower (although it enjoyed a respite in february) while u.s. bond yields rise."}
{"original": "that's a rare phenomenon. how rare? less than 10 percent of the time over the past 50 years. and those years weren't comfortable: on average inflation rose 2 percent, stocks fell 9 percent and volatility rose 22 points."}
{"original": "hartnett recommends continuing to watch for evidence of higher wages (chart below) as the barometer for what comes next. recent comments from treasury secretary steven mnuchin claimed that higher wages don't necessarily lead to higher inflation, which the fed's own research suggests is true, when wage gains are relatively muted. however, the connection between rapid wage growth and high inflation is much stronger."}
{"original": "merrill lynch global economist ethan harris believes the case for higher wage growth is easily made with the economy at or very near full employment -- something the fed admitted in its most recent meeting minutes."}
{"original": "with the unemployment rate below the fed's estimate of the natural rate and at the lowest level since december 2000, harris highlights other measures of labor slack that have improved substantially and are now comparable to their previous-cycle levels: involuntary part-time employment, the number of discouraged workers outside the workforce and the hiring and quit rate."}
{"original": "even the labor force participation rate, which is being dragged down because of structural and demographic issues, has improved. the congressional budget office estimates participation was at about 99.4 percent of potential, a cyclical high. the cbs has penciled in wage inflation of 3 percent by the middle of this year."}
{"original": "and it's looking for the unemployment rate to fall to 3.2 percent by the end of 2019 -- a level last seen in the 1950s."}
{"original": "the result will be an acceleration in the fed's rate hike pace, with three hikes in 2018 and three more in 2019. that's double what the market has priced in for 2019, and it will worsen losses in the bond market. buckle up."}
{"original": "being a mom has plenty of advantages, like your kids showering you with love on mother's day. but the disadvantages are practical. for one, you earn less."}
{"original": "women tend to earn more than men when first out of college. but once they have kids, the typical mom earns less than similarly educated men and other women who don't have kids, according to the economic policy institute. moms are also relegated to handling a disproportionate share of the household chores, which eats into the time they can spend at work and puts them at a disadvantage in high-wage, high-pressure jobs that demand long work weeks, the epi study says."}
{"original": "then too, work breaks caused by temporary disability -- a.k.a. pregnancy -- can disrupt your ability to save and hamper your job prospects when you return to the working world."}
{"original": "men typically get a bump in pay when they become a father, says sallie krawcheck, chief executive of ellevest, an investing platform for women. women get a penalty -- and it doesn't matter whether you have your kids young or wait until you're established in your career."}
{"original": "that said, mothers don't have to spend their lives with such pay inequality, and stay stuck behind the financial curve. if you have kids, or plan to, there are five concrete steps you can take to get your financial life on track and keep it there, no matter what."}
{"original": "1. invest young. the moment you have a job, be it at 16 or 23, you ought to be investing for long-term goals. don't wait until you think you can afford to invest because every year of delay costs you compound investment returns, krawcheck says. compounding allows you to earn higher returns on investment gains, which is incredibly powerful over time."}
{"original": "consider a hypothetical young woman we'll call sally, who starts saving $500 a month from the day she gets her first full-time job at age 22. assuming she earns 9 percent yearly on her investments, she'll have $96,757 a decade later."}
{"original": "let's say sally takes a work break at that point and stops saving. if she simply leaves her investments alone and they continue earning 9 percent per year on average, she'll have $1.4 million at age 62 -- even if she never saves another dime. it's worth mentioning that she only saved $60,000 of her own money. the rest is compound investment returns."}
{"original": "what would have happened if she started saving later, but didn't take that break? if sally started saving at age 32, saved the same $500 per month and earned an average of 9%, she'd have just $915,371 at age 62. and she would have contributed three times as much -- $180,000 – of her own money."}
{"original": "2. take the match. if sally did her saving in a 401(k) plan that offered a company match, she'd be even better off. most large companies will kick in between 25 cents and a dollar for each dollar their workers contribute to the 401(k). so assuming that sally's employer matched half of her contributions, she'd have $750 going into savings each month for 10 years. at age 32, when she took off to have kids, she'd have $145,136 invested. left alone to compound, that would turn into $2.14 million by the time she reached age 62, assuming the same 9 percent average return."}
{"original": "3. invest aggressively. is 9 percent too high a return to expect? not if you invest aggressively -- that means in the stock market -- and for the long term. although stock prices are volatile over the short run, over the 85-year stretch tracked by financial research firm morningstar, a diversified portfolio of big company stocks returned 10 percent on average annually; a portfolio made up of 70% stocks and 30% bonds earned an average of 9.1 percent. u.s. treasury bills, on the other hand, don't put your principal at risk, but they historically have returned just 3.4 percent, which is only slightly more than the rate of inflation."}
{"original": "what does that mean in dollars and cents? if you invested $10,000 in u.s. treasury bills, you would have accumulated just $27,692 at the end of 30 years. if you invested the same $10,000 in a broad basket of u.s. stocks, you would have $198,374, which is seven times more. that makes stocks the investment of choice for long-term goals, such as your far-away retirement."}
{"original": "4. negotiate. if you decide you're going to take a work break to raise kids, know that about 30 percent of those surveyed by the ellevate network ended up taking a substantial – 20 percent or more -- pay cut when they came back. unfortunately, the impact of that reduction in pay compounds just like the interest on investments. but of course, this compounding works against you."}
{"original": "if you come back at a lower rate of pay, you get raises off that lower rate of pay too, krawcheck says. so you might think taking two years off costs you $170,000, but it really costs about $1.7 million."}
{"original": "before going back to work, consult websites such as comparably, glassdoor and payscale, which list average pay ranges in various fields and geographies. if you have friends and former colleagues who might be willing to share salary data, that can also help. in addition to negotiating a competitive salary, consider asking for other benefits that you might want, from additional time off to the ability to work from home a few days a week."}
{"original": "5. ask. want a raise? ask for one, krawcheck says. sure, your boss might say no. but the odds are in your favor. when the ellevate financial network surveyed professional women about what happened after they asked for a raise, 75 percent said they got it."}
{"original": "washington — the trump administration on monday began enforcing stringent income-based requirements for green cards and certain visas, instituting the most ambitious unilateral effort in recent history to change the nation's legal immigration system."}
{"original": "after multiple legal barriers blocking the implementation of the new requirements were cleared by the conservative-leaning supreme court, most green card applicants in the u.s. and abroad will now be subjected to a redefined public charge test. under the rules by the departments of state and homeland security, immigration officials have more power to deny applications from petitioners they deem are, or could become, an economic burden on the country."}
{"original": "the sweeping policy change, one of the administration's top immigration priorities, is expected to block the entry of hundreds of thousands of people, disproportionately affecting prospective immigrants from asia, africa and latin america, according to experts."}
{"original": "since it unveiled the final regulation last summer, the administration has portrayed it as a way to promote self-sufficiency among immigrant communities. (the rule) enforces longstanding law requiring aliens to be self-sufficient, reaffirming the american ideals of hard work, perseverance and determination, said ken cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of the department of homeland security."}
{"original": "immigrant advocates and democrats, however, say the rule amounts to a wealth test that will revive a discriminatory immigration system that shuts america's doors to low-income and working-class immigrants from the developing world."}
{"original": "in 1924, our policy explicitly made it much harder for people from some parts of the world than others to come here. there were country-based quotas and there were country-based categorical exclusions for asian immigrants, julia gelatt, a senior analyst at the nonpartisan migration policy institute, told cbs news."}
{"original": "today, it's not quite as explicit, but by placing such drawn emphasis on people's income and income potential, by putting in place what is essentially a wealth test, this public charge rule could have some of the same impact of reshaping our immigration system to be more european and less latin american, gelatt added."}
{"original": "soon after its final version was published last summer, the rule was blocked in court, with one federal judge in new york calling it repugnant to the american dream. however, circuit courts subsequently lifted three of the four nationwide injunctions. the administration then turned to the supreme court, which lifted the remaining nationwide injunction last month, as well as a state-wide injunction in illinois on friday, allowing officials to enforce the policy on monday across the country."}
{"original": "in a withering dissenting opinion on friday, justice sonia sotomayor expressed concern about the conservative majority's recent decisions allowing the trump administration to move forward with fundamental policy changes without cases being decided on merit."}
{"original": "perhaps most troublingly, the court's recent behavior on stay applications has benefited one litigant over all others, sotomayor wrote in her opinion, noting the conservative jurists on the bench have repeatedly sided with the administration."}
{"original": "a broad and sweeping definition of public charge"}
{"original": "for decades, the u.s. has asked most green card and visa petitioners to prove they won't be a public charge — or an economic burden — on the country."}
{"original": "the term dates back to a time period in u.s. history when the government actively sought to severely limit immigration from developing, non-white countries. it was first codified in u.s. law in 1882, the same year the u.s. enacted the discriminatory chinese exclusion act, which barred the entry of most chinese immigrants on the premise that they jeopardized the good order of certain localities."}
{"original": "in the late 1990s, the clinton administration issued guidance saying only cash benefits could be considered when determining whether an immigrant could be a public charge. the trump administration's policy, however, substantially expands this centuries-old term by broadening the type and amount of benefits — as well as income-based factors — that count against immigrants seeking to stay or move to the u.s."}
{"original": "this certainly is a very broad and sweeping use of the public charge legislation, gelatt said."}
{"original": "under the new regulation, caseworkers would consider enrollment in the widely used supplemental nutrition assistance program (snap), certain federally funded medicaid benefits and a variety of forms of government-subsidized housing, including the popular section 8 vouchers."}
{"original": "officials would deem an immigrant a public charge and deny the application if they determine he or she is more likely than not to use one of the considered benefits for 12 months or longer over the span of three years. on certain occasions, those deemed a public charge could post a bond for an amount no less than $8,100."}
{"original": "to determine whether prospective immigrants are likely to become a public charge, caseworkers would also take into account their income, assets, age, educational skills, english language proficiency, health and other factors. since those expected to be affected by the rule are not eligible for most public benefits because they are not u.s. citizens or permanent residents, critics of the regulation say it is designed to severely restrict immigration based on those factors."}
{"original": "advocates have also denounced harmful effects the rule is having on people who are technically not directly affected by it but who are scared that the use of any public benefits might jeopardize their or their family's immigration cases. researchers have been documenting a chilling effect stemming from the proposed changes that has prompted fearful immigrant families, some with u.s. citizen members, to drop out of essential welfare programs."}
{"original": "to curb this confusion and fear, advocacy groups and local officials have staged public awareness campaigns. organizations like the legal aid society, make the road new york and empire justice center have created tools for lawyers and advocates to advise and screen immigrants on the new requirements."}
{"original": "the implementation of the public charge rule today is a devastating blow for all americans. the rule is heartless, cruel, and betrays our core values as a nation of immigrants, kristin brown, president of the empire justice center, said in a statement. this public charge screening tool will guide community-based organizations in helping families make crucial decisions that may carry life-changing consequences."}

{"original": "the student who actually took my phone and took pictures turned around and told me your day of reckoning is coming, she said."}
{"original": "since the incident, arthur said four photos taken from her phone were printed out and put in her mailbox. she claimed there was a message threatening her and her sons on the back of one photo."}
{"original": "she resigned earlier this week, claiming she was pressured to do so by the school district. arthur said according to district policy, the student should have been expelled."}
{"original": "the whole premise of my privacy being invaded his being ignored and that's what's wrong, she said."}
{"original": "superintendent david eubanks has said arthur was to blame for leaving students unattended during a four-minute break between classes and that the school was concerned she could be contributing to the delinquency of a minor."}
{"original": "eubanks released a statement friday reiterating his belief that arthur was at fault and claiming that she has used the media to transmit false information obviously intended for the purpose of deflecting the incident totally to students."}
{"original": "we do know that her failure to properly supervise students entrusted to her care will negatively impact the lives of students and their parents, eubanks said."}

{"original": "on the silver river, fla. — wildlife managers in florida say they want to remove roaming monkeys from the state in light of a new study published wednesday that finds some of the animals are excreting a virus that can be dangerous to humans."}
{"original": "scientists studying a growing population of rhesus macaques in silver springs state park say that rather than just carrying herpes b, which is common in the species, some of the monkeys have the virus in their saliva and other bodily fluids, posing a potential risk of spreading the disease."}
{"original": "human cases of the virus have been rare, with about 50 documented worldwide, and there have been no known transmissions of it to people from wild rhesus macaques in florida or elsewhere. however, the researchers say the issue has not been thoroughly studied."}
{"original": "the findings, published in the centers for disease control and prevention journal emerging infectious diseases, prompted the researchers from the universities of florida and washington to warn florida's wildlife agency that the infected monkeys should be considered a public health concern."}
{"original": "state wildlife officials say they are taking the problem seriously."}
{"original": "without management action, the presence and continued expansion of non-native rhesus macaques in florida can result in serious human health and safety risks including human injury and transmission of disease, thomas eason, assistant executive director of the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission, said in a statement."}
{"original": "eason would not elaborate on what specific management tactics the state may employ, but a spokeswoman said the commission supports ridding the state of the invasive creatures."}
{"original": "the commission supports the removal of these monkeys from the environment to help reduce the threat they pose. this can be done in a variety of ways, spokeswoman carli segelson said in an email."}
{"original": "the macaques, native to asia, are one of florida's many nonnative wildlife species. their contacts with the public, including last summer when the monkeys chased a family, have made them somewhat notorious critters and have caused two partial park closures since 2016. the monkeys also have roamed far outside the park: dozens were photographed recently swarming a deer feeder outside a home in ocala. they have been spotted in trees in the sarasota and tallahassee areas."}
{"original": "the herpes b virus has been fatal to 21 of the 50 humans known to have contracted it from macaque bites and scratches while working with the animals in laboratories, according to the cdc."}
{"original": "the cdc said there is always concern about the threat that diseases like herpes b virus pose to people, especially in settings where there is frequent interaction between animals and humans where scratches or bites can occur."}
{"original": "herpes b virus infection is extremely rare in people, but when it does occur, it can result in severe brain damage or death if the patient is not treated immediately, cdc spokesman ian branam said in a statement."}
{"original": "the researchers estimate that up to 30 percent of the scores of florida's feral macaques may be actively excreting the virus."}
{"original": "the findings suggest a public health concern, said david civitello, an emory university biology professor who was not involved in the study. still, he said, while the research confirms the presence of the virus in the monkeys' bodily secretions, more work needs to be done to establish how much virus there is, and how easily transferable it is."}
{"original": "it is interesting to see oral shedding at all, civitello said in an email after reviewing the paper. it will be important to figure out whether underreporting, low quantities, or low transmissibility would explain why infections in tourists have not been reported."}
{"original": "the presence of the virus in the monkeys' feces and saliva presents issues for park workers and visitors, who could be endangered if bitten or scratched."}
{"original": "human visitors to the park are most likely to be exposed ... through contact with saliva from macaque bites and scratches or from contact with virus shed through urine and feces, the paper's authors wrote."}
{"original": "the creatures draw nature lovers. on a chilly day in november, capt. tom o'lenick, who has navigated the silver river for 35 years, hollered from his charter boat into the dense surrounding forest. monkey, monkey, monkey! he cried."}
{"original": "more than two dozen monkeys eventually appeared in trees on the riverbank. within minutes, curious kayakers and other boat tour operators pulled close to shore for a better look and to snap photos."}
{"original": "minutes later another troop was running along the opposite riverbank."}
{"original": "the animals' forebears were brought to an island in the silver river early in the 1930s as a tourist attraction due to the popularity of the tarzan movies."}
{"original": "but there was human error in that plan."}
{"original": "they didn't know monkeys could swim, o'lenick said. now there are believed to be about 175 in silver springs state park."}
{"original": "while there are no official statistics on monkey attacks on humans in the park, a state-sponsored study in the 1990s found 31 monkey-human incidents, with 23 resulting in human injury between 1977 and 1984."}
{"original": "samantha wisely, a university of florida disease ecologist and one of the study's authors, said whether the monkeys pose a significant public health threat is still unknown. the paper recommends that florida wildlife managers consider the virus in future policy decisions."}
{"original": "we don't have any silver bullet; that's the nature of science, wisely said."}
{"original": "parler, a social media site that prides itself on allowing unrestricted freedom of speech, has been suspended from apple's app store and google play for failing to moderate content that incites violence. the suspensions come as multiple social media companies are cracking down on posts that promote violence in the wake of the assault on the u.s. capitol."}
{"original": "apple said on saturday that while it has always supported diverse points of view on the app store, there is no place on our platform for threats of violence and illegal activity."}
{"original": "parler has not taken adequate measures to address the proliferation of these threats to people's safety, the company said in a statement. we have suspended parler from the app store until they resolve these issues."}
{"original": "prior to its removal from the app store, apple told parler's developers that their measures for addressing dangerous and objectionable content are inadequate."}
{"original": "parler has not upheld its commitment to moderate and remove harmful or dangerous content encouraging violence and illegal activity, apple told parler. ...you referenced that parler has been taking this content 'very seriously for weeks.' however, the processes parler has put in place to moderate or prevent the spread of dangerous and illegal content have proved insufficient."}
{"original": "according to apple, parler said that it would initiate a moderation plan for the time being and that they would create a temporary task force."}
{"original": "parler will not be reinstated in the app store unless apple receives an update that is compliant with the app store review guidelines and you have demonstrated your ability to effectively moderate and filter the dangerous and harmful content on your service."}

{"original": "our longstanding policies require that apps displaying user-generated content have moderation policies and enforcement that removes egregious content like posts that incite violence, a company spokesperson said. all developers agree to these terms and we have reminded parler of this clear policy in recent months."}
{"original": "the company said it's aware of continued posting in the app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the u.s, adding that in light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app's listings from the play store until it addresses these issues."}
{"original": "there have been dozens of posts on the app that encourage users to partake in actions similar to those of trump supporters rioting at the capitol on wednesday."}

{"original": "the time for peaceful protests has past they're stealing this election, the post reads. ...#calltoarms take back our country."}
{"original": "the google spokesperson said that the company recognizes content policies are debatable and that immediately removing content that violates the policy can be difficult, but that moderating egregious content is required by apps nonetheless."}
{"original": "the suspension comes hours after many pointed out how calls for violence on the app have intensified since wednesday."}
{"original": "one post, highlighted by new york representative alexandria ocasio-cortez, calls the rioters patriots who were carrying banners of support for the greatest president the world has ever known and said they will return to the area on january 19, weapons in tow."}
{"original": "what are @apple and @googleplay doing about this? ocasio-cortez tweeted."}
{"original": "california representative ro khanna called on amazon to follow in google play's footsteps, as the app is hosted by amazon web services. amazon should deny parler services until jan 21 unless they commit to removing all posts related to incitement of violence concerning inauguration, khanna tweeted. this will help prevent further violence and save lives."}
{"original": "the suspension on the app store came soon after twitter announced that president trump has been permanently banned from using his personal twitter account."}
{"original": "twitter's announcement sparked fury on parler, leading some users to call for war. the united states of america has been taken over by the communist party today. you no longer have freedom of speech. they're coming for your guns next, one post says. civil war is coming."}
{"original": "this might seem like a harsh call, but war is upon us. we didn't want this, but when the enemy shuts down every form of communication for patriots to get our story out to the public unfiltered there really is no other option. this is our time for #civilwar2, another post reads."}
{"original": "parler ceo john matze posted on his parler account friday afternoon that we will not cave to pressure from anti-competitive actors."}
{"original": "we will and always have enforced our rules against violence and illegal activity. but we wont cave to politically motivated companies and those authoritarians who hate free speech, he said."}

[...]. we have to think about changing the cost curve in more than money, imposing on them issues and problems that they have to deal with like they're imposing on us. and so i do believe that we need to be thinking about new technologies of defense. we need to be thinking about the kind of technology that allows us to strike with precision at range and not cost us an arm and a leg to do it."}

{"original": "welcome to intelligence matters with michael morell. i'm retired admiral sandy winnefeld, filling in for michael while he's on travel. our guest today is retired air force general phil breedlove, who served as the 17th supreme allied commander of europe and as the commander of u.s.-european command."}
{"original": "born in georgia, he attended georgia tech and was commissioned through their rotc program. he flew f-16s in both europe and asia and also served as the vice chief of staff of the air force. my close association with and deep admiration for phil began when we were fraternity brothers at georgia tech."}
{"original": "i'm fond of saying that, at the time, people expected phil to succeed. phil is recognized as being one of our most effective, if not our most effective, supreme allied commanders of nato and has done a lot in his public and private life to point out the danger represented by vladimir putin and the russian federation. since he retired he's assumed a variety of roles in business and has also taught at the sam nunn school of international affairs at his alma mater. phil, welcome to intelligence matters."}
{"original": "sandy, it's great to be here with you. and i look forward to our conversation."}
{"original": "well, we have a lot to cover today. before we get into talking a bit about europe and asia, the title of this program is, of course, intelligence matters. can you give me a sense, as a long-serving air force officer, former four-star general in several key positions, of how you interacted with and depended on the world of intelligence?"}
{"original": "well, as you know, having also been a pilot in your career, in the early more tactical part of my career, it was all about, how was i going to prepare for my mission? what was the intelligence required to get to a target, deliver a weapon, etcetera? a very tactical look."}
{"original": "and that obviously, through the years, changed. as the vice chief of staff of the air force, begin to look at what intelligence told me about the requirements that we had to make to shape our air force. and then finally, i don't have to tell you that in my role as the saceur and as the commander of u.s.-european command, and trying to shape policy and the reactions of 28 nations in nato, intelligence was key. and having not only an understanding of what u.s. intelligence was, but what the intelligence that was agreed to by all 28 nations, what that was, and the problems and opportunities it generated."}
{"original": "phil, let's talk a little bit about asia, starting with the korean peninsula. you did three tours on the peninsula, including commanding a fighter wing at kunsan air base in 2001. a lot has happened since then. how do you look at the current situation on the peninsula and the way ahead?"}
{"original": "it remains problematic. we have had people tell us for a long time that the hermit kingdom is going to implode and why are we worried about it. and i guess in a glib way, we should ask ourselves, how's that working out for us? the north continues to pose a threat, not only in a conventional way, but now in a more growing nuclear way. and they're determined to use those advantages to try to build a political situation with south korea and the rest of the world that would advantage them in their day-to-day operations."}
{"original": "we have gone from yelling about little rocket man to hugs at the demilitarized zone. how do you feel about president trump's overtures to kim jong-un? have they been productive? do you agree with them? and do you think the north koreans will ever give up their nuclear weapons?"}
{"original": "so, sandy, i think that we want to talk to them. we don't want to fight them. we're sort of playing poker with someone else's chips. it would be the south korean people that would really pay if we were to begin a conflict on that peninsula. and so i would applaud any president -- i don't want to zero in on what's going on now -- but any president that began a real conversation."}
{"original": "i think we have to understand that this is a nation and a set of leadership that is just going to be really hard to deal with. and they really haven't lived up to a lot of their promises in the past, so i think we all need to have a sober judgment of what we might accomplish."}
{"original": "but i would say it's better to try than not to try. and so i applaud any president that tries it. as far as giving up their nuclear weapons, i don't think so. the agreed framework in the early '90s under the clinton years, we gave them tons of money, tons of fuel, tons of food, and we got, really, nothing in return for it. unless we get persistent, pervasive inspection that allows us to completely understand what north korea is actually doing, we're going to be at risk in any agreement i think we make with them."}
{"original": "well, and it also seems that we have to be careful about mirror imaging on north korea. you know, kim jong-un has to worry about both external threats, but also internal threats to the—"}
{"original": "--regime. our relationship with south korea has, like many of our allies, become a little more transactional lately. we're starting to ask the south koreans to pay a little bit more for our presence there. have you got any thoughts for us on u.s. basing of forces in south korea?"}
{"original": "so it's not going to surprise you, having served almost half of my military career oversees, that i am a proponent for our military being engaged overseas. i think that that ounce of provision is worth a whole lot more than the cure if we let the peninsula go. the investment that we make by having a fairly modest force forward to keep peace on the peninsula is absolutely worth it. and you're going to hear this again as we talk about forces in other places around the world."}
{"original": "now this is going to be a tough fight, if it ever actually happens, a conventional fight on a peninsula. we have the tyranny of distance. yes, we have sort of 'fight tonight' ethos on the peninsula. but how do you see this unfolding? are we going to be able to stop the north korean hoards with seoul right on the border of—"}
{"original": "so, it's a great question. and really, some of those dynamics haven't changed for 20-plus years. the fact that north korea can range the capital in that incredibly dense population, in the general seoul area, can range it with dumb conventional firepower from the back side of the kaesong heights, at any moment's notice, it's a tough problem."}
{"original": "and how do you shut that down as a force in the south? this will be a fight that the world hasn't seen in a long time. and the loss of life, both civilian and conventional military on the ground, we are not ready for that, i think, in this world."}
{"original": "yes, it's going to be tough to get our forces there in time to make a difference. it's—"}
{"original": "--going to be something that nobody can really accurately predict."}
{"original": "phil, we were just talking about korea and kim jong-un and nuclear weapons. what do you think is the greatest impediment to him actually giving up those weapons?"}
{"original": "so, sandy, i think it doesn't take a lot of looking into history to see what has happened to every despotic leader that has given up or had his nuclear weapons taken from them, to realize that the leaders in the north see this as their guarantee."}
{"original": "and i think one of the toughest things in my tour as the saceur, is what happened in ukraine. here, ukraine in the early '90s had an agreement with four signatory nations, that if they gave up their nuclear weapons that their territorial integrity and sovereignty would be guaranteed by those nations. and so they gave up their nuclear weapons."}
{"original": "one of the signatories invaded them. and two of the other signatories did nothing about it."}
{"original": "well, and that's to say nothing of libya and, of course, iraq. phil, speaking of asia, many view china as our most capable potential adversary. they've been closing previously existing gaps in conventional capability and opening new ones in asymmetrical capability."}
{"original": "this is making life very difficult for the pacific command commander, as you might imagine. do you think we can keep pace with the chinese through only improvements in our capability? and if so, where do you see that heading? what kind of capabilities do we need in order to keep an advantage out there?"}
{"original": "actually, i don't think that's the right way to go. i've heard you talk about this. and i happen to agree with some of the thoughts you have about, we get locked into certain things. the ends aren't changing, so we have ways and means. we typically focus on those means because they are what we do as an industrial nation here in america."}
{"original": "and i think that changing the ways may be the end tack we have to take. the bottom line is, china is very good at setting goals and sticking to those goals, investing. and they're really pushing ahead in some of these critical technologies that are going to challenge us."}
{"original": "and if all we are going to do is just buy more of the same to try to address it, i think we're going to be on the losing end of that cost curve. just like we applied that to russia in its past, i think china's putting us on the wrong side of that cost curve now."}
{"original": "so you, i think, have a clear feel that just buying more stuff is not going to do the trick. there's sort of an intermediate step, maybe, between having to rethink the whole strategic challenge out there. and that is better stuff. is there anything out there, any kind of breakthrough that could give us an advantage?"}
{"original": "yes, let me back up just a tiny bit. so we do have to fix readiness. the force needs to fix readiness. and some of that fixing readiness is investing in some of those capabilities that we need. so, i don't want to say we don't need to buy anything and we need to flip this, because we do."}
{"original": "we've got to recapitalize some fleets that have been rode hard and put up wet in all of our services. but in the meantime, i think that if all our imagination is captured in doing more of the same, we will lose in this proposition against china."}
{"original": "we have to think about changing the cost curve in more than money, imposing on them issues and problems that they have to deal with like they're imposing on us. and so i do believe that we need to be thinking about new technologies of defense. we need to be thinking about the kind of technology that allows us to strike with precision at range and not cost us an arm and a leg to do it."}
{"original": "so phil, let's drill in a little bit more, beyond now the capacity piece and the technical capability piece."}
{"original": "if we actually bump up against the wall here and we have to think of a whole new strategic concept for china, do you have a sense for what that might look like? is it about changing our ends and lowering our ambition in the western pacific? or it's some different thing we can do that would present china with the dilemmas we've talked about?"}
{"original": "so, i don't know that it's all that easy to just change our ends. our world and our societies expect certain things-- free passageway in the commons, free trade, etcetera, etcetera. and so i'm not sure that we are capable as a nation of really drastically changing the ends."}
{"original": "and as i said before, if all we're going to do is look at means, i think that we are going to be in-- on the back side of a real problem here. so, i do believe we have to look at different ways. and i think that they are at risk in-- if we do-- if we hold them at risk inside their mainland."}
{"original": "right now we are not thinking about attacking the mainland, because this is a nuclear power. and frankly, they have done a pretty good job at holding us at bay and putting us at risk. but if we make them understand, through our investments and our new types of thinking about how to address this problem, that they are at risk in their homeland, i think it will change the calculus a bit."}
{"original": "so let's turn to your most recent work, where you served last in the military. and you're we'll known for your views on vladimir putin and russia. you've been very outspoken on that. what do you think is motivating the russian leader? and what do you see as the trajectory of our relationship with russia, phil?"}
{"original": "so, none of this will be terribly now because my views haven't changed. but let's just recoup. so, first of all, i think mr. putin is a man who has grown up a proud russian. he grew up in the kgb. he did not like the way the cold war ended. he felt like that russia was not at the table when the post-cold war order was sort of set."}
{"original": "and he felt like russia was snubbed and should've been at the table. and he's determined to get russia back at the table on determining the path of europe as well as other parts of the world, as we see now in syria and in north africa. and frankly, it's a bit tough to say."}
{"original": "but remember, this is a kleptocrat. you know, mr. putin has never been paid officially more than an army or air force lieutenant colonel. he's been a public servant all his life. and yet he's one of the richest men in the world. this is a kleptocrat who has been extracting wealth from that nation and he doesn't want to lose that wealth stream. so i think you've got on one side, a proud russian that believes russia was snubbed and should be a major power. and on the other side, there's a man that really likes the stream of money that comes from his position."}
{"original": "phil, to continue our discussion, i asked you about the trajectory of our relationship with russia. where do you see that heading?"}
{"original": "it's not good. if i was to imagine being in the room, having a cognac with mr. putin at this point, i would think he would be a very happy man. what he wants when he looks to his west is an e.u. that is fractured and disorganized, a nato that is fractured and disorganized."}
{"original": "he wants to deal with individual nations, individually, on individual security and business matters. and i think that right now he's succeeding. let's just look at the state of conversation in nato. let's look at the state of conversation in brexit and e.u., etcetera, etcetera. and so i think that right now what we see from mr. putin is unlikely to change, because in his mind, i believe, he sees his path as working."}
{"original": "well, and that's to say nothing of his interference in our elections. and it seems to me that he's not necessarily favoring a single candidate. he just wants to see chaos his way."}
{"original": "exactly. and i think that's a point that this particular city we're sitting in, seems to gloss over. everybody wants to make this an election issue on one side or the other. and i couldn't agree with you more. what he wants is chaos. he wants to drag western democracy down to the level of russian democracy. and, of course, in some ways, he's having some success there."}
{"original": "yes, which helps him set the expectations of his own people. now phil, you had a russian counterpart, a very interesting guy, valery gerasimov, who's the chief of the general staff of the russian armed forces. he's very active, to say the least, and has very strongly-held views on the competition between russia and nato. can you tell us a bit about your relationship with him and how you perceive his views?"}
{"original": "let me just first start with, this is an intelligent man, a thinking man. and i believe he does a lot of his own writing-- maybe not the final products, but you can see what he thinks reflected in his speeches and his writing. so this is a learning, adaptive leader. and i think we need to respect him for that."}
{"original": "i started off trying to build a relationship with him. and he and i began meeting on a series of video teleconferences and so forth. but sadly, i won't argue with why, but sadly when the russians invaded crimea and then when they went in and invaded donbass and set up the radicals there, the saceur, first, was told, no longer to speak to mr. gerasimov. and then the u.s. european command commander was also told to stop conversations with mr. gerasimov."}
{"original": "and i'd draw a contrast there, not to interrupt, that when russia invaded georgia, the only contact between our two governments was between the chief of the general staff, makarov, and admiral mike mullen."}
{"original": "i must tell you that --it's-- you're right, and that was right, in my opinion. i believe when conflict is happening, you step up your conversation. you don't shut it off. and i had offered my opinion about what we should do, but i was given direction from my leadership. and i followed that direction."}
{"original": "well, and look what's happened. so, now looking at the big picture, end of the cold war, the declaration of a peace dividend, do you think we went too far in drawing down from europe? how do you feel about the ability now of the alliance to respond to russian aggression? and let's start with how it might actually start and how you see it playing out and our ability to carry the day?"}
{"original": "so, i do believe we overcorrected. all of us, all the nations of nato and our partner nations as well, we all took big peace dividends. and we in the u.s. removed so much capability from europe. we don't have time to describe how big we were when captain phil breedlove was in 2nd brigade 3rd infantry division, standing with the army as a tacp or an alo in the early '80s."}
{"original": "that's an air liaison officer for—"}
{"original": "yes, so a forward air controller, army associated. and so i think we have overreacted. and now we are having to sort of rethink about how we can do that. but again, not only did we withdraw our troops from europe, but we downsized all of our militaries."}
{"original": "and probably more damaging-- you could speak better to the navy-- but probably more damaging, we have put such a strain on the military that we have, that our readiness is well below where it was when we faced the soviet union across the border. so i do believe that we have correction that needs to be made."}
{"original": "so let's drill a little bit more deeply into that. what do you see as the advantages, operational military advantages that russia has if they decide to get a little feisty vis-à-vis the nato alliance?"}
{"original": "so the nato alliance is on their backdoor. and it's a whole other subject to talk about the encroachment. but some of the nations that used to be warsaw pact are now nato alliance members. and so if you remember jomini, that great thinker, he talked about interior lines."}
{"original": "russia has the ability to quickly move and mass their forces, where nato has to respond to the area. and i know you understand this better than most because of your naval background, but in the cold war we almost took-- we fought to maintain the lines of contact with the east coast of america and europe."}
{"original": "during the post-cold war days, we have all but stopped worrying about fighting our way across the atlantic. in fact, we assume safe passage across the atlantic. and that's not the case anymore. and so russia enjoys that ability to rapidly bring forces together. and if you've ever looked at moscow and the spider network of roads and railroads from there, you understand how quickly they can do this. and then you have to look at what nato has to do to respond. it's a physics problem."}
{"original": "and that's not to mention a singularity of command and control—"}
{"original": "--twenty-eight nations having to decide versus one, and some of the advantages they have in artillery and tactical air defenses and the like. so do you see the need, as we talked about with china, for a new way? or is it just sort of, get the stuff back over there so that we can be more prepared?"}
{"original": "the answer is yes. it's a little bit of all of that. so i think that we, again, have to address our readiness. we and our -- primarily or as well our allies -- need to bring forces to capability and readiness. and yes, we need to look a little bit about, do we have the appropriate forces over there?"}
{"original": "frankly, i don't believe we'll ever permanently move another force to europe. but we need to settle ourselves in a way with prepositioning and other tactics, to be able to rapidly reinforce. and then, as you know, we're-- with the 2nd fleet, we're starting to now rethink how we defend our sea lines of contact with america. but as we talked about with china, we've got to think about different ways. it just can't be means anymore. we've got to change the paradigm a little bit in europe."}
{"original": "as one of the most important organizations that was put into place in the wake of world war ii, with the intent of preventing such large wars from ever happening again, was nato. and our relationship with nato has always been up and down. where do you see it now? how do you see president trump's influence on—"}
{"original": "--that relationship? how do you feel about your old buddies back in europe?"}
{"original": "so, it's an interesting story. and as people sort of pick at me about this, i remind them that we were thrown out of a nato country once, literally thrown out. and so yes, we've had some peaks and valleys in our relationship with nato. i would tell you that i have watched every one of the last three presidents try to get nato to invest more in itself. and while you and i may not agree with the tactics, techniques and procedures used, we actually now have nato allies reinvesting in themselves. it's been a bit of a rocky road. and we'll just leave it at that."}
{"original": "so it may be that we don't necessarily like the tone, but the result seems to be maybe in a direction we want."}
{"original": "phil, much has been made of the fact that the strategic arms reduction treaty, or start, expires in 2021. the u.s. withdrew from the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty in august 2019 because russia failed to return to full and verified compliance through the destruction of its non-compliant missile system. was pulling out of that treaty the right thing to do?"}
{"original": "so this is now just my opinion. you got it right. we were the only one in the treaty. it's kind of hard to have a treaty with yourself. russia had abrogated the treaty. so the question is, how do you move forward? how do you try to re-engage russia?"}
{"original": "the choice was to back out of the inf. if it had been me making that decision, i think i'd have done it differently. i would've tried to build from an existing treaty. i just think it's easier to do that than to renegotiate entirely a new treaty."}
{"original": "but let me throw one more curve ball into this calculus. and that is that we really need to have a treaty with more than just russia. and it would be incredibly hard, but to get china into a treaty as well, because they are going to be an issue. and frankly, right now, i think russia has more issues with china's capabilities than with ours, because we really don't have any in europe right now."}
{"original": "it could be one of the reasons why they violated the treaty, right, because they're more worried—"}
{"original": "we have to be intellectually honest."}
{"original": "how do you feel about the russian assertion that the missile defense system that's in romania, which is a aegis system that not only can carry the sm-3 missile that's a ballistic missile defense thing, but could also theoretically carry the tomahawk missile and therefore we were also in violation of the inf treaty. what's your take on that?"}
{"original": "i think that's a convenient excuse for the russian federation to offer. i think it's hogwash."}
{"original": "so, the russians have been developing some pretty exotic new strategic weapons, right? nuclear cruise missiles, hypersonic weapons and even big transoceanic nuclear torpedoes, as we saw the strategic glance over vladimir putin's soldier looking-- or shoulder looking at a power point slide. but they've also talked about extending the start treaty. that almost seems to be at odds with each other. what do you see the trajectory of strategic arms control agreements with russia?"}
{"original": "i will offer you my hope. i think we need to stay in the start. i think we need to grow from that to a new round of understandings. i think we need to wrap china into these conversations and try to bring that dynamic in. and i think we need to back in now and get a new inf-like treaty, even if it's only with russia, but it would hopefully be with china. and i think that we want to do everything we can to slow this race to expanding the nuclear countries of the world."}
{"original": "so, one of the things that's always been a thorn in russia's side in terms of arms control agreements, is ballistic missile defense. they firmly believe that our development-- or at least they say they believe that our development of ballistic missile defense was designed to negate their ability to respond to an attack, and therefore we would-- it would create strategic instability. phil, do you think that they actually believe this? or do you think they're using it as a convenient foil to try to just get us to get rid of ballistic missile defense?"}
{"original": "i think it's the latter. we all know that russia has the ability to overwhelm our defenses. the only thing that a small defense that we have, if it's credible-- and i think ours is-- and gets more credible every day, the only thing that does is sort of take away the coercive value of small attacks to be-- to force us to think differently as we talk and negotiate with russia."}
{"original": "but we can't build enough missiles to stop their attack. and frankly, i think they're more worried about our decapitation of their ability to launch an attack than they are about our missile defense. i think it's, again, a sort of convenient tool to try to shape us at the negotiating table."}
{"original": "now phil, the realization that i came to in the last couple years i was on active-duty, that our space command and control capability was a bit weak, was a very unforgettable moment for me. that's getting a lot better. the department has tried to reorganize itself for space. as a career air force officer, can you give me a sense for what your thoughts are on the new space force? getting beyond the grief, they've taken over logos and uniforms—"}
{"original": "--and the like. do you think that the department's headed down a wise path here?"}
{"original": "i think we're on a path. and we're going to make it as wise as we can. i love the way that our current chief of staff sort of said it a few years ago. he said, we are currently an air and space force. in 40 years, we're going to be a space and air force."}
{"original": "we in this service, absolutely accept and acknowledge that that transition's going to happen. the real key here then is, how fast does that happen? it matters not now. the decision was to move out. and so i think you're going to see everybody that wears a blue uniform embrace that and move out."}
{"original": "and i'm actually happy about that. what i think we need to understand is, that since we have done this so abruptly and so suddenly, we've got some problems to take care of. and one of them starts with people, or in the commercial world the h.r. business, of the air force."}
{"original": "how do we manage these people that were formerly air force and dutifully became missileers because we told them they had to be missileers to get promoted. and now we've got this mixture of people that aren't purely space, some of them missileers. how do we not damage those highly-valued members of our services as we do this really abruptly into the future?"}
{"original": "and so i embrace and am proud for the fact that we're going to create a space force. i don't want to leave dead and broken bodies along the way as we do that. and so we need to do it quickly. i believe in star wars. there are going to be x-wing fighters. i hope my grandchildren are flying them sometime in the future."}
{"original": "that sounds like fun. maybe we were born too early."}
{"original": "so phil, you-- i have just a little bit of time left. i've known you a long, long time."}
{"original": "you've had a fantastic career. you're one of the most highly regarded officers, let alone air force officers, that i know. can you give me a sense for what the most valuable or the most rewarding part of your career was, whether it's nato or your time in a blue uniform? what was the best part for you?"}
{"original": "so, it changed, sandy. i think you and i both agree, when we were ensigns and lieutenants and captains and majors and commanders, all i wanted to do is fly that f-16. i wanted to be the most effective, efficient killing machine out there. i wanted to be right for my nation."}
{"original": "and then along the way, i was asked to command. i commanded at a very small level in the army. i commanded a squadron, a group, three fighter wings, a numbered air force, a majcom and an alliance. and i will tell you that the most rewarding part of my career was working with the soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines that i got to command along the way. it is absolutely incredibly -- it is our number one resource -- are those soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. and i would just tell you that even though i loved flying the f-16, being able to lead troops was a big deal to me."}
{"original": "well, and that's a great way to end. you have been listening to intelligence matters, hosted by michael morell. i'm your guest host, sandy winnefeld. and our guest has been general phil breedlove, former nato supreme allied commander of europe. phil, thanks so much for spending time with our listeners today. it's been a great discussion."}

{"original": "portman, who cited drug overdoses as the killer of over 120 americans daily, assured viewers that the legislation was moving."}

{"original": "that's what this is all about - each of us doing our part to make sure all our young people can compete in a high-tech, global economy, the president said. they're the ones who will make sure america keeps growing, keeps innovating, and keeps leading the world in the years ahead."}
{"original": "the coronavirus pandemic has roiled the american economy, with over 16 million workers filing unemployment claims in the past three weeks. many employees who have not been fired or furloughed are working on the frontlines of the crisis, including health care workers and others providing essential services — like staffing grocery stores or driving trucks."}
{"original": "millions of non-essential employees are fortunate enough to be able to work from home. these remote workers include the 535 americans representing their constituents in congress. most senators and representatives have returned to their districts, while their staff in washington also work remotely."}
{"original": "important topics normally hashed out in person are now being covered over phone calls or meetings over the video conference platform zoom. congressman ro khanna, a democrat from california, said in an interview with cbs news that he is connecting with constituents through instagram and facebook."}
{"original": "it's been interesting to see what are the types of things you can do remotely and what are the kinds of things that require human contact, said khanna. connecting with people is a major part of a politician's job, khanna said, but you can't really do empathy remotely."}
{"original": "but khanna feels that in some ways, he's been more informed during this tele-work period than when he's working in washington, since he is participating in regular conference calls with other democratic caucus members."}
{"original": "according to an april 6 press release from house democratic caucus chairman hakeem jeffries, over 99% of house democrats participated in caucus telephone conference meetings in the final weeks of march."}
{"original": "the full democratic caucus has held 14 conference call meetings since march 16, with 184 out of 240 democratic members participating in each of the calls. according to jeffries' office, 235 caucus members participated in at least one caucus call since march 16, and 180 participated in at least ten calls."}
{"original": "but while khanna noted that zoom is being used for virtual meetings, senators have been cautioned against it. the senate sergeant at arms sent a memo to senators urging them not to use zoom, according to reporting by the financial times, because of concerns about security and privacy."}

{"original": "senator ted cruz, a republican from texas, is taking advantage of his time working from home to connect with constituents remotely. this week, cruz conducted a tele-tour of communities responding to the coronavirus pandemic using phone calls and video conferences. the tours included calls with organizations like the texas hospital association, the texas trucking association, the houston hispanic chamber of commerce, and other regional economic development councils."}
{"original": "in an interview with cbs news, cruz said that he typically would go to places to meet with constituents in the wake of a natural disaster like hurricane harvey, but working remotely meant moving those interactions online or to the telephone."}
{"original": "the responsibility is the same, but given the social distancing guidelines, it is neither feasible nor advisable to be everywhere in person, cruz said. so i'm doing the same thing, but virtually."}
{"original": "cruz said he normally dedicates the morning to media interviews and spends afternoons speaking to his staff about policy and connecting with constituents. like many other american families impacted by stay-at-home orders, cruz, his wife and his two daughters are all inside the house during the work day."}
{"original": "a silver lining for cruz has been eating lunch and dinner with his family, a rarity for a senator, as well as taking hour-long walks and playing games with his daughters after dinner. working from home does occasionally mean interruptions while he has virtual conversations, cruz said. during tv interviews and calls, sometimes a dog barks in the background or wayward children try to sneak into the background of his makeshift home set."}
{"original": "despite the advantage of being able to log on while wearing sweatpants instead of suits, working remotely has been stressful for some congressional staffers, who are often already expected to work long hours on weekdays and weekends. a communications staffer for a house democrat told cbs news that she's working even more than usual, particularly because her boss is inundated by media requests about the coronavirus."}
{"original": "i don't have a clear separation of 'this is work' and 'this is home.' everything has been both work and home, the staffer said."}

{"original": "the law couldn't be more clear - employers have no business interfering in women's healthcare decisions, california attorney general xavier becerra said in a statement sunday. today's court ruling stops another attempt by the trump administration to trample on women's access to basic reproductive care. it's 2019, yet the trump administration is still trying to roll back women's rights. our coalition will continue to fight to ensure women have access to the reproductive healthcare they are guaranteed under the law."}

{"original": "florida insurance commissioner kevin mccarty cbs news"}
{"original": "insurance companies have long maintained that it is up to policyholders' beneficiaries to contact the insurance company and to file a claim in order to collect whatever death benefit may be due them. but if beneficiaries are unaware of the policy, they don't know to file a claim - something that happens with surprising frequency, says kevin mccarty, the insurance commissioner of florida who led the task force investigating the industry. mccarty says the insurance companies don't reach out to the beneficiaries -- even when the insurers know of the policyholder's death. what we found is that companies have actual knowledge in their files that people have died, yet they have neglected to initiate an investigation and pay the claim, he tells stahl."}
{"original": "one way insurers learned of someone's death was through the use of the social security administration's death master file. mccarty says that many insurance companies used the death master file to their advantage, cutting off annuity, or retirement, benefits to policyholders when they died-- but not using it to notify beneficiaries that they're owed a death benefit."}
{"original": "mccarty is bothered by that practice. i'm here to say that you have a responsibility to investigate a claim if you know someone has died, he says."}
{"original": "what's even worse, says mccarty, is a practice he discovered involving whole life policies in which many insurers continued to make premium payments to themselves using their dead customers' money. what happened, mccarty says, is that policyholders built up a cash value in their policies over time, a nest egg they could access while alive. but after they passed away, many of the insurance companies drained down that accrued cash value to pay themselves premiums. it's a tactic originally designed to keep a policy in force if the holder has lost the financial ability to pay premiums. but in this case, mccarty says it's adding insult to injury. oh, by the way. if you stick that policy in a shoe box and stick it in your closet, not only are we not going to look for you, but we're going to take all the cash value in it... give it back to the company. and leave your beneficiary with nothing. here, sign here."}

{"original": "the cable called on pompeo to support any lawful effort by vice president mike pence and other cabinet members to protect the country including through the possible implementation of the procedures provided for in article 4 of the 25th amendment, if appropriate. the amendment allows for the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to declare a president unfit for office, and the vice president then becomes acting president."}
{"original": "the cables were an extraordinary protest against a sitting u.s. president by american diplomats, who have long complained that the trump administration has ignored and diminished their role and expertise. the dissent channel is normally used to oppose specific foreign policy decisions. the two most recent cables appear to be unprecedented in their scope and characterization of the president as a danger to the country."}
{"original": "the cables also reflect anger at the response to the riot by secretary of state mike pompeo, a loyal trump ally."}
{"original": "pompeo has condemned the violence at the capitol but has pointedly not addressed the role mr. trump played in encouraging his supporters who stormed the building. nor has pompeo addressed the aftermath or acknowledged that american diplomats overseas may now face new difficulty in promoting democracy."}
{"original": "mr. trump himself has railed about what he sees as disloyalty at the state department. he once referred to it publicly — and in front of pompeo and reporters — as the deep state department, a reference to what mr. trump and his supporters believe is a cabal of entrenched bureaucrats intent on subverting his policies."}
{"original": "it was not immediately clear how many diplomats signed the cables, both of which were viewed by the associated press."}
{"original": "the state department did not immediately respond to a request for comment."}
{"original": "it is essential that the department of state explicitly denounce president trump's role in this violent attack on the u.s. government, said the first of the two cables, which added that the president's own comments should not be used as he is not a credible voice on this matter."}
{"original": "just as we routinely denounce foreign leaders who use violence and intimidation to interfere in peaceful democratic processes and override the will of their voters, the department's public statements about this episode should also mention president trump by name. it is critical that we communicate to the world that in our system, no one -- not even the president -- is above the law or immune from public criticism."}
{"original": "this would be a first step towards repairing the damage to our international credibility, it said. it would allow the beacon of democracy to shine on despite this dark episode. it would also send a strong message to our friends and adversaries that the department of state applies an ethos of integrity and objective standards when it condemns assaults on democracy at home or abroad."}
{"original": "it also said pompeo should support any effort by vice president mike pence and other cabinet members to invoke the 25th amendment to remove mr. trump from office."}
{"original": "pressure is building on pence and the cabinet to strip the president of his office, though it's unclear whether such a move would have support from a majority of the cabinet. house democrats plan to request unanimous consent on a resolution from democratic congressman jamie raskin of maryland that calls on pence to invoke the 25th amendment and remove mr. trump from office. if pence declines to act, house speaker nancy pelosi will bring articles of impeachment to the floor."}
{"original": "raskin's resolution calls for pence to use his powers under the 25th amendment to convene the cabinet to declare that mr. trump is unable to successfully discharge the duties of his office and to transmit to the speaker of the house and president pro tempore of the senate that pence will serve as the acting president."}
{"original": "a new spacex rocket blasting off on its long-awaited maiden flight this tuesday -- the falcon heavy -- promises to put on a spectacular show as the world's most powerful booster climbs away from the kennedy space center's historic pad 39a atop nearly 5 million pounds of thrust from 27 engines, nine in each of three core stages."}
{"original": "the heavy will be the most powerful rocket launched anywhere in the world since nasa's now-retired space shuttle, the soviet union's unsuccessful n1 moon rocket, its short-lived energia booster and the gargantuan saturn 5 that launched nasa's apollo moon missions with a staggering 7.5 million pounds of liftoff thrust."}
{"original": "nasa is currently building an even more powerful rocket known as the space launch system, or sls, that will generate 8.8 million pounds of thrust in its initial configuration and up to 11.9 million pounds in a follow-on cargo variant."}
{"original": "the spacex falcon heavy atop pad 39a at the kennedy space center last month for pre-flight tests. the rocket is being readied for its maiden flight tuesday. spacex"}
{"original": "but the sls is not expected to fly until late 2019 or later, and the falcon heavy, assuming it succeeds, will easily hold the title of world's most powerful operational booster in the near term."}
{"original": "i think this could be an extremely significant launch, first of all because it's happening in 2018, not whenever sls is going to launch. it is going to be, if it succeeds, the most powerful rocket in the world, and that enables lots of different things, said john logsdon, a noted space historian and space policy analyst."}
{"original": "it poses a competitive challenge to the nasa way of doing business. just as spacex has posed a challenge to (competitor) united launch alliance that seems to be succeeding, it could well pose a challenge to nasa's launch strategy, logsdon said."}
{"original": "adding to the drama of the heavy's first flight is its payload: a 2,760-pound tesla roadster provided by spacex and tesla founder elon musk, which will be released onto a trajectory carrying it beyond low-earth orbit and into deep space. david bowie's space oddity apparently will be playing on the stereo -- or at least in spacex mission control in hawthorne, california."}
{"original": "payload will be my midnight cherry tesla roadster playing 'space oddity,' musk tweeted late last year. destination is mars orbit. will be in deep space for a billion years or so if it doesn't blow up on ascent."}
{"original": "spacex founder elon musk shared a photo of his cherry red tesla roadster, complete with a spacesiited mannequin known as starman strapped in the driver's seat, before the car was encapsulated in the nose cone of a falcon heavy rocket awaiting its maiden launch. spacex"}
{"original": "rockets typically carry dummy payloads, or mass simulators, when making their first flights. while blasting a $250,000 tesla into space might seem extravagant, building a simulator almost certainly would have cost as much or more. and besides, launching a sports car into space is much more in keeping with musk's playful streak."}
{"original": "responding to a question from a twitter follower, musk said:"}
{"original": "i love the thought of a car drifting apparently endlessly through space and perhaps being discovered by an alien race millions of years in the future — elon musk (@elonmusk) december 2, 2017"}
{"original": "with forecasters predicting an 80 percent chance of good weather, liftoff is targeted for 1:30 p.m. est (gmt-5) tuesday. the test flight has generated widespread interest in the space community and beyond, but musk has gone out of his way to downplay expectations."}
{"original": "this is one of those things that's really difficult to test on the ground, musk said last year. there's a lot of risk associated with the falcon heavy, a real good chance that that vehicle does not make it to orbit. want to make sure i set expectations accordingly. i hope it makes it far enough away from the pad that it does not cause pad damage, i would consider even that a win, to be honest. and uh, yeah. major pucker factor, it really is."}
{"original": "spacex has shaken up the commercial rocket industry, launching 48 falcon 9 rockets since the booster's debut in 2010 -- 18 last year alone -- and perfecting techniques for recovering the booster's first stage so it can be refurbished and re-launched, part of musk's long-range plan to lower costs through rapid reusability."}

{"original": "the company has suffered one in-flight failure and one on-the-pad explosion, but it has put together an impressive list of accomplishments for a startup without decades of experience. it has a $10 billion backlog of payloads awaiting launch holds, more than $4 billion in nasa contracts to deliver supplies to the international space station and, eventually, astronauts starting late this year or early next."}
{"original": "lee solid, a retired rocket engineer who helped build the engines that powered the saturn 5 and the space shuttle, visited spacex's processing hangar at the base of pad 39a last week with former shuttle commander eileen collins."}
{"original": "i was impressed with the whole vehicle and the people working it, he said in an interview sunday. if i had any question or negative thoughts about what elon's doing, they went away. it was a very professional operation out there."}
{"original": "the heavy is made up of three side-by-side falcon 9 core stages, each equipped with nine spacex merlin engines burning rp-1 kerosene fuel and liquid oxygen. an upper stage atop the central core is equipped with a single merlin engine generating 210,000 pounds of push. for its maiden flight, the tesla roadster will be mounted in a nose-cone fairing atop the second stage."}
{"original": "at liftoff, with all 27 core stage engines firing in concert at about 92 percent of full power, the heavy will generate 4.7 million pounds of thrust. that's more than twice the liftoff power of a united launch alliance delta 4 heavy and more than one-and-a-half times the power of a european ariane 5."}
{"original": "flying for the first time, it's difficult to predict exactly how the falcon heavy will perform. as it consumes propellant, loses weight and accelerates, hard-to-model aerodynamic stresses will build up, producing extreme loads on the structure and localized heating."}
{"original": "and then there's the issue of controlling ignition, startup and steady operation of 27 engines firing in close proximity. the vibration environment with 27 clustered engines is extremely difficult to model, one veteran engineer said, subjecting the rocket to significant stresses. the soviet union built the huge n1 moon rocket with 30 first stage engines, but the booster failed all four times it was launched."}
{"original": "the heavy's engines were test fired at the pad on jan. 24 and spacex said later there were no problems. but musk cautioned last year there's a lot that could go wrong when 27 engines are firing at once, adding, i encourage people to come down to the cape and see the first falcon heavy mission. it's guaranteed to be exciting."}
{"original": "the two outside core stages will separate and fly back to landings at the cape canaveral air force station while the central core stage will attempt a landing on an off-shore droneship. spacex"}
{"original": "and not just for the launch. after engine shutdown, the two previously flown outside core stages will separate, flip around and fly back to the cape canaveral air force station for side-by-side rocket-powered descents to touchdown at spacex's landing zone 1. the central core stage will attempt to land on an off-shore droneship."}
{"original": "the recovery of three stages will push spacex's record to 24 successful landings in 27 attempts while providing area tourists and residents with a dramatic show highlighted by dueling sonic booms."}
{"original": "on spacex's web site, the company claims the heavy can send a payload weighing up to 140,660 pounds to low-earth orbit and 37,000 pounds to mars. it can send a probe to distant pluto weighing up to 7,720 pounds, about seven times the mass of nasa's new horizons pluto flyby mission, which was launched by the most powerful version of united launch alliance's atlas 5 rocket."}
{"original": "nasa's space shuttle generated about 6.8 million pounds of thrust from three hydrogen-fueled main engines and two huge solid-fuel boosters. the agency's saturn 5 moon rocket still holds the record as the most powerful operational rocket ever built, using five huge f1 first stage engines to generate 7.5 million pounds of thrust."}
{"original": "the saturn 5, which flew 13 times, had an earth-escape payload capacity of more than 100,000 pounds, about three times the capability of the falcon heavy. but at an advertised price of $90 million, the heavy is much less expensive and can still boost sizable payloads beyond low-earth orbit."}
{"original": "but spacex's long-range plans for the rocket are somewhat foggy. musk said last year the heavy would be used to launch two paying customers on a looping flight around the moon, but no details have been announced. as of this writing, only three missions are believed to be booked on the heavy."}
{"original": "complicating the outlook, spacex is designing a much more powerful bfr rocket (a euphemism for big [expletive] rocket) that would dwarf the heavy in payload capability. it is the rocket musk plans to use for eventual flights to mars."}
{"original": "i don't understand what they're doing, logsdon said. elon's out talking about they're not going to pursue the falcon line of rockets, he's going to put all his efforts into the bfr. so, what is the future of heavy?"}
{"original": "a knowledgeable rocket engineer who asked not to be named said the heavy is too powerful for routine use launching earth-orbiting satellites but not powerful enough to serve as a stand-alone lunar exploration rocket. he said it's generally agreed that meaningful missions to the moon or beyond will require rockets capable of boosting 130-metric-ton payloads into earth orbit."}
{"original": "some observers have speculated that the heavy might be intended as a shot across nasa's bow, so to speak, while the agency is developing the more expensive, but more capable, space launch system rocket. they suspect musk hopes to win government support to help fund the bfr at the expense of the sls."}
{"original": "logsdon said he believes it is good for the country to have two alternative heavy lift vehicles, at least for a little while, to see which one works better. but he also believes the sls enjoys enough solid congressional support to sustain it for some few more years, anyway."}

{"original": "but biden knocked sanders' support of medicare for all, noting that italy, which has seen its health care system overwhelmed by the coronavirus, has a single-payer system. the country implemented a nationwide lockdown to slow the spread of the illness."}
{"original": "the national crisis says, we're responding. it's all free. you don't have to pay for a thing, he said, referring to waiving medical costs during a public health crisis. that has nothing to do with whether or not you have an insurance policy. this is a crisis. we're at war with the virus. we're at war with the virus. it has nothing to do with co-pays or anything."}

{"original": "a week after super tuesday, the democratic field has winnowed to two main candidates, bernie sanders and joe biden, who will be fighting for delegates in six states on tuesday. the most closely-watched of these upcoming six states is michigan. with 125 delegates, it offers the biggest prize of the night. in 2016, sanders scored a major surprise upset against hillary clinton, by winning the majority of white voters, though clinton won handily among black voters and women. it is unclear whether sanders can replicate that victory this time around against biden. like clinton, biden has so far proven he has significant support among african americans, and he is also more popular among working-class white voters than clinton was."}
{"original": "a new poll from monmouth university released on monday showed biden with a commanding lead over sanders. fifty-one percent of likely democratic primary voters said they planned to support biden compared to 36% for sanders. biden led sanders among white voters (50% to 36%), voters of other races, (53% to 36%), voters age 50 and over (62% to 24%) and women (53% to 33%). sanders led biden among voters under 50 years old (49% to 38%) and men (49% to 39%). as of last week, according to a detroit news/wdiv poll, absentee voters who had cast their votes also heavily favored biden over sanders. pollster richard czuba estimated that biden can bank an almost 150,000-vote lead on sanders just through absentees. michigan voters care most about beating president trump (39.3%). health care was a distant second (18.5%), the survey found."}
{"original": "sanders is making a big push in michigan, having appeared at events in five different cities during the final weekend before tuesday's primary. he went to the county where he suffered his biggest defeat in 2016 by vote total, wayne county, home of detroit, and the county where he had his biggest win by vote total, kent county, where grand rapids is located. he also stopped by the liberal haven of ann arbor to try to boost support from university of michigan students at a rally with one of highest-profile supporters, representative alexandria ocasio-cortez. young voters were critical to his success in 2016 in michigan, and they're supporting him in large numbers so far in 2020. on the trail in michigan, he has been vocal about trade, continuing to hammer home the theme that biden has championed trade deals like nafta that many union voters view with suspicion. turnout among african american voters will be closely watched. though biden's ties to black voters have been proven in the contests so far, turnout in michigan, particularly in wayne county, and the level of enthusiasm for him could be a key factor on tuesday. suburban women are another key constituency for biden. sanders has promised to expand the electorate with new voters, but after a disappointing showing on super tuesday, he has admitted some disappointment that the level of turnout is not what he had hoped for or anticipated."}
{"original": "michigan holds what's known as an open closed primary — there is no party registration requirement in the state. any person can vote in either party's primary, but voters must ask for one party's ballot when they show up at the polls and identify in writing which political party they wish to vote with in the primary."}
{"original": "due to a 2018 ballot measure, voters can vote absentee without providing a reason. if a person voted absentee for a candidate who has since suspended his or her campaign, that voter can change their vote if they submitted requests in writing by march 7 or appear in person by monday, march 9. as of march 6, 24,109 people had done this, according to the michigan secretary of state's office. michigan's results could take some time to tabulate. as of march 5, about 90% more absentee ballots were sent compared to five days before the primary in 2016. nearly 600,000 absentee ballots had been cast as of that day. the secretary of state has pushed michigan's legislature to change state law to allow clerks to process or count absentee ballots before election day. sanders is expected to do well in idaho and north dakota, both states with largely white and rural populations, and both states he won in 2016 against clinton. he is also polling high in washington state, the last primary to close on tuesday. but like california, most of washington votes by mail, so the results may not be known for some time."}
{"original": "mississippi also votes on tuesday. it's a state that's expected to go big for biden, given that it has an even larger african american democratic electorate than south carolina. in 2016, 71% of the democratic primary voters in the state were african american. polls will be open between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. et. there is no early voting in the state. absentee ballots had to be received by march 9 to be counted. as of march 5, more than 15,000 voters had requested an absentee ballot for the march 10 election, according to the secretary of state's office. as of march 3, only 10,503 ballots have been received by the circuit clerks offices."}
{"original": "in 2016, clinton had the support from key political figures and labor unions in the state, but won the state by less than 1,500 votes. exit polling said clinton won women with 54% but sanders won men with 56%. sanders also won over voters under 44, while clinton had the backing of voters in the state 45 years old and up. clinton also won 67% of black voters, compared to sanders 32%, but sanders won white voters 54% to 45%. missouri is an open primary, so voters can ask for any party's ballot on election day. delegates will be allocated proportionally to the vote, and the threshold for delegates is 15%. missouri does not have early voting but allows absentee voting. the period to request ballots ended last week, and those ballots must either be received by the time polls close tuesday or submitted in person by monday. according to the office of the missouri secretary of state, 66,374 people had requested absentee ballots as of march 6, but a spokesperson for the office said it would not have a clear sense of how many had been returned until after the election."}
{"original": "in the idaho primary, candidates need to meet at 15% threshold at the congressional district level or statewide to be considered viable. independent and unaffiliated voters are allowed to participate in the democratic primary but cannot participate in the republican primary. in-person early voting in idaho ran from february 24 through march 6. in 2018, idaho changed from a party-run caucus to a state-run primary. idaho allows same-day registration for voters at polling locations. sanders prevailed against clinton in the state in 2016."}

{"original": "by the end of monday night, biden in michigan will have appeared with his trio of recent, high-profile endorsers: michigan governor gretchen whitmer, senator cory booker of new jersey and senator kamala harris of california. cbs news campaign reporter bo erickson says that with the latest endorsement, booker's backing on monday morning, a total of 10 former democratic presidential candidates have endorsed biden. sanders currently has two from former 2020 rivals: new york city mayor bill de blasio and marianne williamson. while biden hopes to focus in the rust belt on his health care policy differences with sanders, coronavirus has placed both the president and the democratic candidates under the spotlight. i think there's no confidence in the president, in anything he says or does, biden told msnbc on monday. i wish he'd be quiet, just let the experts speak and acknowledge whatever they suggest to him is what we should be doing."}
{"original": "sanders dodged a question today about taking personal precautions for his own health in the wake of coronavirus, says cbs news campaign reporter cara korte. well, i'm surrounded by medical personnel, sanders said referring to a panel of health care professional around him, assembled for a campaign event on coronavirus. thank you for asking. i am running for president of the united states and that requires a whole lot of work, he said. sanders' message on coronavirus is twofold: first, he said the trump administration's failure to embrace science is making the situation worse, including the appointment of vice president mike pence as coronavirus czar. during the panel discussion, sanders read a quote from the president that suggested people should work through symptoms. that might be the stupidest advice ever made by a president of the united states, said sanders. secondly, folding in medicare for all, sanders said a vaccine should be made free for everyone. he also said a single-payer system would lower the risks on contamination as people could to the doctor without fear of not affording care. earlier monday, at a rally in st. louis, sanders spoke the virus at length. and just look at the insanity dealing with this coronavirus, this very serious problem that we're dealing with in america, dealing with all over the world. think about the insanity of a system where today, somebody wakes up and maybe they think they have the symptoms of coronavirus. yet they cannot afford to go to a doctor."}

{"original": "less than a week after suspending his presidential campaign, billionaire and former new york mayor mike bloomberg is spending his own money to combat voter suppression. cbs news campaign reporter tim perry confirms bloomberg gave $2 million to collective future for african american voter registration. this is not the first time bloomberg has spent his own wealth for this particular issue. in december 2019, bloomberg announced a $5 million donation to stacey abrams' new voter protective initiative. this donation expands on bloomberg's commitment to register 500,000 voters from under-represented groups in key swing states heading into november's general election. voter suppression efforts across the country have been a barely disguised effort to keep black americans and other democratic-leaning voters from the polls. i've always believed we need to make it easier for all citizens to register and vote, not harder. bloomberg said in a statement. that's why i strongly support collective future in their effort to register 500,000 black americans. these new voters could determine the november election - and the future of the country. the stakes couldn't be higher. so while our campaign for the presidency is over, our work to get america back on track is still growing. a spokesperson for bloomberg told cbs news the money was transferred last week, but the proposal had been in the works before bloomberg exited the race after a poor super tuesday showing."}

{"original": "in his first television interview since suspending his presidential campaign, pete buttigieg told nbc news the decision to drop out of the race was his own after being asked if the establishment pressured him to end his presidential bid. look the kind of people who run for president of the united states are the kind of people who make their own decisions, buttigieg said. it was my decision. cbs news campaign reporter jack turman says buttigieg also announced that he will be guest hosting jimmy kimmel live on thursday. he said that one of the guests on thursday is actor sir patrick stewart."}
{"original": "there's a trade war raging between the top two democratic presidential contenders, report cbs news campaign reporters bo erickson and cara korte. since super tuesday left two main candidates standing last week, sanders has made it a point at campaign stops to list the areas where he and biden disagree. trade has taken center stage this week, as the two men fight for delegates in the industrial midwest. though neither candidate has released a detailed trade policy, a decisive primary win in michigan on tuesday or next week in ohio could signal how the democratic party will approach trade and the nation's economic agenda. across one of the nation's most iconic manufacturing states, sanders has been taking swipes at biden's positions on trade. he slammed then-senator biden's support of the 1993 north american free trade agreement (nafta), which eliminated most tariffs between the u.s., mexico and canada and the 2000 china trade bill, which reinstated permanent and normal trade relations (pntr) with china. sanders voted against both measures as a house member and continues to rail against the policies today, a point highlighted by a sanders ad called decimated that's up in every march 10 and march 17 primary state. if we are going to defeat trump in michigan, in pennsylvania, and in wisconsin, it will be very hard for a candidate who voted for these disastrous trade agreements, sanders told a detroit crowd on friday."}
{"original": "this playbook may seem familiar to democrats, since sanders waged a similar campaign against clinton in the 2016 democratic primaries in michigan. he skewered her at a democratic debate held in flint, michigan, two days before the primary. secretary clinton supported virtually every one of the disastrous trade agreements written by corporate america. nafta, supported by the secretary, cost us 800,000 jobs nationwide; tens of thousands of jobs in the midwest. permanent normal trade relations with china cost us millions of jobs, he said at the time."}
{"original": "the argument helped sanders eke out a win over clinton in the great lakes state, in a 1.5-point upset. later, mr. trump, too, consistently criticized clinton over nafta and the trans-pacific partnership. sanders portrays his congressional votes opposing the trade deals as a matter of character. i worked with the unions as a member of the house of representative to defeat nafta and to defeat pntr with china. i can remember like it was yesterday being on a picket line in montpellier, vermont in opposition to nafta. i knew what it was gonna do. i knew that you cannot ask american workers who are earning living wages to compete against the starvation wages being paid in mexico, sanders said friday in detroit. the senator hit the same note during campaign stops in michigan over weekend. he said in flint on saturday that i heard, during that period in the '90s, i heard all of corporate america say, 'you gotta vote for these trade agreements.' and all of the media said, 'you gotta vote for these trade agreements.' i stood with the unions, the working families of this country; i voted against those agreements! joe biden voted for those agreements. the reviews of nafta are somewhat mixed, and a new version of the deal, the u.s.-mexico-canada trade agreement, is expected to be implemented soon, after canada ratifies it."}
{"original": "in 2013, the liberal think tank economic policy institute projected that nafta caused, 20 years of stagnant wages and the upward redistribution of income, wealth and political power. at the same time, foreign affairs estimates that 14 million american jobs still depend on nafta. and a 2016 report from the u.s. international trade commission concluded the policy, had essentially no effect on real wages in the united states of either skilled or unskilled workers."}
{"original": "biden has rarely brought up north american trade policy on the stump since the iowa caucuses, where he would emphasize the impacts of the agricultural trade war with china. instead, he casts himself as an ally to workers and union members, even though its some workers have fallen victim to the shift of u.s. production to cheaper alternatives in mexico, as general motors did in march 2019, eliminating 1,700 hourly jobs in ohio alone. he stands by his nafta vote, arguing that no, it wasn't a mistake to vote in favor of the deal, he said last may in iowa. he has labeled himself a fair trader, rather than a free trader. he added, we should treat other countries in a way they treat us…just deciding it's all about trade deficit balancing...we need to do more."}
{"original": "the most recent ripple in the trade debate has been the usmca agreement, an idea then-candidate barack obama pitched in the 2008 primary. biden has said that in principle he supported the agreement due to the increased labor and environmental protections, issues that he told cbs news in summer 2019 that he believed should have been more thoroughly addressed from the beginning of the nafta negotiation in the 1990s. sanders unapologetically voted against usmca, stating that protections did not go far enough. on this matter sanders stood alone. his one-time democratic adversaries criticized him for being too purist in his pursuit. elizabeth warren, once sanders' fellow progressive in the race, promised to support the usmca and bargain for a better deal if elected. the distinction was noted by some in the rust belt. frank hammer, a retired 32-year general motors employee, participated in a panel discussion on trade with sanders friday in detroit. you were the singular, sole [candidate] that said — consistent with your past positions — that you were opposed to [usmca] and i think that speaks volumes for the stance that you have taken on behalf of working class people and especially auto workers, hammer said. and i'm so grateful. thank you."}
{"original": "on the trail biden has dismissed china's status as an economic powerhouse, pointing out basic challenges chinese leaders face, like providing enough potable water for their people, and boasting about the u.s. dominance in the future. the idea that china is going to eat our lunch, it's bizarre, he said in iowa in late january, suggesting that rather than viewing china as an existential threat, the u.s. could help china with some of its problems. the u.s. can compete with china and insist that they follow the rules, he proposed. unlike the social security ads the biden campaign is running in michigan, two biden advisers tell cbs news after reviewing their internal polling they decided to not engage sanders on the intra-party trade war. at this point i'm not sure voters are looking for a vote-by-vote analysis, one biden adviser told cbs news, they're looking for a nominee. others agree that focusing on trade — even in michigan — may not be as beneficial as sanders hopes. i think it's a miscalculation from sanders, justin wolfers, professor of economics and public policy at the university of michigan, told cbs news. wolfers cited a gallup poll that shows 67% of self-described democrats say that nafta has been beneficial for the united states. wolfers said that with the mr. trump's election everything is a little upside down in terms of trade politics because the gop incumbent has made a stronger pitch for protectionist voters than any democratic nominee is likely to make."}
{"original": "relatively speaking, democrats are now the pro-trade party, wolfers added."}
{"original": "biden has a strong argument to make in michigan on manufacturing, though, since he had a leading role in helping to negotiate the obama administration's 2009 auto bailout of two of the big u.s. automakers, general motors and chrysler. just like the automobile industry came back, detroit is going to come back, biden said in 2014. it's not only an important city but it's an iconic city. it symbolizes the manufacturing might of the united states of america. according to an invitation obtained by cbs news campaign reporter adam brewster, biden is expected to attend a high-dollar fundraiser in michigan this week, co-hosted by cynthia and edsel ford, the great-grandson of henry ford."}
{"original": "the california primary is far from over with more than 3 million ballots still left to count, according to estimates published by the california secretary of state. as of monday afternoon, cbs news estimates sanders leads with 33.9%, followed by biden at 26.6%. sanders so far is estimated to win 185 delegates while biden is at 143. cbs news campaign reporter musadiq bidar says the millions of ballots that remain unprocessed are because of last minute voters – those who either put their ballots in the mail on election day, or who voted in person but decided to change their party registration on the spot. this also includes ballots that were damaged, had typos, or required careful examination from a human election worker. in california, it typically takes counties weeks to process and count all of the ballots. according to the secretary of state's office, los angeles county, the most populous county in the state, has more than 800,000 ballots that still need to be counted. san diego county has about 350,000 remaining ballots, roughly 200,000 remain unaccounted in sacramento county while more than 100,000 need to be counted in san francisco county. state law requires county elections officials to report the final results to the secretary of state by april 3, 2020. the secretary of state has until april 10, 2020, to certify the results of the election."}
{"original": "governor steve bullock announced monday morning he will be running for the u.s. senate, reports cbs news political unit associate producer eleanor watson. democrats have had their eyes on bullock as a potential candidate to take on republican incumbent steve daines in november. bullock has won statewide three times and won his second term as governor of montana in 2016, the same year donald trump carried the state by about 20 points. a popular democrat in a red state would give democrats a chance at expanding the map for senate battlegrounds in 2020. bullock was reluctant to run for senate at first because he wanted a more executive role, so he launched a presidential bid in may. he told cbs news political correspondent ed o'keefe around the time of his announcement that his experience has always been executive, and i think that's where i could best apply my talents, and that's what i'm looking forward to. bullock suspended his presidential campaign after seven months without gaining traction in the polls. in the interview in may, bullock also told o'keefe, i know that we're going to have good candidates in montana to take on senator daines. however, no strong candidate emerged in the months leading up to monday's filing deadline. the deadline to submit candidacies to the secretary of state's office is monday evening. bullock plans to file with his wife and children by his side at the secretary's office in helena."}

{"original": "bond prices also changed course and moved sharply lower. the yield on the 10-year treasury note rose to 2.65 percent after it plunged to 2.55 percent thursday, its lowest in almost a year. that helps banks, as higher interest rates allow them to make bigger profits on mortgages and other loans."}
{"original": "london — in the final days of the trump administration, the u.s. state department announced that it will designate an iranian-backed group in yemen a foreign terrorist organization. ansar allah — better known around the world simply as the houthis, controls a vast swathe of war-torn yemen, and the united nations warns the terrorist label could worsen the conflict. humanitarian groups that provide aid to around 80% of the country's population say it will have dire consequences for their operations."}
{"original": "for five years the houthis have fought in a brutal civil war against yemen's internationally recognized, saudi arabian-backed government. the houthis control territory where about 80% of yemenis live, including the country's capital saana and the major port of al-hudaydah."}
{"original": "the designations are intended to hold ansarallah accountable for its terrorist acts, including cross-border attacks threatening civilian populations, infrastructure, and commercial shipping, u.s. secretary of state mike pompeo said in a monday statement. he said the measures would take effect on january 19 — the day before president-elect joe biden is sworn into office."}
{"original": "pompeo acknowledged in the statement concerns that these designations will have an impact on the humanitarian situation in yemen, and said the u.s. would put in place measures to reduce their impact on certain humanitarian activity and imports. he said the administration was also ready to work with the u.n. and aid groups to address these implications."}
{"original": "the designations are also intended to advance efforts to achieve a peaceful, sovereign, and united yemen that is both free from iranian interference and at peace with its neighbors, the statement continued."}
{"original": "united nations spokesperson stéphane dujarric said, however, that the new designation could aggravate the conflict, while impeding vital humanitarian operations and deepening yemen's economic collapse."}
{"original": "yemen brings in almost all its food via commercial imports. we are concerned that the designation will negatively impact — including through possible 'over compliance' by commercial actors — imports of food and other essential commodities just as more yemenis are starving, dujarric said. the humanitarian operation – the largest in the world — cannot replace the private sector or compensate for major drops in commercial imports of food and other essential goods."}
{"original": "we are also concerned that the designations may have a detrimental impact on efforts to resume the political process in yemen, as well as polarize even more the positions of the parties to the conflict, he added."}
{"original": "the u.n.'s world food programme, which provides more food aid than any other organization to yemen, acknowledged the u.s. government's commitment to work with the u.n. on the delivery of humanitarian assistance, but said it hoped to get more clarity soon on what accommodations would be made."}

{"original": "the humanitarian response does not operate in a vacuum. we work with banks, commercial traders and transporters, who in turn have links to global insurers and so on. we urge that the special measures mentioned by the u.s. government to maintain the flow of humanitarian aid to yemen take this into consideration, she continued."}

{"original": "this is pure diplomatic vandalism, david miliband, ceo of the international rescue committee, said in a statement. after four years of a failed war strategy that has created the world's largest humanitarian catastrophe, the last thing the yemeni people need is further interruption of aid and economic flows."}
{"original": "the further immiseration of yemenis, which will be the product of this policy, is a disgrace to the name of the u.s., and will have the perverse result of strengthening precisely the forces it claims to oppose, added miliband, who previously served as the u.k. foreign secretary."}
{"original": "the move was also the cause of serious consternation for some u.s. lawmakers this week. one u.s. congressional aide described a monday conference call between state department officials and congressional staffers on the pending designation of the houthis — along with a state sponsor of terrorism re-designation for cuba — as an acrimonious disaster."}
{"original": "the aide told cbs news that a representative for the u.s. federal government's own agency for international development (usaid) had said on the call that the designation would cost lives. the aide said there was no consultation with u.s. lawmakers on the major policy change, which they said showed a completely disregard for the catastrophic loss of life it would cause."}

{"original": "the following is a transcript of an interview with former secretary of state john kerry that aired sunday, january 12, 2020, on face the nation."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: we go now to dubuque, iowa and the presidential campaign trail where former secretary of state john kerry is on a campaign bus trip with former vice president joe biden and you can hear that bus generator going in the background. good morning to you, mr. secretary."}
{"original": "former secretary of state john kerry: sorry about that. good morning, margaret. good to be with you."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: i want to pick up kind of where we just left off with the two senators. you know, you've been touting joe biden's foreign policy experience as a reason voters should consider voting for him. bernie sanders, his opponent, has- has taken that on as a reason essentially not to specifically focusing in on biden's vote to help authorize the war in iraq. he called it appalling that after 18 years, joe biden still refuses to admit he was dead wrong in the iraq war, the worst foreign policy blunder in modern american history. given what you know about the region and how iran was essentially empowered by that, why- why doesn't he just call it a mistake?"}
{"original": "kerry: well, i think i in fact, margaret, i think that bernie, regrettably, is distorting joe's record in the following sense. i mean, he doesn't have what joe biden has, which is eight years of sitting on the national security council and demonstrating his judgment, whether it was on his leadership, dealing with the migration that was flowing across our border and helping to resolve that with the presidents of those countries or his work pulling troops out of iraq and negotiating that and working as perhaps the lead point man on that effort. i think that- that i know very well what joe's position was, because i answered those questions back in 2002, 2000- 2003 and four. and it was very clear that what we were doing was listening to a president who made a pledge that he was going to do diplomacy, that he was going to exhaust diplomacy, build a coalition. and ultimately we learned, as joe did and i did, that the intelligence was distorted. so joe spoke out and criticized. joe was against what they were doing. the vote was not a vote specifically to go to war. it was a vote for the president to have leverage with respect to getting saddam hussein back to the negotiating table, back to the inspections, excuse me. and i think we were let down and joe has said many times that it was a mistake."}
{"original": "obviously, you trust the words of the administration who didn't follow through on what they said they were going to do. and i invite you to go back, read my speech on the floor and others--"}
{"original": "kerry: --where i said this is not a vote specifically to let the president go to war. so i think bernie is trying to drive a wedge in there. i understand that, but i think the vice president has unparalleled demonstrated accomplishment and success in foreign policy as chairman of the foreign relations committee and as vice president. and he, in my judgment, is the one person running for president--"}
{"original": "kerry: --who the moment he takes office, has the ability to be able to address a lot of questions, including the credibility of the united states."}
{"original": "kerry: joe has told the truth. people know that. and i think they will trust in his capacity to lead the country at a very, very delicate time--"}
{"original": "kerry: --is, in fact, a premium."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: it is. and iran, an issue you know well, is front and center right now. but virtually every single democrat running for office right now is claiming the same or virtually the same iran policy, which is to try to revive the deal that you negotiated. there's- some would say a shell of it left now. shouldn't voters expect more out of a iran strategy from someone trying to be commander in chief?"}
{"original": "kerry: well, joe biden is, in fact, providing more, which is to recognize that- that it's not enough just to go back to where we were because obviously circumstances have changed and things have evolved in the last three and a half years. and- and what- what vice president biden knows we have to do is make sure now that all the things that we were going to do in the follow on agreement, which was always contemplated. margaret, you were there. you're an expert at this. you know exactly what the truth is about it. we were trying to take the nuclear weapon off the table first and then negotiate yemen, hezbollah, threats against israel, the regional question of trafficking of arms. and- and so vice president biden understands that now has to also be front and center --"}
{"original": "kerry: --as you- as you revive the agreement. but the truth is, france, germany,--"}
{"original": "kerry: --britain, china, russia are all still trying to keep the agreement in place because they recognize it's the strongest, most transparent, most accountable nuclear agreement on the planet, --"}
{"original": "kerry: -- and it did take a nuclear weapon off the table until president trump decided unilaterally to ignore all of our allies and move to get out of the agreement."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: the president's going on the--"}
{"original": "kerry: --that's happened in the last days--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: --going on the attack on that deal this morning, specifically mentioning you. perhaps not a surprise. but, you know, i- i know the deal you negotiated lifted sanctions, gave some relief in exchange for capping the nuclear program. there was also a parallel negotiation that released some cash as part of a settlement of a different, separate dispute. the president this week put blame on the administration, your- the administration you served on with essentially helping to provide money to the irgc. i want to play a sound bite of what you said in 2016 to cnbc when you were asked about how iran would spend the money."}
{"original": "kerry: i think that some of it will end up in the hands of the irgc or of other entities, some of which are labeled terrorist. you know, to some degree i'm- i'm not going to sit here and tell you that every component of that can be prevented. but i can tell you this, right now, we are not seeing the early delivery of funds going to that kind of endeavor at this point in time. i'm sure at some point some of it will."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: i remember talking to you at the time. money is fungible."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: why, though, did you think--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: --that that was a risk worth taking if you knew the possibility of what would happen with that money?"}
{"original": "kerry: well, what i was really saying, i think, first of all, margaret, you are an expert at this. you were there. you know that the president's tweet is a lie. and the president tweeted this morning, because i am coming on the show and he knew you'd ask me the question or he'd push you in a place where you did ask the question. you and the media, i think, need to call a lie a lie. you know--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: mr. secretary, i asked you that question in 2015 too."}
{"original": "kerry: --they didn't get 150 billion dollars. no- no- no. but let me just finish. you know- yes. and i'll- i'll answer that. i was saying clearly some money from the budget of iran is going to go to the irgc. it always has. that's no surprise. but the truth is and president trump- i- i- well, he probably doesn't know this, but the fact is his own defense intelligence agency in 2017 testified to the congress that very, very little money actually went to the irgc at all. most of the money went to the economy of iran, which is precisely what i said and what we all said. so, the irgc has never had a problem getting money. margaret, but the fact is donald trump keeps saying they got 150 billion dollars. a lie. he keeps saying that all of that money went to pay for it. it did not. his own defense intelligence agency says most of the money went for the economy of the country. so, you know, we have to stop dealing with questions on donald trump's lies and start dealing with the reality of what is going on. the fact is--"}
{"original": "kerry: --that mo- the vast proportion of that money--"}
{"original": "kerry: --went to the economy of iran and they're always going to be funding the irgc. there was no question about that."}
{"original": "kerry: and the irgc budget has not gone up markedly as a result--"}

{"original": "dallas — without the shocking video, it's unlikely that the world would have learned or cared about the violent manhandling of 69-year-old david dao on a united airlines flight last month."}
{"original": "the outrage on social media, the mea culpa by an airline ceo, the promise to treat customers better - none of it would have happened."}
{"original": "the passengers who shot those videos on a united express plane in chicago violated united's policy on photography. by the letter of the airline's law, they too could have been ordered off the plane."}
{"original": "under united's policy, customers can take pictures or videos with small cameras or cellphones provided that the purpose is capturing personal events. filming or photographing other customers or airline employees without their consent is prohibited. american, delta and southwest have similar policies."}
{"original": "passengers are accustomed to using their cellphones to take photos and videos that they can upload to facebook, twitter or instagram. airline rules on photography are sporadically enforced, but passengers should read them in the in-flight magazines because there can be consequences."}
{"original": "this month, a united ticket agent ordered a passenger's reservation canceled as he filmed her while disputing a $300 baggage fee in the new orleans airport. after navang oza posted his video online, united apologized, saying that the video does not reflect the positive customer experience we strive to offer."}
{"original": "in april, a jetblue airways crew called airport police to meet a man who they said continued to record a selfie video during a security-sensitive time in flight, while the cockpit door was opened. michael nissensohn insists that he wasn't recording the procedure."}
{"original": "i told them there is no rule against talking a selfie on a plane, nissensohn says. he says he was ordered off the plane and held up at laguardia airport in new york for more than an hour before being let go without charges. jetblue declined to comment on the incident. a spokesman says the airline doesn't publish its photography policy for security reasons."}
{"original": "with airline customer service in decline, videotaping is the only way that passengers can make sure they are treated fairly, says gary leff, a travel blogger who has criticized the airlines over the issue."}
{"original": "the tsa allows more photography at the checkpoint than the airlines allow on board their planes, he says."}
{"original": "the transportation security administration says that photography at checkpoints is fine if people don't take images of monitors or interfere with screeners. travel bloggers say, however, that people have had run-ins with tsa officers, and you should expect to be questioned if you snap more than a casual photo of a companion."}
{"original": "lawyers who specialize in first amendment or travel law say airlines generally cannot limit photography or video recording in an airport because it is a public space. but airlines have more power on planes because as private parties they are not bound by the first amendment."}
{"original": "they are within their rights to establish these rules, they are within their rights to throw you off the aircraft if you continue filming, says joseph larsen, a media-law attorney in houston."}
{"original": "however, there is no law against taking photos or video on an airplane, and it is unlikely that anyone would face legal jeopardy for taking pictures of an altercation on a plane or their own peaceful dispute with an airline employee, larsen says."}
{"original": "if you see something going on that is a matter of legitimate public interest, he says, go ahead and capture it even if you don't have express permission to film another passenger. the man who was roughed up by airport officers on the united express plane, david dao, has already got his settlement with united, larsen says. he is probably pretty happy that was documented."}
{"original": "indeed, dao's attorney, thomas demetrio, said, dr. dao has become the unintended champion for the adoption of changes which will certainly help improve the lives of literally millions of travelers, cbs chicago reported."}
{"original": "documenting perceived injustices has become a powerful way for passengers, particularly economy class passengers, to push back against major airlines. it's a frustrating moment for economy-class travelers, who increasingly face airline fees for everything from cabin blankets to checked baggage to carry-on bags. in 2016, passenger airlines collected a total of $4.2 billion in baggage fees and $2.9 billion in reservation change fees, according to the u.s. department of transportation."}
{"original": "long security lines exacerbate the problem, particularly for passengers who don't have access to expedited screening."}
{"original": "after a recent video of a confrontation over a stroller between an american airlines flight attendant and a mother with two young children, the airline grounded the employee. the person who shot the video violated american's policy, which prohibits unauthorized photography or video recording of employees or other passengers."}
{"original": "privately, airline officials say it is unlikely they would take action in such cases. american is reviewing its policy because of the difficulty of enforcing it."}
{"original": "even if the law is on the side of the passenger with a camera, there are practical considerations."}
{"original": "unless it's a legitimate safety issue like annoying other people, i don't see a problem with taking photos on a plane. but that's a call of the captain, and in the first instance the captain is right, says thomas dickerson, a retired new york state judge and author of travel law."}
{"original": "passengers can challenge the captain's judgment in court, and might win, dickerson says, but the problem for consumers is, do you really want to get thrown off the plane?"}
{"original": "the following is a transcript of the interview with secretary of state mike pompeo that aired sunday, jan. 13, 2019, on face the nation."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: joining us now from abu dhabi one of nine countries he's visiting in an eight day trip through the middle east is secretary of state mike pompeo. welcome to face the nation."}
{"original": "secretary of state mike pompeo: it's great to be with you, margaret."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: mr. secretary, we are in the middle of this shutdown, and i know a number of state department employees are not getting paid including a quarter of u.s. employees in foreign countries. you've been going to u.s. embassies. what are you telling staff about when they can expect a paycheck?"}
{"original": "sec. pompeo: look it- it's unfortunate that we're in the shutdown, i wish we weren't, too. i hope that it's resolved quickly and i've certainly told our- our teams that. but you have to know these great americans who are working in our embassies around the world. they understand the mission. they understand its importance. they understand that whether the government is open or closed they have a task to do and they are hard at it. they have- they have all uniformly been very engaged and continue to be so. it's been a great trip in that respect."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: how has this been impacting morale? i mean how are you telling people to explain to their foreign counterparts why the u.s. government shut itself down?"}
{"original": "sec. pompeo: yeah, margaret, our foreign counterparts have lots of things on their agenda to talk with us about. the topic of the government being shut down in the united states hasn't risen to the top of the pile in any of the visits that i've had."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: well i do want to ask you since we are so focused on what's happening with this shutdown here at home, the state department when it comes to the border issues has issued a report in 2017 about counterterrorism and it says that there is no credible evidence that international terrorist groups have established bases in mexico or sent operatives via mexico into the united states. it adds the southern border is vulnerable, but terrorist groups likely seek other means of trying to enter the united states. how does this match with the claim that there is a border security crisis?"}
{"original": "sec. pompeo: margaret, make- make no mistake about it margaret, keeping our southern border secure is an important national security component, it's- it's critical that we do that well. there's a real risk to the united states of america. we need to take this seriously. we need to secure our southern border. we need to make sure that those who want to do us harm don't have a way to access us in that way. there are many things we have to do. one of the reasons i'm in the middle east is to work on prevailing against terror. there are lots of elements of this but border security is a certain and certainly an important component."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: so is the state department report wrong to say that this is not how terrorists are trying to enter the united states?"}
{"original": "sec. pompeo: margaret, terrorists try to get into our country lots of ways. one of the ways they can come in is across our southern border. what you saw was an unclassified report. make no mistake about it, terrorists will always find the weakest link. and we need to make sure that the weakest link in our national security isn't on our southern border."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: i want to get to your trip through the middle east, but i first want to ask you about this new york times report that says right after president trump fired former fbi director james comey the fbi began investigating whether president trump himself was a potential threat to national security and whether he'd been working for russia or unintentionally influenced by moscow. what is your reaction to this?"}
{"original": "sec. pompeo: i'm not going to comment on new york times stories, but i'll certainly say this: the- the notion that president trump is a threat to american national security is absolutely ludicrous."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: just to clarify since you were cia director did you have any idea that this investigation was happening?"}
{"original": "sec. pompeo: margaret- margaret- margaret. i've answered this question repeatedly indeed on your show. the- the idea that's contained in the new york times story that president trump was a threat to american national security is- is silly on its face and not worthy of a response."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: one of the reasons you're in the middle east is to reassure and explain to some of our allies what the u.s. policy in syria is. so i'd like you to do that for us today because the pentagon announced yesterday that it actually has begun its withdrawal from syria. yet the u.s. national security adviser john bolton said that wouldn't happen until two things. one, the u.s. defeated isis and two, turkey assured us it wouldn't go after our kurdish allies. have those two conditions been met?"}
{"original": "sec. pompeo: margaret the president's guidance is incredibly clear. the roughly two thousand uniformed soldiers that are in syria today are going to be withdrawn that- that activity is underway. we're going to do so in an orderly and deliberate way. a way that protects america's national security. a way that allows us to continue the important mission that they were on - the counterterrorism mission. the effort to make sure that with the destruction of isis is not only complete but that their resurgence is not possible. our efforts to counter the threat from terrorism stemming from the islamic republic of iran. those are all real missions. the tactical change we've made and the withdrawal of those two thousand troops is just that - a tactical change. mission remains the same."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: so has turkey's president promised you not to attack our kurdish allies?"}
{"original": "sec. pompeo: yeah, look when president erdogan and president trump spoke, they talked about this issue. the turks have made clear that they understand that there are folks down in syria that have their rights. we also want to make sure that those in syria aren't attacking- terrorists aren't attacking turkey from syria. we're fully engaged. ambassador jeffrey is fully engaged in conversations with the turks as well as with the sdf in syria to make sure that we accomplish all of those missions. we can- we can do each of those things, margaret."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: the sdf among some of the fighters that we were talking about kurdish allies there. just to explain for our audience."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: i want to ask you here though because you know as a diplomat the threat of credible use of military force is what gives you power at the negotiating table. how does taking out u.s. troops from syria get you any closer to expelling iran?"}
{"original": "sec. pompeo: margaret, the united states of america can project military power from lots of places in the world. the absence of a couple thousand soldiers on the ground in syria in no way materially diminishes the capacity of the united states of america and our amazing armed forces to deliver american power to accomplish our objectives anywhere in the world. that certainly includes in syria. it certainly includes into iran if need be. we still have those tools. america's diplomats still have that leverage and that power standing behind them. i'm very confident in our military capabilities here in the middle east."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: so by that, are you saying that having u.s. troops in nearby iraq will fill any kind of vacuum left by pulling out of syria?"}
{"original": "sec. pompeo: margaret, we have lots of tools in the arsenal. i was out visiting some amazing warriors out at navcent yesterday in bahrain. we have an enormous amount of american military capacity. our- our ability to achieve what we need to do militarily is there. my task as america's secretary of state is to make sure that we don't have to use that tool. that we get the diplomatic outcomes to secure the middle east and keep it stable and protect the american people as well."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: when it comes to iran, the trump administration has taken some, you know, confrontational tactics here, pulling out of the nuclear accord saying that iranian threats would be matched here. but we saw this week another american - a navy vet - michael white has been behind iranian bars since july. so the trump administration is not stopping iran from taking americans hostage. what is happening with this american?"}
{"original": "sec. pompeo: this administration is proud of the work that we've done to get americans released all across the world. with respect to that michael white case in particular, i can't say much. it's an ongoing consular matter. but the american people should know we take the security of every american, wherever they are traveling in the world as one of our foremost priorities. we will continue to work to get each of them back. and your point- your point about the islamic republic of iran is spot on. it's why the jcopa was such a horrible idea. many americans are being held there today that were taken by the iranian regime. these are a group of people who are among the worst terrorists in the world and who have the least respect for human rights in the world. and it's why this administration has taken the very hard line you just described against iran."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: is the trump administration open to a prisoner swap with iran?"}
{"original": "sec. pompeo: i'm not going to talk about something like that."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: well i ask you because michael white's mother spoke to cbs and she said she would like the administration to negotiate for her son. she said, what is a human life worth? i would like the u.s. to negotiate. i want him home. what can you tell her you're doing to bring her son home?"}
{"original": "sec. pompeo: i have great sympathy for the families of those americans who are wrongfully detained all across the world. and we do everything we can every day to get their return. we use our diplomatic tools in every corner of the world, to reach out to these places to get these young men and women home. we're intent to do that in iran. we're intent to do that all across the world. we- we take this- this obligation as a solemn one. and this administration's had quite a few successes."}
{"original": "sec. pompeo: i hope we have more."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: potentially open to negotiations then?"}

{"original": "margaret brennan: i know, sir, you're at the end of this trip, you will be headed to saudi arabia. it has been about 100 days since washington post journalist jamal khashoggi was brutally murdered there. will you raise this issue with mohammed bin salman, the crown prince?"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: then what will you say?"}
{"original": "sec. pompeo: i'll say what- margaret i'll say what we have said consistently. america's position both privately and publicly is the same. this was an outrageous act, an unacceptable murder. those who were responsible will be held accountable by the united states of america. we're determined to do that. we're determined to get at the facts just as quickly and as comprehensively as we can. we've had a policy that's been remarkably consistent with respect to this. we- we- we, we like the rest of the world, value human rights all across the globe. and the murder of jamal khashoggi was outrageous and we'll hold those responsible accountable. and then we'll talk about all the important things we do with the kingdom of saudi arabia and all the support they provide to keep americans in kansas and colorado and california and in washington, d.c. safe."}

{"original": "she is dedicated to promoting school choice but her critics say she really wants to privatize the public school system that she once called, quote, a dead end."}
{"original": "now, after the school shooting in parkland, florida, her portfolio is expanding. monday, president trump is expected to appoint her as head of a new commission on school safety charged with developing policies to prevent school violence."}

{"original": "betsy devos visited the school in florida on wednesday, but like almost everywhere else she goes, she faced criticism. some of the students sent out angry tweets: you came to our school just for publicity and avoided our questions. betsy devos came to my school, talked to three people, and pet a dog. many of the students are frustrated at the administration for talking about school safety, but not acting."}

{"original": "betsy devos: they want a variety of things. they want solutions."}
{"original": "lesley stahl: do you think that teachers should have guns in the classroom?"}
{"original": "betsy devos: that should be an option for states and communities to consider. and i hesitate to think of, like, my first-grade teacher, mrs. zorhoff, i couldn't ever imagine her having a gun and being trained in that way. but for those who are-- who are capable, this is one solution that can and should be considered. but no one size fits all. every state and every community is going to address this issue in a different way."}
{"original": "secretary of education betsy devos speaks with 60 minutes correspondent lesley stahl cbs news"}
{"original": "lesley stahl: do you see yourself as a leader in this-- in this subject? and what kind of ideas will you be promoting?"}
{"original": "betsy devos: i have actually asked to head up a task force that will really look at what states are doing. see there are a lot of states that are addressing these issues in very cohesive and coherent ways."}
{"original": "lesley stahl: do you feel a sense of urgency?"}
{"original": "lesley stahl: 'cause this sounds like talking. instead of acting."}
{"original": "betsy devos: no, there is a sense of urgency indeed."}
{"original": "i hesitate to think of, like, my first-grade teacher, mrs. zorhoff, i couldn't ever imagine her having a gun and being trained in that way."}
{"original": "the reason betsy devos wanted to be secretary of education was so she could promote school choice, offering parents options other than traditional public schools – where 90 percent of kids go. she has proposed massive cuts in public education funding and wants to shift billions to alternative players like private, parochial and charter schools."}
{"original": "betsy devos: we have invested billions and billions and billions of dollars from the federal level and we have seen zero results."}
{"original": "lesley stahl: but that really isn't true. test scores have gone up over the last 25 years. so why do you keep saying nothing's been accomplished?"}
{"original": "betsy devos: well actually, test scores vis-à-vis the rest of the world have not gone up. and we have continued to be middle of the pack at best. that's just not acceptable."}
{"original": "lesley stahl: no it's not acceptable. but it's better than it was. that's the point. you don't acknowledge that things have gotten better. you won't acknowledge that, over the--"}
{"original": "betsy devos: but i don't think they have for too many kids. we've stagnated"}
{"original": "lesley stahl: okay, so there's the big argument. so what can be done about that?"}
{"original": "betsy devos: what can be done about that is empowering parents to make the choices for their kids. any family that has the economic means and the power to make choices is doing so for their children. families that don't have the power, that can't decide: i'm gonna move from this apartment in downtown whatever to the suburb where i think the school is gonna be better for my child if they don't have that choice – and they are assigned to that school, they are stuck there. i am fighting for the parents who don't have those choices. we need all parents to have those choices."}
{"original": "we should be funding and investing in students, not in school buildings, not in institutions, not in systems."}
{"original": "question is: does her solution work? do choice schools perform better than public schools? naturally -- there are conflicting studies. it's complicated."}
{"original": "but devos spends a lot of time showcasing choice schools like cold spring elementary, a public school in indianapolis – that was allowed to get rid of the local teachers' union and create an innovative curriculum."}
{"original": "but when parents choose these options, taxpayer funds follow the child and that means that the public school left behind can end up with less money."}
{"original": "lesley stahl: why take away money from that school that's not working, to bring them up to a level where they are-- that school is working?"}
{"original": "betsy devos: well, we should be funding and investing in students, not in school-- school buildings, not in institutions, not in systems."}
{"original": "lesley stahl: okay. but what about the kids who are back at the school that's not working? what about those kids?"}
{"original": "betsy devos: well, in places where there have been-- where there is-- a lot of choice that's been introduced-- florida, for example, the-- studies show that when there's a large number of students that opt to go to a different school or different schools, the traditional public schools actually-- the results get better, as well."}

{"original": "lesley stahl: no, but your argument that if you take funds away that the schools will get better, is not working in michigan where you had a huge impact and influence over the direction of the school system here."}
{"original": "betsy devos: i hesitate to talk about all schools in general because schools are made up of individual students attending them."}
{"original": "lesley stahl: the public schools here are doing worse than they did."}
{"original": "betsy devos: michigan schools need to do better. there is no doubt about it."}

{"original": "devos is the only cabinet secretary protected by a squad of u.s. marshals because she's gotten death threats. she's frequently met by protesters who accuse her of pushing an elitist agenda."}
{"original": "she often manages to offend, as when she called historically black colleges and universities pioneers of school choice – as though they had a choice."}
{"original": "at this commencement speech at bethune-cookman university, students booed and turned their backs to her."}
{"original": "lesley stahl: why have you become, people say, the most hated cabinet secretary?"}

{"original": "some of the criticism, she feels, is unfair, especially when it involves her wealth. she faced a hostile question about it during a speech at harvard last year."}
{"original": "harvard question: so you're a billionaire with lots and lots of investments. and the so-called school choice movement is a way to open the floodgates for corporate interests to make money off the backs of students. how much do you expect your net worth to increase as a result of your policy choices?"}
{"original": "moderator: you can choose not to answer that secretary."}
{"original": "among president trump's cabinet of moguls and titans, devos is the richest: she grew up wealthy and married even wealthier. in their hometown of grand rapids, the devoses have been exceedingly charitable, their name decorates buildings like the civic center and children's hospital."}

{"original": "lesley stahl: so you've been on the job now over a year. what have you done that you're most proud of?"}
{"original": "betsy devos: yeah. we've begun looking at and rolling back a lot of the overreach of the federal government in education."}
{"original": "by overreach she means regulations. and like most of president trump's cabinet, devos is a devoted de-regulator. part of her job as secretary of education is overseeing guidelines that protect the civil rights of students."}
{"original": "just days after being confirmed, she rescinded a guideline implemented under president obama that allowed transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice – sparking even more protests."}
{"original": "she is now considering scrapping the obama-era guidance on how to identify, avoid and remedy discriminatory discipline, which aims to prevent schools from punishing students of color more harshly than their white classmates."}
{"original": "betsy devos: we are studying that rule. we need to ensure that all students have an opportunity to learn in a safe and nurturing environment. and all students means all students."}
{"original": "lesley stahl: yeah but let's say there's a disruption in the classroom and a bunch of whites kids are disruptive and they get punished, you know, go see the principal, but the black kids are, you know, they call in the cops. i mean, that's the issue: who and how the kids who disrupt are being punished."}
{"original": "betsy devos: arguably, all of these issues or all of this issue comes down to individual kids. and--"}

{"original": "as you take a closer look at your financial footing amid the headwinds of a pandemic, it's an excellent time to examine the possible impact of a joe biden presidency on money matters."}
{"original": "the balance of congress has shifted following the georgia runoffs, providing possible momentum for president biden's agenda. a new covid-19 stimulus check, taxes, health care — it's all on the line. here's how it may impact your wallet."}
{"original": "look for a third round of pandemic relief shortly after biden's inauguration, said bernard yaros jr., an economist with moody's analytics. analysts expect the new administration to roll out direct payments of $1,400 to millions of americans."}
{"original": "in february, we expect that there's going to be a covid-specific relief package, yaros said. that measure will likely once again extend unemployment insurance benefits, with enough support for another round of checks issued to americans, whether it's 2k or slightly lower, he said."}
{"original": "small businesses are likely to receive more grants and forgivable loans, as well."}
{"original": "and we're also thinking, you would probably get some additional funding for rental assistance, yaros added."}
{"original": "with democrats gaining two seats in the senate from the georgia runoffs, there is now a greater possibility of moving from relief to stimulus mode in late 2021."}
{"original": "that's because now that the democrats have a simple majority in the senate. they can pass changes to the tax code as well as implement changes in spending, yaros said."}
{"original": "moody's analytics economists expect the biden administration will dedicate increased funding for enhancements to social safety nets, possibly including:"}
{"original": "rolling out paid sick leave protections."}
{"original": "offering universal pre-k for 3- and 4-year-olds."}
{"original": "providing some kind of student debt forgiveness."}
{"original": "but on these initiatives, democrats will have to pick and choose, yaros said."}
{"original": "among the more moderate democrats, they're not going to want to increase the deficit too much. that's obviously going to be a limiting factor, he adds."}
{"original": "and while vice president kamala harris holds the deciding vote in the event of a senate tie, the 50-50 split between democrats and republicans doesn't constitute filibuster-proof power."}
{"original": "higher taxes are expected to partially fund the widening of these social safety nets."}
{"original": "yaros says biden is likely to succeed in reversing trump's tax cuts, raising the corporate income tax rate to 28%, increasing the tax rate for taxable incomes of more than $400,000 and eliminating some tax breaks for those making more than $1 million."}
{"original": "but the tax hikes may be smaller than widely anticipated, says michael zezas, head of u.s. public policy research at morgan stanley."}
{"original": "in a senate where democrats have the slimmest majority possible, any one democratic senator effectively has a veto. and when it comes to taxes, we expect many of the biden administration's proposed taxes won't pass muster with democratic moderates, zezas said in an analysis."}
{"original": "we estimate about $500 billion of tax increases are possible, obviously a smaller number than another potential covid stimulus round, and also smaller than the $1 trillion-plus spending now in play for each of health care and infrastructure, zezas added."}
{"original": "even if biden can swing the tax hikes, they aren't expected to kick in until 2024, yaros said, to make sure that there's no fiscal drag, at all, on the economy in these next couple of years when we're still digging ourselves out of the pandemic."}
{"original": "joe biden also has some ideas to reshape employer-sponsored retirement plans."}
{"original": "one of those proposals is to equalize the tax benefit of contributing to a retirement plan so that higher-income earners aren't getting more of the benefit than the lower-income workers, that it's standard across the board, said anne tyler hall, founder and principal of hall benefits law."}
{"original": "for example, someone in a 37% tax bracket is able to deduct the full amount of a retirement plan contribution, so $37 for every $100 pre-tax contribution. that's a greater tax benefit than someone in a lower tax bracket, such as 20%, who would receive a $20 deduction for each $100 pre-tax contribution."}
{"original": "the idea proposed by the biden administration is to offer a tax credit to low- and moderate-income workers, resulting in an equal tax benefit."}
{"original": "democrats are also pushing for employers to make retirement saving easier for the u.s. workforce."}
{"original": "employers who don't offer retirement plans would be required to allow employees to make contributions to individual retirement accounts, iras, hall said. contributions to the iras would come directly from paychecks."}
{"original": "with the shift of balance in congress, hall says such changes may be more likely. plus, some of these provisions have bipartisan support, she added."}
{"original": "helsinki - finland has become the first country in europe to pay its unemployed citizens a basic monthly income, amounting to 560 euros ($587), in a unique social experiment which is hoped to cut government red tape, reduce poverty and boost employment."}
{"original": "olli kangas from the finnish government agency kela, which is responsible for the country's social benefits, said monday that the two-year trial with the 2,000 randomly picked citizens who receive unemployment benefits kicked off jan. 1."}
{"original": "those chosen will receive 560 euros every month, with no reporting requirements on how they spend it. the amount will be deducted from any benefits they already receive."}
{"original": "the average private sector income in finland is 3,500 euros per month, according to official data."}
{"original": "kangas said the scheme's idea is to abolish the disincentive problem among the unemployed."}
{"original": "the trial aims to discourage people's fears of losing out something, he said, adding that the selected persons would continue to receive the 560 euros even after receiving a job."}
{"original": "a jobless person may currently refuse a low-income or short-term job in the fear of having his financial benefits reduced drastically under finland's generous but complex social security system."}
{"original": "it's highly interesting to see how it makes people behave, kangas said. will this lead them to boldly experiment with different kinds of jobs? or, as some critics claim, make them lazier with the knowledge of getting a basic income without doing anything?"}
{"original": "the unemployment rate of finland, a nation of 5.5 million, stood at 8.1 percent in november with some 213,000 people without a job - unchanged from the previous year."}
{"original": "the scheme is part of the measures by the center-right government of prime minister juha sipila to tackle finland's joblessness problem."}
{"original": "kangas said the basic income experiment may be expanded later to other low-income groups such as freelancers, small-scale entrepreneurs and part-time workers."}
{"original": "other european countries have considered offering citizens basic income, although to date finland is the only one to experiment with the policy. swiss voters last year rejected a proposal that would have guaranteed that all residents receive roughly $2,560 per month to help cover their basic needs."}
{"original": "brett mcgurk, the former special presidential envoy for the global coalition to defeat isis who stepped down in december, said he had no choice but to resign after president trump's sudden and unexpected order to withdraw u.s. troops from syria."}
{"original": "in his first television interview since resigning, mcgurk said isis is not defeated, despite claims to the contrary by officials in the trump administration."}
{"original": "i've probably traveled to syria more than any other american civilian official, he said. i know our people in syria. my heart is broken, he added, extending condolences to the families of four americans killed in a suicide bombing last week, the deadliest incident for u.s. forces in syria since the civil war began."}
{"original": "mcgurk, a longtime diplomat who was appointed special envoy by president barack obama in 2015, criticized mr. trump's decision to order the withdrawal of u.s. troops, which he cast as a total reversal of years of u.s. policy in the region."}
{"original": "on instructions from the white house, we were telling [u.s. partners on the ground that] we'd stay in syria until we completed the enduring defeat of isis, not just the physical territory. we'd stay in syria until the iranians left syria, and also until there was a irreversible political progress in geneva to end the ultimate civil war, mcgurk said. and it was the total reversal of our policy that made it — i just, i concluded i could not be effective in carrying out those new instructions."}
{"original": "mcgurk said a sustainable plan had been in place to defeat isis and begin serious negotiations with parties in syria, including russia."}
{"original": "the minute you announce to the world that you're leaving, a vacuum opens up and all the other powers in the region start making different calculations, he said."}
{"original": "still, given mr. trump's announcement, he said the world has to really accept some hard truths — i think, number one, we are leaving. the president has made that clear — we are leaving."}
{"original": "mcgurk said the top mission for troops should be to get out of the country safely."}
{"original": "withdrawing under pressure from a combat zone is one of the most difficult military maneuvers we can ask our people to do, he said."}
{"original": "outgoing u.s. department of education secretary betsy devos urged congress to reject calls to forgive student loan debt, a promise made on the campaign trail by president-elect joe biden."}
{"original": "in what reads like a farewell letter, devos offered closing thoughts on her time leading the education department. devos, a decadeslong advocate for school choice, made her final case as education secretary for expanding federal tax dollars for families that opt for private schools and opposed student loan forgiveness and free college, calling the proposals misguided."}
{"original": "across-the-board forgiveness of college debts is not only unfair to most americans, it is also the most regressive of policy proposals – rewarding the wealthiest sector of our labor force at the expense of the poorest, devos wrote in the monday letter obtained by cbs news."}
{"original": "the department of education suspended all monthly federal student loan payments in march amid the coronavirus outbreak and the economic fallout caused by the pandemic, granting all borrowers an interest-free forbearance period. in its $900 billion stimulus bill, congress neglected to extend the program and student loan payments could resume as soon as february."}
{"original": "it's possible the popular forbearance program will be extended again after president-elect joe biden takes office on january 20. when student loan payments do resume, the department of education doesn't expect a smooth transition. in its 2020 annual report, issued tuesday, the department said it expects loan servicers and the federal government will face a heavy burden in 'converting' millions of borrowers to active repayment. some of those borrowers, the report warns, will become delinquent."}
{"original": "tackling student loan debt will be a major issue for the biden administration. mr. biden has pledged to address the student loan crisis, including a proposal to cancel $10,000 in debt for students who work in national or community service."}
{"original": "last year student loan debt reached an all-time high, nearly $1.6 trillion among more than 40 million americans, making the department of education the country's biggest consumer lender, according to the federal reserve bank of new york. about 1 in every 5 borrowers are in default, according to the u.s. department of education."}
{"original": "devos wrote that under her leadership the way in which borrowers apply and pay back loans was revolutionized thanks to a streamlining of services."}
{"original": "where there was once a confusing and frustrating maze of websites, studentaid.gov is now the single online home for information. where there were once dozens of phone numbers, now there is a single 800 number, devos wrote. understanding and repaying student loans is becoming easier than ever."}
{"original": "devos did not directly acknowledge president trump's loss or refer to mr. biden by name in the five-page letter, which was shared with congressional leadership and house and senate education committee members as well as congressional appropriation subcommittee members."}
{"original": "although tens of millions of u.s. workers stand to benefit from the families first coronavirus response act, roughly as many americans would not."}
{"original": "the proposed bill, which the senate is expected to vote on this week after the house passed similar legislation last weekend, could provide billions of dollars to workers affected by the coronavirus — a key step in propping up an economy that is quickly sliding into recession."}
{"original": "the measure is a huge, huge first step, said kathleen romig, a senior policy analyst at the center on budget and policy priorities. millions of people are going to get some paid time off that they would not have otherwise, and employers are getting a big government subsidy."}
{"original": "she added: people are already starting to take this leave, with or without emergency benefits."}
{"original": "still, unless changes are made to the bill, more than 60 million americans would be ineligible for the two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of family and medical leave it offers for those impacted by the global pandemic. that's because larger companies, those with 500 or more employers, are exempt from the proposal's provisions."}
{"original": "for now, the bill's status remains fluid. house lawmakers passed a series of corrections to their bill monday night. in the senate, kentucky republican rand paul is reportedly threatening to delay a vote unless lawmakers include additional means of funding the benefits expansion."}
{"original": "my understanding is changes are being made as we speak, sarah jane glynn, a senior fellow at the center for american progress, a liberal-leaning think tank, told cbs moneywatch. whether that leads to substantive revisions in the bill or minor technical fixes remains to be seen, she added."}
{"original": "the house's latest proposed changes to its measure stipulate that:"}
{"original": "companies would not be compensated for sick days they already provide workers, although they could be reimbursed for health care premiums for employees on emergency sick leave."}
{"original": "the right to paid-family leave would only apply to parents whose children's school or childcare facility had closed due to the coronavirus."}
{"original": "health-care providers and emergency responders — along with workers who had been in quarantine or caring for a family member with the virus — would not be eligible for the additional 10 weeks of paid leave."}
{"original": "in the original version of the bill, all workers who received paid sick time would be eligible for another 10 weeks of paid leave at two-thirds pay."}
{"original": "there is a risk that the senate could look to make alterations to the house bill, though we expect that the pressure to act rapidly, and the bipartisan nature of the current text, will reduce the likelihood of changes, height securities analysts clayton allen and hunter hammond said in a report."}
{"original": "the paid sick leave provision — the center of negotiations last week between house speaker nancy pelosi and treasury secretary steven mnuchin — is complicated, according to the analysts. it mandates that employers with less than 500 employees fund paid leave at varying rates for varying amounts of time, with wide variations for different circumstances, they wrote. government tax credits would offset some of those costs."}
{"original": "the 500 employee cap likely leaves millions of americans without the new benefit, allen and hammond wrote."}
{"original": "as it stands, the bill provides tax credits to help small- and medium-size businesses finance the new benefit. for an employer, those credits would materialize when they pay their taxes, which companies typically do quarterly. for self-employed workers, that relief would also come when they pay their annual taxes."}
{"original": "either way, that presents problems, given that many employers are already taking an income hit from the virus, glynn said. for one, the bill would not take effect for two weeks after being signed into law. for small businesses, that means they'd have to start covering workers as soon as early april — but they wouldn't see any relief until july, when filing quarterly taxes."}
{"original": "for small business experiencing steep declines in demand now, my fear for some is that is going to mean having to close their doors, glynn said."}
{"original": "as now structured, the measure covers workers in businesses with less than 500 employees, which is roughly half of private-sector workers, or 67 million, glynn said. if you add public sector workers into the mix, a total of 87 million are covered."}
{"original": "of the 61 million people working for the larger employers that are exempt from the coronavirus relief measure, 11%, or 6.7 million, have zero paid sick days, data show. most those workers have 7 to 8 paid sick days — not enough to self-quarantine as long as health experts recommend."}
{"original": "there were earlier versions that would have covered more people, but after extensive lobbying from big business and what conservatives wanted, this is where we ended up, glynn said."}
{"original": "the wait for the refundable tax credit is now the number one sticking point, said romig, while adding that everybody sees we need to do this quickly."}
{"original": "as she put it: as the crisis spreads it's going to become more evident that this is necessary, that businesses of all sizes will need this, at some point."}

{"original": "new york -- verizon will pay a $1.35 million fine over its use of supercookie technology that the government said followed phone customers on the internet without their permission. verizon will also have to get an explicit yes from customers for some kinds of tracking."}
{"original": "the supercookies landed their name because they were hard, or near-impossible, to block. verizon uses them to deliver targeted ads to cellphone customers. the company wants to expand its advertising and media business and bought aol for its digital ad technology in 2015."}
{"original": "the federal communications commission said monday that it found that verizon began using the supercookies for consumers in december 2012, but didn't disclose the program until october 2014. verizon waited until march 2015 to update its privacy policy to disclose the trackers and gave people an option then to opt out."}

{"original": "health officials have identified a cluster of dentists who died of a mysterious lung disease. a report published by the centers for disease control and prevention found that nine dentists in virginia were found to have idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf), a chronic, progressive lung disease of unknown cause, between the years 2000 and 2015."}
{"original": "according to the national institutes of health, ipf causes scar tissue to build up in the lungs, which makes the lungs unable to transport oxygen into the bloodstream effectively. the condition is associated with a poor prognosis, the cdc says."}
{"original": "of the nine dentists in the report, seven died."}
{"original": "overall, the researchers found 894 patients diagnosed with ipf at a medical center in virginia. dentists made up just 1 percent of ipf patients documented in the study. however, researchers note that number is striking when considering the number of dentists in the united states."}
{"original": "a cluster is defined as an aggregation of cases grouped in place and time that are suspected to be greater than the number expected, even though the expected number might not be known, dr. randall nett, the lead author of the study and a medical officer with the u.s. public health service, told cbs news in an email. the number of dentists treated for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) at this virginia tertiary care center was about 23 times higher than expected."}
{"original": "the cause of the disease is not known, but experts say work-related hazards are likely at play. past research has linked the condition to jobs that involve exposure to dust, wood dust and metal dust. some other suspected causes include tobacco smoke and viral infections."}
{"original": "this is the first study to find a possible association with dentistry and ipf."}
{"original": "dentists and other dental personnel have unique exposures at work. these exposures include bacteria, viruses, dusts, gases, radiation, and other respiratory hazards, randall said. at this time, we do not know what caused this cluster of ipf cases in dental personnel. however, it is possible exposures at work contributed to this cluster."}
{"original": "however, he emphasized that the group identified in the study is very small and says more work has to be done before any conclusions can be drawn about the risk dentists or other dental personnel may face from the disease."}
{"original": "dr. paul casamassimo, chief policy officer of the american academy of pediatric dentistry's pediatric oral health & research center, notes that a number of dental professional organizations have taken steps to add safety of both patients and dental personnel to their program agendas. their aim is to improve awareness and offer advice to mitigate health risks."}
{"original": "dentists now do far less laboratory work in most instances even while training in school, casamassimo told cbs news. the likelihood of exposure to dusts and airborne chemicals is less than in the past, but still there for many dentists, particularly if they trained long ago and haven't kept up with environmental and workplace warnings."}
{"original": "experts recommend dental workers wear certified respiratory masks if they are working in any environment that might result in respiratory hazards."}
{"original": "the report concludes that more research is needed to better understand the potential health risks of working in dental care and how that might be associated with ipf."}
{"original": "this cluster of ipf cases reinforces the need to understand further the unique occupational exposures of dental personnel and the association between these exposures and the risk for developing ipf so that appropriate strategies can be developed for the prevention of potentially harmful exposures, the authors write."}
{"original": "children who suffer through multiple ear infections are often candidates for ear tube surgery. but a new study finds that the use of one type of ear drops — quinolones — after these surgeries may raise a child's risk for a perforated eardrum."}
{"original": "children who received post-surgical quinolones were 60 percent more likely to suffer eardrum perforations than those who received another type of ear drops, called neomycin, according to researchers from the university of florida in gainesville."}
{"original": "the surgery in question is called tympanostomy. in these surgeries, small tubes are inserted into the eardrums to open up the area behind the eardrum and keep air pressure at a level equal to that of the middle ear. this helps prevent fluid buildup in the middle ear."}
{"original": "we have tended to use quinolone ear drops fairly liberally after tympanostomy tube surgery, study co-author dr. patrick antonelli, chair of otolaryngology, said in a university news release."}
{"original": "in the new study, antonelli's team tracked data on nearly 100,000 children who underwent ear tube surgery. the researchers then compared post-operative eardrum perforation rates after kids were given either quinolone or neomycin drops."}
{"original": "the study couldn't prove cause-and-effect. however, children who received quinolones were 60 percent more likely to suffer eardrum perforations than those who received neomycin ear drops, the findings showed. and the researchers believe that the rate of perforations might rise higher if children are given quinolones together with steroids."}
{"original": "our findings suggest the need for more caution with the use of quinolone ear drops, antonelli said."}
{"original": "the new study builds on prior research suggesting that quinolones may come with risk, he added. concerns have been raised about potential problems with quinolones, including harmful effects on soft tissues. last year, a u.s. food and drug administration advisory committee concluded that the benefits of quinolones in certain instances might not outweigh the risks."}
{"original": "according to study co-author almut winterstein, evidence on quinolones' detrimental effects on soft tissues, animal studies, clinical trials and observational studies overwhelmingly point to the possibility that quinolones could contribute to the development of persistent eardrum perforations. winterstein is chair of the university's department of pharmaceutical outcomes and policy."}
{"original": "however, even though this study raises concern about quinolones, neomycin ear drops come with their own hazards, the researchers conceded. repeat use of neomycin has been linked to hearing loss over time."}
{"original": "so, antonelli said, physicians are stuck between a rock and a hard place. until we have other, safer antibiotic ear drops available, clinicians and parents must be cautious when using quinolones or neomycin, and understand the risks associated with both classes of drugs."}
{"original": "two physicians familiar with treating childhood ear infections reviewed the new findings, and agreed the issue is a tough one."}
{"original": "quinolones have some advantages over the commonly used alternatives, which themselves are associated with toxic effects on the hearing nerve, said dr. michael grosso. he's head of pediatrics at northwell health's huntington hospital in huntington, n.y."}
{"original": "these results leave ent [ear, nose and throat] surgeons without an obvious alternative: the risks and benefits of using other antibiotics — or no antibiotic — will need to be considered, possibly on a case-by-case basis, grosso said."}
{"original": "an otolaryngologist said the study did have some flaws, as well."}
{"original": "according to dr. darius kohan, there were many variables influencing the results — the kids in the study were largely covered by medicaid, details on the dose and duration of therapy was unavailable, and the study only focused on one form of quinolone ear drops."}
{"original": "still, the florida researchers do focus on a potential problem we should be acutely aware of, and i do agree with the conclusion that one must judiciously employ topical antibiotic therapy for ear infections and ear surgery, kohan said. he's chief of otolaryngology at lenox hill hospital, in new york city."}
{"original": "grosso had one more caveat for parents."}
{"original": "parents should be cautious about agreeing to 'ear tubes' in the first place, he said. although they are clearly helpful to many children, parents should do their homework to be sure that their child's ear problems meet the narrow criteria set forth by experts, as many cases of ear fluid go away with 'watchful waiting' alone."}
{"original": "the study was published recently in the journal clinical infectious diseases."}
{"original": "stocks were spooked badly earlier this week when federal reserve officials made comments that sounded like rising interest rates were a sure thing. those hawkish remarks pushed the nasdaq 100 below its 50-day moving average (a major trend indicator) for the first time since december. even though wall street rebounded on wednesday, investors should pay attention."}
{"original": "clearly, the fed has made a major change in tone from the years of monetary policy dovishness that investors had become accustomed to."}
{"original": "despite some recent softness in the economic growth and inflation data, the fed hiked interest rates again earlier this month. that's the third quarter-point hike since election day, a dramatic quickening from the prior pace of a single hike in december 2015."}
{"original": "moreover, officials penciled in another rate increase before the year-end as well as the start of a rollback of its $4.4 trillion balance sheet swollen by years of asset purchases (qe1, qe2, etc.). that's a far more aggressive pace than the market believes is appropriate."}
{"original": "in their latest series of comments, fed policymakers outlined their justification for action, summarized into these three overarching concerns. investors should be watching closely because as long as these worries remain valid, the fed will keep tightening the screws on interest rates, credit availability and thus the stock market's performance:"}
{"original": "both fed chair janet yellen and vice chair stanley fischer noted that asset price valuations were extended. fischer highlighted that equity price-earnings ratios are near the top of historical levels and that it would be foolish to think all risks [are] eliminated amid a notable uptick in risk appetites in asset markets."}
{"original": "he's right: the widely followed shiller p-e ratio, which smooths earnings over a 10-year window, has increased to nearly 30 and is on the verge of eclipsing the 1929 black tuesday high that ushered in the great depression. only the dot-com bubble, with a ratio of nearly 45, exceeds the overvaluation stocks are getting now."}
{"original": "on tuesday, san francisco fed president john williams told an australian tv interviewer that the stock market rally still seems to be running very much on fumes and that it clearly is a risk to the u.s. economy."}
{"original": "while inflation remains relatively tame, thanks to renewed weakness in energy prices, the unemployment rate has fallen to just 4.3 percent. in yellen's press conference after the fed's latest policy announcement a couple of weeks ago, she cited this along with other data points suggesting labor market tightness is a historical antecedent to higher inflation pressure."}
{"original": "on june 25, williams warned that a very strong job market comes with risks. namely, that if the fed is too relaxed in its rate hike pace the economy will eventually overheat, causing inflation or some other problem. on june 27, he added that he expected wage inflation to increase to a range of 3 percent to 3.5 percent."}
{"original": "philadelphia fed president patrick harker added on june 27 that he sees very little slack in the labor market and views the recent inflation weakness as temporary."}
{"original": "but above all, the fed is slowly beginning to acknowledge its unofficial third mandate: the risks that runaway markets pose to financial stability. (the central bank's two official mandates are price stability and maximum employment.)"}
{"original": "fischer warned that high financial market prices may lead to future stability risks. put simply, if valuations become too extended, it could lead to a bubble, which will eventually pop and jeopardize the broader economy."}
{"original": "new york fed president bill dudley admitted in a speech to the bank for international settlements on june 25 that the fed has become frustrated by an easing of financial market conditions since the rate hike campaign started in 2015. this is the opposite of what policymakers wanted to see. and it's being driven in large part by the stock market's near-20 percent rise since that time."}
{"original": "thus, dudley warns, the fed will likely keep tightening policy harder than the economic and inflation data in isolation would suggest so that it can cool investor sentiment, increase credit costs throughout the economy and prevent job market overheating and thus high inflation."}
{"original": "the trouble with all this: the fed has a terrible record of engineering soft landings in the economy and financial markets. the last two tightening cycles resulted in major stock market losses and volatility. once investors' speculative fever breaks, sentiment often devolves into panic and a rush to exit."}
{"original": "gluskin sheff economist david rosenberg noted that there have been 13 bouts of fed hawkishness since world war ii. ten have landed the economy in recession."}
{"original": "julián castro, the former housing and urban development (hud) secretary who announced saturday he is running for president, says president trump is a failed leader on immigration and called for an end of detentions of families seeking asylum at the southern border."}
{"original": "he's a failed leader on this issue, and now he's just trying to stoke his political base by bringing up the wall all the time, castro said on face the nation sunday. and it's just a failure of leadership all around. i would end this kind of family detention."}
{"original": "castro, who is mexican-american, made his presidential announcement in san antonio, his hometown and the city where he served as mayor for five years. he served as hud secretary under president obama."}
{"original": "in the face the nation interview, castro said as president he would make sure that we invest in sensible, smart and effective border security that includes personnel, that includes the smart use of technology and that does not scapegoat these immigrants, but tries to look for a way that we can get to comprehensive immigration reform to fix our broken immigration system."}
{"original": "he criticized mr. trump's policy of family separations at the southern border, saying it has not deterred more families coming from central american countries. actually the exact opposite happened, he said."}
{"original": "castro also said he supports medicare for all to transform the u.s. health care system."}
{"original": "i'm under no illusion that accomplishing something like medicare for all would be easy, he said. but i do believe that in this nation, in the richest nation on earth, that not a single person should be without health care when they need it."}
{"original": "castro, whose campaign slogan is one nation. one destiny, acknowledged he has an uphill battle ahead of him to capture the democratic nomination among what is likely to be a crowded field of contenders."}
{"original": "i'm under no illusion right now that i'm in the poll position or anything, castro said. i'm not a front-runner, but nobody who grew up here in these neighborhoods, including myself, has ever been a front-runner. and i think in this country right now, that there are a lot of people who don't feel like front-runners. and i'm going to go speak to them in this campaign."}

{"original": "mexico made it clear it won't pay for the border wall promised by president donald trump during the 2016 election campaign. yet mr. trump keeps repeating the notion in various forms, most recently tying it to his newly renegotiated trade agreement with mexico. the latest utterance came in his speech from the oval office last night."}
{"original": "the wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with mexico, mr. trump said."}
{"original": "the new trade agreement reached last year, called the united states mexico canada agreement, or usmca, would replace the existing north american free trade agreement, known as nafta, which has been in effect since the early 1990s. nafta eliminated most tariffs between the three signatories, with a few exceptions."}
{"original": "usmca, which does little to change those eliminations, isn't yet in effect. that's because congress still needs to ratify the deal (as do legislative bodies in mexico and canada)."}
{"original": "in the u.s., usmca ratification is far from certain and isn't likely to be taken up soon, given democrats now control the house and the government remains partially shut down. even if the new trade deal is enacted, it's not clear how funds in the u.s. treasury would be earmarked to build mr. trump's wall."}
{"original": "the president has previously implied that tariffs paid on mexican imports could be used to bolster u.s. coffers and, in turn, be eventually allocated to pay for wall construction. that's also problematic: congress drafts budgets and must approve any government spending."}
{"original": "donald trump keeps repeating the ludicrous claim that somehow the revised nafta will fund his wall even though it remains unclear if the deal will be enacted, lori wallach, director of trade policy for advocacy group public citizen, said in a statement. and if it is, the text does not include border wall funding directly nor would it generate new government revenue indirectly given it cuts the very few remaining tariffs, not raises them."}
{"original": "tariffs are taxes paid at the border to the government in order to import goods and services into the u.s. for sale inside the country."}
{"original": "any taxes collected into the u.s. treasury that could be allocated for wall construction would still have to be approved by congress, which at the moment remains at an impasse with mr. trump on that very topic. it's why the government is partially shut down."}
{"original": "reminder: companies, not countries, pay tariffs"}
{"original": "importers like ford or walmart pay these duties. they either swallow the cost or pass it along to consumers. that means it's often ordinary americans who foot the bill for tariffs."}
{"original": "mr. trump's trade levies are designed to make certain goods more expensive for u.s. consumers, who in turn are likely to seek out lower-cost items made in the u.s. or from countries that aren't facing the higher tariffs."}
{"original": "for u.s. manufacturers, purchases are often raw materials, like steel, or finished and semi-finished parts, like seats for automobiles. the u.s. also imports food and commodities like grain and meat."}
{"original": "take steel and aluminum. mr. trump's white house imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum last year. because prices for imported metals are now higher, domestic producers have also been able to raise prices. and it's those increases that can get passed onto consumers for the finished goods."}
{"original": "when it comes to the usmca, mexico generally doesn't pay taxes on goods imported into the u.s. if there are tariffs, u.s. companies pay them. higher tariffs can force a company to pass on that extra cost to the consumer."}
{"original": "another theory is that the u.s. economy will be so good under the new agreement that the u.s. treasury's coffers will swell, providing enough funds to pay the billions for mr. trump's wall. that's a lot of ifs, given the current impasse, experts have noted."}
{"original": "bottom line: no matter how many times mr. trump says it, mexico probably isn't paying for the wall, directly or indirectly, anytime soon. as things now stand, u.s. taxpayers would wind up with the bill."}
{"original": "pete buttigieg, president biden's nominee to lead the transportation department, fielded questions from the senate commerce committee on a wide range of topics including infrastructure, the airline industry, amtrak, regulations and federal funding in his confirmation hearing thursday."}
{"original": "if confirmed, he's likely to be among those tasked with trying to convince congress to pass a major infrastructure plan that would also help spur job growth. the nation's infrastructure has been crumbling, republicans and democrats agree, but there's been no major legislation passed on funding an infrastructure overhaul in recent years."}
{"original": "now is the time, and we have a real chance to deliver for the american people, buttigieg said in his prepared opening remarks. we need to build our economy back, better than ever, and the department of transportation can play a central role in this, by implementing president biden's infrastructure vision."}
{"original": "buttigieg pointed out that it's states, counties and local governments that are expected to maintain roads and bridges, but they lack resources."}
{"original": "it's another example of how we need major and significant investment as a safety concern to enhance, upgrade and maintain bridges and other key infrastructure assets across the country, he said, in response to questioning by minnesota senator amy klobuchar."}
{"original": "the young former presidential candidate impressed democrats and republicans alike with his testimony."}
{"original": "i'm quite certain he will be confirmed, republican committee chairman senator roger wicker said during the hearing."}
{"original": "montana senator jon tester, a fellow democrat, raved, you have put on a clinic on how a nominee should act. you haven't avoided questions, he said, adding, and you know what the heck you're talking about. and that's refreshing."}
{"original": "if confirmed, buttigieg would oversee a department that requested $89 billion for the 2021 fiscal year."}
{"original": "buttigieg, the former mayor of south bend, indiana, and a 2020 democratic presidential candidate, brought up his experience dealing with infrastructure and transportation issues as mayor of south bend, indiana. he also highlighted that his experience as mayor would help guide him as he approaches transportation issues and funding for the department."}
{"original": "as a mayor from the industrial midwest, i will bring a bottom-up perspective on transportation programs and funding, buttigieg said in his opening remarks. if confirmed, i look forward to working with our partners at the state, local, territorial, and tribal levels to find solutions to our infrastructure issues while we also prepare for the future of transportation at a time of great change."}
{"original": "in his prepared opening testimony, buttigieg mentioned that effective transportation policy can help people achieve the american dream, but he said that he is also aware that misguided policies and missed opportunities in transportation can reinforce racial and economic inequality, by dividing or isolating neighborhoods and undermining government's basic role of empowering americans to thrive."}
{"original": "after mr. biden announced buttigieg's nomination, there were early signals of bipartisan support for buttigieg. in a statement from december 15, republican senator todd young of indiana, who sits on the commerce committee, said, as a former city leader here in indiana, pete understands how critical infrastructure is to growth and opportunity. it will be good to have a hoosier serving in this capacity."}
{"original": "when running for the democratic presidential nomination, buttigieg occasionally admitted that he thought the trump administration would enact infrastructure reform, citing the potential job growth from an infrastructure package. in addition, buttigieg, when talking about infrastructure on the 2020 campaign trail, also frequently advocated for the u.s. to increase investments not only in bridges, railways and roads, but also in implementing better infrastructure to provide clean, safe water."}
{"original": "buttigieg is the latest of mr. biden's cabinet picks to testify before senate committees. if confirmed, he will be the first openly lgbtq cabinet member to be confirmed by the senate. he introduced his husband, chasten buttigieg, who attended the hearing, to the committee during his opening remarks."}
{"original": "i want to thank him for his many sacrifices and his support in making it possible for me to pursue public service, the nominee said."}
{"original": "president donald trump's trade war with china isn't only hitting apple -- new data suggest it's taking a toll on the u.s. manufacturing sector as a whole."}
{"original": "the institute for supply management, an association of purchasing managers, said thursday that its closely watched manufacturing index fell sharply in december from the previous month to its lowest level in more than two years. the drop — the biggest in a decade — was worse than economists had expected. the cause? a slowdown in growth in the world's two largest economies -- the u.s. and china."}
{"original": "the story here is that the trade war, coupled with china's underlying slowdown, is wreaking havoc in both countries, said ian shepherdson, chief u.s. economist with pantheon macroeconomics, in a note."}
{"original": "apple on wednesday pointed to trade tensions as one reason for weaker-than-expected demand for its flagship iphone in china."}
{"original": "although american manufacturers remain in good shape after a year of solid economic growth and healthy consumer spending, evidence that the manufacturing sector is cooling seemed to contribute to the malaise on wall street. stocks were already tumbling thursday, suffering another sharp decline the day after apple cut its revenue forecast."}
{"original": "the ongoing open issues with tariffs between u.s. and china are causing longer-term concerns about costs and sourcing strategies for our manufacturing operations, one manufacturer said in responding to the ism survey. we were anticipating more clarity [regarding] tariffs at the end of 2018."}
{"original": "the manufacturing index's drop echoes the deterioration in the other manufacturing surveys and suggests that the slowdown in global growth is starting to take its toll on the u.s. economy, andrew hunter, senior u.s. economist at capital economics wrote in a note."}

{"original": "washington -- in the spring of 2014, as a team of experts was examining what ailed the u.s. nuclear force, the air force withheld from them the fact that it was simultaneously investigating damage to a nuclear-armed missile in its launch silo caused by three airmen."}
{"original": "the air force on friday gave the associated press the first substantive description of the accident after being questioned about it by the ap for more than a year."}
{"original": "the accident happened may 17, 2014, at an underground launch silo containing a minuteman 3 intercontinental ballistic missile, or icbm. the silo, designated juliet-07, is situated among wheat fields and wind turbines about 9 miles west of peetz, colorado. it is controlled by launch officers of the 320th missile squadron and administered by the 90th missile wing at f.e. warren air force base at cheyenne, wyoming."}
{"original": "the air force said that while three airmen were troubleshooting the missile, a mishap occurred, causing $1.8 million in damage to the missile. the service declined to explain the nature of the mishap, such as whether it caused physical damage, saying the information is too sensitive to be made public."}
{"original": "the three airmen were immediately stripped of their certification to perform nuclear weapons duty. the missile was taken offline and removed from its silo. no one was injured and the air force said the accident posed no risk to public safety."}
{"original": "more than a year later the three airmen were recertified and returned to duty."}
{"original": "at the time of the accident, a group of nuclear weapons experts was nearing the end of a three-month independent review of the entire u.s. nuclear force, an examination prompted in part by a series of ap stories on troubles within the force. the experts were operating on orders from then-defense secretary chuck hagel, who asked them to begin their review in march. they reported their results to him june 2."}
{"original": "the ap asked lt. col. john sheets, spokesman for the air force global strike command, which is responsible for the icbm force, whether the may 17 accident had been reported to the hagel-appointed review group. the experts were looking at a range of issues, including shortcomings in training, equipment, morale and leadership."}
{"original": "no. the accident was going through the investigative process when the review teams made their visits to icbm bases, sheets said. pressed further, he said he could say no more and referred questions about this to the pentagon, which did not immediately comment."}
{"original": "the accident investigation board did not begin its work until aug. 25, more than three months after the mishap. a safety investigation was begun sometime earlier. the air force denied an ap request for the accident investigation report in 2015 under the freedom of information act."}
{"original": "hans kristensen, director of the nuclear information project at the federation of american scientists, said saturday the fact that the hagel review group was not told about the accident raises questions about what other accidents and incidents may have been overlooked by that investigation."}
{"original": "on friday evening, the ap was given a brief summary of the report. it said the minuteman 3 missile became nonoperational during a diagnostic test on the evening of may 16, 2014. the next morning a mishap crew chief, who was not identified, did not correctly adhere to technical guidance during troubleshooting efforts, subsequently damaging the missile. no further details about the damage or errors were disclosed."}
{"original": "the investigation report summary said there were four contributing factors to the accident, and two were identified. one was the mishap chief's failure to follow technical guidance. the other was that the mishap chief lacked the necessary proficiency level to anticipate the consequences of his actions during the troubleshooting."}
{"original": "in seeming contradiction of that second point, the air force said in its separate statement to the ap that the mishap team chief was properly trained for the task he was performing."}
{"original": "sheets said it is possible that some or all of the three could still face disciplinary action."}
{"original": "the summary said the central cause of the mishap was established by clear and convincing evidence, but the air force would not disclose the cause or the evidence. it said the cause is cited in the investigation report. the air force refused to make that public, saying the report is classified, even though the service's own policy requires the public release of accident board reports."}
{"original": "the amount of damage to the missile - $1.8 million, according to the air force - suggests that the airmen's errors might have caused physical damage, kristensen said. if so, he said, it could have been categorized by the air force as a bent spear event, which is an official reporting code word for a significant nuclear weapon incident. the air force refused to reveal how it categorized the juliet-07 accident."}
{"original": "by keeping the details of the accident secret and providing only vague responses, the air force behaves as if it has something to hide and undermines public confidence in the safety of the icbm mission, kristensen said."}

{"original": "former attorney general jeff sessions and his aides were the driving force behind the separation of thousands of migrant families in 2017 and 2018, pushing for the policy's implementation even as federal prosecutors raised concerns about the young age of some of the children, according to a report released by the justice department's internal watchdog."}
{"original": "a 93-page report published on thursday by the justice department's inspector general found that sessions and top aides, including his counselor gene hamilton, failed to coordinate with u.s. prosecutors, the u.s. marshals service and shelters before ordering the zero tolerance policy of prosecuting all adults who crossed the southern border without legal permission, including those traveling with their children."}
{"original": "we concluded that the department's single-minded focus on increasing immigration prosecutions came at the expense of careful and appropriate consideration of the impact of family unit prosecutions and child separations, the report said."}
{"original": "according to the report, u.s. attorneys along the southern border were not initially made aware that sessions wanted them to prosecute all migrant parents who had been apprehended with minor children. they were later told that was the case, and that there would be no categorical ban on prosecuting parents because of their children's age."}
{"original": "[w]e need to take away children, sessions said during a call in may 2018, according to contemporaneous notes taken by several u.s. attorneys. [i]f care about kids, don't bring them in; won't give amnesty to kids; to people with kids, the notes said. sessions declined to be interviewed by investigators with the inspector general's office, the report said."}
{"original": "john bash, the former u.s. attorney for the western district of texas, told the justice department inspector general's team that then-deputy attorney general rod rosenstein said prosecutors could decline to prosecute some cases if they involved parents of children who had a disability or spoke pre-columbian languages."}
{"original": "rosenstein told investigators from the inspector general's office that he understood the zero tolerance policy would result in children being separated from their families."}
{"original": "i think the answer is yes, he said. i think everybody understood that what it meant was we are going to prosecute ... everybody who committed a crime without regard [to] whether they brought a child."}
{"original": "in a statement following the report's release on thursday, rosenstein, who stepped down in may 2019, said he wished we all had done better."}
{"original": "since leaving the department, i have often asked myself what we should have done differently, and no issue has dominated my thinking more than the zero tolerance immigration policy, said rosenstein, who is one of the few trump administration officials who have expressed regret over their involvement in enforcing the policy. it was a failed policy that never should have been proposed or implemented."}
{"original": "as detailed in the report, a u.s. prosecutor in texas told investigators that the prosecution of migrant parents had a considerable effect on his office's ability to prosecute other criminal cases, including those related to sex crimes. crossing the border without permission, if prosecuted, is a misdemeanor offense."}
{"original": "during the spring of 2018, u.s. immigration authorities separated more than 2,800 migrant children from their parents, before judicial intervention and public outcry forced the trump administration to halt the practice."}
{"original": "the children were incorrectly designated as unaccompanied minors and sent to shelters overseen by the u.s. refugee agency, while their parents were prosecuted for crossing the southern border without legal permission."}
{"original": "most of the 2,800 families who were separated during the zero tolerance period were still in the u.s. when a federal judge blocked the policy, and were eventually reunited."}
{"original": "roughly 470 parents were deported during this period, and about one-third chose to have their children brought back to central america, as the government generally opposed allowing them to return to the u.s. the rest allowed their children to remain in the u.s. without them."}
{"original": "many of the migrant parents separated from their children in 2017 and early 2018, however, were deported without them, complicating reunification efforts. because of stale or outdated personal information and phone numbers, advocates have been struggling to locate all parents and more than 600 remain unreachable, according to court documents."}
{"original": "lee gelernt, the american civil liberties union lawyer representing the separated families, urged the incoming administration of president-elect joe biden to rectify the immoral and illegal legacy of the family separation policy. mr. biden has pledged to create a task force to help locate separated parents who have yet to be located."}
{"original": "the incoming administration must reunite the separated families in the united states, but we cannot stop there, gelernt said. these families deserve citizenship, resources, care, and a commitment that family separation will never happen again."}

{"original": "in february, north korea used a launcher truck to fire a midrange solid-fuel missile that it calls the pukguksong (polaris)-2, a land-based version of a submarine-launched missile the country revealed earlier. that missile traveled about 500 kilometers before crashing into the sea, according to south korean and u.s. officials."}
{"original": "the february launch, the north's first missile test after trump took office, alarmed neighbors because solid-fuel missiles can be fired more quickly than liquid-fuel missiles, which need to be fueled before launch and require a larger number of vehicles, including fuel trucks, that could be spotted by satellites."}
{"original": "the north's latest launch came a week after north korea successfully tested a new midrange missile that pyongyang said could carry a heavy nuclear warhead. experts said that rocket flew higher and for a longer time than any other missile previously tested by north korea, and that it could one day reach targets as far away as hawaii and alaska."}
{"original": "that missile launch showed that north korea's technology seems to be getting more sophisticated, and it represented a significant advance for kim jung un and his nuclear weapons program, martin reported. u.s. officials said it appeared to have been a test of a reentry vehicle, a key technology north korea must master before it can develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the u.s. mainland with a nuclear weapon."}

{"original": "new research suggests food options available at u.s. workplaces are likely doing no favors for americans' waistlines."}
{"original": "a new study from the centers for disease control and prevention found nearly a quarter of employed u.s. adults obtain food or beverages at work at least once a week. and those foods and drinks are typically unhealthy, often high in calories, sodium, added sugars, and refined grains."}
{"original": "investigators looked at data collected from 2012 to 2013 on more than 5,000 study participants from across the country. on average, each person consumed nearly 1,300 calories from foods and drinks at work per week. generally, these foods and beverages did not align well with the department of health and human service's dietary guidelines for americans."}
{"original": "the most common foods and drinks obtained at work include pizza, soft drinks, cookies, cakes, brownies, pies, and candy. the foods included in the study were either purchased on site at work either from a cafeteria or vending machine or offered for free in common areas, during meetings, or at worksite social events. the data did not include foods that were brought into work from home or purchased at off-site restaurants or retail stores."}
{"original": "researchers say improving the nutritional quality of foods eaten at work can go a long way in improving the nation's health. obesity and poor nutrition are two of the main risk factors for chronic conditions like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. these diseases make up seven of the top 10 leading causes of death in the united states and account for 84 percent of total health care costs, the researchers point out."}
{"original": "previous research published in 2010 found that three in 10 working adults in the u.s. were obese. employed adults with obesity also report eating less fruits and vegetables and lower levels of physical activity outside of work than normal weight adults."}
{"original": "with approximately 150 million working adults nationwide, the researchers say employers are in position to institute workplace wellness programs with the potential to reach and have an impact on a large number of americans' health."}
{"original": "employers can offer appealing and healthy options in cafeterias, vending machines, and at meetings and social events, said lead cdc investigator stephen j. onufrak, phd, a researcher with cdc's division of nutrition, physical activity, and obesity. one way to do this is by incorporating food service guidelines and healthy meeting policies into worksite wellness efforts."}
{"original": "in addition to providing foods that are more in line with the dietary guidelines, including fruits, vegetables, beans, whole grains, nuts and seeds, work places can take additional steps to help improve health of employees."}
{"original": "foods can be placed in areas that encouraged consumption of the better choices, like placing fruit on the welcome desk or bottles of water at the cash register, and keeping unhealthy choices in less appealing places such as putting full sugar sodas on the very top or very bottom rack of the cooler, debbie petitpain, ms, rdn a media spokesperson for the academy of nutrition and dietetics, told cbs news. and financial incentives, such as a frequency program or employee discount, can be used to encourage employees to make the healthy choice."}
{"original": "employees can also do their part to make healthier food decisions at work. petitpain recommends knowing what food options are available in the cafeteria or vending machines before lunch or snack time."}
{"original": "many operations post a menu online or outside the cafeteria so you can review the options and pick the best choice ahead of time instead of making the decision when you are hungry, under a time crunch and smelling burgers, she said."}
{"original": "simple swaps can also reduce the amount of calories, sodium, and added sugars consumed. these include choosing baked chicken over fried, a sandwich instead of pizza and an unsweetened drink like tea or carbonated water rather than soda."}
{"original": "for breakfast, petitpain suggests eating a whole grain cereal or oatmeal instead of processed meat like bacon or a stack of pancakes. and for a snack, sticking with yogurt, a fruit cup, or cottage cheese, or selecting nuts, trail mix, or whole grain crackers from the vending machine over sweets or chips is the way to go."}
{"original": "the new cdc research also found that nearly 70 percent of calories consumed at work came from free foods offered at meetings, in common areas, or at workplace social events. while experts say employers can work to address the healthfulness of these free foods, employees can also take steps to avoid temptation."}
{"original": "unfortunately, even if the food is free, the calories still count. portion control makes all the difference, petitpain said. one slice of veggie pizza or a small slice of cake can be worked into an overall healthy diet. a healthy eating pattern isn't defined by one meal. you can always alter your dinner to balance out foods eat during work hours. remember, though, that just because it's offered, you don't have to eat it."}
{"original": "she recommends keeping busy during meetings by taking notes or chatting with co-workers at celebrations to keep from nibbling."}
{"original": "while the study didn't take into account foods brought in to work by colleagues, anyone who's ever worked in an office knows it's the first place people bring leftover halloween candy or holiday treats."}
{"original": "ask your colleagues to adopt a 'no junk food' policy or to also bring a healthy treat with the unhealthy one, petitpain recommends. research shows that keeping the treats out of sight, say in the break room or in a cabinet, reduces mindless snacking. brushing your teeth after lunch or chewing gum can keep you from nibbling, as well."}
{"original": "by now it's clear that the tech stocks that have been fueling the u.s. stock market are running out of gas. sparking tuesday's collapse in share prices across the board was the tech-heavy nasdaq's nearly 3 percent tumble."}

{"original": "it's not just the s&p 500 that's afflicted. earlier this month, a subset of this group (apple, facebook, amazon, netflix and alphabet) accounted for a quarter of the nasdaq composite, up from less than 20 percent just three years ago. goldman sachs analysts recently pointed out that the fangmans were among the most crowded trade on wall street, with amazon, facebook and alphabet three of the top four most widely held stocks among hedge funds."}
{"original": "bank of america's michael hartnett warned clients this week that this is just the latest bubble created by overly easy central bank policy. he's dubbed it the icarus trade and wrote that the lowest interest rates in 5,000 years have guaranteed a melt-up trade in risk assets including the latest e-commerce bubble consisting of the majority of the fangman stocks. they're up 617 percent since the financial crisis, making it the third-largest bubble of the past 40 years."}
{"original": "but rapid price deflation is underway as a perfect storm of negative headlines hit. facebook shares have been pushed into a bear market -- down more than 22 percent from their recent high (chart above). the company is now grappling with the #deletefacebook blowback following revelations of the political weaponization of personal data, a looming congressional appearance by ceo mark zuckerberg and growing realization that stricter data regulation is coming. these forces will also hit the data hoarders at google."}

{"original": "this would be a big negative, according to the folks at sentimentrader, because it would end a streak of more than 400 days above this long-term average. and stocks have tended to perform poorly when they're below and looking up at the 200-day, with an average annualized return of just 0.2 percent (vs. 11.1 percent when above this measure)."}

{"original": "this week we inaugurate a new administration and pray for its success in keeping america safe and prosperous. we extend our best wishes, and we also want them to have luck — a very important word, mr. trump said in a speech that was clearly scripted but with small insertions of trump flair."}
{"original": "mr. trump thanked his family, the pences, his chief of staff mark meadows, the secret service and law enforcement."}
{"original": "most of all, i want to thank the american people, mr. trump said. to serve as your president has been an honor beyond description."}
{"original": "mr. trump said it never failed to move him when americans flocked to wave at his motorcade, not just to see him but out of honor for the country."}
{"original": "the president did mention the violent attack on the nation's capitol, even as he has denied that his rhetoric was remotely responsible for it."}
{"original": "all americans were horrified by the assault on our capitol. political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as americans. it can never be tolerated, the president said in his address."}

{"original": "if you want to tweet something about your personal experience at your job, do it, kennedy told philly.com on tuesday. a lot of times your bosses will sugarcoat what's going on. doing it publicly really puts the spotlight on them."}
{"original": "the social media post that landed kennedy in hot water came after a customer tweeted thanks for a free food offer in january 2015."}

{"original": "kennedy took down the tweet after a supervisor showed him a social media policy that banned disparaging, false statements about chipotle. but he was fired two weeks later after circulating a petition about workers being unable to take breaks."}
{"original": "kennedy, of upper darby, was represented by the pennsylvania workers organizing committee, which has pushed for higher pay for fast-food workers. the national labor relations board agreed with complaints filed by the group that kennedy was unfairly treated. the case was one of several the nlrb considered regarding the social media rights of fast-food workers protesting wages and working conditions."}

{"original": "gold has been a hot commodity so far this year. but will it last?"}
{"original": "the yellow metal is up more than 19 percent and has recently tested the $1,280-an-ounce level for the first time since early 2015 (chart below). in comparison, the dow jones industrials index is down 2.7 percent for the year to date. the tech-heavy nasdaq composite -- which features one-time momentum favorites like apple (aapl) -- fares even worse: it's down 7.2 percent."}
{"original": "a number of factors are fueling gold's rise. the recent cooling in the u.s. dollar. financial volatility at the start of the year. early evidence of rising inflation. physical metal shortages in the futures market. and the recent experiment with deepening negative interest rates in europe and asia as overseas central banks respond to recent vulnerabilities with even more aggressive monetary policy stimulus."}
{"original": "above all, though, inflation dynamics should keep gold pushing higher as crude oil looks set to stabilize and the u.s. labor market tightens."}
{"original": "ed yardeni at yardeni research notes that the federal reserve's preferred inflation measure -- the core personal consumption expenditures deflator -- increased to 1.7 percent in february up from a recent low of 1.3 percent in october (chart below). that's very close to the fed's 2 percent target and suggests that factors like rising housing costs and an ongoing decline in the unemployment rate are lifting the general price level -- both in a cost push (as businesses try to pass on higher unit labor costs) and demand pull (from lower rental vacancies, for instance)."}
{"original": "at the same time, fed policymakers have recently been voicing increasing worry about the potential risk of expectations about prices -- or where people believe inflation is headed -- from low energy costs. this suggests that despite the firming up of core, or ex-energy, inflation measures, the fed is likely to hold off on any further interest rate hikes until the second half of the year as it waits for hard evidence that that u.s. economy is bouncing back."}
{"original": "if so, that means the central bank could potentially fall behind the curve on inflation because monetary policy operates with a lag of around nine months. it takes time for changes in interest rates to percolate through the financial system into loan rates, affecting credit-fueled purchases and, ultimately, business revenues."}
{"original": "conformation of this should come courtesy of the fed's updated summary of economic projections, or dot plot, at its next policy announcement a week from today, on march 16."}

{"original": "republican candidates descended on south carolina saturday to speak at the kemp forum on expanding opportunity - an anti-poverty summit hosted by house speaker paul ryan and sen. tim scott."}
{"original": "the summit is being billed as an opportunity for gop candidates to discuss conservative solutions to the problems of the american poor. it's named after former congressman jack kemp, whom ryan considers a mentor. kemp was known as an aggressive crusader for supply-side conservative economics, which argued lower taxes would increase growth. but he was also known for his outreach to minority communities and people living in poverty, and his insistence that the republican party should speak to everyone in america, not just the middle class and the well-off."}
{"original": "naming the gathering after kemp echoes the former congressman's efforts to do what ryan is trying to do, face the nation host john dickerson wrote in a column shortly after the summit was announced. kemp even tried to do it when he was bob dole's vice presidential nominee. he traveled to harlem in new york, watts in los angeles, and the south side of chicago preaching the gospel of free enterprise. green is the color of civil rights, he used to say, meaning the money that came from free enterprise. much like ryan, kemp was ultimately discouraged from appealing for votes in poor neighborhoods where there weren't many republicans."}
{"original": "in one of ryan's first major policy addresses as speaker, he echoed kemp's message."}
{"original": "there are the millions of people stuck in neutral: 6 million people who have no choice but to work part time, 45 million people living in poverty, he said. conservatives need to have an answer to this--because we do not write people off in this country. we just don't."}
{"original": "the summit was arranged before ryan became speaker, but he felt strongly enough about his message that he wasn't going to let his new job scuttle the event."}
{"original": "this is such a high priority for me, i instantly determined as soon as i became speaker that i'm going to keep this on the schedule, ryan told the wall street journal this week."}
{"original": "the forum could give ryan and the republican candidates an opportunity to renew kemp's message for a new generation and demonstrate how their policies would address the problem of poverty in america. and according to the most recent annual data available, that's no insignificant task."}
{"original": "the census defines poverty on a sliding scale according to the size of a family unit, but for a family of four, the poverty threshold in 2014 was just over $24,000. for one person, it was just over $12,000."}
{"original": "in 2014, 46.7 million people were living in poverty, according to the census bureau - a poverty rate of 14.8 percent."}
{"original": "some groups were harder hit than others - 21.1 percent of children were living in poverty, comprising a full third of the american poor. the poverty rate for white americans was only 10.1 percent, but for hispanic americans, it was 23.6 percent, and for black americans, it was 26.2 percent. among men, the poverty rate was 13.6 percent; among women, 16.1 percent."}

{"original": "it is also threatening the act of in-person voting, prompting some states to postpone their primaries over health concerns, including ohio's primary, which was scheduled for today. florida, illinois and arizona went ahead with their primaries as scheduled but made changes to accommodate concern about the virus, like moving polling locations out of senior living facilities and offering sanitizing materials. in-person voting is a comparable transaction to picking up a takeout restaurant order or shopping at a grocery store, said matt dietrich of the illinois state board of elections. primary voting typically is a swift transaction that can be done at a safe distance from other voters."}
{"original": "officials and campaigns alike have also been advocating for absentee or mail-in voting, where available, in the coming primaries. these options have been available in several of the states that have voted."}

{"original": "in the lead-up to tuesday's primaries, the democratic campaigns have operated largely online, canceling all in-person events and instructing staff to work from home. on monday night, sanders' campaign held a first-ever digital rally with several musical guests, distributed via livestream. last week, he broadcast a fireside chat. biden hosted a tele-town hall on monday, where the impact of the pandemic was a top concern."}
{"original": "after run-ins with protesters in new hampshire and california, joe biden officially received full protection from the secret service on tuesday, according to a spokesperson. as the future of the 2020 race continues to remain uncertain, cbs news campaign reporter bo erickson says biden, like his fellow americans, is at home following social distancing guidelines. while the campaign has repeatedly said they are following the advice of local and state public health officials regarding tuesday's primary contests, they also today released a memo declaring the us held elections during the civil war, the 1918 flu pandemic, and world war ii. regarding potential health fears keeping voters from the polls, the campaign also said they believe overall turnout will be roughly on pace for 2016 in arizona and florida and roughly on pace for 2018 in illinois due to early voting measures."}
{"original": "as the primary process continues to creep along, a hot topic of political gossip is taking hold around the biden campaign: if he is the nominee, who should his vice presidential nominee be? it is unclear if the campaign has begun the vetting process for vice president, but biden prompted speculation this week when he promised to choose a woman."}
{"original": "so, allies of his are already sending their recommendations, including former congressman luis guiterrez, who wrote that biden should pick a latina. other allies of biden's have told cbs news they'd like to see former democratic presidential rivals senators kamala harris or amy klobuchar on the shortlist."}

{"original": "stephanie porta, the co-founder and executive director of organize florida, one of the groups involved in the lawsuit, said, there are thousands of people in florida who are under self-quarantine or forced quarantine, who are unable to participate in this election as well as thousands of students who have been ordered to move home…it's important that we have participation levels that ensure that everybody's voice is heard in a democracy."}
{"original": "the complaint requested an extension for people to be able to request a vote-by-mail ballot to march 27. it also asked the state to contact voters whose precincts changed as a result of site relocations. by the florida democratic party's count, at least 91 precincts had closed or moved throughout the state in the days before the primary contest. the state democratic party staff contacted voters to let them know of precinct changes based on information gathered from conversations with state county supervisors."}

{"original": "polls did not open in ohio tuesday after the state health director backed by the governor and secretary of state ordered all polling locations to be closed, citing a health emergency. in a statement, governor mike dewine said the state was facing an unprecedented public health crisis and to conduct an election would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus. cbs news political unit associate producer sarah ewall-wice says the move came monday night just hours after a county judge rejected a lawsuit calling for the state's march 17 primary to be postponed, but overnight, the ohio supreme court upheld the decision to keep polling places closed tuesday after a complaint was filed by a candidate for county court to have the primary move forward march 17. on tuesday, boards of elections posted signs at polling locations letting voters know voting had been postponed. it's now slated to take place on june 2. as directed by the secretary of state's office, the boards of elections will process absentee ballot applications postmarked by may 26, and returned ballots must be postmarked by june 1."}

{"original": "as a number of states postpone primaries and other state officials continue to monitor the situation, democratic national committee chairman tom perez is urging the remaining primary states to protect the health of voters by implementing a number of steps including vote by mail. as our country deals with the uncertainty of coronavirus, it is critical that states provide clarity and not confusion, which could lead to disenfranchising voters, perez said in a statement. states can provide easy access to voting while still taking necessary precautions to protect the health and safety of the american people. along with pushing for vote by mail, cbs news political unit associate producer sarah ewall-wice says perez also suggested no-excuse absentee voting where voters can drop off their ballots at a convenient location or in the mail. he's also calling for the days and hours of voting to be expanded where in-person voting can still take place to cut down on lines."}
{"original": "meanwhile, perez slammed ohio's late night primary postponement, echoing the state democratic party by saying monday night only led to more chaos and confusion. he said the ohio state party is working tirelessly to protect the right to vote and argued that other states should make it easier to vote rather than moving primaries to later in the election season where there could be continued uncertainty. so far, five states have postponed primaries to dates in may and june. perez said the dnc said it will work with state parties around their delegate selection plans so that states can elect their delegates to the national convention once they are allocated."}

{"original": "since instituting its migrant protection protocols program in early 2019, the trump administration has required roughly 70,000 non-mexican asylum-seekers, including families with children, to wait for their u.s. court hearings in northern mexico, which includes areas the state department warns americans not to visit due to widespread crime and violence."}
{"original": "citing conditions in tent camps, insecurity in mexican border towns and overall desperation, some migrant parents enrolled in the program have allowed their children to present themselves to u.s. border officials without them, since minors who are processed as unaccompanied can't be returned to mexico under u.s. policy and law. many of the children have other family members in the u.s. willing to care for them."}
{"original": "according to government data obtained by cbs news, the office of refugee resettlement, the federal agency responsible for housing unaccompanied children, has housed 701 minors whose parents were in mexico under the mpp program. most — 643 of them — have been released to family members in the u.s."}
{"original": "once they reached u.s. soil in late 2019 from honduras, modesto and his 15-year-old son were returned to matamoros, mexico, where they lived for months in the squalid tent city there, the largest migrant camp along the southern border. modesto said they lived a cruel life in the camp."}
{"original": "he would tell me, 'dad, i can't stand it anymore. i suffer here. i'm hungry. i can't study. we don't live well here, and i feel desperate. i want to be in the u.s.,' said modesto, who asked for his surname to be omitted because he has an ongoing u.s. immigration case."}

{"original": "u.s. law shields unaccompanied minors from expedited deportations and requires the government to connect them with lawyers and child advocates while they are housed in shelters overseen by the refugee agency, which is charged with releasing them to family members willing to sponsor them."}
{"original": "these minors are entitled to seek asylum through child-sensitive interviews with the u.s. citizenship and immigration services, rather than in an adversarial courtroom proceeding with a judge and a government attorney who seeks their deportation. if they lose their case, they can apply for asylum a second time before an immigration judge. they may also request visas for victims of parental neglect, abuse or abandonment."}
{"original": "the government has argued that children who received a removal order alongside their family under the remain-in-mexico program can be quickly deported after re-entering the u.s. as unaccompanied minors. but advocates believe these children should be afforded the safeguards offered to other unaccompanied minors, arguing they did not get a fair day in court while waiting in mexico."}
{"original": "these children seeking safety deserve the protection, compassion and care that our government should, in theory, provide, natalia trotter, an attorney for the refugee and immigrant center for education and legal services who is representing modesto's son, told cbs news. the fact that this administration has allowed children to be in this chaotic situation is disgraceful."}

{"original": "the trump administration has hailed the remain-in-mexico program as its signature border policy, arguing that it stemmed u.s.-bound migration from central america and allowed u.s. officials to weed out non-meritorious or fraudulent asylum claims."}

{"original": "i hear vice president biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new, buttigieg said thursday at a town hall in decorah. but history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up, is to look to the same washington playbook and recycle the same arguments and expect that to work against a president like donald trump, who is new in kind."}
{"original": "buttigieg then pivoted to sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who favors medicare for all and free college tuition at public universities. buttigieg's campaign has also recently sent out fundraising emails that say nominating sanders would be a risk at a time when democrats are desperate to reclaim the white house from president trump."}
{"original": "i hear senator sanders calling for a kind of politics that says you got to go all the way here and nothing else counts, buttigieg continued. and it's coming at the very moment when we actually have a historic majority, not just aligned around what it is we're against, but agreeing on what it is we're for."}
{"original": "buttigieg has remained in the top tier of democratic presidential hopefuls in early state polls, although his position may have slipped since the start of the year. the most recent des moines register poll found him to be the first choice of 16% of likely iowa caucus-goers while sanders was the first choice of 20%. the same poll in november found buttigieg leading the democratic field in the state with 25% support."}

{"original": "according to cms, about 42 percent of the 10.7 million undocumented immigrants living in the u.s. in 2014 — the most recent year for which data was available — were doing so on expired visas. as the southern border has hardened, that number is estimated to have risen to over half, randy capps, director of research for u.s. programs at the migration policy institute, said."}
{"original": "the fight over a border wall is a typical issue of 'fighting the last war': ten years ago was the fight against mexican migration to the u.s., capps said in a telephone interview with cbs news. the problem isn't mexican migration anymore. now the immigration problem is overstayers, not border crossers."}
{"original": "the undocumented immigrant population hit a 12-year low in 2016, the most recent year for which data is available, almost entirely due to a sharp drop in unauthorized border crossings by mexican nationals, according to the pew research center. pew estimated that the unauthorized mexican immigrant population decreased by 22 percent since its peak in 2007."}
{"original": "over a five-year period ending 2016, a little over half a million mexicans illegally entered the u.s. through the southern border. that was down from 2.05 million during five years ending 2007, according to pew."}

{"original": "mr. trump has made immigration, specifically a border wall, a signature piece of his administration's priorities. while there have been some measures to rein in visa overstays since mr. trump was sworn into office, the changes have been less resource-draining."}
{"original": "one such change is that immigration customs and enforcement now emails visa holders to warn them that their legal residency is about to expire, said jessica vaughan, director of policy studies at the center for immigration studies, a research group that supports policy which admits fewer immigrants."}
{"original": "it'll make people think twice about staying, vaughan said in a telephone interview with cbs news. i think it'll help."}
{"original": "in the year ending september 30, 2017, the most recent year for which data is available, about 700,000 foreigners were living in the u.s. on visas that had expired in the prior 12 months, according to data from the department of homeland security. the agency estimated that about 15 percent of those have since left the country, but the rest remain in the u.s. as undocumented immigrants. 2017 was only the second year that dhs reported the overstay figure."}
{"original": "like most other immigration data points, pinpointing the total undocumented population and how they arrived in the u.s. is equal parts art and science, vaughan said. using deportation data from ice, which tracks how immigrants arrive in the u.s., vaughan estimates that visa overstays comprise somewhere between 40 and 50 percent of the undocumented immigration population."}

{"original": "the 26-year-old was the mets' closer before he was suspended for 80 games last april 11 following a positive test for stanozolol, a drug popular among bodybuilders. at the time, he said, i can honestly say i have no idea how a banned substance ended up in my system."}
{"original": "he returned july 12, appeared in seven games for new york, then was banned for 162 games on july 28 after a positive test for stanozolol and boldenone."}
{"original": "i think not surprisingly there's a tremendous amount of disappointment, i think to some extent, anger, to some extent, amazement that this could happen so soon after a previous suspension was completed, mets general manager sandy alderson said then. this is the consequence of making bad choices."}
{"original": "mejia's 162-game suspension had matched the longest under the big league program, a year-long ban served by the yankees' alex rodriguez in 2014 that originally was 211 games before an arbitrator reduced it."}
{"original": "major league players and teams agreed in november 2005 that a third positive test for peds would result in a lifetime ban. no players have been banned for life under the rules, which were put in place under pressure from congress to toughen their drug program."}
{"original": "mejia has spent parts of five seasons with the mets. his breakout campaign came in 2014, when he appeared in 63 games and posted a 3.65 era and 28 saves. the dominican right-hander signed with the organization in 2007."}
{"original": "the mets and mejia had just agreed last month to a one-year, $2.47 million contract."}
{"original": "we were deeply disappointed to hear that jenrry has again violated major league baseball's joint drug prevention and treatment program,the mets said in a statement reported by cbs new york. we fully support mlb's policy toward eliminating performance enhancing substances from the sport. as per the joint drug program, we will have no further comment on this suspension."}
{"original": "mejia may apply one year from now to baseball commissioner rob manfred for reinstatement, and manfred at his discretion has the power to let mejia back in baseball - but no earlier than for the 2018 season."}
{"original": "if an application is made and denied, mejia could ask baseball's arbitrator to end the ban, claiming the penalty is without just cause. the arbitrator cannot reduce the ban to less than two years."}
{"original": "des moines — faced with a bounty of potential candidates vying for the democratic presidential nomination, party voters appear to be putting a premium on electability, a signal of a more strategic approach to the selection process."}
{"original": "interviews with voters and strategists show a baseline for support coming into focus for 2020: can this candidate beat president trump?"}
{"original": "i didn't know it was that bad to lose, said des moines resident debbie whittie, who came to check out one of elizabeth warren's events over the weekend. whittie, who works for a credit union, says she is more engaged in political news than ever before. i'm already worried about that, she said when asked about electability. i really think i should go for 'the best,' but that consideration is going to have to be in my best."}
{"original": "jeanne williamson, another des moines resident and a democratic caucus-goer, said she will be taking a hard look at how the candidates stand on various policies. but, that's my first reaction: to beat trump, she said while standing in line to see warren on a chilly saturday evening."}
{"original": "i would vote for anyone probably who could defeat trump, said sally carney, another iowa democratic voter. oh, it's the most important: get him out, said cathy sanchez, a preschool teacher who came to warren's event in council bluffs. bill shackelford, a retiree, said he wants someone who is not subject to being characterized by the right wing and therefore vulnerable to defeat by mr. trump. don't underestimate him, he said of the president."}
{"original": "people are going to want to see how the person can match up to trump, said mike vlacich, a new hampshire democratic strategist who managed hillary clinton's campaign in the state. voters are going to try to visualize this person on a debate stage with trump and on social media and ask, does this person have what it takes?"}
{"original": "in that way, a voter is going to be a little more of a political scientist, vlacich said, and less interested in sending messages or proving points, but making sure we have what it takes to win the white house back."}
{"original": "who that candidate will be is anyone's guess at this point. and voters had varying views about how to beat trump, whether it be through character and policy contrasts, inspiration and passion, or adopting the incumbent's own tactics. but the sentiment is driving interest and attendance at political events at this early stage in the cycle. and the prospect of taking mr. trump on is attracting what is expected to be the largest democratic field in two decades."}
{"original": "for the last generation, [when] there has been such an overwhelming presence of individuals on the democratic side, a lot of democrats didn't see a path to victory, said new hampshire democratic party chairman ray buckley. donald trump has convinced every single person on every street corner in america that they could do a better job as president."}
{"original": "massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, former housing and urban development secretary julian castro, and former maryland rep. john delaney are the only candidates who have so far made official moves towards presidential bids. but several others are at least seriously considering bids, including a number of incumbent senators, former mayors, businessmen, and a former vice president."}
{"original": "electability, though, is difficult to measure, particularly at this stage in the cycle. and perceived electability doesn't always equal success, as the 2016 election most recently demonstrated to democrats. but the reaction among democratic voters to the current president is so viscerally negative that it has become a unifying force in the party."}
{"original": "some democrats are concerned about the official party operation getting too involved in picking who is the most electable. and the democratic national committee is making an effort to be as inclusive as possible, as evidenced by their debate schedule and overall strategy. activists, too, acknowledge the concern about letting the perfect be the enemy of the good."}
{"original": "there's definitely a pragmatic streak. we're not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater, said neil sroka, spokesman for the progressive activist group democracy for america. no doubt defeating donald trump is the priority. but we have to be more than a party standing against donald trump. we have to stand for something."}
{"original": "in her stops through iowa over the weekend, warren did not mention mr. trump by name. instead, she aimed to introduce herself to voters as a fighter for the middle class and for a fairer economic playing field. one voter asked why she gave mr. trump fodder to be a bully by releasing a dna test, a signal that some may not like a candidate who plays the president's game. others thought the approach showed a certain toughness, or didn't matter much to them at all."}
{"original": "warren has shown a propensity for sparring with mr. trump, particularly through his preferred medium of twitter. but in iowa, she made a point not to make the trip about him. she did, however, try to pitch herself as having a broader appeal beyond her current fan base."}
{"original": "we gotta stay focused on what matters to us. and what matters to us is that everybody gets a fighting chance, warren said. you don't have to persuade people ... democrats, republicans and independents get it."}
{"original": "washington — a prestigious scientific panel is recommending that states significantly lower their drunken driving thresholds as part of a blueprint to eliminate the entirely preventable 10,000 alcohol-impaired driving deaths in the united states each year."}
{"original": "the u.s. government-commissioned, 489-page report by a panel of the national academies of sciences, engineering and medicine released wednesday throws the weight of the scientific body behind lowering the blood-alcohol concentration threshold from 0.08 to 0.05. all states have 0.08 thresholds. a utah law passed last year that lowers the state's threshold to 0.05 doesn't go into effect until dec. 30."}
{"original": "the amount of alcohol required to reach 0.05 would depend on several factors, including the person's size and whether the person has recently eaten. a 150-pound man might be over the 0.05 limit after two beers, while a 120-pound woman could exceed it after a single drink, according to the american beverage institute, a national restaurant group."}
{"original": "the panel also recommended that states significantly increase alcohol taxes and make alcohol less conveniently available, including reducing the hours and days alcohol is sold in stores, bars and restaurants. research suggests a doubling of alcohol taxes could lead to an 11 percent reduction in traffic crash deaths, the report said."}
{"original": "it also calls for cracking down on sales to people under 21 or who are already intoxicated to discourage binge drinking, and putting limits on alcohol marketing while funding anti-alcohol campaigns similar to those against smoking."}
{"original": "all the proposals are likely to draw fierce opposition from the alcohol and restaurant industries. the beverage institute took out full-page newspaper ads opposing utah's new law that featured a fake mugshot under a large headline reading, utah: come for vacation, leave on probation."}
{"original": "the recommendations in the academies' report would do nothing to deter repeat offenders and high bac drivers, who represent the vast majority of alcohol-impaired driving deaths, the distilled spirits council said in a statement. the council said it also doesn't support the report's recommendations for tax increases and advertising bans, which will have little or no impact on traffic safety."}
{"original": "the report points out that alcohol-impaired driving remains the deadliest and costliest danger on u.s. roads, accounting for 28 percent of traffic deaths. each day, 29 people in the u.s. die in alcohol-related crashes and many more are injured. forty percent of those killed are people other than the drunken driver."}
{"original": "rural areas are disproportionately affected. in 2015, 48 percent of drunken driving fatalities occurred in rural areas."}
{"original": "the report says many strategies have been effective to prevent drunken driving, but a coordinated multilevel approach across multiple sectors will be required to accelerate change."}
{"original": "the problem isn't intractable, the report said."}
{"original": "from the early 1980s to the early 2000s, there was significant progress as the result of an increase in the drinking age to 21, decreases in the blood-alcohol threshold, and other measures, the report said. but since then, progress has stagnated and recently has begun to reverse."}
{"original": "action to address drunken driving can't wait for the advent of self-driving cars immune to the lures of a cold beer or a fine wine — it will take too long for autonomous vehicles to replace all the human-driven machines on the road, said the panel's chairman, steven teutsch, a senior fellow for health policy and economics at the university of southern california in los angeles."}
{"original": "in the meantime, we have 10,000 people a year dying and we ought to do something about it, he said."}
{"original": "the report cites studies that show the united states lags behind other high-income countries in preventing drunken driving fatalities. more than 100 countries have adopted the 0.05 threshold lower. in europe, the share of traffic deaths attributable to drunken driving was reduced by more than half within 10 years after the standard was dropped, the national transportation safety board said in 2013. the safety board has also recommended the 0.05 threshold."}
{"original": "alcoholic beverages have changed significantly over the past 25 years. they are more affordable, of far greater variety, and more widely advertised and promoted than in earlier periods, the report said. the lack of consistency in serving sizes and the combination of alcohol with caffeine and energy drinks make it harder for drinkers to estimate their level of impairment."}
{"original": "the report was commissioned by the national highway traffic safety administration, which asked the academies to determine which strategies for reducing drunken driving have been proven effective."}
{"original": "president-elect joe biden has chosen rohit chopra to be the director of the consumer financial protection bureau, tapping a progressive ally of sen. elizabeth warren to helm the agency whose creation she championed. the pick comes as democrats eye ways to provide student loan relief to millions of americans as part of a covid-19 relief package."}
{"original": "chopra, now a commissioner at the federal trade commission, helped launch the consumer agency after the 2008-09 financial crisis and served as deputy director, where he sounded the alarm about skyrocketing levels of student loan debt. chopra previously served as assistant director of the cfpb, where he led the agency's efforts on student loans. he also served as a special advisor at the u.s. department of education."}
{"original": "in these roles, chopra led efforts to spur competition in the student loan financing market, develop new tools for students and secure hundreds of millions of dollars in refunds for borrowers victimized by unlawful conduct by loan servicers, debt collectors, and for-profit college chains."}
{"original": "biden announced the move monday, along with his intent to nominate gary gensler, a former chairman of the commodity futures trading commission, as the next chair of the securities and exchange commission. gensler, a former goldman sachs banker, tightened oversight of the complex financial transactions that helped cause the great recession."}
{"original": "biden's choice of an expert with experience as a strong markets regulator during the financial crisis to lead the sec signals a goal of turning the wall street watchdog agency toward an activist role after a deregulatory stretch during the trump administration."}
{"original": "consumer advocates praised the selections of gensler and chopra."}
{"original": "gary gensler wasn't afraid to take on wall street as chair of the u.s. commodity futures trading commission and will return the sec to an agency that both protects small investors from risky practices and protects the financial system from dangerous actors, ed mierzwinski, senior director for federal consumer programs at consumer advocacy group u.s. pirg, said in a statement."}
{"original": "gensler, now a professor of economics and management at mit's sloan school of management, was an assistant treasury secretary in the clinton administration and later headed the cftc during barack obama's term."}
{"original": "gensler was senior adviser to u.s. senator paul sarbanes in writing the sarbanes-oxley act and was under secretary of the treasury for domestic finance from 1999 to 2001 and assistant secretary of the treasury for financial markets from 1997 to 1999. with a background of having worked for nearly 20 years at wall street powerhouse goldman sachs, gensler surprised many by being a tough regulator of big banks as cftc chairman."}
{"original": "fluent in the nexus between politics and economic policy, gensler was chief financial officer for hillary clinton's 2016 presidential campaign against donald trump and an economic adviser to obama in his 2008 presidential bid."}
{"original": "gensler has been a leader and adviser of biden's transition team responsible for the federal reserve, banking issues and securities regulation."}
{"original": "jay clayton, a former wall street lawyer who headed the sec during the trump administration, presided over a deregulatory push to soften rules affecting wall street and the financial markets, as trump pledged when he took office. rules that under the dodd-frank law tightened the reins on banks and wall street in the wake of the financial crisis and the great recession were nipped in."}
{"original": "gensler will tip the sec away from making it easy for companies to raise money and toward protecting unsophisticated investors, said erik gordon, an assistant professor of business at the university of michigan. his history in the obama administration leaves him few friends on the republican side — and he probably doesn't care."}
{"original": "the senior republican on the house financial services committee, rep. patrick mchenry of north carolina, said gensler's receptiveness to new financial technologies and cryptocurrency are positive. but he added, i fear democrats want to steer the (sec) away from bipartisan common ground in an attempt to achieve their most partisan goals."}
{"original": "sen. sherrod brown of ohio, the senior democrat on the senate banking committee who is set to become its chairman, said gensler's record as a regulator demonstrates that he will hold bad actors accountable and put the interests of working families first."}
{"original": "brown said chopra will return the cfpb to its central mission of protecting consumers and also will ensure the agency plays a leading role in combating racial inequities in our financial system."}
{"original": "the cfpb was created at warren's behest as an independent agency by the dodd-frank law. its director was given broad latitude to act alone, without winning agreement from members of an agency board."}
{"original": "while it enforces consumer-protection laws, the cfpb also gained powers to scrutinize the practices of virtually any business selling financial products and services: credit card companies, payday lenders, mortgage servicers, debt collectors, for-profit colleges, auto lenders, money-transfer agents."}
{"original": "the cfpb became a keen target of conservative republicans. trump named then-white house budget director mick mulvaney as acting director of the cfpb when cordray left in november 2017."}
{"original": "mulvaney had been a vocal critic of the consumer agency and made deep changes to it, softening regulations on payday loans, for example, and pulling back on enforcement efforts. the agency has been led by trump appointee kathy kraninger since december 2018."}
{"original": "as one of two democratic commissioners on the five-member federal trade commission, chopra has been an outspoken critic of practices by big companies, especially tech giant facebook. he has lodged strong dissents on ftc actions against the company for privacy violations and alleged anti-competitive conduct, saying they didn't go far enough."}
{"original": "rohit chopra has the ideal background for hitting the ground running at the cfpb, mike litt, consumer program advocate with the u.s. pirg education fund, said in a statement. in his government service, he has used all policy levers available to protect consumers from corporate wrongdoers. we couldn't be happier with his selection to restore the cfpb after three years of disastrous leadership."}

{"original": "anthony salvanto: good morning, margaret. big keys for him. first of all, overwhelming support from black voters. that was key and they make up most of the electorate in south carolina. that was really helped by an endorsement from representative jim clyburn, the most influential african-american politician in the state, more saying that was important than not. and then, finally, big support among those looking for electability that somebody they feel can go on to beat donald trump in november. the question now, margaret, is can joe biden parlay that argument into super tuesday?"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: and we'll get details and forecasts from you on super tuesday ahead, anthony."}

{"original": "margaret brennan: is this now a two-man race?"}
{"original": "senator bernie sanders: well, all i can say is we have won the popular vote in iowa. we won the new hampshire primary. we won the nevada caucus. we lost last night. we're looking forward to super tuesday. i think we got a great chance to win in california, in texas, in massachusetts, and a number of states around the country."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: south carolina is the first southern state. does that indicate anything to you about your prospects in places like virginia and-- and north carolina? will joe biden really challenge you there?"}
{"original": "senator bernie sanders: well, we're going to see. i mean i think based on the polling, we're doing pretty well in virginia. i think we got a shot in north carolina. all i can say is the issues that we are talking about and that is health care as a human right, raising the minimum wage to a living wage, dealing forcefully with the existential threat of climate change. those are ideas, margaret, that i think are resonating all across this country. i think we have an excellent chance to do well on tuesday and to win the democratic nomination."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: joe biden is blanketing the airwaves this morning. we know from your campaign that you raised forty-six million dollars in february. that's a significant number. what do you think that does for you going into super tuesday? what edge?"}
{"original": "senator bernie sanders: well, margaret, it is not only-- it is not only the amount of money that we raised, and that is a phenomenal amount, it's how we raised it. we don't have a super pac like joe biden. i don't go to rich people's homes like joe biden. i think joe has contributions from more than forty billionaires. what we have done is receive more campaign contributions from more americans than any candidate in the history of the united states, averaging eighteen dollars and fifty cents. this is a campaign of working people and by working people. and i'm extraordinarily proud of that. but we have enough money now not only to take us through super tuesday, but take us through the entire process fueled by the contributions of working-class people all across this country."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: your campaign said that if you are the nominee, you won't accept the financial help that michael bloomberg has offered. he said he'd extend it to any party nominee. do you really want to turn down his bankroll?"}
{"original": "senator bernie sanders: well, look, mister bloomberg is free to do anything he can with his sixty billion dollars and that's legal. all i can say is at this point we are confident that we can receive the kind of campaign funding that we need from working-class and middle-class people, that we don't have to be beholden to any powerful special interests. look, one of the things that upsets people--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: so you would accept it?"}
{"original": "senator bernie sanders: --whether conservative or progressive, is-- i didn't say that. what i would say--"}
{"original": "senator bernie sanders: --is that he has the right to do anything he wants. right now, we are confident, margaret, based on the fundraising that we are doing, is that we can beat trump."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: but you are a democratic socialist. you have never officially entered the democratic party. in fact, you constantly criticize democratic establishment. so, how can you convince the country that you are the best candidate to unify democrats and challenge president trump?"}
{"original": "senator bernie sanders: well, two points. i am a member of the democratic leadership. i have been in the democratic caucus from my, you know, virtually my first day back in congress thirty years ago and from-- in the state of vermont, where i live, i am supported by democrats that have won the democratic primary. but we will win because we have an agenda that speaks to independents, to democrats, and to more than a few republicans. look, we are living at a time when the american people are sick and tired of the kind of income and wealth inequality that exists in america. all over this country, margaret, and i have been all over this country, you got millions of people who work eleven, twelve bucks an hour. they can't afford childcare."}
{"original": "senator bernie sanders: they can't afford health care. they are scared to death about their retirement. they want a government that represents them, not just billionaire campaign contributors. that's how you win. you put together that coalition, multi-generational, multi-racial. that is what we're doing. no campaign out there has a stronger grassroots movement than we do. that's how you beat trump. and, by the way, almost all of the national polls out there, you know, i've had last seventy polls, sixty-five of them, i think, have us beating trump."}
{"original": "senator bernie sanders: we're beating them in battleground states like pennsylvania, wisconsin, and michigan. we can beat trump."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: you have rallies planned out in california. there is very much a concern about the spread of the coronavirus on the west coast. is it safe for you? have you spoken to any government officials about whether people can really appear at your rally and not worry about their own health?"}
{"original": "senator bernie sanders: well, actually, we have. i mean that's a very fair question. and my campaign has spoken to public health officials on that issue. and right now, we are planning to do rallies not only in california, but in utah, minnesota, and other states around the country."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: you've been sparring with the pro-israel lobby known as aipac. you said it gives a platform for bigotry, which was seen as a swipe at prime minister netanyahu. today, israel's ambassador to the u.n. says of you that you're not welcome in that country and anyone who calls our prime minister a racist is either a liar, an ignorant fool, or both. do you see a political cost in taking on the pro-israel lobby in this way?"}
{"original": "senator bernie sanders: yeah, i do. i mean they have a lot of money. they have a lot of power. look, i'm jewish and i'm very proud of my jewish heritage. as a kid i spent time in israel. i am not in-- anti-israel. i will do everything i can to protect the independence and the security and the freedom of the israeli people. but what we need in this country is a foreign policy that not only protects israel but deals with the suffering of the palestinian people as well. you got seventy percent youth unemployment in gaza. people can't even leave that district, that area, major, major crises. it is not sustainable that we-- continued conflict in the middle east until the united states develops an even-handed policy."}
{"original": "senator bernie sanders: so, i am pro-israel; i am pro-palestinian. i want to bring people together to finally achieve peace in that region."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: i want to ask you on foreign policy. the president just authorized a deal with the taliban. what do you think of that? because if you're commander in chief, you'd either follow through with it or halt the withdrawal of u.s. troops."}
{"original": "senator bernie sanders: well, i don't have enough details and the-- and that peace agreement, needless to say, is going to have to go through the afghan government. we don't know what's going to happen. one of the difficulties, to be very honest, margaret, in dealing with trump, it is very hard to believe anything that he says, whether it's the coronavirus, whether what's going on in afghanistan. but it is my view that the united states and i-- i speak of somebody help lead the opposition to getting us into the war in iraq. it is my view that we got to end endless wars, that when we have five hundred thousand people in america sleeping out on the street and people can't afford health care--"}

{"original": "alex azar (secretary of health and human services/@secazar): glad to be here. thank you for having me."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: so we just had the first american death on u.s. soil out in washington state. what do we know about how the virus was contracted and how much it has spread?"}
{"original": "alex azar: so this individual and we just want to express our sympathy, certainly for his family and for all who are suffering from the coronavirus, this individual was in the hospital out in calif-- out-- out in washington. we do not know how he contracted the virus, yet. and so that's why we and the state of washington are deployed out there to try to trace who he had contact with and how he might have gotten the virus. that's why we call it right now a potential community case, meaning we don't have a discernible connection to any travel to korea or china or any other impacted area."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: so, at this point, you don't know if this person came into contact with anyone. he just showed up sick at the hospital?"}
{"original": "alex azar: we have no evidence so far that establishes a connection to somebody who traveled to an impacted area. and so we do not know how he contracted the virus. that's really what we do. that's the basic blocking and tackling right now of public health is we're going to trace the people that he had contact with. we're going to trace the other cases. there is a nursing home that sends patients to this hospital. and there are cases in that nursing home. but who spread to whom? we do not know yet."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: the president yesterday when he was speaking referred to this fatality as a woman. it is a man."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: how is a mistake like that made? because people are very nervous right now and getting some of these basic facts right affects public trust."}
{"original": "alex azar: well, i understand that. it's a very fast-moving situation. our centers for disease control and prevention were up late at night, very earl-- early in the morning, working with the washington state public health office and inaccurately recorded that the individual was a female. that's what the president was briefed on. they've apologized for incorrectly briefing on that. but it's a very fast-moving situation. obviously, we regret the error."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: given that it is so fast moving, what are your projections now? how many americans do you expect to come down with this virus?"}
{"original": "alex azar: so what your viewers need to know is the risk to average americans remains low. we are working to keep it low. we will see more transmission of cases in the united states. we've got the finest public health system in the world here. this is what we do. we cannot make predictions as to how many cases we'll have but we will have more and we will have more community cases. it's simply just a matter of math."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: well, you have to have a number you're working with in order to make sure that you have adequate supply, things like testing kits, right? so--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: --how are we on shortages? you may not want to tell me the number, but you have one in your head--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: --you're using for planning."}
{"original": "alex azar: no we don't. we- we don't-- we do not use-- because it is an unknown, the epidemiological spread of this virus in a highly developed health care system that was on it with-- at the most aggressive containment measures in the history of the united states. it is unknown how that will spread. in terms of testing kits, we've already tested over thirty-six hundred people for the virus. we now have seventy-- the capability in-- out-- in the field to test seventy-five thousand people. and within the next week or two we'll have a radical expansion even beyond that of the testing that's available."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: in washington state, in places that have declared emergencies, even shutting down schools i mean they are projecting numbers themselves."}
{"original": "alex azar: they might make projections of numbers themselves, but we are not. we'll take aggressive public health measures. it's what we call community mitigation steps. so depending on the nature of the disease and depending on what we learn from these in the field investigations--"}
{"original": "alex azar: --the state and local government will take measures appropriate to contain the spread of the disease."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: so in france, they shut down the louvre museum. they're telling people, don't kiss, don't shake hands. in japan, they're closing schools for a month. canada's health minister told his people to start stockpiling food. in the u.s. there are closures, as we just said, in washington and in oregon. they've declared a state of emergency out there. and the cdc said this week, disruption to everyday life might be severe."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: what does that mean? i mean americans hear this and they are concerned. there's about a two-percent fatality rate."}
{"original": "alex azar: and i-- i appreciate that people are concerned of that, and that-- that is why we're being radically transparent about what we know and also what the full range of potential scenarios could be. and that's why we say might be, but also might not be with aggressive containment and mitigation steps. right now it's important for people to understand we're not advising any types of particular measures in the united states like travel restrictions or closures. state or local public health offices, which are the frontlines of response, might make their own decisions to do that. but, at this point, we do not have sufficient spread in the united states that would indicate those measures. but we're not taking any of them off the table. the full range of options will always remain on the table."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: in a crisis you need public trust."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: an inspector general announced this week that they are looking into this complaint by a whistleblower that your agency did not provide adequate training or equipment to those workers who went to receive and welcome back americans who had been evacuated from wuhan, china. and those workers were not tested for the virus after they had that contact. have you personally looked into these allegations?"}
{"original": "alex azar: yes, we are-- we are looking into these allegations. i am personally involved in doing so. first--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: so, can you say that this wasn't something that tipped off the spread on the west coast?"}
{"original": "alex azar: that is absolutely not the case. so, first, we take the protection of our employees very seriously. second, we want to make sure isolation and quarantine procedures are followed as appropriate. third, we appreciate the whistleblower bringing forward any concerns. we are aggressively looking into any-- if-- to see whether there's validity to the concerns. but what the american people should need to know is that we now have passed well over fourteen days since any hhs employee had contact with the individuals involved. they are not-- nobody is symptomatic. nobody has a disease. even if these allegations prove to be true, there was no spreading of the disease from this."}
{"original": "alex azar: and we have offered, even though it is not medically indicated, we have offered to test any hhs employees involved if they would like that extra piece of mind. we want to do that for our employees."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: there are cases of the coronavirus in mexico and in canada. yesterday, the president said he is considering and looking at closing the southern border."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: what will decide that? are you looking at that?"}
{"original": "alex azar: that's not one of the highest priority areas that we're looking at right now, because mexico only has a couple of cases. canada's epidemiology is similar to the united states right now. what the president's making clear, though, is we'll always be looking at travel restrictions, border protections. we will take whatever measures are appropriate and necessary to protect the american people. but we don't forecast doing that anytime soon."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: do you expect drug shortages, as some senators have highlighted concerns there could be because of disruption to the supply chain?"}
{"original": "alex azar: so, we're very concerned about the intermingling of our supply chain with china, in particular. we-- the fda has gone out and worked proactively with drug manufacturers and there are twenty drugs for which the entire molecule or a critical element of the molecule is made exclusively in china. and so we're working aggressively with the-- with the manufacturers to determine if there are any shortages. we are aware of one drug which has many, many replacements in terms of that therapeutic class available that may be in shortage for a short period of time. but--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: what drug is that?"}
{"original": "alex azar: --i'm not able to because it's commercially confidential information that's submitted voluntarily to us, i'm not able to discuss that. but this is a drug in a class where there are many, many, many alternatives available. it's a generic drug. very available."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: all right. mister secretary, thank you for your time."}
{"original": "and we will be right back with another cabinet official, secretary of state mike pompeo, so stay with us."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: yesterday, the u.s. signed a deal with the taliban that may lead to a full withdrawal of u.s. troops from afghanistan. since it began in 2001, the war has claimed the lives of more than two thousand four hundred american troops. secretary of state mike pompeo is just back from the signing ceremony in doha. he got off the plane just a short while ago. and thank you for being here, mister secretary."}
{"original": "mike pompeo (secretary of state/@secpompeo): thank you."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: so this is significant. and according to the deal that was released, the u.s. will bring down troops to eight thousand six hundred in the next hundred and thirty-five days. and then if conditions are met, a total withdrawal within fourteen months. but the president said yesterday, if bad things happen, we'll go back in. what's the benchmark there?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: yes, ma'am. this was a historic day. american blood and treasure have been expended in this place for an awfully long time. we went there after 9/11. no one still feels the anger of that day any more than i do. but it was time. and the taliban knew it was time. president trump has allowed us to take the fight to the taliban these last two years. and we have done so. it's why they, for the first time, have announced that they're prepared to break with their historic ally, al-qaida, who they've worked with much the det-- detriment of the united states of america. you can see, go read the document, the taliban have now made the break. they've said they will not permit terror to be thrust upon anyone, including the united states, from afghanistan. this is historic in that way and no one should underestimate the trump administration. you can see our work on counterterror, whether it's al-baghdadi, qassem al-rimi--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: how long will it take--"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: --the work that we did against qassem soleimani. this is a president who is committed to defending and protecting the american people. we'll do that every place we battle against terror whether that's afghanistan or any of the other dozens of places we push back each and every day."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: how long would it take to get u.s. troops out? because you're saying this is based on conditions. that means the taliban has to follow through on a few things."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: what would make the president hit the brakes and stop the withdrawal?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: look, we can't get into hypotheticals about what it would take exactly but there is a detailed set of commitments that the taliban have made about the levels of violence that can occur, the nature of what's got to take place. we are hopeful that in the coming days, there will be inter-afghan negotiations that commence as well. that has not happened before. it's going to be rocky and bumpy. no one-- no one is under any false illusion that this won't be a difficult conversation. but that conversation for the first time in almost two decades will be among the afghan people. and that's the appropriate place for that conversation to take place. we're-- we're prepared to do what it takes to ensure that we keep america safe. we've asked everyone there to reduce the levels of violence, both the afghan national--"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: --security forces and the taliban."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: but president trump said he's going to meet with the taliban in the near future. when? where? is that camp david?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: i don't know when. i don't know where. i-- i'm very confident. president trump wants to make sure that everyone in afghanistan understands that the united states is committed to making sure that this conversation take place. we have been at this for an awful long time. you recounted the loss of american life. there's a better path forward. the taliban now know this because of the work that we've done. and president trump will be actively engaged in helping us get the conditions right and beginning this journey that the first step was taken in doha yesterday."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: we're going to take a break and continue the conversation on the other side of it. please stay with us. we hope you will, too."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: secretary pompeo is here for more on ending america's longest war, and then a look at politics and super tuesday."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: welcome back to face the nation. and we are continuing our conversation with secretary of state mike pompeo, who is just back in the u.s. after signing a deal with the taliban in doha. and-- and-- just that statement alone is kind of amazing. you were the first u.s. cabinet official to ever meet with a member of the taliban. i think you actually met with one of the founding members of the taliban who is involved in this."}
{"original": "mike pompeo: i met with a senior negotiator yesterday, yes."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: you-- you called them terrorists in the past. do you still consider the taliban terrorists?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: they have an enormous amount of american blood on their hands."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: and, apparently, in a partnership still with al qaeda?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: yep, they said yesterday, signed a document. the gentleman whom i met with agreed that they would break that relationship and that they would work alongside of us to destroy, deny resources to and to have al qaeda depart from that place."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: and you trust that?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: don't trust anything. we're going to deliver. it's about actions. the agreements that set out, the conditions that set out the space. but, no, this deal doesn't depend upon trusting anyone. it has a deep, complex, well-thought out, multi-month negotiated verification complex and mechanism by which we can observe and hold every member of the agreement accountable. we'll do that. it's not about trust. it's about what happens on the ground to not only yesterday, which was an important day, but in the days that follow."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: the u.s. pledged in this agreement, which is public, as you say, that it will help to get up to five thousand taliban prisoners released. the president of afghanistan, ashraf ghani, says no way, no how. he-- nothing like that was agreed to. all of this is supposed to happen in the next ten days. did the u.s. agree to help release five thousand prisoners?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: you saw what the document says. it says, we will work with all relevant--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: so ghani-- what he is saying is wrong?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: it says that we will work with all relevant parties to build on confidence, to create confidence-building measures amongst all of the parties, the afghan government, non-taliban, and others in the afghan. we-- we want this to be an inclusive process."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: but it's a process--"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: we want-- we want women--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: --this would be a spoiler in just--"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: we want-- we want--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: --the first ten days."}
{"original": "mike pompeo: we want women to be involved. they-- there will be lots of people say things. there will be lots of noise. everyone is competing for attention and time in the media. what matters is the actions that we take, the discussions that we had. we have come a long ways and we have worked not only yesterday. while i was in doha, secretary of defense was in kabul, along with nato secretary general stoltenberg. they made a declaration. there was a commitment from the afghan government, too. we've made a lot of progress. no one is under any illusion that this will be straightforward. we've built an important base where we can begin to bring american soldiers home, reduce the risk of the loss of life of any american in afghanistan, and, hopefully, set the conditions so the afghan people can build out a peaceful resolution to their, now what for them is a forty-year struggle."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: well, putting five thousand or up to five thousand fighters back on the field is, obviously-- would have a significant impact on-- on any of the implementation, one would think. so, are-- are--"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: so, there have been-- there-- there-- there have--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: --do you expect this to actually happen?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: --there have been prisoner releases from both sides before. we have managed to figure our path forward. we'll know who these people are. we are working to build out a set of confidence measures that will do for america what president trump has committed: reduce our cost in blood and treasure and keep america safe from terrorism. i don't think any american can doubt president trump's seriousness in that."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: congresswoman liz cheney, republican, and about twenty allies--"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: who i know well."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: --who you know well, wasn't very happy with you this week, though, because she released a public letter saying that there are problems with this, that you-- you-- you are pretending that the taliban can be counterterrorism partners and saying, you know, the taliban is still allied with al qaeda and pointed out you personally when you were a member of congress--"}

{"original": "mike pompeo: there are no annexes that the members of congress won't have a chance to see--"}

{"original": "margaret brennan: --that will be shared with congress?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: the public document was released yesterday. there are two implementing elements that will be provided. they are secret. they are military implementation documents that are important to protect our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. every member of congress will get a chance to see them. they are classified, secret. there aren't any side deals. remember, the side deals i was complaining about were deals that the american side--"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: --never got to see. john kerry never got to see those side deals. this is-- this is not that. this is a fully transparent arrangement. and as for-- and as--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: so there is no deal to keep a certain u.s. military presence in afghanistan?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: and there-- the document that was made public yesterday is the complete agreement. the implementing elements of that will be available for every member of congress to see. know this. i saw what congresswoman cheney said, and i have an enormous amount of respect for her. the american people should know donald trump is not going to take words on a paper. we are going to see if the taliban are prepared to live up to the commitments they've made. the bush administration and the obama administration both tried to get the words that were on the paper yesterday that the taliban would break from al qaeda publicly. we got that. that's important. now, time will tell if they'll live up to that commitment is our expectation. they have promised us they will do so and we'll be able to see on the ground everything they do or choose not to do."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: well, it's a historic agreement."}
{"original": "mike pompeo: thank you very much, margaret."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: secretary, thank you for coming on to talk about it. we'll be right back."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: that was businessman tom steyer doing a little pre-primary dance in south carolina. he did come in third, but he had hoped to do better and he dropped out of the race last night but rest of the candidates have moved on to super tuesday, and that's this tuesday, when fourteen states will hold contests. among them california and texas. we have some new cbs news battleground tracker numbers for both of them. out in california senator bernie sanders is up with thirty-one percent support. former vice president joe biden and massachusetts senator elizabeth warren come in behind sanders with nineteen and eighteen percent, respectively. former new york city mayor michael bloomberg has twelve percent, and the rest of the field comes in at under ten percent. looking to texas, the race is tighter. bernie sanders is in the lead here with thirty percent, but joe biden close behind him with twenty-six percent and elizabeth warren comes in at seventeen-percent support. michael bloomberg is at thirteen percent, and the rest of the field comes in at six percent or less. joining us once again is cbs news elections and surveys director anthony salvanto. we want to bring in cbs news political correspondent ed o'keefe. ed, this was a big and much-needed win for joe biden in south carolina. what does this mean for him going into tuesday?"}
{"original": "ed o'keefe (cbs news political correspondent/@edokeefe): well, his team would tell you this is the momentum they need to convince any late-deciding voter who is not a fan of bernie sanders to side with them instead. their hope is that by the end of tuesday, he emerges as the clear alternative to sanders. it's pretty mathematically impossible, based on what polling is showing us right now, for somebody to surpass sanders, especially because he is going to have such a big win, it looks like, in places like california. but they are hoping, the biden team is, that in the next few days they are able to raise millions of dollars and again convince people that he is the leading alternative."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: anthony, does he have the enthusiasm that you say sanders' supporters have?"}
{"original": "anthony salvanto (cbs news elections and surveys director/@salvantocbs): well, that remains a key difference between these candidates which is that bernie sanders' supporters are the most enthusiastic of all the top candidates. that's why his numbers remain so stable. those folks turn out for him. but joe biden still has a challenge in that regard. his supporters are less enthusiastic about him. can he motivate them to turn out? i think it remains a key question. and, look, to that point, when you look at california, texas, at these big delegate hauls, the democrats give out delegates just to top finishers. and so they could very conceivably end up splitting the delegates along with some of these other candidates and then we move on into the spring."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: and there are a lot of delegates at stake here on tuesday. a thousand three hundred forty-four, it's about thirty percent of what's needed for the nomination. so, ed, how do the candidates sort of crack the threshold? explain some of the math here."}
{"original": "ed o'keefe: so there is, essentially, two numbers to look at on tuesday night. there's the perception number, who wins the state? who can say that they walked away winning the most states? but the more important number, ultimately, is the nomination number. who gets closest to getting the one thousand nine hundred ninety or ninety-one delegates you need to get over the threshold and-- and win that nomination."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: because it's not winner take all."}
{"original": "ed o'keefe: it is not. you have to hit fifteen percent in each congressional district and in the states. and so the numbers to look for are fifteen. so if you look at our california and texas numbers right now, mike bloomberg is in trouble because he is not hitting fifteen percent. this could have been a very expensive overuse of his money if he can't hit fifteen percent in those two states. but this is why, despite not winning anything so far, elizabeth warren is still in this race. because she sees that she is doing well enough in california and in texas and in a few of these other states, likely, that she can get above fifteen percent and keep a pool of delegates that keeps her in the race going into later march and april."}
{"original": "anthony salvanto: and that bloomberg number that you talk about is so critical because if he does do just well enough to pick up delegates, if he picks up delegates in some regions of these states, even if he doesn't win them, then that changes the math for everybody else. now he is a player. but if he falls just short of it, then all those delegates can go to other top candidates, to a-- to a biden or to a sanders and that changes the math going forward for them."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: ed, can four hundred million dollars in ad spending close that gap? that's a big gamble."}
{"original": "ed o'keefe: it could, potentially. look, and, tonight, he is-- he is doing something that hasn't been done in a while. he is buying three minutes of advertising on nbc and cbs to talk about the coronavirus. and trying to cast himself as somebody who is a competent manager, who could probably help solve this problem, and would have tackled it sooner than the president. he can spend as much as he wants. but if he doesn't hit fifteen percent in these states on tuesday, it will have been for naught, essentially. certainly, they believe that they can go on into florida and arizona and illinois next and-- and try to compete in later march contests. but, perhaps, the biggest loser last night in south carolina was mike bloomberg because joe biden did so well. they needed biden to stumble or to only win narrowly to help make the argument that he is the better moderate alternative."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: it couldn't have felt good for tom steyer to have spent over three hundred million-- two hundred million dollars, almost three hundred million on spending on ads."}
{"original": "ed o'keefe: it's a warning sign because south carolina was his-- was his petri dish."}
{"original": "ed o'keefe: it was his test that if he could do it there, he could do it anywhere. he couldn't."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: so, anthony and ed, there are a lot of headlines after south carolina saying this is now a two-person race but there are still a lot of people on the field. so--"}
{"original": "anthony salvanto: it remains a multicandidate race. there's no question about it. and i think part of that is you look at bernie sanders and you look at, despite that enthusiasm that he has, can he grow it? can he draw people to him? and when we ask folks, most of the people supporting sanders say they've already liked him. they've liked him for a long time. but far fewer say they've taken-- taken a second or third look at him as he's won these early states. so can he translate any success he's had into momentum going forward and build on that twenty-five, that thirty percent that he's already got? that, i think, remains a key question."}
{"original": "ed o'keefe: this will not be clean. this is going to be a messy contest. it's different than what we've seen before because we have so many candidates. we are down to seven, the magnificent seven, perhaps, who are going into tuesday. will the field shrink after tuesday? probably. but, again, if you're somebody who can hit viability, fifteen percent in a few of these states, you have no reason to get out yet."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: it makes for some exciting political watching on tuesday."}
{"original": "ed o'keefe: and very little sleep."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: a very little sleep for (indistinct)."}
{"original": "anthony salvanto: a very long night with delegates coming as we go, as we go."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: all right. well, we'll-- we'll gear up for that with both of you. thank you."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: for a closer look at how prepared we are for the coronavirus here in the u.s., we turn to former fda commissioner and physician doctor scott got-- gottlieb. good to have you here."}
{"original": "dr. scott gottlieb (former fda commissioner/@scottgottliebmd): thanks."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: you served in the trump administration. what do you think the administration is doing now that is right, wrong in its handling of the virus?"}
{"original": "dr. scott gottlieb: right. well, certainly expanding the diagnostic capability is the right move. we're going to have the capacity by the end of this week to diagnose probably ten thousand people a day or screen ten thousand people a day with the public health labs. hundred labs doing hundreds tests a day. by the end of the week after that, we'll probably bring on another ten thousand. so we'll have testing capacity of, perhaps, as much as twenty thousand a day by the end of the next two weeks. once we bring on the academic labs, that was really a critical step, bringing on those academic labs--"}
{"original": "dr. scott gottlieb: --and-- and leveraging their capacity. these are the major medical centers. what we need to do now is make a real concerted effort to get a therapeutic. we know when this started, but we don't know when this is going to end. and what's going to end it is our technology. our savior here is going to be our technology. and we need to make a really robust effort to try to develop a therapeutic."}
{"original": "dr. scott gottlieb: a treatment or a vaccine. but a-- a therapeutic-- a treatment is going to be more likely to be available in the fall. a vaccine is a much longer way off. and we always knew when that once in a generation strain came along, and this might be that strain, that what we were going to have to depend on was our science and something to stop it like a treatment or a vaccine. a treatment, again, we could have by september, october, potentially."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: but more testing means more positive results. i mean you're saying, basically, expect the number of those who've been diagnosed with the virus to also increase?"}
{"original": "dr. scott gottlieb: it's going to increase. this-- right now, there's probably hundreds or low thousands of cases. everyone's--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: hundreds or low thousands of coronavirus cases--"}
{"original": "dr. scott gottlieb: in the u.s.--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: --in the u.s. that aren't reported?"}
{"original": "dr. scott gottlieb: --that aren't reported yet. it's a big country three-- three hundred and forty million people, three hundred and thirty million people, so anyone's individual risk is-- is still very low. but we need to get those cases diagnosed and identified so we could start getting people quarantined and into treatment and prevent more spread. we need to start mitigating the implications of the spread. there was an analysis out today by trevor bradford, very good researcher out of the hutch, looking at the genetic strains in washington state. and by looking at the strains and the drift between the different strains for the people who have been diagnosed there, he's suggested that there's perhaps hundreds and maybe low thousands of cases. it's an interesting analysis. there probably are more cases. we have community spread now in washington state, california, perhaps, illinois, oregon. so certainly hundreds of cases."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: so has the administration been slow in its response?"}
{"original": "dr. scott gottlieb: well, look, i think the decision the administration made to block the travel, which was controversial at the time, clearly, bought us time. it-- it slowed the introduction of the virus into the country. virus was probably here at that time, but it slowed additional cases. the question is what do we do with that time? i think there's some things we did that were very smart. we got the country prepared. one of the mistakes, one of the challenges was getting the diagnostic testing in place. i think what-- what we should have done and i don't want to, you know, armchair quarterback this, we relied on the cdc. we always rely on a cdc in a public health emergency. but simultaneous to that, we should have also been reaching out and trying to get the laboratory-developed tests into the game and the manufacturers, who have diagnostic capability. we've done that. you know, a couple of weeks went by and they did that. and that is now in place. and those labs are going to be coming online. so we course corrected. i think what it teaches us, if you're looking back, what is the teachable moment? it's don't take a linear approach to these crises, take an all of the above approach. and we need to do that now in a therapeutic. we-- we can't put all our eggs in the vaccine basket. we need to be looking at antibody-based prophylaxis, treatments, vaccines, and all of the above approach."}

{"original": "margaret brennan: the nih director, anthony fauci, a doctor, said that from what he's seen, if you get infected, you likely won't get reinfected. but there seems to be so much we don't know. if someone has just sort of mild or moderate symptoms, how do they last? how do you know to go and get tested?"}
{"original": "dr. scott gottlieb: that's the challenge here. you don't. you know there isn't-- the spectrum of disease here is very wide. a lot of people are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, but they shed virus and they're still infective. they can still transfer the virus and a small percentage get very sick. and so, it's probably the eighty percent that are mildly symptomatic or even asymptomatic that are the ones that are spreading it. the other thing is that people who get very sick, don't get very sick right away. the time to hospitalization in-- in different studies was nine to twelve days. so they start off with cold-like symptoms and then they progressively get more ill. and it's in that phase that people are spreading it. there was a very interesting analysis in the new england journal of medicine about two weeks ago that looked at viral load and viral shedding--"}
{"original": "dr. scott gottlieb: --across a spectrum of disease. and the people who are mildly symptomatic shed as much virus as the people who are very sick and that's atypical. typically, the amount of virus you have and shed to-- in-- in some diseases comports with how much-- how much of virus you have."}

{"original": "michael crowley: well, that's a big question. you know, president trump was getting close to nominating congressman ratcliffe back in the summer, and met so much resistance from senior republicans in congress who said this man is not qualified. he's only been on the intelligence committee for a year, may have inflated his resume, and is much more partisan around the people who've held that job. the president pulled back and didn't do it. the question is now has ratcliffe changed any minds? there's not a lot of evidence to that, but there may be a little bit of a game going on here because the president has installed richard grenell, his ambassador to germany, in that job, in an acting basis and because of complicated things that have to do with the-- the-- how long acting directors can serve. by nominating a new person, even if president trump doesn't think ratcliffe can get confirmed, that allows rick grenell to stay in that job for a longer amount of time. there's another theory that rick grenell is even more unpalatable to people in congress than ratcliffe. so ratcliffe may be the more acceptable alternative. so there's a lot going on here and people are trying to figure out what's real and what isn't."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: well, i bring that up first because it gets to some of what we have been talking about today in terms of confidence in professionals versus political choices made for political reasons, and-- and confidence in-- in hard fact and in intelligence. ed, i know you've been following, as you always do, you lived in china for so long, and you followed the origins of this outbreak of corona, when you heard the administration this week change its language so many times in describing and characterizing response, what did you make of that? and what do you make of what is actually known in terms of what china is sharing with the u.s.?"}

{"original": "president-elect joe biden will extend the nearly year-long pause on federal student loan payments on day one, the first concrete promise the incoming administration has made to tackle the $1.6 trillion debt crisis."}
{"original": "biden transition official david kamin told reporters friday that alleviating the crushing financial burden of student debt would be an immediate priority for the incoming administration as part of its commitment to get our economy moving and keep americans afloat. that includes directing the department of education on day one to extend the popular student loan forbearance program, as well as expanding income based repayment programs, and fixing and expanding loan forgiveness programs for those with public service jobs."}
{"original": "but how exactly the incoming administration will handle student loan forgiveness for other borrowers remains unclear. in the call with reporters, the transition official said biden supports congress immediately canceling $10,000 of federal student loan debt per person as a response to the covid crisis but didn't offer details or a specific time frame."}
{"original": "student loan debt has been a looming financial issue since before the pandemic, but widespread coronavirus-related job losses and pay cuts, especially among millennials, have exacerbated the issue. last year student loan debt reached an all-time high, nearing $1.6 trillion among more than 40 million americans, according to the federal reserve bank of new york. on average, student loan borrowers owe between $200 and $299 every month, an amount that for many is simply untenable; about one in every five borrowers are in default, according to the u.s. department of education."}
{"original": "democrats are split on how to address the crisis. originally a fringe idea, the concept of student loan cancellation has gained traction among more progressive pockets of the party. during the 2020 presidential primaries, senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts proposed forgiving up to $50,000 in debt and independent senator bernie sanders of vermont called for cancelling all student loans. in a more moderate approach, mr. biden has expressed his support for congressional legislation that would cancel $10,000 per borrower."}
{"original": "no matter the specifics of mr. biden's plan, the approach will likely be an about-face from the current administration's stance. in a letter early last week, now-former u.s. department of education secretary betsy devos urged congress to reject calls to forgive student loan debt, calling the policy proposals misguided and unfair to most americans."}
{"original": "since march, all federal student loan payments have been suspended as part of the federal government's covid-19 response. an extension of the grace period was included in early drafts of december's stimulus package, but was cut in final negotiations. student loan payments are currently scheduled to resume at the end of this month. the transition team did not indicate how long a new extension could last."}
{"original": "a pew study from november found that nearly 6 in 10 borrowers said it would be somewhat or very difficult to restart payments on their loans the next month."}
{"original": "when student loan payments do resume, the department of education doesn't expect a smooth transition. in its 2020 annual report, the department said it expects loan servicers and the federal government will face a heavy burden in 'converting' millions of borrowers to active repayment. some of those borrowers, the report warns, will become delinquent."}

{"original": "the announcement is part of a broader movement to undo criminal justice policies that have meted out exceptionally long sentences for drug offenders, caused prison populations to balloon and, advocates say, created unnecessary barriers for ex-convicts looking to rebuild their lives. it amplifies an ongoing justice department push to rethink harsh drug sentences and to ensure alternatives to prison for certain nonviolent defendants, an effort known as smart on crime."}
{"original": "the long-term impact of a criminal record prevents many people from obtaining employment, housing, higher education and credit -- and these barriers affect returning individuals even if they have turned their lives around and are unlikely to reoffend, the department said in a seven-page policy statement titled roadmap to re-entry."}
{"original": "lynch made the announcement in philadelphia on monday at the start of national re-entry week."}
{"original": "the issue of felons' rights has attracted growing attention at the state and federal levels in recent years. last week, virginia gov. terry mcauliffe issued an executive order that would allow more than 200,000 convicted felons to cast ballots in november, calling voting rights the essence of our democracy."}

{"original": "the practical impact is to standardize varied state laws about identification."}
{"original": "but even more important is the message that such a program would send to returning citizens: that they are welcome back into society; that their government is invested in their success; and that they can now - quite literally - exchange their old identity as a federal inmate for a fresh start, lynch said in philadelphia, where she was joined by housing and urban development secretary julian castro."}
{"original": "separately, lynch announced a series of actions taken by the federal bureau of prisons, which houses nearly 200,000 prisoners, to help convicts better acclimate to society. roughly 600,000 state and federal prisoners return to their communities each year, the justice department said."}

{"original": "the fear of running out of money in retirement is widespread -- and understandable. but it may also be pushing retirees to hoard their hard-earned savings more than is warranted. and that means they may be shortchanging themselves when it comes to funding their living expenses in retirement."}
{"original": "these are among the many findings in a recent report issued by the employee benefit research institute (ebri)."}
{"original": "ebri analyzed the assets and spending statistics for retirees in the first 20 years of their retirement, using data from the respected health and retirement study (hrs) and consumption and activities mail survey (cams). they found that in general, retirees are spending down their assets quite slowly. for example:"}
{"original": "for retirees with less than $200,000 in non-housing assets immediately before retirement, the median had spent down about one-quarter of their assets after 18 years."}
{"original": "for those with between $200,000 and $500,000, the median had spent down a little more than one-quarter of their assets over 18 years."}
{"original": "for those with at least $500,000, the median had spent down just 11.8 percent within the first 20 years of retirement."}
{"original": "about one-third of all sampled retirees had increased their assets over the first 18 years of retirement."}
{"original": "ebri also found that retirees with pension income were much less likely to have spent down their assets than non-pensioners. during the first 18 years of retirement, the median non-housing assets of pensioners had dropped by just 4 percent, compared to 34 percent for non-pensioners. one possible explanation is that pensioners had started with higher retirement savings than non-pensioners."}
{"original": "also, the majority of retirees avoided drawing down their assets by limiting spending to their flow of regular income from sources such as social security, pensions and annuities. this is another possible explanation for why pensioners are drawing down assets at a slower rate than non-pensioners"}
{"original": "in additions, the ebri report discussed the possible reasons retirees are hesitant to spend down their savings:"}
{"original": "they're uncertain about how long their money might need to last, so they're cautious with it in case they live a long time."}
{"original": "retirees might be worried that they'll incur high expenses for medical care or long-term care at the end of their lives."}
{"original": "they might want to preserve assets for bequests."}
{"original": "retirees might not be aware of strategies that allow higher spending yet still preserve a level of assets, so they err on the side of caution."}
{"original": "many retirees might find it difficult to shift their mindset from accumulating savings to spending them down."}
{"original": "indeed, these are all valid reasons for retirees to be cautious with their spending. ebri's findings that retirees appear to be frugal with their spending are consistent with an earlier report prepared by the advisory firm united income."}
{"original": "the ebri report is also careful to point out that some retirees are running out of money in retirement. for example, of those who started with less than $200,000 in savings, about one-third have less than 20 percent of their assets remaining after 17 to 18 years of retirement."}
{"original": "what are some possible lessons new retirees and older workers who are approaching their retirement years can take from ebri's study results? here are a few:"}
{"original": "older workers and retirees who adopt one or more of these strategies might feel comfortable spending more in retirement to enjoy their lives. financing a 20- to 30-year retirement isn't easy, so it only makes sense to spend some time researching and adopting smart strategies."}
{"original": "st. petersburg, fla. - when three florida teenagers stole a car, crashed it into a cemetery pond and then drowned, pinellas county sheriff bob gualtieri talked about his frustration, about lives needlessly lost, and how the vehicle became a death chamber for the three girls."}
{"original": "now, nearly a month after the tragedy, gualtieri is angrily defending his agency against accusations that his officers didn't do enough to rescue the girls as the car sank in 15 feet of water. bloggers, some tv stations and comedian d.l. hughley have posted about the march 30 incident that claimed the lives of two 15-year-olds and a 16-year-old from st. petersburg."}
{"original": "police caught on tape watching girls die. they didn't even try to help. just watched. sickening, hughley wrote friday morning on facebook. his post had more than 5,000 reactions and 7,000 shares."}
{"original": "the posted dashcam video, which gualtieri said was a misleadingly edited version of the original, shows the scene and includes audio of some of the officers. one deputy comments that he thinks he hears screams coming from the car and another says, they are done. they are sig-7 dude. signal 7 is law enforcement code to indicate a fatality. commenters on facebook widely criticized the deputies for not going into the water and trying to save the people inside the sinking car."}
{"original": "later friday, gualtieri posted a different dashcam video from a second cruiser on the department's facebook page showing two officers walking by with clothes in hand. gualtieri said that deputies waded into the water and tried to save the girls - and that the video proves it."}
{"original": "unfortunately, there's a false narrative that's being spread by people on social media, he said. we're unfortunately in a society today that if it's not on video, then it didn't happen."}
{"original": "cbs affiliate wtsp in tampa reports there are some troubling inconsistencies with the story. one of them is, due to a technical issue, it's nearly impossible to match up the deputies time stamps on their dash-cam video. that's because the time is actually set by each deputy manually when they turn their vehicles on."}
{"original": "on one of many videos reviewed by the associated press on friday, a camera captures a police cruiser driving to the pond, behind several other police cars. it parks, and then eight minutes later, a deputy in a black shirt walks in front of the camera, holding clothing in his hand. seconds later, another deputy, in a tank top and holding a uniform, walks in front of the cruiser."}
{"original": "officials say those two deputies attempted to enter the water but retreated due to safety concerns."}
{"original": "the vehicle began listing forward, at which point, i took off my duty belt and attempted to swim out to the vehicle, wrote deputy logan tromer, who is also on the sheriff's office dive team but who happened to be working the night shift. i made it approximately 10-15 yards out; however, at this point the vehicle was facing front bumper down and was completely submerged within seconds. due to the unknown depth, thick vegetation and officer safety concerns, i had no choice but to exit the water and suspend my rescue efforts."}
{"original": "according to deputies, dominique battle, 16, ashaunti butler, 15, and laniya miller, 15, drowned after they stole a gold honda accord from a pinellas county walmart parking lot. though the county sheriff's rules forbid deputies from chasing stolen vehicles, some officers were trailing the car when the car plunged into a pond off a sharp turn in the road around 4 a.m. the next morning."}

{"original": "new surveillance footage might give investigators fresh clues into the disappearance of two idaho kids. the video appears to show their mother, lori vallow, at a storage facility near their home shortly after 7-year-old jj and 17-year-old tylee ryan were last seen in september."}
{"original": "investigators went through a storage unit where they found bikes, photos and a backpack with jj's initials, according to cbs news' jonathan vigliotti who reported from inside the rexburg, idaho facility."}
{"original": "it was disturbing to see that it was the children's belongings that were in that storage unit, private investigator rich robertson said. robertson had been working on the case with jj's grandparents, kay and larry woodcock."}
{"original": "the video shows vallow and a man visiting the storage unit on multiple occasions after the children went missing in fall 2019. at one point, a man is seen carrying a heavy tote bag."}
{"original": "if they had expected the kids to be coming home soon, why would that stuff be in a storage? on the other hand, if they didn't think the kids were ever coming back, why keep it? robertson asked. vallow and daybell have both denied any wrongdoing in the case."}
{"original": "kay woodcock attended a press conference last week after vallow ignored a court order to produce the two kids. on wednesday, the woodcocks filed a petition to obtain guardianship of jj."}
{"original": "meanwhile vallow and her husband, chad daybell, were last seen in hawaii at the end of january after both of their former spouses, and vallow's brother, all died under what authorities call suspicious circumstances over the past eight months."}
{"original": "robertson, the private investigator working with jj's grandparents, said that one of the victims, vallow's ex-husband charles, had a $1 million life insurance policy."}
{"original": "at this point we think that lori vallow believed she was the beneficiary, he said."}
{"original": "a legal expert who spoke to cbs news said that a lack of evidence could be why vallow has not yet been arrested. a contempt charge for failing to produce the children as the court ordered could be a possibility, though it is likely insufficient to compel her back to idaho."}
{"original": "the senate on friday overrode president trump's veto of the national defense authorization act, the $740 billion defense policy bill. this veto, in the waning days of mr. trump's presidency, marked the first time congress has voted to override him."}
{"original": "the final vote tally was 81 to 13, with a two-thirds vote required to overturn the veto. the bill had previously passed in the senate 84-13 earlier this month, and the house has already voted to override mr. trump's veto."}
{"original": "mr. trump tweeted after the vote that senate republicans had missed a big opportunity to get rid of section 230, one of the portions of the bill he had objected to. mr. trump wanted to repeal the social media liability shield, but several members of congress, including some republicans, argued that the repeal of section 230 of the communications decency act was not relevant to national security."}
{"original": "mr. trump also vetoed the ndaa because of a provision on renaming bases honoring confederate officials."}
{"original": "senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has tied a vote on repealing section 230 to a bill which would increase direct payments to americans from $600 to $2,000. mcconnell has repeatedly expressed his opposition to increasing direct payments, which is supported by mr. trump and some republicans, and so tied it to a repeal of section 230 knowing that adding a controversial rider would prevent its passage."}
{"original": "mr. trump has vetoed nine bills during his presidency, but none have been overridden. if successful, this will be the first time one of his vetoes will be overturned. the ndaa is a critical defense bill that has passed every year for decades, so overriding the veto will not necessarily be a controversial vote for republicans."}
{"original": "congressional republicans are mostly still in lockstep with the president, with some refusing to acknowledge president-elect joe biden's victory. several house republicans and at least one senator, gop senator josh hawley, are expected to challenge the results of the election when congress convenes to tally electoral college votes on january 6."}

{"original": "the two governments express interest in a settlement but give no indication their stances have shifted."}

{"original": "stay-at-home orders issued across the u.s. have made it a challenging time to run a political campaign. and it's even more difficult to ask voters —and supporters — for cash to help fuel these operations. in three weeks, more than 16 million u.s. workers filed for unemployment benefits as efforts to stop the spread of coronavirus shut down businesses across the country. with so many people suffering economic devastation because of the novel coronavirus and uncertain of what the future holds, candidates are faced with a conundrum."}
{"original": "how do you ask someone to give money to a campaign right now, wondered charleston county democratic party chair colleen condon. i don't know how you do it. i don't know how anybody does it."}
{"original": "it's a question that candidates and supporting organizations are grappling with across the nation. many struggle with asking for cash even in the best of times, but for better or for worse, money is still what fuels a campaign, so now, it's about striking a delicate balance."}
{"original": "on fundraising, it's definitely a huge challenge, especially for down-ballot candidates who don't have as big of a network to work with, said ianthe metzger, deputy director of campaign communications for emily's list, which supports progressive women candidates. if we do get back to normal in a few months, candidates are going to need the resources to get them over the finish line, so we're not telling them to stop fundraising, just to kind of really talk to people, she adds."}
{"original": "people are incredibly stressed. they're stressed about their job, they're stressed about are they going to bring the virus home to their kids, said dr. kayser enneking, a democrat running for a florida state house seat. this is not the time for me to call and say, 'hey, by the way you know, i know you want better government and that costs a lot of money to do.' and so, that's been really challenging because we know how political campaigns run — they run on money."}
{"original": "one republican house strategist told cbs news he expects small-dollar fundraising is going to be hardest hit by this pandemic."}
{"original": "if you're a restaurant or retail worker that's been furloughed, it's really hard to keep chipping in your $10 or $15 contribution online when you're worried about when your next paycheck is going to come, he said."}
{"original": "we're telling candidates, they're going to have to exercise some judgment on a lot of this right now, said ross morales rocketto, co-founder of run for something which focuses on recruiting progressive young candidates for down-ballot races."}
{"original": "his organization and others are encouraging candidates to continue making calls to supporters, including those who donate money. ted terry, the first vice chair for the georgia democratic party, is running for a county commission seat. he said during this pandemic, he's continued to make calls because people are continuing to donate when they can."}
{"original": "a lot of times you're calling people that you already know are...big democrats, said terry. they already care about these issues — it's just a matter of do they have money now or are they waiting till the end of the month because they just gave their discretionary fund to support the local food bank and…next month, they'll be able to support your campaign."}
{"original": "in some cases, the calls have shifted from candidates explaining their own efforts to checking in with their constituents and their well-being. if people are struggling, it's best to nix the hard ask. run for something has also suggested candidates go through their lists and ensure they're not calling health care workers or other essential personnel on the frontlines of the pandemic and those who may have been especially hard-hit by the pandemic."}
{"original": "at the same time, down-ballot campaigns that are no longer holding in-person fundraising events have turned money-raising gatherings into virtual ones. zoom happy hours have been popping up for candidates up and down the ballot. one held a movie night online and another brought donors together with online bingo. ted terry said his team is beginning to experiment with zoom fundraisers too, and in a couple weeks he plans to integrate yoga into his online fundraising. a yoga instructor has offered to conduct an online class and donate all the proceeds to his campaign."}
{"original": "we're not trying to just be like 'hey let's all get on a zoom call and just talk to each other for 30 minutes, said terry. we're trying to think outside the box."}
{"original": "even without the overt asks, donations are going up in some cases. health care professionals-turned-candidates have, for example, seen a bump in funding as more people determine they want to support people with this kind of expertise representing them in government. other candidates with health care backgrounds have become a vital resource for constituents."}
{"original": "they are texting me and they're saying, 'you know, i have a fever. do you think i need a covid test?' [or] '...should i be wearing a face mask? you know, is it okay for me to go to the grocery store?' i mean just some basic questions that they need somebody to turn to and because they know that i have a public [profile], they know how to find me and they know i'll answer it and answer it as truthfully as i can, said enneking, a university of florida anesthesiologist."}

{"original": "while enneking said fundraising is a crucial part of campaigning, she doesn't believe it's appropriate for her right now."}
{"original": "i don't want people to think that i am using this virus as a political tool to highlight the fact that i'm a doctor, said enneking. what this is about is saying 'yes, i am a doctor and i understand the science, and i understand that policy affects health outcomes, and that's why we need people that understand medicine here.'"}
{"original": "others not in the health care field but with strong views on the current system here have addressed the coronavirus in their own fundraising pitches."}
{"original": "in an email to supporters, m.j. hegar, who's running to unseat texas senator john cornyn solicited donations under the subject line, help me defend our health care. others have sent out similar pleas by text message."}
{"original": "we have to do [fundraising] with empathy and putting our values first, said andrew feldman from the national democratic training committee, which serves as a resource for democrats running at every level. connecting with potential donors with the values your campaign believes in, which are issues largely that we're seeing that if implemented would have helped this crisis… issues like affordable universal health care, sick leave. i mean, these are things that democrats have been leading on for a long time."}
{"original": "in terms of hard numbers, it's unclear what the pandemic's overall impact on campaign cash funds the pandemic will be. according to one democratic strategist, democratic house candidates started off 2020 with very strong numbers, but there was a dip towards the tail end of the quarter. there will likely be a clearer picture at the end of the second quarter. same goes for senate candidates."}
{"original": "i think the impacts of not being able to do events and doing virtual fundraising won't really hit until next quarter, said an aide on a democratic senate campaign. people have concerns about their own livelihood, so they're less inclined to donate. i'm sure we'll see that in the next quarter."}
{"original": "democratic senate races will continue to raise the resources they need, but right now they are all focused on supporting their communities, providing reliable information, and putting forward real solutions to help address this crisis, said dscc spokesperson stewart boss."}
{"original": "in a memo sent in early march, national republican congressional committee chairman tom emmer told members to be sensitive that your donors may have suffered financial losses during this pandemic. while large gatherings fundraiser may be impractical or illegal depending on your location, you can still sit down and make fundraising calls and touch base with donors asking how they are."}
{"original": "being able to come off of super tuesday with a big win, really did put some wind in our sails to get through march. obviously we wanted more wind, but you never know what happens when the whole world stops, texas house republican candidate genevieve collins told cbs news. she also pointed to delays in the passage of the stimulus package as a potential issue boosting small dollar donations. in a time where we really have to meet people at their most basic needs, to stall something...really hurts the majority of americans and is very distasteful in dallas. and people are mad about it and are quite frankly, capable of giving $25. you know they're not giving $2,800 but they're giving what they're feeling, what they're comfortable to give."}
{"original": "winred, the platform used by republican candidates to raise funds, had anticipated seeing a decrease in funding as coronavirus precautions went into effect but did not see a significant dip in the first quarter. the platform hauled in nearly $130 million for republicans over the first three months of the year."}
{"original": "meanwhile, the organization actblue which democrats use for fundraising has not released fundraising totals since the outbreak began, but it has promoted resources to help candidates and progressive organizations navigate asking for cash under the current circumstances."}
{"original": "when civilian life will be returning to some semblance of normal remains unknown. with that in mind, multiple candidates confirmed to cbs news, they're already considering options should they be forced to carry on a virtual campaigns heading into the general election."}
{"original": "batten down the hatches, hurricane season is around the corner."}
{"original": "the u.s. department of commerce's national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa) said today it expects an above-normal atlantic hurricane season this year, which extends from june to december. noaa forecast between 11 and 17 named storms, of which five to nine could actually become hurricanes with winds of 74 miles per hour or higher, and two to four of them could reach 111 miles per hour."}
{"original": "hurricane season outlooks have a tendency -- like many weather forecasters -- to be wrong. and when meteorologists do err on cyclones, they do so very publicly. when a hurricane wallops the east or gulf coast, tv cameras focus on the devastation, while announcers report that they got it wrong again."}
{"original": "this year, like any other, somebody is bound to be wrong. the colorado state university (csu) tropical meteorology project said in april that, based on cooler ocean temperatures, it expected a slightly below average season of major storms. but global weather oscillations, which boasts that it has the most accurate predictions, said that years 2017 and 2018 would be the most active and dangerous in a decade."}
{"original": "does it really matter? asked julie rochman, the head of the insurance institute for business and home safety (ibhs) in tampa, florida, the heart of hurricane country. it only takes one bad storm for you to be part of the 'hit' parade on tv saying, 'we thought it could never happen here!"}
{"original": "rochman gets her kicks deliberately blowing down houses and conducting other weird wind and water experiments so that the ibhs can see exactly how buildings and property get damaged during a storm. and she has a lot of advice for protecting yourself from the 100- or 500-year storm that just might hit this year and perhaps next year, too."}
{"original": "americans have become complacent about hurricanes in recent years, even though there have been some severe storms, such as 2016's hurricane matthew, which devastated haiti and then went on to kill 43 people in the southeast u.s."}
{"original": "but the profit motive and the desire for waterfront property is getting the better of many people as major storms like katrina and sandy begin to fade, said loretta worters, spokesperson for the insurance information institute, which represents the property-casualty insurance industry."}
{"original": "even though lately tornadoes have gotten a lot more attention than hurricanes, remember that it only takes one hurricane in a densely populated area to cause vast devastation, she said."}
{"original": "here's a sobering statistic: if a storm the size of miami's monster 1926 hurricane hit today, the damage would be at least $125 billion, or three times the cost of hurricane katrina, the worst the u.s. has suffered so far. that's because many more people are living in harm's way, added worters."}
{"original": "u.s. census bureau data shows that the population of coastal counties, which contain 14 of the nation's 20 largest metropolitan areas, grew by 84 percent from 1960 to 2008. in contrast, the population in noncoastal counties increased by only 64 percent during the same period."}
{"original": "the nine states with the highest population density are located along the east coast and the five states experiencing the biggest increase in population -- california, florida, georgia, texas and virginia -- are also situated on the coast. according to air worldwide, the insured value of property in coastal states has historically doubled each decade."}
{"original": "any victim of sandy or katrina will tell you that flooding is the worst part of the storm. and it's only likely to get worse if, as the new york times just pointed out, an antarctica meltdown raises sea levels by as much as six feet."}
{"original": "flood damage is excluded under standard homeowners' and renters' policies, but it's available as a separate policy from the national flood insurance program (nfip). it's also sold as excess coverage from a few private insurers that provide policies for high-value homes and businesses worth more than $250,000."}
{"original": "but despite warnings from insurers and the media, an iii poll conducted in 2016 showed that only 12 percent of american homeowners had flood insurance, compared to the 14 percent that had this coverage in 2015. even though, according to the nfip, during the term of a 30-year mortgage, a property owner is 26 times more likely to suffer flood damage than fire dam­age."}
{"original": "a homeowners' policy doesn't necessarily protect you against all the wind damage from a hurricane, either. homeowners should be aware that they may have a hurricane or windstorm deductible, said the iii's worters. a homeowner could be responsible for anywhere from 1 percent to 5 percent of the loss, though in areas where homes are close to the coast that deductible could be as high as 10 percent."}
{"original": "more and more companies are indicating the actual dollar amount you'll be responsible for rather than the percentage to make it less confusing for homeowners, said worters. for example, if you have a 1 percent deductible and your home is worth $200,000, you would be responsible for $2,000. but if you're a beachfront resident with a 10 percent deductible and your home is worth $1 million, the first $100,000 in wind losses is on you."}
{"original": "is there any good news? hurricanes come with built-in warning periods, said the ibhs's rochman. you get time to prepare. and here are her suggestions for doing so:"}

{"original": "no further discharge restrictions have been made as of thursday, an orr spokesperson said. the agency had previously stopped placing minors in shelters and programs in california, new york and washington. in addition to the three confirmed cases, orr has tested 15 other children in its custody as of thursday. eleven results came back negative and the rest are pending. the agency is consulting with local health authorities in new york to determine next steps."}
{"original": "officials also revealed on thursday that the number of positive coronavirus cases among staff members and contractors at facilities for unaccompanied migrant children has grown to seven. six of them work in new york and one is a staff member in texas. a foster parent in washington also tested positive for the virus earlier this month. the refugee agency said it is also notifying anyone who may have been exposed to the workers."}
{"original": "coronavirus is particularly dangerous for older people and those with underlying medical issues, but children and young people can carry and transmit the virus, even if the risk of serious illness is relatively low. migrant minors in orr custody crossed the southern border without parents or guardians, or in certain circumstances, were separated from them."}

{"original": "the announcement on thursday is likely to fuel even more calls for the trump administration to quickly release some of the tens of thousands of immigrants it is currently detaining, especially as the public health crisis to contain the coronavirus intensifies. on wednesday, lawyers asked a federal court in california to require officials to release unaccompanied migrant children who have been in government custody for more than a month or transfer them to facilities where social distancing can be reasonably practiced."}
{"original": "similar calls have been made for immigration and customs enforcement, or ice, to reduce its detainee population, which stood at more than 38,000 over the weekend. despite confirmed coronavirus cases among detainees and staff at detention facilities, the agency has not moved to significantly downsize its detainee population."}
{"original": "in response to the pandemic, orr, an agency within the department of health and human services, is also prioritizing placing migrant children in local facilities after receiving them from department of homeland security officials, who are generally the first to apprehend unaccompanied minors near the southern border. officials said the move is designed to avoid air travel."}
{"original": "last week, orr leadership also issued guidance requiring that migrant children in its custody undergo mandatory temperature checks twice day, agency officials said. if a child has a temperature higher than 100 degrees, the shelters have to notify the government."}
{"original": "under u.s. law, the department of homeland security is generally required to transfer unaccompanied migrant children in its custody to orr within 72 hours. the children stay in orr custody until they are released to sponsors."}
{"original": "two years ago, the agency struggled to house the thousands of minors who the trump administration separated from their parents or guardians as part of the controversial zero tolerance policy."}
{"original": "we're beginning to see the economic impact of coronavirus in unemployment claims at the national level, but cbs news campaign reporter adam brewster says economists are warning that the worst is still to come. according to labor department data released on thursday, there were 281,000 seasonally adjusted initial unemployment insurance claims for the week ending march 14. this measures people who hadn't filed for unemployment insurance the week before. the number of claims was up 33% from the previous week and was the highest number of initial claims since september 2, 2017, right after hurricane harvey."}
{"original": "the increase in initial claims are clearly attributable to impacts from the covid-19 virus, the labor department said in a news release. but the unemployment insurance numbers released today cover a period of time before some states ordered restaurants to close their doors, except for takeout and delivery services, and told bars, theaters, gyms and other businesses to close to help stem the spread of the outbreak. that impact will be seen in next week's numbers."}
{"original": "while the jump today would be staggering in normal times, early unemployment figures from states this week indicate there could be a huge spike in claims when data is released next week, according to justin wolfers, a professor of economics and public policy at the university of michigan. the initial claims number that will be printed next thursday, so it won't be official until then, but ones printed next thursday will show over a million initial claims. it may show one and a half million, wolfers said. so this morning you saw it rise by 70,000, which is about a third. it's going to rise by a factor of five."}
{"original": "in an analysis for the new york times, wolfers found 629,899 claims filed in just 15 states this week. more than 80,000 claims were filed in california on tuesday, according to governor gavin newsom, compared to 2,000 on a normal day. minnesota has seen more than 50,000 claims filed this week. the michigan unemployment insurance agency is experiencing a more than 550% increase in claims compared to normal anticipated activity at this time of year, according to erica quealy, spokesperson for the michigan department of labor and economic opportunity."}
{"original": "when there's a slow drip of businesses closing, economists can spend months debating whether there's a recession. now, many have been forced to close their doors at once due to coronavirus, which will lead to terrifying numbers for the coming weeks."}
{"original": "we expect the next two to three weeks to be terrifying, wolfers said. all of those job losses that would normally occur over several months are going to occur over several weeks. what's not clear is whether there will be job losses beyond those expected in the next few weeks that are directly attributable to social isolation, wolfers said. it will take some time to tell if there's a significant round of job losses that follows the initial wave caused by businesses closures. one literally quite important thing to say is no one knows anything, wolfers said. and that may actually make you optimistic right now because it could be that we're wrong about lots of negative effects as well."}
{"original": "in an effort to blunt the losses from closing dine-in services, restaurant owners are encouraging people to continue ordering delivery and take-out, according to cbs news reporter kate smith. some establishments are offering the services for the first time and say it's allowing them to keep some of their employees working close to full schedules. l'artusi, a downtown manhattan italian restaurant, had never done delivery before this week. kevin garry, the owner and managing partner of epicurean, the restaurant group behind l'artusi, said when we turned it on, we had an amazingly positive response. business has been so good that l'artusi has been able to offer their kitchen employees close to a full schedule, garry said."}
{"original": "with the 2020 race seemingly on the back burner as the nation focuses on the immediacy of the coronavirus, joe biden's campaign has been actively trying to shift its message online during the pause of public campaign events, cbs news campaign reporter bo erickson reports. one strategy they're employing is blistering responses to president donald trump's response-related daily press conferences. today's headline from the biden team: trump lies after spending months downplaying coronavirus and ignoring scientists and experts who sounded the alarm."}
{"original": "in a statement, deputy campaign manager kate bedingfield said, time after time, president trump has failed the american people through his negligent and incompetent response to a global health pandemic — squandering months as he blithely downplayed its risks. biden's campaign pointed to seven examples of statements from mr. trump between january 22 and march 9 which they say shows the white house downplayed the growing threat of the virus."}
{"original": "the continued focus on the pandemic also allows biden to defend the legacy of former president obama. the obama-biden administration set up the white house national security council directorate for global health security and biodefense to prepare for future pandemics like covid-19, biden tweeted, donald trump eliminated it — and now we're paying the price."}
{"original": "the campaign for bernie sanders reached out to supporters today via email in a note signed by the vermont senator, cbs news campaign reporter cara korte reports. the note followed up on what we've heard sanders talk about this past week regarding covid19 – they're looking for folks to share stories on how the virus is impacting them and what they need to get through this time. as was the case in his email yesterday, there was no donation ask; however, hyperlinks throughout the message routed to his website, which is bugged with actblue donation tabs. the main point to be made is that in this period of crisis it's imperative that we stand together […] this is a moment that we have got to be working together and going forward together, it reads. the letter asks for supporters to share their experiences but also sign a petition to show support for sanders' covid-19 agenda."}
{"original": "if the campaign is on its last legs, a note like this reminds that sanders and his staff speak to supporters as a tight-knit community. at the same time, the information collected could used to show biden and the democratic establishment an indisputable tally of sanders' coalition, which could arm sanders with some leverage."}
{"original": "hawaii congresswoman tulsi gabbard announced in a twitter video that she is suspending her presidential campaign, leaving former vice president joe biden and vermont senator bernie sanders competing for the democratic nomination. in the video, gabbard said she is offering her full support for biden in order to unify the country. the endorsement of biden is a shift for gabbard, who endorsed sanders in the 2016 presidential election after resigning from her position as vice chair of the democratic national committee."}
{"original": "although i may not agree with the vice president on every issue, i know that he has a good heart and he is motivated by his love for our country and the american people, gabbard explained in her twitter video. i'm confident that he will lead our country guided by the spirit of aloha -- respect and compassion -- and thus help heal the divisiveness that has been tearing our country apart. cbs news campaign reporter jack turman says gabbard consistently polled in the low single digits and failed to make the debate stage as the nominating contests were underway. cbs news estimated that gabbard received two delegates from american samoa."}
{"original": "as the campaign rallies and town halls come to a grinding halt due to fears over coronavirus, one political activity has not yet been canceled: campaign fundraising. cbsn political reporter caitlin huey-burns and cbs news political unit associate producer sarah ewall-wice say presidential and congressional campaigns must adjust to a strange new world of digital rallies, tele-town halls and ground-game operations, but fundraising is an area that has already been working effectively online and candidates have long been investing in and growing digital fundraising tools and see it as a critical campaign function."}
{"original": "on thursday, cbs news confirmed that the trump campaign and the republican national committee have suspended in-person fundraising events, but digital fundraising efforts will continue. president trump and the rnc have the strongest fundraising operation in presidential history and our unmatched data and digital operation make us uniquely equipped to sustain a digital fundraising operation, said trump campaign communications director tim murtaugh in a statement."}
{"original": "as it is, we are in an incredibly strong position. while we are temporarily suspending in-person fundraising events, we will still be able to gather support from americans who fully support president trump, his accomplishments, and his leadership, he said."}
{"original": "former vice president joe biden's campaign has also not been holding in-person fundraisers of late but his team is exploring digital fundraising options. we're raising money digitally, doing virtual fundraisers [and will] continue to be creative about how to use video or multimedia elements, says biden campaign spokesman tj ducklo, arguing that president trump's handling of the pandemic has caused an even greater sense of urgency among democrats to oust him from office while generating enthusiasm around biden's candidacy."}
{"original": "after sunday's debate — which showed biden and bernie sanders standing a socially distant six feet apart and bumping elbows instead of shaking hands — the biden campaign had its best debate fundraising haul, surpassing each of the past 10 previous debate nights. the handling of covid-19 was a chief topic of discussion. the outbreak comes as the democratic presidential primary is wrapping up with biden leading sanders in the delegate count 1,093 to 802. such a moment would, in normal times, present a prime fundraising opportunity for the biden campaign."}
{"original": "at this point historically, what would happen is we'd aggressively start to pivot to the general election to talk about joint fundraising committees with the dnc and really building the infrastructure to really compete with the republicans in november, said rufus gifford, president obama's 2012 campaign finance director and a supporter of biden. it will be generally harder to raise money at a time when people are concerned… it's not the easiest or best time to raise money, so you have to acknowledge that reality especially considering we don't know how long that's going to last."}
{"original": "but the pandemic and the ensuing economic instability make asking for money a delicate task. with people's jobs and livelihoods at stake — candidates have to consider the sensitivity around raising money in a time of crisis as other aspects of daily life have come to standstill. you have to be a little mindful that there's lots of stuff going on that might prevent someone from being able to contribute or to contribute as much as they would want to, said ducklo."}
{"original": "on thursday, the governor of connecticut ned lamont announced he would be postponing the state's presidential primary scheduled for april 28 amid concerns over the spread of coronavirus. cbs news political unit associate producer sarah ewall-wice says this makes connecticut the sixth state to delay its 2020 primary following maryland, ohio, louisiana, georgia and kentucky."}
{"original": "in coordination with other states and our secretary of the state, and in an effort to carry out democracy while keeping public health a top priority, i have decided to move our presidential primary to june 2nd, lamont first stated in a tweet. my most important concerns are allowing every connecticut voter to make their voice heard in the selection of the presidential candidates, and ensuring that they are able to cast their ballots as safely as possible, posted connecticut secretary of state denise merrill on twitter. moving the primary date is a good first step, and will give our local election officials more time to prepare. changing an election date is not something we do lightly – it's a recognition of the severity & nature of this crisis, and more steps may be necessary to guarantee that every ct voter has an opportunity to cast their ballot."}
{"original": "four states are still scheduled to hold primaries on april 28, including delaware, new york, pennsylvania and rhode island. however, the rhode island board of elections voted on tuesday to move the primary from april 28 to june 2 as well but it still awaits the governor's approval."}
{"original": "twenty-six lawmakers have had to self-quarantine because of the coronavirus, with many other house members closing their offices to prevent further spread or because of a positive diagnosis of a staffer. cbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarro reports that these 26 lawmakers include two house members that tested positive for covid-19 on wednesday, mario diaz-balart of florida and ben mcadams of utah."}
{"original": "in a tweet, diaz-balart said that he will remain in his washington d.c. apartment to avoid contact with his wife in south florida, who has a pre-existing condition. i want everyone to know that i am feeling much better. however, it is important that everyone take this extremely seriously and follow cdc guidelines in order to avoid getting sick and mitigate the spread of this virus."}
{"original": "the question of how congress can function and act on emergency legislation, in a time of social distancing in response to a disease that appears to have greater impact on older populations, still remains to be seen. in a letter, house majority leader steny hoyer said the house, which is currently in recess, will not return until we are in a position to vote on the third piece of emergency legislation to respond to the economic impact of this crisis. hoyer added, i share the concerns of many members regarding the number of members on the house floor at any one time. i therefore expect that the house will adjust our voting procedures in order to follow the cdc's recommendations. no decisions have been made on exactly what these changes will be, but we will be discussing all options."}
{"original": "dallas - the price of oil keeps falling. and falling. and falling."}
{"original": "the cost of crude briefly dipped below $30 a barrel tuesday, its lowest level in more than 12 years, before climbing back above that threshold before the close of trading. oil, which had sold for roughly $100 a barrel for nearly four years before beginning to fall in the summer of 2014, is down 17 percent this year alone and is now probing depths not seen since 2003."}
{"original": "all you can do is forecast direction, and the direction of price is still down, said larry goldstein of the energy policy research foundation, who predicted a decline in oil in 2014."}
{"original": "the price of crude is down because global supplies are high at a time when demand for it is not growing very fast. the price decline, already more dramatic and long-lasting than most expected, deepened in recent days because economic turmoil in china is expected to cut demand for oil even further."}
{"original": "lower crude prices are leading to lower prices for gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and heating oil, giving drivers, shippers, and many businesses a big break on fuel costs. the national average retail price of gasoline is $1.96 a gallon."}
{"original": "that trend is expected to continue. the u.s. energy information administration forecasts that the average retail price for gas to hover around $2 a gallon for most of 2016. the agency also predicts that u.s. households will see the lowest heating oil and natural gas bills this winter in more than a decade."}
{"original": "on tuesday the energy department lowered its expectations for crude oil and most fuels for this year and next. the department now expects u.s. crude to average $38.54 a barrel in 2016."}
{"original": "but layoffs across the oil industry are mounting, and bankruptcies among oil companies are expected to soar. bp announced layoffs of 4,000 workers on tuesday. fadel gheit, an analyst at oppenheimer & co, said as many as half of the independent drilling companies working in u.s. shale fields could go bankrupt before oil prices stabilize."}
{"original": "a boom in u.s. oil production thanks to new drilling technology helped push global supplies higher in recent years. other major oil producers and exporters in the middle east and elsewhere have declined to reduce their own output in an attempt to push prices back up. iran, trying to emerge from punishing economic sanctions, is looking to increase exports in the coming months, which could add further to global oil stockpiles."}
{"original": "the energy department said u.s. crude oil inventories remain near levels not seen for this time of year in at least the last 80 years. it says global supplies exceed global demand by about 1 million barrels per day on average. economists at the federal reserve bank of dallas believe excess inventories won't begin falling until 2017."}
{"original": "the higher supplies and lower prices haven't translated into rising global demand. most of the increase in world oil demand over the past several years has come from china, but signs are pointing to much slower economic growth there, which in turn reduces demand for fuels made from crude."}
{"original": "disappointing reports last week about china's manufacturing sector and a fall in the yuan's value triggered a global stock sell-off and an even more dramatic decline in the price of oil and other commodities."}
{"original": "the first five days of the year marked the worst start of a year for oil in history, according to s&p dow jones indices, and oil has only fallen further since."}
{"original": "motorists are saving every time they fill up. the energy information administration figures that the average u.s. household saved about $660 on gasoline last year compared with 2014, and that the average price for gasoline this year will be $2.03 a gallon, the lowest since 2004."}
{"original": "airlines, big users of jet fuel, have posted record profits, and other businesses are saving too from cheaper energy."}
{"original": "but workers in the oil patch have paid the price. about 17,000 oil and gas workers in the u.s. lost their jobs in 2015, but if you include oilfield support jobs the number is about 87,000, according to michael plante, an economist at the dallas fed who has written about the effect of oil prices on the economy."}
{"original": "even so, economists say low oil prices are still a net benefit for the u.s. economy."}
{"original": "consumers have more money in their pocketbooks, said amy myers jaffe, an energy consultant who teaches at the university of california, davis. and for businesses, i can hire more people or buy new equipment because i no longer have to spend that money on energy."}
{"original": "oil traders and wall street analysts expect further declines in oil prices in the coming weeks. several have predicted that prices will fall well below $30 a barrel."}
{"original": "there are wild cards that could result in a sudden rise in oil. a perennial threat is fighting in the middle east, which has destroyed production facilities in the past."}
{"original": "just as $100 oil encouraged the new production that contributed to this plunge in prices, $30 oil is discouraging the big investment needed for exploration and production for the future. the number of rigs drilling for oil in the u.s. has fallen by more than two-thirds, to 516 last week from an october 2014 peak of 1,609, according to a closely-watched count by the drilling services company baker hughes."}
{"original": "eventually, analysts say, the supply will fall below demand and prices will rise. oppenheimer's gheit thinks oil will eventually rise and settle into a range between $50 and $70 a barrel -- but not anytime soon."}
{"original": "the longer it remains low, the more violent the reaction to the upside is going to be, he said."}
{"original": "as the opioid epidemic continues to wreak havoc on communities across the country, new data looks at where drug abuse is most pronounced and which geographic areas in the united states are most at risk."}
{"original": "the report from personal finance website wallethub ranks the 50 states and the district of columbia across more than a dozen key metrics, ranging from the rate of opioid prescriptions to arrest and overdose rates and meth-lab incidents per capita."}
{"original": "according to the report, the 10 states with the biggest drug use problems include:"}
{"original": "district of columbia missouri new hampshire michigan west virginia new mexico indiana rhode island kentucky pennsylvania"}
{"original": "to determine which states have the biggest drug problems, wallethub ranked the states in three overall categories: drug use and addiction; law enforcement; and drug health issues and rehab. these categories included 20 relevant metrics that were weighted and averaged to calculate overall score. among other data points, the metrics included the share of teenagers who used illicit drugs in the past month, overdose deaths per capita, drug arrests per capita, share of adults who needed but didn't receive treatment for illicit drug use in the past year, and the number of substance abuse treatment facilities per 100,000 people."}
{"original": "the report also includes interviews with experts in the fields of medicine, psychology, criminal justice, and public health policy on ways to combat the opioid epidemic -- indicating just how complex the problem is and how difficult any solutions will be."}
{"original": "there won't be a silver bullet that will solve this epidemic, said courtney r. yarbrough, an assistant professor at emory university rollins school of public health."}
{"original": "mark concordia, an associate professor of criminal justice at roberts wesleyan college, calls for a multiprong holistic approach that prioritizes treatment over punishment while aggressively pursuing drug dealers with more serious charges."}
{"original": "sharon levy, md, president of the association for medical education and research in substance abuse (amersa) and an associate professor of pediatrics at harvard medical school, points out that it's important to understand addiction as a medical condition rather than bad behavior -- destigmatizing the problem and making it easier for someone suffering to get help."}
{"original": "addiction is a chronic medical disorder in which patients lose control over drug use, levy said. it is a treatable condition."}
{"original": "sen. kirsten gillibrand, d-new york, is expected to announce her plans to form a presidential exploratory committee on tuesday's late show with stephen colbert, according to a person familiar with her planning."}
{"original": "gillibrand is scheduled to appear on the cbs late night program on tuesday night. if she announces her exploratory committee, as expected, she would become the second u.s. senator — and second female senator — to announce plans to begin the legal process of running for the democratic presidential nomination in 2020. the 52-year old is one of the most active and outspoken critics of president trump and she earned acclaim from party activists when she began voting against all of the president's cabinet and senior government nominees in early 2017."}
{"original": "gillibrand would join a democratic presidential field beginning to take shape. over the weekend, former housing and urban development (hud) secretary julián castro formally launched his presidential bid, while sen. elizabeth warren, d-massachusetts, launched an exploratory committee on new year's eve. rep. tulsi gabbard, d-hawaii, said over the weekend that she plans to form an exploratory committee in the coming days. several other senators, current and former governors and mayors, and former vice president joe biden are still mulling potential campaigns."}
{"original": "spokespeople for gillibrand declined to comment. in recent days, she has announced that her senate chief of staff, jess fassler, and meredith kelly, a former communications director for the democratic congressional campaign committee (dccc), would be joining the senior staff of her prospective campaign."}
{"original": "gillibrand is the junior senator from the state of new york and was appointed to the seat in january 2009 to replace former sen. hillary clinton, who had stepped down to serve as secretary of state. previously, she was known as a moderate democrat representing new york's north country who openly touted her support of gun rights. but her positions on many policy issues took a decidedly liberal turn once she began serving the empire state and she became an outspoken proponent of stricter gun laws, comprehensive immigration reform and women's rights. she won her first full term to the senate in 2012 and was reelected this past november."}
{"original": "in the senate, she's used her perch on the armed services committee to push for the repeal of the don't ask, don't tell policy that banned gay men and lesbians from serving in the military. last year she was the first senate democrat to call on former sen. al franken, d-minnesota, to resign amid accusations of inappropriate behavior towards women. she also sits on senate committees focused on agriculture, aging and the environment."}
{"original": "before running for congress in 2006, gillibrand once served as special counsel to then-hud secretary andrew cuomo and later as a manhattan-based attorney who worked for a firm that represented philip morris, the cigarette company."}
{"original": "gillibrand graduated from dartmouth college and received her law degree from university of california los angeles. she is the author of the book off the sidelines: speak up, be fearless, and change your world, and a children's book named bold & brave: ten heroes who won women the right to vote."}
{"original": "while all eyes were on the impeachment trial in the senate on thursday, the house passed a pair of bills intended to constrain president trump's ability to launch attacks on iran. however, the white house has issued veto threats for these bills, even if they are taken up and approved by the senate."}
{"original": "the first bill, introduced by congressman ro khanna, was modeled after an amendment which was stripped from the national defense authorization act (ndaa) during negotiations last year. the bill would prohibit mr. trump from using government funds to engage in conflict with iran without the express permission of congress."}
{"original": "the second bill, sponsored by congresswoman barbara lee, is a repeal of the 2002 authorization for use of military force against iraq (aumf), which the trump administration used as part of its justification for the strike which killed iranian military leader qassem soleimani earlier this month. the legislation targeted saddam hussein and the weapons of mass destruction he was believed to have, but it also allowed for use of force as a part of the prosecution of the war on terrorism."}
{"original": "we need to reassert our congressional authority, lee said in an interview with cbs news on wednesday. she called the 2002 aumf a terrible, terrible authorization which was based on lies by the bush administration."}
{"original": "the repeal of it is long overdue, lee continued."}
{"original": "the white house issued veto threats against the bills proposed by khanna and lee on monday. in a statement of administration policy, the white house said lee's bill would undermine the president's ability to defend united states forces and interests in the region against ongoing threats from iran and iranian-sponsored proxies. however, mr. trump appeared to send a conflicting message with a tweet on wednesday, urging representatives to vote their heart."}
{"original": "on the iraq war resolution being voted on tomorrow in the house of represenatives [sic], we are down to 5000 soldiers, and going down, and i want everyone, republican and democrat, to vote their heart! mr. trump wrote."}
{"original": "lee said that even if the senate chose not to vote on khanna's bill or hers, she would not be deterred."}
{"original": "we don't play by their rules, lee said, condemning senate majority leader mitch mcconnell for not bringing house-approved to the senate floor. we can't allow their collusion together on such matters of national security to drive what we do."}
{"original": "washington - since the federal reserve raised interest rates from record lows last month, the global picture has darkened. stock markets have plunged. oil prices have skidded. china's leaders have struggled to steer the world's second-biggest economy."}
{"original": "all of which raised a delicate question: did the fed err in raising rates for the first time in nearly a decade?"}
{"original": "don't expect the central bank to answer or even acknowledge that question when it issues a statement after its latest policy meeting ends wednesday. but in their meeting, the fed's policymakers will surely grapple with whether -- and, if so, how -- to respond to an altered economic landscape."}
{"original": "no one thinks the fed will suddenly reverse course and roll back the quarter-point increase in its key short-term rate it announced dec. 16. but some analysts say the fed might signal that the pace of three or four additional rate increases that many had expected this year could become more gradual -- with perhaps only two rate hikes this year and not starting until midyear."}
{"original": "people are just scared right now, said david wyss, a former fed staff economist and now an economics professor at brown university. it isn't just china weighing on things. europe hasn't solved its problems, we have geopolitical risks in the middle east and in the united states there is a lack of confidence in the political parties and the candidates."}
{"original": "the most visible sign of the economic fear has been the sharp fall in the stock market. even after a gain of 211 points friday, the dow jones industrial average shed more than 7 percent of its value in the first three trading weeks of 2016."}
{"original": "china has unnerved investors because of an economic slowdown that beijing seems incapable of managing properly. the country's decelerating growth has shrunk global commodity prices and the emerging market countries that have supplied them to china. last week, the price of oil reached a 12-year low of $28.15 a barrel before rebounding to around $32 on friday."}
{"original": "many see the fed's december rate hike as a key factor in the stock market's tumble. the move amounted to only a small rise in the fed's still-extremely low target rate for overnight bank lending. but it signaled that a seven-year period of near-zero rates was ending and that while borrowing costs wouldn't be rising fast, they would be headed steadily up."}
{"original": "the fed's critics had warned for years that by keeping rates so low for so long, it was fueling dangerous bubbles in assets such as stocks. some now see the falling stock prices as the correction that they had forecast would occur after the fed started raising rates."}
{"original": "others say the market's swoon seems hardly due to a small increase in the fed's benchmark rate. they point instead to china's economic troubles, the slide in oil prices and weakness in some key areas of the global economy. still, some economists suggest that if the fed could have foreseen what has ensued in the month since it raised rates, it might have reconsidered."}
{"original": "at the time they raised rates, it seemed like a reasonable decision, and it certainly has been supported by the strong employment numbers we have seen, said nariman behravesh, chief economist at ihs global insight. but starting at the beginning of the year, it seems all hell broke loose. the rather inept handling by chinese authorities of the stock market troubles in that country has really bothered global markets."}
{"original": "a prolonged drop in the stock market can sometimes -- but certainly not always -- signal an impending recession. most analysts note that the 6½-year-old economic expansion has lasted longer than most. yet they don't see a recession as imminent. behravesh said he puts the possibility of a mild recession starting later this year at around 20 percent. but he said his firm's forecast is for the economy to rebound from a slow final three months of last year to growth of around 2.5 percent this year."}
{"original": "and what should the fed be doing?"}
{"original": "analysts expect no course shift this week. the fed may make some slight changes to its policy statement to express concern in particular about intensified global pressures. that could assure investors that the fed will weigh such developments in deciding when to next raise rates."}
{"original": "the fed will probably acknowledge that global economic conditions have deteriorated since the december meeting, but they will balance that by saying u.s. economic conditions have not changed, suggested sung won sohn, an economics professor at the martin smith school of business at california state university."}

{"original": "because donald trump was unwilling to sell his businesses, and he continues to own them, foreign governments continue to have a way of channeling money to him in an effort to influence him and u.s. policy, said kathleen clark, who teaches government ethics at washington university law school."}

{"original": "amid a parabolic push by big tech stocks this week -- briefly lifting the nasdaq above 6,100 on monday for the first time -- wall street is bracing for the start of another two-day federal reserve policy meeting on tuesday."}
{"original": "while no rate hike is expected as policymakers gauge the effect of their quarter-point rate hike in march, the third increase of this tightening cycle that started in december 2015, all eyes will be on how officials interpret recent unevenness in the economic data."}
{"original": "consider that first-quarter gdp growth slowed to just 0.7 percent amid the worst consumer spending performance since 2009 during a time of ebullient post-election confidence (as measured by a multitude of surveys) and record stock prices. consumers, investors and businesses say they're geared up and ready to spend, invest and hire."}
{"original": "but the on-the-ground reality says something different. and that presents a policy conundrum for the fed."}
{"original": "at its last policy meeting in march, the fed updated its economic projections (forecasting 2 to 2.2 percent gdp growth for 2017) and dramatically quickened the pace of policy tightening: from just two quarter-point hikes in two years, it unleashed its next increase after just three months in response to the post-election surge of confidence and resulting financial market gains."}
{"original": "moreover, in recent months fed officials have increasingly discussed the need to reduce the size of the central bank's asset holdings after multiple iterations of bond-buying stimulus since the financial crisis. from around $800 billion before the crisis, the fed's balance sheet now totals more than $4 trillion."}
{"original": "in retrospect, this may have been too much too fast. key leading indicators like loan growth have rolled over dramatically -- with the decline in commercial and industrial lending happening at a pace associated with the last three recessions. corelogic recently noted that loan performance -- a key indicator of typical economic expansions and recessions -- is beginning to deteriorate."}
{"original": "confirming all of this were first-quarter earnings reports out of the financial sector over the past month. quarter-over-quarter lending at the largest u.s. regional banks declined in the period for the first time since 2013's first quarter. commercial loan balances didn't change at jpmorgan (jpm) and wells fargo (wfc) compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, with wells fargo getting dinged for lower mortgage activity as well."}
{"original": "and early reads on the second quarter don't look much better: a weaker-than-expected ism manufacturing index for april suggests the weakness may be continuing. the reading for new orders fell to 57.5 from 64.5, while employment dropped to 52 from 58.9. while any measure over 50 indicates month-to-month growth, this is a rather dramatic slowdown suggesting the post-election confidence boost is fading."}
{"original": "consumers continue to hunker down as well: the savings rate increased to the highest level since last august in april."}
{"original": "no wonder then that according to the cme's fedwatch tool, which measures rate hike expectations based on futures trading, the market sees only a 4.8 percent chance of a rate hike this week."}
{"original": "but the current economic unevenness is expected to fade: for the fed's june meeting, the market assigns 70 percent odds of at least a quarter-point hike. by the end of the year, short-term interest rates are forecast to be somewhere around 1.5 percent, up from 0.9 percent now. hope springs eternal, it seems."}
{"original": "while the fed's policy statement will likely be light on detail when it's released wednesday afternoon, watch for additional insight from fed officials, including vice-chair stanley fischer and chicago fed president charles evans. both will speak at an event on friday at stanford university. chair janet yellen is scheduled to speak at a conference on friday as well, but according to keefe, bruyette & woods analysts, she isn't expected to comment on policy."}
{"original": "beijing -china is consolidating its ability to censor the internet by drafting rules requiring businesses that serve domestic internet users to register their web addresses inside the country, a move seen as targeting chinese companies but that has raised concerns among foreign businesses."}
{"original": "in its most draconian interpretation, the proposed requirements could also further limit access within the chinese network, analysts said. that appears to be the latest step by the ruling communist party to erect cyberbarriers in the name of what some officials call internet sovereignty."}
{"original": "this expands control over domestic internet operators and contributes to the gradual buildup of the capability underpinning internet sovereignty, said rogier creemers, an expert on chinese media policy at the university of oxford."}
{"original": "under the draft regulations released this week by the ministry of industry and information technology, any firm that provides services to chinese users must register its domain, or web address, with a chinese provider. the rules are found in article 37 of the ministry's proposed update to a set of decade-old internet laws."}
{"original": "analysts said the main targets appear to be chinese internet companies that store their content domestically but keep their web address registered overseas with reputable, international firms for security purposes."}
{"original": "requiring them to shift their registration to a domestic provider under chinese government control would allow censors to react more quickly in blocking access to certain sites, said long weilian, an info-tech consultant based in the southern chinese city of shenzhen who has blogged extensively on the issue."}
{"original": "before, they had to contact the server, get the address, talk to the manager and then ask them to censor something, long said. if the domains are all domestic, they can directly stop traffic going to your domain with a command."}
{"original": "jacob parker, vice president for china operations with the u.s.-china business council, which lobbies the chinese government on trade policy, said his group was concerned that the rules would block the free flow of information."}
{"original": "any kind of restrictions would undermine china's broader economic development goals, parker said."}
{"original": "concerned that a borderless, u.s.-led global internet could weaken its political control, china's government has repeatedly issued internet regulations that have drawn criticism from western trade groups. following pushback from the white house last year, china dropped a provision in a cybersecurity law that would require companies to keep chinese user data at facilities in china, allowing the government access to personal information."}
{"original": "questions remain about the new rules' true purpose and how strictly they would be enforced. the ministry is currently soliciting feedback on the proposed registration regulations, and chinese laws are often softened during the revision process."}
{"original": "fang xingdong, the director of a top chinese technology think tank, said he believes chinese leaders are seeking to enhance their control, but not to wall china off from the rest of the world."}
{"original": "under the current wording, all this is doing is integrating large chinese web service providers under a more rigorous supervision framework, while most small businesses won't be affected, said fang, whose organization regularly submits opinions to the government on internet issues."}

{"original": "the federal government is scheduled to release unemployment claims data on thursday, but that number is likely to be incomplete. because unemployment insurance is handled by states, which set their own procedures, it can take anywhere from two to four weeks for that information to be reported and collected into federal data."}

{"original": "salt lake city -- the mormon church, the biggest sponsor of boy scout troops in the united states, announced thursday it is pulling as many as 185,000 older youths from the organization as part of an effort to start its own scouting-like program."}
{"original": "the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints said the move wasn't triggered by the boy scouts' decision in 2015 to allow gay troop leaders, since mormon-sponsored troops have remained free to exclude such adults on religious grounds."}
{"original": "but at least one leading mormon scholar said that the boy scouts and the church have been diverging on values in recent years and that the policy on gays was probably a contributing factor in the split."}
{"original": "cbs affiliate kutv in salt lake city, utah, reports the lds church said it doesn't believe young men between 14 and 18 years old are not being served well by the varsity or venturing programs."}
{"original": "the church said the decision will affect 185,000 teens; the boy scouts put the number at 130,000."}
{"original": "the loss is only a fraction of the 2.3 million youths in the boy scouts of america, but the organization has been grappling with declining membership for years and has enjoyed an unusually close bond with the mormon church for more than a century because of their shared values. joining the boy scouts is practically automatic among mormon boys."}
{"original": "boy scouts of america spokeswoman effie delimarkos said the organization is saddened by the decision but understands the church's desire to customize a program."}
{"original": "about 280,000 mormon boys ages 8 to 13 will remain in the scouts while the church develops its program, the mormons said. the boy scouts estimated their number at 330,000."}
{"original": "kutv reports the church will continue through 2018 to make the same payment to the boy scouts of america for registration of its young men."}
{"original": "like other conservative faiths, the mormon church opposes gay marriage and teaches that being in a homosexual relationship is a sin. the church initially said it was deeply troubled by the boy scouts' policy change on gays but stayed with the organization after receiving assurances it could appoint troop leaders according to its own religious and moral values."}
{"original": "in thursday's announcement, the church said that it learned recently that the boy scouts are considering admitting girls, but that its decision was made independently of that."}
{"original": "matthew bowman, a mormon scholar and history professor at henderson state university, said the schism reflects the two organizations' diverging values, with gays and girls among the issues on which they are moving apart."}
{"original": "the church is wedded very much to traditional gender roles and they see the boy scouts of america increasingly move away from that, bowman said. that means that they have come to see it as less of a hospitable place."}
{"original": "thursday's announcement represents a first step toward something that has been in the works for years: a mormon-run scouting-type program that could be used in congregations around the world. the church has 15.8 million members, nearly 6 in 10 of them outside the u.s. and canada. scouting is available only in the u.s. and canada."}
{"original": "the long game here is the church looking forward to a time when americans are even more of a minority in the church than they are now, bowman said."}
{"original": "mormon teenagers who want to continue working toward the eagle scout rank will be able to do that on their own while also participating in the new program, said church spokesman eric hawkins."}
{"original": "the boy scout movement has been entrenched in mormon culture for as long as anyone can remember."}

{"original": "new york -- for 108 years, the boy scouts of america's flagship program has been known simply as the boy scouts. with girls soon entering the ranks, the group says that iconic name will change. on wednesday, the organization announced a new name for its boy scouts program: scouts bsa. the change will take effect next february."}
{"original": "chief scout executive mike surbaugh said many possibilities were considered during lengthy and incredibly fun deliberations before the new name was chosen."}
{"original": "we wanted to land on something that evokes the past but also conveys the inclusive nature of the program going forward, he said. we're trying to find the right way to say we're here for both young men and young women."}

{"original": "the organization has already started admitting girls into the cub scouts, and scouts bsa begins accepting girls next year."}
{"original": "surbaugh predicted that both boys and girls in scouts bsa would refer to themselves simply as scouts, rather than adding boy or girl as a modifier."}
{"original": "the program for the older boys and girls will largely be divided along gender-lines, with single-sex units pursuing the same types of activities, earning the same array of merit badges and potentially having the same pathway to the coveted eagle scout award."}
{"original": "surbaugh said that having separate units for boys and girls should alleviate concerns that girls joining the bsa for the first time might be at a disadvantage in seeking leadership opportunities."}
{"original": "so far, more than 3,000 girls have joined roughly 170 cub scout packs participating in the first phase of the new policy, and the pace will intensify this summer under a nationwide multimedia recruitment campaign titled scout me in."}
{"original": "the name change comes amid strained relations between the girl scouts and boy scouts of america."}
{"original": "girl scout leaders said they were blindsided by the move, and they are gearing up an aggressive campaign to recruit and retain girls as members."}
{"original": "among the initiatives is creation of numerous new badges that girls can earn, focusing on outdoor activities and on science, engineering, technology and math. the organization is expanding corporate partnerships in both those areas, and developing a girl scout network page on linkedin to support career advancement for former girl scouts."}
{"original": "girl scouts is the premier leadership development organization for girls, said sylvia acevedo, the girl scouts' ceo. we are, and will remain, the first choice for girls and parents who want to provide their girls opportunities to build new skills ... and grow into happy, successful, civically engaged adults."}
{"original": "the girl scouts and the bsa are among several major youth organizations in the u.s. experiencing sharp drops in membership in recent years. reasons include competition from sports leagues, a perception by some families that they are old-fashioned and busy family schedules."}
{"original": "the boy scouts began as a movement in england in the early 20th century. it took off in america almost immediately as a way to keep young men (as the scout oath puts it) physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight. tens of millions of american boys have taken that oath, and only the most determined attain scouting's highest rank: eagle scout, an elite group of american men, from billionaires like michael bloomberg to presidents like gerald ford."}
{"original": "since the early 1970s, the boy scouts have lost two-thirds of their annual membership -- some four million boys. and that's a tradition they want to change while still preserving almost everything else."}
{"original": "the girl scouts say they have about 1.76 million girls and more than 780,000 adult members, down from just over 2 million youth members and about 800,000 adult members in 2014."}
{"original": "the overall impact of the bsa's policy change on girl scouts membership won't be known any time soon. but one regional leader, fiona cummings of girl scouts of northern illinois, believes the bsa's decision to admit girls is among the factors that have shrunk her council's youth membership by more than 500 girls so far this year."}
{"original": "she said relations with the boy scouts in her region used to be collaborative and now are very chilly."}
{"original": "how do you manage these strategic tensions? she asked. we both need to increase our membership numbers."}
{"original": "surbaugh said bsa's national leadership respected the girl scouts' program and hoped both organizations could gain strength."}

{"original": "with great fanfare, u.s. equities have climbed out of their feb. 11 low, reversing what was the worst-ever start to a year and ending a very scary test of last august's market lows. the dow jones industrials index climbed back above the 18,000 level for the first time since august and moved within a few hundred points (less than 2 percent) of last may's record high."}
{"original": "with all that, many have started wondering if the long sideways crawl in stocks that started in late 2014 could finally be ending -- despite fundamental headwinds like weak earnings (first-quarter results expected to be the worst since 2009 and the fourth consecutive quarterly decline in profitability) and tepid gdp growth (the atlanta fed's gdpnow first-quarter estimate stands at just 0.3 percent)."}
{"original": "whether a breakout is at hand i can't say one way or another. but here's something worth mentioning: america's stock market rally stands alone. markets around the planet are much less ebullient, with the msci world index (minus the u.s.) down nearly 15 percent from its high last summer. that suggests caution is warranted."}
{"original": "first, the dow jones industrials are constrained in a three-year trading range between 16,000 and 18,000 (chart above) as investors struggle to balance catalysts like federal reserve policy tightening, the ups-and-downs in crude oil, a stronger dollar, earnings and gdp growth."}
{"original": "second, take a look at japan's nikkei average, which remains 16.1 percent off of its summertime high and is still well below its 50-week moving average (chart above). gdp growth remains slow, at just a 0.7 percent annual rate. and despite negative interest rates and an aggressive asset-purchase program from the bank of japan, inflation is dancing on the edge of negative territory. the specter of deflation is dangerous because of tokyo's 229 percent government debt-to-gdp ratio."}
{"original": "third, china's shanghai composite is still recovering from a dramatic bubble boom-and-bust cycle from 2014 through 2015, which has seen share prices fall nearly 43 percent from their highs (chart above). a two-year-old pattern of lower highs and lower lows remains in play as the chinese economy grapples with currency volatility, overreliance on credit, capital outflows and a bungled transition away from exports and fixed-asset investment toward services and consumption. and what's happening in china is a big concern for the u.s. fed, so keep a close eye on that."}
{"original": "fourth, germany's dax is down nearly 16 percent from its high last summer as the eurozone contends with a recent flare up of sovereign debt risk, tepid gdp growth (just 1.6 percent annualized), low inflation and still-high joblessness in peripheral countries, like spain's 20.9 percent currently."}
{"original": "finally, consider the u.k.'s ftse index, which is down nearly 10 percent from its high last spring. while gdp growth here is better (at 2.1 percent), recent economic data like retail sales have disappointed (worse performance since january 2014). that suggests headwinds related to britain's possible exit from the european union."}

{"original": "the previous british government, also led by the conservative party, or the tories, as they are commonly known, maintained an official policy of working for a total ban on ivory sales."}
{"original": "the independent newspaper reports that mrs. may's manifesto has quietly dropped that line, and replaced it with a generic call for the protection of endangered species."}
{"original": "at the heart of the debate is the multi-million-dollar illegal trade in ivory, mostly taken from african elephants by poachers who leave the animals to die. as cbs news' holly william reported, the trade is making the poachers and traders rich, but so many elephants are being slaughtered that scientists warned in 2014 the species could be completely wiped out within 100 years."}
{"original": "according to that study, 100,000 elephants were killed for their tusks over the course of just three years, and more contemporary estimates suggest as many as 20,000 are killed for their ivory every year."}
{"original": "since 1979, the african elephant's range has shrunk dramatically. the animals have reached what the study's authors call a tipping point -- with more elephants killed each year than there are born."}
{"original": "any sale or purchase of newly-poached ivory is strictly against the law, including in britain, but a loophole in british law makes trade in antique ivory items (created in 1947 or earlier) legal. according to the independent, lax verification required by the law to prove an item's age makes it difficult to enforce."}
{"original": "for that reason, the previous tory government policy was to close the 1947 loophole and make all ivory trade illegal – a policy backed by conservation and animal welfare groups."}

{"original": "washington — former speaker of the house paul ryan condemned efforts by a group of republican lawmakers to reject the electoral votes from some states, saying sunday that it is difficult to conceive of a more anti-democratic and anti-conservative act."}
{"original": "efforts to reject the votes of the electoral college and sow doubt about joe biden's victory strike at the foundation of our republican, ryan, a former gop congressman from wisconsin who retired in 2018, said in a statement. he called the expected action from house and senate republicans a federal intervention to overturn the results of state-certified elections and disenfranchise millions of americans."}
{"original": "the fact that this effort will fail does not mean it will not do significant damage to american democracy, ryan added."}
{"original": "at least 100 house republicans are expected to object to the electoral votes cast in a handful of battleground states when congress convenes for a joint session wednesday to tally the votes and certify the election results. on saturday, a group of 11 republicans in the senate said they, too, intend to reject electoral votes from disputed states unless a commission is appointed to conduct a 10-day audit of the results from those states. gop senator josh hawley of missouri said last week he also intends to object to the certification of electoral votes."}
{"original": "federal law allows for written objections to a state's electoral votes to be made during the joint session, but they must be signed by at least one senator and one member of the house. once an objection is properly made, the house and senate then meet separately to debate for a maximum of two hours before reconvening to vote on the objection. a simple majority in each chamber is needed for the objection to be sustained and the challenged state's votes tossed out. because democrats control the house, it's highly unlikely the lower chamber will vote to uphold an objection, and president-elect joe biden's win is expected to be reaffirmed despite the challenges from republicans."}
{"original": "the last time an objection was made was in 2005, when democratic ohio representative stephanie tubbs and california democratic senator barbara boxer challenged the ohio's electoral votes in the 2004 presidential election. neither chamber voted to sustain the objection and toss the votes, with the senate voting it down 1 to 74. multiple house members objected to florida's electoral votes in the 2000 presidential election, but no senators signed onto the challenge."}
{"original": "ryan joins several other republicans, including senators mitt romney of utah and pat toomey of pennsylvania, in criticizing the expected challenges of electoral votes from gop lawmakers. a group of conservative house members led by congressman thomas massie of kentucky also broke with their republican colleagues and said in a statement sunday that the electoral votes submitted to congress by the states should be tallied."}

{"original": "despite repeated baseless claims of fraud and irregularities by various republican lawmakers and officials, no evidence of widespread voter fraud has been found. former attorney general bill barr told the associated press on december 1, to date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election. christopher krebs, the former head of the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency, said the 2020 election was the most secure in american history."}
{"original": "multiple lawsuits brought by the president's allies alleging fraud in various states have all been thrown out. mr. trump's personal attorney, rudy giuliani, while arguing a case in pennsylvania court challenging that state's election laws explicitly stated, this is not a fraud case."}

{"original": "a u.s. district court judge had issued an injunction in december 2017 blocking the ban, but the supreme court's stay stops that ruling from taking effect for now. the case is still pending in the 9th circuit court of appeals, and the supreme court will not weigh in on the constitutionality of the ban itself until after that ruling."}

{"original": "until a few years ago service members could be discharged from the military for being transgender. that changed under president barack obama. the military announced in 2016 that transgender individuals already serving in the military would be allowed to serve openly. and the military set july 1, 2017 as the date when transgender individuals would be allowed to enlist."}
{"original": "but after president donald trump took office, the administration delayed the enlistment date, saying the issue needed further study. while that study was ongoing, mr. trump announced via tweet in july 2017 that transgender individuals would be banned from the military, surprising many. lgbtq advocacy groups filed a lawsuit in seattle in 2017 challenging the constitutionality of the ban."}

{"original": "tokyo - the bank of japan on friday said it will charge lenders that leave too much cash on idle deposit with it, introducing a negative interest rate policy for the first time as it seeks to shore up a stumbling economic recovery."}
{"original": "the surprise move rattled stock market investors, with the nikkei 225 index swinging between gains and losses after the announcement. it closed 2.8 percent higher, but the japanese yen slid, with the u.s. dollar rising to about 120.70 yen from about 118.50 earlier in the day."}
{"original": "the central bank said it's imposing a 0.1 percent fee on some new commercial bank deposits with the boj, effectively a negative interest rate. it hopes that will encourage commercial banks to lend more, rather than keeping cash at the boj, and stimulate investment and growth in the world's third-largest economy."}
{"original": "the boj said in statement that japan's economy is still recovering, but risks from volatile global financial markets could undermine confidence and slow progress toward the central bank's 2 percent inflation target."}
{"original": "bank deposits with the boj will be divided into three tiers. existing current account balances will earn a 0.1 percent positive interest rate. required reserves held at the central bank by financial institutions will earn zero interest. any additional current account deposits would incur the minus 0.1 percent rate, the boj said."}
{"original": "the bank will cut the interest rate further into negative territory if judged as necessary, it said."}
{"original": "it said the policy would continue as long as needed to achieve its inflation target. in the meantime, the boj pushed back its timeframe for achieving that goal from late 2016 to mid-2017."}
{"original": "we think there is an increasing risk that an improvement in the business confidence of japanese firms and the conversion of deflationary mindset may be delayed, and that the underlying trend in prices might be negatively affected, boj gov. haruhiko kuroda said at a news conference."}
{"original": "the european central bank has already imposed negative interest rates, after leaving interest rates near zero failed to entice banks into seeking higher returns through lending."}
{"original": "in japan, keeping interest rates near zero has likewise failed to yield the desired results, raising doubts about the credibility of the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing policies announced by boj gov. haruhiko kuroda in april, 2013."}
{"original": "data on friday showed japan's core inflation rate for 2015, excluding volatile food prices, at 0.5 percent."}
{"original": "that and other figures show the economy remained anemic last year, as stagnant incomes, the slowdown in china and the mixed blessing of lower oil prices hobbled prime minister shinzo abe's recovery strategy."}
{"original": "consumer spending fell 4.4 percent in december from a year earlier, as households chose to save rather than splurge on any gains from the low oil prices that are slowing inflation. it was the fourth straight month of year-on-year spending declines."}

{"original": "the central bank said friday it would also persist with its quantitative easing purchases of about 80 trillion yen (about $660 billion) of government bonds a year."}
{"original": "the aim is to end a long spell of deflation, or falling prices, that is thought to be discouraging corporate investment. indeed, corporate profits have soared as massive stimulus weakened the japanese currency, making earnings made abroad worth more when converted into yen. but investment and wages have lagged."}
{"original": "average incomes fell 2.9 percent from a year earlier in december. even though unemployment was steady at 3.3 percent and the job market remained tight, companies wary over the economic outlook are opting not to raise pay."}

{"original": "president trump's national security adviser, john bolton, said sunday the u.s. military withdrawal from northeastern syria is conditioned on defeating the remnants of the islamic state of iraq and syria (isis), and on turkey assuring the safety of kurdish fighters allied with the united states."}
{"original": "bolton, who traveled to israel to reassure the u.s. ally of the trump-ordered withdrawal, said there is no timetable for the pullout of american forces in northeastern syria. he also insisted it's not an unlimited commitment."}
{"original": "there are objectives that we want to accomplish that condition the withdrawal, bolton told reporters in jerusalem. the timetable flows from the policy decisions that we need to implement."}
{"original": "those conditions, he said, included the defeat of remnants of isis in syria, and protections for kurdish militias who have fought alongside u.s. troops against the extremist group."}
{"original": "bolton's comments mark the first public confirmation that the drawdown has been slowed, as mr. trump faced widespread criticism from allies and the resignation of defense secretary jim mattis for a policy that was to have been conducted within weeks. the u.s. military has already received orders on the drawdown."}
{"original": "mr. trump announced in mid-december that the u.s. will withdraw all of its 2,000 forces in syria. mr. trump's move has raised fears over clearing the way for a turkish assault on kurdish fighters in syria who fought alongside american troops against is extremists. turkey considers the syrian kurdish people's protection units, or ypg, a terrorist group linked to an insurgency within its own borders."}
{"original": "bolton, who is to travel on to turkey on monday, said the u.s. is insisting that its kurdish allies in the fight against isis are protected from any planned turkish offensive. he is to deliver a warning to turkish president recep tayyip erdogan this week."}

{"original": "bolton said the u.s. has asked its kurdish allies to stand fast now and refrain from seeking protection from russia or syrian president bashar al-assad's government. i think they know who their friends are, he added, speaking of the kurds."}
{"original": "he said chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen. joseph dunford would continue negotiations with his turkish counterparts this week to seek protection for america's kurdish allies in syria."}
{"original": "additionally, ambassador jim jeffrey, who has been serving since august as the special representative for syrian engagement and was named last week as the american special envoy for the anti-islamic state coalition, is to travel to syria this week in an effort to reassure the u.s.'s kurdish allies that they are not being abandoned, bolton said."}
{"original": "bolton said u.s. troops would remain at the critical area of al-tanf, in southern syria, to counter growing iranian activity in the region. he defended the legal basis for the deployment, saying it's justified by the president's constitutional authority, adding i'm a strong believer in article ii."}
{"original": "the u.s. is also seeking a satisfactory disposition for roughly 800 isis prisoners held by the u.s.-backed syrian opposition, bolton said, adding talks were ongoing with european and regional partners about the issue."}
{"original": "bolton is to have dinner israel's prime minister, benjamin netanyahu, sunday evening to discuss the pace of the u.s. drawdown, american troop levels in the region, and the u.s. commitment to push back on iranian regional expansionism. bolton was expected to explain that some u.s. troops based in syria to fight is will shift to iraq with the same mission and that the al-tanf base would remain."}
{"original": "bolton also was to convey the message that the united states is very supportive of israeli strikes against iranian targets in syria, according to a senior administration official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss bolton's plans before the meetings and spoke on condition of anonymity."}
{"original": "bolton on sunday also toured the ancient tunnels beneath the western wall in jerusalem's old city. he watched a virtual reality tour of the historic site and dined there with his israeli equivalent, as well as u.s. ambassador to israel david friedman and israel's ambassador to the u.s., ron dermer."}

{"original": "after years of rape, beatings and persecution from notorious gangs in their home countries, 12 central americans fled to the united states last year to seek asylum. but then-attorney general jeff sessions had just issued a policy change: domestic and gang violence would not be grounds for asylum."}
{"original": "they sued, and in december, a federal judge said the policy change was unlawful, and those individuals would get a second chance. but six of them had already been deported back to their native countries and, per the judges orders, ice agents are responsible for bringing them back. all of six remain in central america, and the government blames the shutdown."}
{"original": "among the plaintiffs still stuck in central america is nora, an el salvadorian women who survived years of beatings and rape by her partner, a known gang member. when nora attempted to end the relationship in may of last year, her partner's gang targeted her, threatening to rape her and kill her children."}
{"original": "in may, when nora was walking home with her three young children, [her partner's friend] pursued her down the street and told her that he knew she lived alone with her children and that he would come to her house at night to have sex with her, according to the original complaint against sessions' new asylum policy. he showed her a gun in his waistband and then looked to her son, indicating that he would kill them both if she did not submit to his demands."}
{"original": "shortly after the threat, nora and her son fled el salvador, seeking asylum in the u.s. even though an immigration officer believed her story — hers is a typical experience for women in central america — she did not pass her credible fear interview because of the new policy."}
{"original": "generally, asylum is available to anyone who fears persecution in their home country because of their affiliation with one or more of five accepted groups: race, religion, nationality, political opinion or particular social group."}
{"original": "in his december ruling on the lawsuit, the judge called the policy change arbitrary, capricious, and in violation of the immigration laws insofar as those policies are applied in credible fear proceedings."}
{"original": "of the 12 plaintiffs in the case, grace v. whitacker, six had already been deported to central america, five had been released from detention centers as they awaited removal, and one remains detained, according to jennifer chang newell, an attorney with the aclu's immigrants' rights project who worked to strike down sessions' asylum policy."}
{"original": "the judge ordered that the six who had been removed be brought back to the u.s. for immigration proceedings. but the partial government shutdown has restricted ice agents' ability to follow through, according to a status report filed by the government jan. 18. although ice agents have been able to locate nora and her son in el salvador, they haven't been successful bringing them back to the u.s. yet."}
{"original": "due to the lapse in appropriations, the normal process for paying departure and passport fees has become complicated, the report said."}
{"original": "some of the plaintiffs have had to pay their own travel document fees — despite the judge's order saying that would be the government's responsibility — and told that they would be reimbursed eventually, according to the report."}
{"original": "there's been a few logistical issues getting them back, things like travel documents, passports, parental consent and travel fees, said newell in a telephone interview with cbs news on friday."}
{"original": "as they wait, six of the plaintiffs remain in the countries and situations that prompted them to seek asylum in the first place. nora and her son continue to fear for their lives, according to the original complaint."}
{"original": "though the plaintiffs will get a second chance at asylum, thousands others won't."}
{"original": "if someone has already been removed because of the sessions decision and they weren't part of the lawsuit, they're just out of luck, said anne dutton, an attorney at the center for gender and refugee studies who also worked on the case, in a telephone interview with cbs news on friday."}
{"original": "new asylum seekers won't be held to sessions' struck-down policy on domestic and gang violence, and have the potential to seek refuge in the united states on those grounds thanks to the aclu's lawsuit. however, the relief may not last; the government appealed the decision last week."}
{"original": "what exactly happens to the plaintiffs next isn't clear. and last week's status report said part of the delay in returning the asylum seekers is because the parties do not agree on the process that will be applied to the plaintiffs once they are returned to u.s. soil."}
{"original": "the government argues that upon their arrival in the u.s., nora, her son and the other four should be detained until their credible fear interview, which could take months to schedule. lawyers representing the central americans, however, believe that they should be able to begin that process without being held in a detention center."}

{"original": "birmingham, ala.—the government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines."}
{"original": "we are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire, says 40-year-old keisha brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on birmingham's north side."}
{"original": "the mostly african-american community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the environmental protection agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house."}
{"original": "as president trump and congress battle over trump's demand for a wall on the southern u.s. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property."}
{"original": "epa's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. as an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. that's the hazard at northern california's iron mountain mine, where epa workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream."}
{"original": "practically speaking, said bonnie bellow, a former epa official who worked on superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation wholly depends on the length of the shutdown."}
{"original": "unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site, bellow said."}
{"original": "in north birmingham, brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any epa crews at people's houses. it wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work."}
{"original": "but long before the shutdown began, brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. my main concern is the health of the people out here, said brown, who has asthma. all of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day."}
{"original": "in terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site — which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts — but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed."}
{"original": "at the epa, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. it also means the epa isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. routine inspections aren't happening. state, local and private emails to epa officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends."}
{"original": "in montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said kristi ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's department of environmental quality. the epa normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies."}
{"original": "with most epa colleagues idled, ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project."}
{"original": "but it's the agency's work at superfund sites — lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities — that gets much of the attention."}
{"original": "absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown up to the point that additional epa direction or funding is needed, the epa said in a statement."}
{"original": "sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens, the agency said."}
{"original": "for federal superfund sites in michigan, the shutdown means there are no epa colleagues to consult, said scott dean, a spokesman for that state's department of environmental quality."}
{"original": "at michigan superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, dean said."}
{"original": "bellow, the former epa official, said the cancellation of hearings about superfund sites posed immediate concerns."}
{"original": "in east chicago, indiana, for example, the epa called off a planned public hearing set for last wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil."}
{"original": "the epa has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located."}
{"original": "during a public meeting nov. 29, some residents complained that the epa's approach would leave too much pollution in place. but others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said debbie chizewer, a northwestern university environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area."}
{"original": "the epa announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled."}
{"original": "leaders of the east chicago calumet community advisory group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the epa's regional superfund division."}

{"original": "despite increasing demands for the department of justice to temporarily close all the nation's immigration courts due to the coronavirus pandemic, most courts remain open. some courts have even reopened after the department confirmed people who were there tested positive for the virus."}
{"original": "ginnine fried, a government lawyer who represents a union of immigration and customs enforcement (ice) attorneys, called the decision to keep most immigration courts open absolutely outrageous."}
{"original": "now that people keep popping up positive, you can't claim plausible deniability. now it's conscious disregard for human life and safety, fried, a vice president of the american federation of federal employees' local 511, told cbs news."}
{"original": "on tuesday, 12 immigration courts were closed. two of them — the ones in varick street, new york, and elizabeth, new jersey — were closed because individuals who were there received a positive covid-19 diagnosis, according to the executive office for immigration review (eoir), the justice department branch that oversees immigration tribunals. but by wednesday morning, both facilities were again open for business."}
{"original": "the decision to reopen the varick street location is also drawing ire on facebook. one commenter on the eoir's facebook page wrote, instead of taking the necessary preemptive measures suggested by the cdc, the eoir's policy is to wait until staff contracts the virus and then close for a day. shameful."}
{"original": "federal immigration judges are also expressing concern."}
{"original": "i have never seen such callousness and cluelessness in an agency leadership, judge ashley tabaddor, president of the national association of immigration judges (naic), another union, told cbs news."}
{"original": "hearings for immigrants who are not detained by ice have been suspended until april 10. the justice department also postponed hearings scheduled through april 22 for asylum-seekers returned to mexico under the migrant protection protocols program. but hearings for detained immigrants and asylum-seekers are still moving forward and some support staff are being required to go into the office."}
{"original": "on wednesday, the justice department opened six immigration courts that had been closed, including locations hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic in new york and california, for the limited purpose of accepting filings made by lawyers."}
{"original": "failing to close all of the nation's immigration courts, both non-detained and detained settings, now will exacerbate a once-in-a-century public health crisis and lead to a greater loss of life, tabaddor said."}
{"original": "while eoir discourages continuances in cases involving detainees, except under the most extenuating of circumstances, sources say they do routinely happen. if immigration courts were to close, non-violent detainees could be released on a type of parole or could be in detention for a longer period of time. in the latter case, there is the potential for immigrants with delayed hearings to file for habeas corpus, or unlawful detention. to avoid that, immigration law groups urging the doj to close the courts have recommended that priority matters be completed over the phone and electronically. something that, they say, is not happening now."}
{"original": "in a letter to eoir on monday, the association of deportation defense attorneys wrote: requests for telephonic hearings are not being approved expeditiously, or are simply not being acted upon despite a timely request having been made."}
{"original": "most if not all, non-detention hearings are already being rescheduled. these types of cases usually involve asylum or relief from deportation. sources say non-detainment hearings are frequently postponed, often for several years, since the immigration courts' backlog is currently over 1.4 million cases. as a result, all non-detained immigrants with scheduled hearings will likely see a delay in removal proceedings."}
{"original": "there is also concern that by keeping the courts open, people will have to violate orders put in place by their local or state governments. one person posting on facebook wrote, i am an attorney doing a case pro bono in denver. i have a filing due april 8. in order to effectuate the filing i will have to violate my city's shelter in place order in order to make the required copies and then again to mail the documents or deliver them in person. i am in a r=high (sic) risk category and you are endangering my health and those of the employees at the courthouse and at the copy place. shame on you."}

{"original": "the u.s. officially exhausts its borrowing authority friday, and the treasury department will be forced to resort to so-called extraordinary measures to prevent a default on the debt – a tactic that will work until late february, treasury secretary jack lew has said repeatedly."}
{"original": "but the deadline has been greeted with nonchalance on capitol hill, where republicans have been plotting to demand something in return for raising the debt ceiling – they're just not sure what. and even though they couldn't agree on something, lawmakers shrugged, packed their bags, and left town for the weekend."}
{"original": "i think that we're still looking for the pieces to this puzzle, house speaker john boehner, r-ohio, told reporters thursday morning. but listen, he assured them, we don't want to default on our debt and we're not going to default on the debt."}
{"original": "the folks up the way on pennsylvania ave. were similarly unalarmed by the impending deadline, and seemed content to stand back and let house republicans sort out their strategy."}
{"original": "we certainly believe republican leaders who say that we have to raise the debt ceiling. it's the responsibility of congress to ensure that bills that have already been incurred are paid in a timely fashion so that the united states doesn't default, said white house press secretary jay carney."}
{"original": "carney maintains the administration's position has not changed – they will not negotiate. we are not going to pay ransom in return for congress fulfilling this basic responsibility, he said."}
{"original": "boehner and president obama have tried and failed to negotiate on fiscal issues time and time again – over the debt ceiling once before, tax and entitlement reform, the grand bargain, and the government shutdown. this time, they aren't even trying to get together to talk (though this would violate the administration's no-negotiations policy)."}
{"original": "that leaves boehner to sell his conference on deal the president hasn't had a hand in crafting. but so far, boehner isn't having much success among his fellow republicans."}
{"original": "earlier this week, house republican leaders pitched two possible trades for a year-long debt ceiling extension: approve the controversial keystone xl pipeline or repeal the risk corridors in the affordable care act, a provision that which enables the government to share in the risks and gains of the marketplace. if the cost of insuring people is lower than expected, insurers pay into a pool, and if it's higher than expected, they can draw from that pool."}
{"original": "but just a day later, neither had enough support, and both ideas were ditched."}
{"original": "now, they're kicking around a few possibilities that could even get some democratic support: patch the reimbursement formula for doctors who treat medicare patients, known as the doc fix; change the congressional budgeting processes and undo cuts to the cost-of-living formula for military retirees that were part of the budget deal negotiated last year."}
{"original": "it's unclear that any of those options will pass, and the republicans might end up having to approve an unconditional debt ceiling increase, which some members say is inevitable."}
{"original": "we've had three years of fighting over the debt ceiling, [and] unfortunately we have not been victorious in many of those fights. i think that this year the speaker should just allow the democrats to pass a clean debt ceiling, the democrats can own it, they can explain to the american people why they want to continue to increase the debt without any major reforms and we can go to the american people and we can tell them that if they get rid of [senate majority leader] harry reid we will actually make the reforms that are necessary for america to be strong again, said rep. raul labrador, r-idaho, at a regular forum featuring conservative lawmakers wednesday morning."}
{"original": "that leaves boehner in his usual position: at the head of a fractious group of lawmakers, trying to piece together enough votes to keep the government running."}
{"original": "at least he has a sense of humor about it."}

{"original": "president donald trump has long been an unlikely sweetheart for conservative and evangelical voters. now, in the lead-up to the midterm elections, the thrice-married former democrat who used to describe himself as very pro-choice is offering catnip to conservative voters with a new administration push to strip funding from planned parenthood and other family planning clinics."}
{"original": "the initiative, announced last week, has arrived just in time for mr. trump to highlight it tuesday night when he speaks at the susan b. anthony list's annual campaign for life gala. it is aimed at resurrecting parts of a reagan-era mandate banning federally funded family planning clinics from referring women for abortions, or sharing space with abortion providers."}
{"original": "marjorie dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion susan b. anthony list, says the move will help tremendously in the midterm elections."}
{"original": "it's also the latest evidence that as he frets over the russia investigation and prepares for a planned summit with north korea, mr. trump has also been focused on fulfilling campaign promises and tending to issues that galvanize his base: holding a series of events to rail against the dangers of illegal immigration, pulling out of the iran-nuclear deal and wading anew into the fight over abortion rights."}
{"original": "mr. trump is far from a natural fit for conservative voters. he recently admitted to reimbursing his lawyer for paying pay hush money to a porn star who claimed she had sex with mr. trump (a charge that he denies). and mr. trump has bragged about groping women without their permission. during the campaign, he sometimes had trouble articulating his views on abortion, at one point suggesting women should be punished for having abortions. his campaign later walked back the statement, saying that if abortion were ever outlawed, he believed that doctors who perform them should be punished."}
{"original": "nonetheless, white evangelical voters overwhelmingly supported mr. trump in 2016, and that support has only grown. a prri survey released last month found white evangelical support for mr. trump at an all-time high, with 75 percent of those polled holding a favorable view of the president and just 22 percent holding an unfavorable view. support for mr. trump within the general population in the poll stood at just 42 percent."}
{"original": "religious groups like the catholic medical association approve of a series of actions mr. trump has taken, beginning with his appointment of judges who oppose abortion rights, including supreme court justice neil gorsuch, and trump's reinstatement of the global gag rule that bars federal funding for nongovernmental organizations that provide abortion referrals."}
{"original": "mr. trump has also surrounded himself with staffers with deep ties to conservative groups, including counselor kellyanne conway and director of strategic communications mercedes schlapp."}
{"original": "ralph reed, chairman of the private faith & freedom coalition, also pointed to the president's dismantling of the iran nuclear deal and his decision to move the u.s. embassy in israel from tel aviv to jerusalem as steps that have played especially well with evangelical voters. but he said the president's actions on abortion hold special sway, in part because of trump's early struggle with the issue."}
{"original": "on a policy level, i see it as a series of promises made and promises kept. and in this case, a pro-life promise made and pro-life promise kept. and i would argue those are the most important promises to keep because he was someone who was believed, accurately or otherwise, as a recent arrival to conservatism and someone who had an ideologically mixed past, reed said."}
{"original": "reed added that as president, trump has done everything that he can to keep faith with the faith-based voters that provided him with his margin of victory in 2016."}
{"original": "when it comes to the midterms, reed said, i expect donald trump to be rewarded for these efforts by a similarly historic turnout among evangelical and other pro-life voters."}

{"original": "thanks to provocative moves by iran and less-than-coherent actions by the outgoing trump administration, the president-elect is facing an increasingly uncertain situation when it comes to iran, a decades-long american nemesis that has been a target of blame for much of the middle east's instability."}
{"original": "in the past week alone, president donald trump's team has dispatched b-52 bombers to the persian gulf in response to alleged iranian attack planning and reversed an order to bring home the uss nimitz, the only u.s. aircraft carrier in the region."}
{"original": "on monday, iran not only announced it had resumed advanced uranium enrichment in violation of the 2015 nuclear deal but also seized a south korean-flagged oil tanker and its crew. this combustible combination coming just two weeks before the president-elect's inauguration threatens to derail or at least delay biden's hopes to return the u.s. to the nuclear accord that trump withdrew from in 2018."}
{"original": "below is a look at the latest developments:"}
{"original": "concerns have run high for some weeks about iran stoking tensions, particularly around the january 3 one-year anniversary of the u.s. killing of a top iranian general in iraq. u.s. officials have been on heightened alert for possible retaliation from iran, including from allied militia in iraq that have previously launched rockets at u.s. facilities in the country."}
{"original": "on monday iran said it had ramped up its enrichment of uranium to 20% purity – not high enough to make a nuclear weapon, but a significant step closer to that level."}
{"original": "it is a move in a concerning direction, particularly because a state that can enrich to 20%, which technically qualifies as high-enriched uranium, can go all the way to what is called weapons-grade uranium, which is usually 90-plus percent, behnam ben taleblu, a senior fellow at the foundation for defense of democracies, told cbsn on tuesday."}
{"original": "he said the enrichment upgrade meant that iran has done the lion's share of the work to get closer to a weapon."}
{"original": "meanwhile, iran seized a south korean chemical tanker this week, claiming it was posing a danger to the environment. taleblu said there was a clear precedent of iran seizing vessels ahead of diplomatic meetings with foreign officials to try to extort states for money."}
{"original": "the south korean ship was seized ahead of a planned visit by south korea's president to tehran. as taleblu explained, south korea controls a significant sum of iranian state money in an escrow account, but has adhered to u.s. sanctions and not allowed tehran to access it."}
{"original": "this is iran both trying to put pressure on south korea to release the funds, as well as trying to get u.s. partners… who are reliant on persian gulf oil, on persian gulf trade, to put pressure on washington to cease this policy of sanctions, he said."}
{"original": "although neither the enrichment announcement nor the seizure of the south korean ship appeared linked to the death of iran's general in iraq, the two moves did raise tensions in the region, which has long been unpredictable."}
{"original": "part of the worry is that a single wrong move — or intentional provocation — has the potential to trigger war."}
{"original": "there is no sign the u.s. is planning an attack on iran, although trump has said he would respond to any attack by iran or its affiliated militias in iraq that resulted in the death of an american. the u.s. military has long had a wide variety of weapons and troops in the middle east that could be called on if hostilities broke out. but trump himself has derided the idea of getting further mired in middle east wars."}
{"original": "the scenario that worries u.s. military officials is iran conducting an attack, either inside iraq or elsewhere in the gulf region, that would prompt trump to retaliate, leading to escalation that could spark a wider war. that is part of the reason the u.s. has kept an aircraft carrier in the region on a near-continuous basis since may 2019, when the white house first asserted that iran was planning attacks on u.s. personnel."}
{"original": "the highly unusual nimitz flip-flop by the acting secretary of defense, christopher miller, seemed to undercut u.s. central command's efforts to convince iran that it would not pay to launch an attack on u.s. forces."}
{"original": "the huge vessel, with a complement of attack and support aircraft, was literally leaving the region when it received word to turn around and head back."}
{"original": "the aircraft carrier uss nimitz phil mislinski/getty"}
{"original": "sending the nimitz home had been on the table for weeks, since the carrier was on a lengthy deployment and was scheduled to be home by the end of 2020. its tour was extended by a few weeks to provide backup for u.s. troop withdrawals in afghanistan, iraq and somalia. but as tensions with iran rose in mid-december, central command wanted to keep the nimitz nearby. instead, on december 31, miller announced that he had ordered it to return home. three days later, he reversed himself and said it would stay."}
{"original": "cancelling the go-home order for the nimitz took some defense officials by surprise, suggesting that the decision may have been made at the white house rather than as a result of new arguments from military officers."}
{"original": "these long-range bomber flights aren't commonplace, but they've become a bit more routine in recent weeks as a show of military might. there have been three b-52 bomber missions to the region in less than two months, most recently on december 30."}
{"original": "the roundtrip flights from the united states are meant to show how quickly bombers can get to the area. they can be equipped with either conventional or nuclear missiles."}
{"original": "a missile, in white, launches from a b-52 bomber during a weapons test. mike cassidy/u.s. air force"}
{"original": "marine gen. frank mckenzie, the top u.s. commander for the middle east, made the message clear this week, saying: we do not seek conflict, but no one should underestimate our ability to defend our forces or to act decisively in response to any attack."}
{"original": "biden's transition team has declined to comment in detail about the latest developments and what they may mean for their plans, but biden and his top national security aides have laid out their approach to iran in broad strokes."}
{"original": "top of that list is bringing iran back into compliance with the nuclear deal and then expanding that pact to take into account non-nuclear behavior that wasn't covered by the initial agreement."}
{"original": "iran, however, has said it will only return to compliance if the u.s. rejoins the deal and rescinds sanctions that trump reimposed over the past two years. at the same time, biden aides have said iran cannot win sanctions relief unless and until it respects the deal."}
{"original": "iran's latest actions, coupled with the trump administration's movement of forces, complicate diplomacy and raise the risk of miscalculation, particularly as tensions continue to run high between iran and its neighbors."}
{"original": "the increased tensions, which have triggered the highest alert levels for u.s. personnel in iraq, may make it difficult for the incoming biden administration to pivot the military more aggressively toward russia and china."}
{"original": "the daughters of an american man detained in syria for nearly two years are speaking out and publicly asking president trump to bring their father home. majd kamalmaz was arrested in damascus in 2017. since then his daughters, ula and maryam, have been working quietly with the state department to find their father."}

{"original": "the syrian government, like i suppose many adversarial governments to the u.s., want leverage against the u.s., want ways to put pressure on the u.s., foreign policy expert paul salem said."}
{"original": "salem, president of the middle east institute, said the hostile relations between the u.s. and syria make the cases for tice and kamalmaz more difficult."}
{"original": "the syrian regime probably detained him in order to get washington's attention and perhaps to negotiate towards normalizing relations with syria, salem said."}
{"original": "kamalmaz immigrated to the u.s. when he was six years old and became a dual-citizen."}
{"original": "we're american in every way possible. don't let this fool you. i mean, my father always taught us that this is your country, we're not going anywhere. we were all born and raised here, maryam said."}

{"original": "in a rare split between two democratic candidates who have so far been friendly on the campaign trail, senator elizabeth warren on sunday said that she's disappointed by a report that senator bernie sanders' campaign had prepared a negative script for volunteers to use about her. sanders appeared to dismiss the criticism, calling it a bit of a media blow-up."}
{"original": "politico first reported on the script, which has not been challenged by sanders or his campaign. according to politico, campaign volunteers were told to say people who support her are highly-educated, more affluent people who are going to show up and vote democratic no matter what and that she's bringing no new bases into the democratic party."}
{"original": "warren, who was campaigning sunday in iowa, told reporters that she was disappointed to hear that bernie is sending his volunteers out to trash me."}
{"original": "bernie knows me, and has known me for a long time, warren said. he knows who i am, where i come from, what i have worked on and more, and the coalition and grassroots movement. we're trying to build democrats we want to win. in 2020, we all saw the impact of the factionalism in 2016, and we can't have a repeat of that."}
{"original": "sanders has been dogged by criticism since 2016 of sowing division within the democratic party, but warren has so far avoided taking part in that particular line of attack. sanders and warren, the leading candidates on the left, have so far refrained from attacking each other on the campaign trail and at the debates. they both will be at tuesday's debate, along with former vice president joe biden, former south bend mayor pete buttigieg, senator amy klobuchar and tom steyer."}
{"original": "sanders, who was also campaigning in iowa, on sunday called warren a very good friend of mine and said no one is going to trash elizabeth."}
{"original": "we have hundreds of employees, sanders said. elizabeth warren has hundreds of employees. and people sometimes say things they shouldn't."}
{"original": "warren's campaign sunday night sent out a fundraising email focused on sanders."}
{"original": "this type of attack isn't about disagreeing on issues — it's about dismissing the potency of our grassroots movement, campaign manager roger lau wrote. let's be clear: as a party, and as a country, we can't afford to repeat the factionalism of the 2016 primary."}
{"original": "i have all the respect in the world for bernie sanders, but when talking about our movement, his campaign has it backwards, the email continues. i hope he reconsiders what he's encouraging."}
{"original": "sanders and warren are locked in a tight race in iowa, which will caucus on february 3. a des moines register/cnn/mediacom poll released earlier this week had sanders leading with 20%, followed by warren at 17%, buttigieg at 16% and biden at 15%."}
{"original": "the sanders campaign, meanwhile, focused this weekend on biden. in south carolina, where biden has a sizable lead, campaign surrogate nina turner wrote an op-ed in the newspaper the state titled while bernie sanders has always stood up for african americans, joe biden has repeatedly let us down. senior campaign adviser jeff weaver attacked biden campaign surrogate john kerry for saying biden wasn't voting for war in the 2002 iraq vote."}

{"original": "at issue is tinder's 2015 decision to charge customers 30 and older a $19.99 monthly fee for its tinder plus feature, for which younger people pay $9.99 to $14.99. plaintiff allen candelore filed suit seeking class-action status against tinder, alleging the company's pricing constituted unfair competition and violated california's unruh civil rights act. a spokesperson for tinder couldn't be reached."}
{"original": "the service, where people swipe right on their smartphones to accept a potential match, is part of the internet company match, also the corporate parent of match.com and okcupid. tinder plus allows users to change their location so they can find potential dates anywhere in the world and a rewind feature that lets users undo a left-swipe reject."}
{"original": "tinder, which claims more than 26 million matches every day, charged lower rates for younger consumers because its market research showed that they were less able to afford premium services. a three-judge panel of the los angeles county superior court, however, rejected tinder's justification for the difference in charges."}
{"original": "no matter what tinder's market research may have shown about the younger users' relative income and willingness to pay for the service, as a group, as compared to the older cohort, some individuals will not fit the mold, the 26-page ruling said. some older consumers will be 'more budget constrained' and less willing to pay than some in the younger group. … because nothing in the complaint suggests there is a strong public policy that justifies the alleged discriminatory pricing. … accordingly, we swipe left, and reverse."}
{"original": "candelore has been involved in other high-profile lawsuits. he is a member of the nonprofit national coalition for men (ncfm), which seeks to raise awareness about how men and boys are affected by sex discrimination. mother jones reported in 2016 that candelore and two other ncfm members filed suit in california against business networking and golf events in recent years that were open only to women. both cases were later settled for an undisclosed amount of money."}
{"original": "al rava, who represents candelore in the tinder case, also served as counsel in the networking and golf course cases. he has cited the unruh act in many of the more than 150 discrimination cases he has filed over the past decade, including a challenge to an oakland athletics' giveaway of baseball hats to female fans that was eventually settled."}
{"original": "in fact, i have been victorious in all my unruh civil rights act sex-discrimination lawsuits because, as a result of these lawsuits, every defendant stopped its unequal treatment of male and female consumers,' rava said. he added that the tinder lawsuit isn't related to the ncfm."}

{"original": "margaret brennan: mister secretary, we are in the middle of this shutdown, and i know a number of state department employees are not getting paid, including a quarter of u.s. employees in foreign countries. you've been going to u.s. embassies. what are you telling staff about when they can expect a paycheck?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo (secretary of state/@secpompeo): look, it-- it's unfortunate that we're in the shutdown, i-- i wish we weren't, too. i-- i hope that it's resolved quickly and i've certainly told our-- our teams that. but you have to know these great americans who are working in our embassies around the world. they understand the mission. they understand its importance. they understand that whether the government is open or closed they have a task to do and they are hard at it."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: well, i do want to ask you since we are so focused on what's happening with this shutdown here at home, the state department when it comes to the border issues has issued a report in 2017 about counterterrorism and it says that there is no credible evidence that international terrorist groups have established bases in mexico or sent operatives via mexico into the united states. it adds the southern border is vulnerable, but terrorist groups likely seek other means of trying to enter the united states. how does this match with the claim that there is a border security crisis?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: margaret, make-- make no mistake about it, margaret, keeping our southern border secure is an important national security component, it's-- it's critical that we do that well. there's a real risk to the united states of america. we need to take this seriously. we need to secure our southern border. we need to make sure that those who want to do us harm don't have a way to access us in that way. there are many things we have to do. one of the reasons i'm in the middle east is to work on prevailing against terror. there are lots of elements of this but border security is a certain and impor-- certainly an important component."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: so is the state department report wrong to say that this is not how terrorists are trying to enter the united states?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: margaret, terrorists try to get into our country lots of ways. one of the ways they can come in is across our southern border. what you saw was an unclassified report. make no mistake about it, terrorists will always find the weakest link. and we need to make sure that the weakest link in our national security isn't our southern border."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: i want to get to your trip through the middle east, but i first want to ask you about this new york times report that says right after president trump fired former fbi director james comey, the fbi began investigating whether president trump himself was a potential threat to national security and whether he'd been working for russia or unintentionally influenced by moscow. what is your reaction to this?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: i'm not going to comment on new york times stories, but i'll certainly say this: the-- the notion that president trump is a threat to american national security is absolutely ludicrous."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: just to clarify since you were cia director, did you have any idea that this investigation was happening?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: margaret-- margaret-- margaret, i-- i've answered this question repeatedly indeed on your show. the-- the idea that's contained in the new york times story that president trump was a threat to american national security is-- is silly on its face and not worthy of a response."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: one of the reasons you're in the middle east is to reassure and explain to some of our allies what the u.s. policy in syria is. so i'd like you to do that for us today because the pentagon announced yesterday that it actually has begun its withdrawal from syria. yet the u.s. national security adviser john bolton said that wouldn't happen until two things: one, the u.s. defeated isis; and two, turkey assured us it wouldn't go after our kurdish allies. have those two conditions been met?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: margaret, the president's guidance is incredibly clear. the roughly two thousand uniformed soldiers that are in syria today are going to be withdrawn that-- that activity is underway. we're going to do so in an orderly and deliberate way. a way that protects america's national security, a way that allows us to continue the important mission that they were on--the counterterrorism mission. the effort to make sure that with the destruction of isis is not only complete, but that their resurgence is not possible. our efforts to counter the threat from terrorism stemming from the islamic republic of iran. those are all real missions. the tactical change we've made in the withdrawal of those two thousand troops is just that--a tactical change. mission remains the same."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: so has turkey's president promised you not to attack our kurdish allies?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: yeah. look, when president erdogan and president trump spoke, they talked about this issue. the turks have made clear that they understand that there are folks down in syria that have their rights. we also want to make sure that those in syria aren't attacking-- terrorists aren't attacking turkey from syria. we're fully engaged. ambassador jeffrey is in-- fully engaged in conversations with the turks as well as with the sdf in syria to make sure that we accomplish all of those missions. we can-- we can do each of those things. margaret."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: the sdf among some of the fighters that we were talking about kurdish allies there. just to explain for our audience."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: i want to ask you here, though--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: --because you know as a diplomat the-- the threat of credible use of military force is what gives you power at the negotiating table. how does taking out u.s. troops from syria get you any closer to expelling iran?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: margaret, the united states of america can project military power from lots of places in the world. the absence of a couple thousand soldiers on the ground in syria in no way materially diminishes the capacity of the united states of america and our amazing armed forces to deliver american power to accomplish our objectives anywhere in the world. that certainly includes in syria. it certainly includes into iran if need be. we still have those tools. american diplomats still have that leverage and that power standing behind them. i'm very confident in our military capabilities here in the middle east."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: so by that, are you saying that having u.s. troops in nearby iraq will fill any kind of vacuum left by pulling out of syria?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: margaret, we have lots of tools in the arsenal. i was out visiting some amazing warriors out at navcent yesterday in bahrain. we have an enormous amount of american military capacity. our-- our ability to achieve what we need to do militarily is there. my task as america's secretary of state is to make sure that we don't have to use that tool. that we get the diplomatic outcomes to secure the middle east and keep it stable and protect the american people as well."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: when it comes to iran, the trump admin-- administration has taken some, you know, confrontational tactics here, pulling out of the nuclear accord saying that iranian threats would be matched here. but we saw this week another american--a navy vet--michael white, has been behind iranian bars since july. so the trump administration is not stopping iran from taking americans hostage. what is happening with this american?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: this administration is proud of the work that we've done to get americans released all across the world. with respect to that michael white case, in particular, i can't say much. it's an ongoing consular matter. but the american people should know we take the security of every american, wherever they are traveling in the world as one of our foremost priorities. we will continue to work to get each of them back. and your point-- your point about the islamic republic of iran is spot on. it's why the jcopa was such a horrible idea. many americans are being held there today that were taken by the iranian regime. these are a group of people who are among the worst terrorists in the world and who have the least respect for human rights in the world. and it's why this administration has taken the very hard line you just described against iran."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: is the trump administration open to a prisoner swap with iran?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: i'm not going to talk about something like that."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: well, i ask you because michael white's mother spoke to cbs and she said she would like the administration to negotiate for her son. she said, what is a human life worth? i would like the u.s. to negotiate. i want him home. what can you tell her you're doing to bring her son home?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: i have great sympathy for the families of those americans who are wrongfully detained all across the world. and we do everything we can every day to get their return. we use our diplomatic tools in every corner of the world, to reach out to these places to get these young men and women home. we're intent to do that in iran. we're intent to do that all across the world. we-- we take this-- this obligation as a solemn one. and this administration's had quite a few successes. i hope we have more."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: potentially open to negotiations then?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: we're using every tool that we have in our arsenal to get these americans back home, wherever we find them."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: ambassador bolton said the next summit with kim jong-un would be in january or february. we're in that window. when will we see president trump sit down with the north korean leader?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: we're working out the details, margaret. you'll be among the first to know."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: i know, sir, you're at the end of this trip, you will be headed to saudi arabia. it has been about a hundred days since washington post journalist jamal khashoggi was brutally murdered. will you raise this issue with mohammed bin salman, the crown prince?"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: then what will you say?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo: i'll say what-- margaret, i'll say what we have said consistently. america's position both privately and publicly is the same. this was an outrageous act, an unacceptable murder. those who were responsible will be held accountable by the united states of america. we're determined to do that. we're determined to get at the facts just as quickly and as comprehensively as we can. we've had a policy that's been remarkably consistent with respect to this. we-- we-- we, we like the rest of the world value human rights all across the globe. and the murder of jamal khashoggi was outrageous and we'll hold those responsible accountable. and then we'll talk about all the important things we do with the kingdom of saudi arabia and all the support they provide to keep americans in kansas and colorado and california and in washington, dc, safe."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: mister secretary, thank you very much for your time. safe travels."}
{"original": "mike pompeo: margaret, thank you very much. you have a great day."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: we turn now to house republican leader kevin mccarthy. congressman, you're usually in your home state in california when we talk to you so we like having you here in person in snowy dc."}
{"original": "representative kevin mccarthy (house minority leader/@gopleader/r-california): thanks for having me."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: i want to get to this washington post report before we talk about the shutdown. it-- it says that the president has tried to conceal the substance of his conversations with vladimir putin, even taking away the notes from his translator who sat in-- the interpreter in the room during their talks. does it concern you that there's no public record of what the president discussed with vladimir putin, the leader of the country that interfered in the 2016 elections?"}
{"original": "representative kevin mccarthy: well, margret, what i do know is what this administration, this congress has done. we've been very tough on russia. look at the sanctions that we have taken. with this administration: one, on the election meddling that russia has done, the movement of russia with inside ukraine as well. and i just listened to the president last night. he's more than willing to have an open to what that discussion was about he said on a news show last night. but i know what the president likes to do. he likes to create a personal relationship, build that relationship, even rebuild that relationship like he does with other world leaders around."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: but this was keeping the record of the conversation from the national security adviser. the person who is supposed to be the top adviser to the president."}
{"original": "representative kevin mccarthy: well, in hearing the president last night on the show, he says he was more than willing to let that information go out. so that's what i know right now."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: does congress want to see any of this? or speak to the interpreter?"}
{"original": "representative kevin mccarthy: i'd like to-- the president to be able to build these relationships. i know this administration. i know this congress is very tough on russia. and we will continue to be so. but i want this president to be able to build the relationship, even on a personal level with all the world leaders as well."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: i know you speak to the president, have you ever asked him about this?"}
{"original": "representative kevin mccarthy: i haven't asked him about this situation, yet, because it just came out. but i did talk to the president yesterday about the shutdown. i know this president is focused on giving this government open. that's why the president is here. that's why i am here in washington. the challenge has been from the very beginning the president has made numerous offers about this shutdown. reasonable too, moving further to the democratic side. and there has not been one offer coming back from the democrats. it is unacceptable that eight hundred thousand u.s. employees are not being paid. you know what we're arguing over? one-tenth of one percent of the federal budget. and it's not as though we're asking democrats to do something they haven't done before. they voted for border wall and fencing. we have democrats, even the new progressives from california. katie hill, says she would vote for a wall. you had the chairman--"}

{"original": "representative kevin mccarthy: well, who in america believes in border security, doesn't have some form of a barrier? because i've heard democrats say they want a form of a barrier. the president has moved from a concrete to a steel barrier. so i've watched this president look for compromise. there just has been no compromise on the other side."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: but should you reopen the government while you have this argument?"}
{"original": "representative kevin mccarthy: we can have this government reopened. the president is correct. less than forty-five minutes--"}

{"original": "representative kevin mccarthy: it's one tenth of one percent of the federal budget. if we cannot do this together, what else can we not do in the future? this is not that big of a problem. democrats in the past have voted for fencing and for wall. why, now, do they disagree? because it's president trump? i think the american public understands this. we can solve this in minutes and these-- these workers should be able to be paid. it only takes a few minutes inside the meetings, but when the democrats will not even make a counteroffer, it's unacceptable."}

{"original": "margaret brennan: with dozens of democrats considering a 2020 presidential bid on saturday the former mayor of san antonio, julián castro, became the latest candidate. castro gained national attention when he delivered the keynote address at the 2012 democratic convention and he was also secretary of housing and urban development during the obama administration. the grandson of a mexican immigrant, julian castro has already been endorsed by a democratic member of congress, his twin brother, joaquin. and julian castro joins us from the site of his announcement."}
{"original": "the president visited your home state of texas this week, went to the border, said there is a humanitarian and national security crisis. do you agree with him that there is a crisis at the border?"}
{"original": "julián castro (d-presidential candidate/@juliancastro/former housing and urban development secretary): what i believe is that he's created a tragedy at the border. this policy of separating children from their parents and the terrible way that customs and border protection has managed its responsibilities, including the deaths of two children within the last few weeks. that's a real tragedy."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: well, that family separation policy has been paused at least. but there are a record number of family units crossing the border and that creates a lot of challenges. so what would you do?"}
{"original": "julián castro: i don't believe that we should have family detention for people that are seeking asylum or refugee status, so that we should develop other ways to ensure that people are processed, that we're able to keep track of them in the country."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: you were critical even under the obama administration, specifically about their high level of deportations. so what do you offer as an alternative if you're not going to detain and you're not going to deport what do you do with illegal immigrants?"}
{"original": "julián castro: well, what i believe we could do and what the obama administration did do i believe toward the end of its tenure was to look at things like ankle monitors so that you're able to monitor where people are in the country. but we also need to be serious about recognizing the right of people to seek asylum. and the president is playing games with this, blocking people's right to seek asylum. i would change that. i would make sure that we push as hard as possible for comprehensive immigration reform so that for the people who are already here, if they've been law abiding, if they pay a fine, that-- that they can get an earned path to citizenship."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: you announced your candidacy and almost immediately the rnc issued a statement. i want to read it here to you. it says, julián castro has made history by becoming one of the biggest lightweights to ever run for president. he was a weak mayor who couldn't even handle being hud secretary. this is obviously just another desperate attempt to become someone else's running mate. these are sharp words, but it's the first official attack on you. how do you respond and-- and how do you explain why you are qualified to be commander-in-chief?"}
{"original": "julián castro: you know they're going to use those kinds of words for every single democrat that decides to run for president. i wouldn't put too much stock in that. i would just say to the american people directly, i've had executive experience. i have led one of the largest, most diverse cities in the country. i've led a federal agency at hud and-- and done some great work to expand opportunity. i know what it takes to ensure that we have a government that functions well and to help inspire people. i also have a life experience that i think resonates with a lot of americans. you know i'm here in my neighborhood that i grew up in. grew up in a single parent household, went to the public schools here in san antonio. was able to go to college and law school and to reach my american dream. and i am motivated to make sure that every american can reach their dreams."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: well, some of the things you outlined as part of your platform, medicare for all, universal access to prekindergarten education, a green new deal, these put you in the more liberal or progressive wing of the democratic party. so one of the challenges for you is how do you attract centrists or people who perhaps were alienated by the president but aren't comfortable with being so reliant on the government as their main provider?"}
{"original": "julián castro: what i hear out there is that there are a lot of folks, a lot of people, who want us to invest in universal health care. and i'm under no illusion that accomplishing something like medicare for all would be easy. but i do believe that in this nation, in the richest nation on earth, that not a single person should be without health care when they need it."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: so what is that going to cost taxpayers? you've got to make some real changes there to be able to pay for it."}
{"original": "julián castro: no, you do. there's no question that it's going to take several things. i think it's going to take asking wealthier individuals to pay their fair share."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: what does that mean?"}
{"original": "julián castro: we've had basically the-- the last forty years essentially of-- of lower and lower commitment on people at the very top. same thing goes for corporations. we have corporations-- multinational corporations that are hardly paying anything in federal taxes."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: you want to increase the corporate tax rate?"}
{"original": "julián castro: we need to ask them to pay their fair share. i think that we can consider different ways, different proposals, to be able to raise more revenue from, you know, the wealthiest corporations."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: all right. we will be tracking you and your campaign. thank you so much for joining us."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: there will be more of our interview on our website at facethenation.com. we will be back in a moment."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: we will be right back with a lot more face the nation, including our political panel and former homeland security secretary jeh johnson. stay with us."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: welcome back to face the nation. for some expert analysis on the government shutdown, the emerging 2020 presidential race and so much more we would like to welcome our political panel. jeffrey goldberg is the editor-in-chief of the atlantic, seung min kim covers the white house from capitol hill for the washington post, david nakamura is a white house reporter for the washington post, and michael crowley is the white house and national security editor at politico. seung min kim, let me start with you. did you hear any signs of progress from what leader mccarthy talked about today?"}
{"original": "seung min kim (the washington post/@seungminkim): there is no signs of progress anywhere that we've seen in the last several days. we don't get a way out of the shutdown at least legislatively if three people aren't talking. that's the president, nancy pelosi, and chuck schumer. and by all accounts they are not having any discussions right now after the president reportedly stormed out of that meeting in the situation room on wednesday at the white house. and that's why there seems to be sort of a sense of inevitability or at least there was until friday about the president declaring a national emergency as kind of a way out of the shutdown. although the president seem to kind of scale that back in his latest comments at the white house on friday. but there are concerns with that as well. i mean we-- first of all, it's not a guarantee that the government reopens."}
{"original": "seung min kim: congressman mark meadows, who is a trump ally on capitol hill told us that he's like i don't really know why people think that just because the president does this the government will reopen. so that was kind of a sign for us that perhaps this isn't the easiest way out and also the concern among republicans about declaring this national emergency. you've gotten some pretty strong pushback from senior republicans saying this could be an abuse of executive power. something they talked a lot about under the obama administration."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: michael, we're hearing, you know, the white house seems to be focusing in on speaker pelosi and the opposition in the house. they seem to be seeing an opportunity with some of these new freshmen democrats who've been elected from districts that otherwise have been supportive of trump. what do you make of this as a strategy? can you actually pick them off? do you get anywhere by doing so?"}
{"original": "michael crowley (politico/@michaelcrowley): sure. i mean, i guess, it's-- i don't know, if it's arbitrage or the concept where you can exploit a gap between evidence of the president's past support and then a democrat maybe in theory over performing in that same place. so those are the natural targets you go for. i haven't seen a lot of evidence that they are strategically hitting those targets so far. and i know that we've reported at politico that there are white house allies who want to see the president, for instance, go in to some of those districts or have white house officials, you know, hold events in these members' districts really put the pressure on them with local media and try to exploit that tension between a district that was pro-trump in sixteen and maybe one pro-democrat in eighteen and really put them on the spot. but, you know, fundamentally, what's so interesting here is the president really just seems to be doubling down on this base strategy, the one that he went for in 2018. and it seems like we're kind of setting the stage for the 2020 presidential campaign. and the president may feel that he just absolutely has to keep that base, but that base is fortyish percent. and it's going to be tough for him to win reelection if he doesn't do something more broadly. so it's going to be interesting to see--"}
{"original": "michael crowley: --if he remains dug in on that."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: and-- and to that point we have some cbs news polling that we've done and it seems that the president's approval rating is low in terms of how he is handling this shutdown, down to about thirty-five percent. of course, for congressional republicans it's even lower than that--just twenty-one percent. so this, is it necessarily a political win or could it be?"}
{"original": "david nakamura (the washington post/@davidnakamura): well, that's a great point. the-- we have also a new poll out today from the washington post, though, that shows something interesting, which is that, although a majority of the country does blame the president much more than democrats for the shutdown, it also said that support for a border wall has actually spiked among republicans at large--by sixteen points over the past year as the president keeps talking about this. and i'm sure the president is seeing that and saying, look, this is broadly popular, not just among the base of the republican party but eighty-seven percent, according to this poll we have out today of the republicans support it. seventy percent of republicans strongly support a border wall. so the president is reading that and he really believes that his strategy is working despite this idea that he is going to take the blame the longer this goes on."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: it's interesting you say that the cbs news poll, in terms of how you build the wall, shows that about two-thirds, sixty-seven percent of americans oppose declaring a national emergency to get us there. and-- and it looks like it really breaks down along partisan lines, jeff."}
{"original": "jeffrey goldberg (the atlantic/@jeffreygoldberg): right. right. i mean, a national emergency might actually be the only way out of this impasse because it doesn't seem likely. i was talking this week to one of the new democrats, going to the opposite of your point."}
{"original": "jeffrey goldberg: one of the-- not the most famous new democrat on the hill, but one of the--"}
{"original": "jeffrey goldberg: --one of the new ones. and there is a-- there is a strong ideological feeling that you can't give in on-- on any-- any compromise, even a compromise that gets them daca or something else, which is a kind of interesting mirror of what you're seeing in the republican base, which is wall or-- or nothing at all. so you have everybody dug in and you have no negotiating going on. i'm always struck in these moments by the fact that the president, who allegedly is one of the world's great negotiators, isn't much of a negotiator at all. so i just don't-- i don't-- i don't see-- i don't see this resolving itself anytime soon."}
{"original": "david nakamura: if-- if anything-- we had a-- a year ago, there was a big debate over immigration. this idea, he traded a border wall funding for legalization for these dreamers. the president then turned that down by all accounts and asked for more. he said, we want to cut legal immigration, we want to speed up deportations, change laws that democrats didn't agree with and many, even moderate republicans don't want to change, which is providing some protection legally to immigrant children who're coming across. since then, he has made it tougher by the policies he's enacted unilaterally--the separations at the border in june of children from their parents, sending troops to the border during the campaign."}
{"original": "david nakamura: from the democrats i talked to, they said this has made us even less-- more-- more skeptical of him that he either-- either take a deal. but also his policies are so inhumane, in their mind, we're not going to give him any ground on the wall."}
{"original": "jeffrey goldberg: skepticism. that's even more salient is the skepticism of the core of the trump's base worrying ann coulter-base, let's call it, worrying that he is going to give in. he's extraordinarily sensitive to that. that's why there is really not much hope for negotiating a settlement to this anytime soon because he's so worried about that that core of the core."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: seung min, when we heard from senator graham last week on this show, he was saying one of the things most offensive to him as representative of republicans was this accusation that somehow in their calls for border security they're being called racists. i thought it was interesting to hear from-- from leader mccarthy here that when it comes to those accusations within his party right now around this iowa republican steve king that that he wants to take a stand on this."}
{"original": "seung min kim: i found it really fascinating, as well. i mean, i-- those comments from leader mccarthy on your show just a few minutes ago was probably among the strongest condemnations that we have heard from senior house republicans about congressman king's rhetoric and behavior. and i found it really interesting when he said, quote, actions will be taken against congressman king--"}
{"original": "seung min kim: -- that he's meeting with him tomorrow to discuss this issue."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: it sounds like he may be losing his committee memberships."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: there will be action taken against in the meeting. he will be downgraded."}
{"original": "seung min kim: that was my-- that was my assumption when-- because that's usually what--"}
{"original": "seung min kim: --a party leader can do. the congressional black caucus has called for congressman king to be stripped of his committee assignments. and it's just interesting because congressman king has been controversial for a very long time. i mean i'm-- i'm from iowa, so i'm familiar with his rhetoric. but-- and he said things about immigration during the immigration debate a few years ago. but you are seeing this rise in very vocal condemnations of his rhetoric. i mean, it wasn't just leader mccarthy, senator joni ernst from iowa called those remarks racist and said they are not representative of the state."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: --had the bet on it."}
{"original": "seung min kim: exactly, as well. so it's-- so the-- the rise in opposition against what he's-- what the congressman has been saying, you know, frankly for a long time has been interesting to watch."}
{"original": "michael crowley: and that's really important because we're at a moment in this country where people worry that certain kinds of rhetoric are being normalized and that the--"}
{"original": "michael crowley: --that the parameters of debate are expanding to areas that would have been intolerable a few years ago. and you think about, for instance, what happened in charlottesville in the degree that there was some-- some-- almost a tacit approval of that or even when the president said there were, you know, find people on both sides in charlottesville."}
{"original": "michael crowley: it's nice to see that people are pushing back. they are still to some degree enforcing those norms of conversation."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: i also want to ask you, seung min, to clarify something. leader mccarthy mentioned, i'm not in puerto rico, i'm here in washington. what was the point he was trying to make there?"}
{"original": "seung min kim: --there is-- yeah. so there is a contingent of congressional democrats who are on-- in nevada and puerto rico right now for a super pac. the optics are great, i will say--"}
{"original": "seung min kim: --during the shutdown. and there is, obviously-- because a lot of the shutdown is a messaging war and optics war. and you-- leader mccarthy-- kevin mccarthy made a point of saying, look, i am here in dc. i am ready to work. he pointed out that he is usually in california when-- when you speak to him."}
{"original": "seung min kim: and there is some unhappiness among democratic quarters that that trip happened this week."}
{"original": "jeffrey goldberg: i am old enough to remember when people thought that puerto rico was a natural republican stronghold, by the way. but it doesn't seem like the party believes that anymore."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: no. if we did-- when we looked at the-- the group, the delegation that did go to puerto rico, it looks like speaker pelosi decided not to go though she had been originally expected to be there. so it-- it is an optics war, it's a rhetoric war. and, unfortunately, it doesn't sound like there is much traction to getting anything done."}
{"original": "but i want to take a quick break, come back because there is a lot more we need to sort through here. so we're going to take a short break. stay with us, more from our panel."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: and we are back now with our panel. we started off the show with speaker, excuse me, with secretary of state mike pompeo talking about his trip through the middle east. jeff, can you tell me what the syria policy is of the trump administration?"}
{"original": "jeffrey goldberg: it's the best policy. all the best policies. that's the problem in understanding and probably doing commentary on our foreign policies that we have so many foreign policies at once. this secretary did a-- made a valiant effort to suggest that we are not withdrawing from syria even though we're actually withdrawing from syria. and-- and the people who are coming out of syria, the americans troops, even if they are coming out in an orderly fashion, as he said, are there to fight terrorists. and it's very, very hard to make the case that you're doubling down your fight against terrorism when you're leaving. the-- the core of the problem is that the president he works for is isolationist by disposition. doesn't understand why we're in the middle east at all. mike pompeo comes from another tradition, quite the opposite tradition. he believes in a muscular american presence. and we saw his very, very strong speech in cairo, which is allegedly a repudiation of obama policy. so it's--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: even down just to the-- to the orchestration of it--"}
{"original": "jeffrey goldberg: right. a little bit-- a little bit in your face. i'm going to cairo and i'm repudiating what you just said in a really unusual way. and-- and so you have so many different foreign policies in-- inside one administration, it's hard to keep them straight."}
{"original": "david nakamura: think about this, though. i was thinking about this, you know, the president's other big gambit on foreign policy is this ongoing dialogue of some, sort of, with north korea. think what kim jong-un must be seeing here. you have the-- the hawkish secretary of state and national security adviser john bolton with one view of how to approach iran and stay in syria."}
{"original": "david nakamura: and the president is saying, no, you know, i have my own view. i'm just going to do the opposite. you see, now kim jong-un continue to send letters to president trump, very flattering. he wants to deal directly with the president because he sees this sort of a-- a chance, you know, to sort of maybe get some gains. i mean the idea of--"}
{"original": "jeffrey goldberg: but if he's smart--"}
{"original": "jeffrey goldberg: --he might know that that those gains are not durable."}
{"original": "david nakamura: they are not durable."}
{"original": "jeffrey goldberg: yeah. and it-- yeah."}
{"original": "david nakamura: but-- but, you know, kim jong-un's goal is to reduce troop presence, right, in-- in the korean peninsula. look-- look, what's going on here in syria?"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: right. and to cut back all the military--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: --that the united states has in the region. on iran, to add to jeff's point, you heard the secretary of state this week say, we are going to try to get every boot, iranian boot out of syria. how do you do that when you don't have a military there?"}
{"original": "jeffrey goldberg: can you convince them with strong words? i-- i don't know. you made the excellent point that the threat of military force, obviously is-- is when you couple that with effective diplomacy that's one way to do it. no, it doesn't seem-- i mean, look, this is why the israelis and many of the gulf arabs were so nervous when trump announced this impromptu policy shift, radical policy shift, because you-- you leave syria that allows iran to come in fully. pompeo's speech in cairo was a very, very anti-iran speech."}
{"original": "jeffrey goldberg: nothing is adding up. this is the problem. i mean you have to have policies that actually correspond to the reality on the ground. and so i-- i think it's very, very hard to understand how this works."}
{"original": "michael crowley: pompeo did say something today that i've heard him say before that i think could be worth focusing on. he keeps referring to the withdrawal of uniformed american troops from syria. i don't know exactly what he means. but i am wondering to what degree the administration at least maybe telling (indistinct) officials like pompeo in defending trump's policy. we're going to have the cia and then we might even have--"}
{"original": "michael crowley: --contractors. we know there's been a lot of debate around this administration with the possibility of using contractors. so i think that's something to keep an eye on. i think it's noteworthy that he keeps stressing that word."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: it-- it's a good-- good point to (indistinct) because clearly having an intelligence presence is incredibly important in a place that is home to so many terror groups at this point. that's one of the things that israelis were concerned about--"}
{"original": "jeffrey goldberg: i mean the other quick point to make on this is that pompeo's speech was very, very hard on iran. but one of the reasons it's not flying in the middle east is that recognizing that all diplomacy is hypocrisy to some degree. there is not a harsh word to be said about saudi arabia, and one does not have to think that iran is anything other than the leading state sponsor of terror. you-- you can still think that but also think that our punitive allies are also human rights violators and authoritarian despotic regimes."}
{"original": "jeffrey goldberg: it would be fascinating to watch this week."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: michael, i want to ask you, we-- we did ask both the secretary and leader mccarthy about these reports in the past few days about the president's relationship with russia or at least his decision to not make public the notes that he has had from interpreters from private meetings with vladimir putin. why is it important that the rest of the national security establishment be part of this? as leader mccarthy said this is just about a personal relationship."}
{"original": "michael crowley: sure. well, there's the-- there's the sort of traditional reason, which is that the foreign policy machine works better if all the smart people who are looking at it from different angles, people who have regional focuses who have expertise in putin's psychology who are arms control experts can see the conversation and weigh in. and-- and, you know, referring back to the parsing language, hey, it was really important and significant that putin use this word. you know, he hasn't used this word in six years. it means that they're interested in this again. or somebody can point out i can see that he's putting pressure on this issue trying to move us. the president who, you know, is totally new to diplomacy as of two years ago, wouldn't be picking up on those things. that's just how it traditionally works. and you have-- it's almost like crowdsourcing, right, get all the best minds looking at this and then--"}
{"original": "michael crowley: --you get together and talk about it. okay. so, now the trump's specific problem is that, you know, we know senior officials in our own justice department at one point, a couple of years ago according to the great reporting by the new york times yesterday, believed it was at least worth investigating whether the president, i can't believe i'm saying these words--"}
{"original": "michael crowley: --on television, it's like am i living in a dream, may have been acting as an agent for the russian government and vladimir putin."}
{"original": "jeffrey goldberg: it's not a dream, it's a bad movie."}
{"original": "michael crowley: i mean, a bad-- a bad movie, the greatest movie ever made, who knows exactly--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: it's an extraordinary report."}
{"original": "michael crowley: it's-- it's stunning. and i want to say, to go back-- and then the washington post, by the way, followed up with the great report, that after a meeting he had with vladimir putin and only a translator in the room, asked the translator for those notes and took them away. and they were not circulated through the government. just very quickly, last point, david, to your earlier point about leaders seeing the officials around trump and going around them--"}
{"original": "michael crowley: --and going straight to trump. lot of reasons, i think there's vla-- that vladimir putin is doing that, whether or not it's some kind of a spy movie running an-- an agent thing or just pure psychology. that's the game he's playing."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: it's also extraordinary to have the america's top diplomat, the secretary of state, twice clarify that the president is not a national security threat--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: --and laugh-- and-- and say that's laughable."}
{"original": "jeffrey goldberg: right. it's worth dilating on this for one moment, that we're in a situation where we're discussing in serious terms whether or not the president of the united states is a russian intelligence asset. and that's-- that's what's happening in washington today. and that is truly remarkable thing that we're experiencing right now."}
{"original": "david nakamura: and the president's response on this about, you know, keeping this meeting quiet is-- and keeping people out of it, it's not just to have a better relationship with leader like vladimir putin. but also that there's been leaks of his other, especially early in his presidencies, from really embarrassing leaks about what he said to other world leaders that made him look foolish, made him look reckless. but now he's sort of created this extra problem that either-- leaders-- because he's not staying on some sort of script or--"}
{"original": "david nakamura: --you know-- you know, going with the talking points that are developed by a national security agency or staff, be prepare for these meetings, sort of ad-libbing and having these sort of embarrassing--"}
{"original": "david nakamura: --leaks come out. now he's left with a situation where it looks certainly bad if, you know, if he's keep-- if he's taking notes from his translator."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: the story is not going away. we'll continue it. but we have to leave the panel here."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: and we'll be back in a moment with former obama administration homeland security secretary jeh johnson."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: we're joined now by former department of homeland security secretary jeh johnson. welcome to face the nation."}
{"original": "jeh johnson (former secretary of homeland security): margaret, thanks for having me."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: in addition to being homeland security secretary, before that you had also been general counsel at the pentagon."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: so i know you're very familiar with some of the legal authorities here--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: --that we may need to-- to look at, because the president says that he may declare a national security emergency in order to get border funding for this wall. take it from other monies that congress had already approved and use it in a way they didn't approve. does he have the ability legally to do this?"}
{"original": "jeh johnson: well, first, margaret, i just have to say there is an emerging crisis in homeland security on our border, by taking the very workers we depend upon for our security, land, sea, air, secret service, coast guard, border patrol, customs agents and so forth, and inflicting on them all sorts of stress and anxiety in their personal life about whether they're going to be paid and when. that's the security crisis that i see from the workforce in dhs."}
{"original": "jeh johnson: now when it comes legally to whether or not the president can declare a national emergency to get around the dispute, earlier in the week the administration seemed to be talking about using a department of defense authority to take money that's been designated by congress for military construction toward another project. the law specifically allows for that upon the declaration of a national emergency. but that particular provision is typically used overseas to support the military like building detention facilities or military housing. the lawyers in the administration now seem to have come to a provision that allows for a reprogramming, as we refer to it, taking money from army's civil works projects here in the united states that were at some point essential to national defense and then redesignating and reprogramming it for some other army civil works project."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: some of that aid money for puerto rico and--"}
{"original": "jeh johnson: so, in my view, that's probably slightly more legally plausible. the earlier defense authority was really trying to jam us square peg in a round hole."}
{"original": "jeh johnson: this one is slightly more plausible, but politically highly objectionable because you're taking billions of dollars away from important civil works projects to recover from the hurricanes and the wildfires. and i-- i would predict there'd be huge, huge objection to doing that. ultimately, this-- this has to be something for our political leadership to work out--"}
{"original": "jeh johnson: --to get the government back to work. that's the most basic function of our civilian political leadership, to keep the government open and pay the workers."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: well, and to your point, it is worth what you underscored there, that a number of people who work on national security issues aren't getting paid because of this--"}
{"original": "jeh johnson: --depend upon to find explosives and luggage, to find weapons and luggage, the people we depend upon to secure our borders to look for contraband at ports--"}
{"original": "jeh johnson: --to look for narcotics at ports, are the people that are under great stress right now because of this shutdown. it be must be leading-- i think i know this workforce. it must be leading to all kinds of uncertainty, stress and anxiety, and frankly, anger and resentment. we see reports of tsos calling in sick. and if this is not resolved soon, i predict that that's going to go in the wrong direction and we're going to start seeing longer and longer lines at airports."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: when you were at dhs, i know you said that-- at that time in 2015, you saw the influx and apprehensions of children and family units as an emerging crisis."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: now the trump administration is seeing record numbers of those family--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: --units coming across the border. they're saying this is a crisis now, and it sounds like the one you saw coming. so this is a unique challenge for them. are they wrong to call that a crisis?"}
{"original": "jeh johnson: it is very definitely humanitarian crisis because of the poverty and violence in central america. and the way to deal with this problem, frankly, is make a long-term investment in helping to eradicate the poverty and violence in the three countries that are probably the most violent on earth. that's not a quick, simple, easy fix which washington likes."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: el salvador, honduras and guatemala."}
{"original": "jeh johnson: correct. and so we need to make a long-term political commitment to investing and dealing with those push factors, otherwise we're going to continue to deal with this problem for a very long time."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: border wall, what i hear you saying, not the most effective way. let me get, though, to-- to the nuts and bolts of the family members here. because the obama administration faced some challenges on the question of whether they could detain families together--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: --for more than twenty days."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: that's at the heart of the trump administration's, you know, defenses as to why they were justifying the separation of families. so what alternatives are there?"}
{"original": "jeh johnson: well, you're referring to the flores decision--"}
{"original": "jeh johnson: --which imposed basically a limit on us to hold people for longer than-- than twenty days. i think that there has to be a range of tools that dhs can go to in-- in a crisis when you see a spike like this. again, it requires a long-term investment and the push factors. but we need things like-- we, you know, we can always assess whether there is more border security that's necessary. more surveillance, more road, perhaps, fortifying walls. in my judgment, there also needs to be more immigration judges--"}
{"original": "jeh johnson: --to move these cases along. but it does require a range of things and a long-term political commitment to dealing with the underlying factors that lead to these crisis."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: very quickly, do you expect the supreme court to uphold the daca ruling?"}
{"original": "jeh johnson: i-- i hesitate to predict what this supreme court will do."}
{"original": "jeh johnson: i think that there is adequate legal basis for the program."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: all right. at the heart of-- of some of these potential solutions. so thank you very much."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: we will be right back."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: that's it for us today. thank you for watching. until next week for face the nation, i'm margaret brennan."}
{"original": "the trump administration on monday re-designated cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism, hitting the country with new sanctions that could hamstring president-elect joe biden's promise to renew relations with the communist-governed island. secretary of state mike pompeo announced the step, citing in particular cuba's continued harboring of u.s. fugitives, its refusal to extradite a coterie of colombian guerrilla commanders as well as its support for venezuelan leader nicolás maduro."}
{"original": "the designation, which had been discussed for years, is one of several last-minute foreign policy moves that the trump administration is making before mr. biden takes office jan. 20."}
{"original": "removing cuba from the blacklist had been one of former president barack obama's main foreign policy achievements as he sought better relations with the island, an effort endorsed by mr. biden as his vice president. ties had been essentially frozen after fidel castro took power in 1959."}
{"original": "as he has with iran, mr. trump has sought to reverse many of obama's decisions involving cuba. he has taken a tough line on havana and rolled back many of the sanctions that the obama administration had eased or lifted after the restoration of full diplomatic relations in 2015."}
{"original": "since mr. trump took office, after a campaign that attacked mr. obama's moves to normalize relations with cuba, ties have been increasingly strained."}
{"original": "in addition to attacking cuba for its support of maduro, the trump administration has also suggested that cuba may have been behind or allowed alleged sonic attacks that left dozens of u.s. diplomats in havana with brain injuries starting in late 2016."}
{"original": "however, few u.s, allies believe cuba remains a sponsor of international terrorism, quibbling with either the definition based on the support for maduro or outright rejecting american claims that cuban authorities are bankrolling or masterminding international terrorist attacks."}
{"original": "cuban foreign minister bruno rodriguez condemned the u.s. action. the us political opportunism is recognized by those who are honestly concerned about the scourge of terrorism and its victims, he said on twitter."}
{"original": "rep. gregory meeks, the new chairman of the house foreign affairs committee, said mr. trump's designation would not help the cuban people and seeks only to tie the hands of the biden administration."}
{"original": "this designation of cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism with less than a week to go in his presidency and after he incited a domestic terror attack on the u.s. capital ... that's hypocrisy, meeks said in an interview with the associated press."}
{"original": "nonetheless, cheered on by cuban american and venezuelan exiles in south florida, the trump administration has steadily increased restrictions on flights, trade and financial transactions between the u.s. and the island."}
{"original": "the latest sanctions put cuba alongside north korea, syria and iran as the only foreign nations deemed state sponsors of terrorism. as a result of monday's actions, most travel from the u.s. to cuba will be barred as well as the sending of remittances to cuba from relatives in the united states, a significant source of income for the impoverished island."}
{"original": "but with dollar-generating business already reeling from the effects of the coronavirus and previous measures like mr. trump's ban on cruise ships and cap on remittances, the biggest impact will likely be diplomatic."}
{"original": "this will really slow any thaw in relations with the biden administration, said emilio morales, an exiled cuban economist and president of the miami-based havana consulting group."}
{"original": "morales said unwinding the measure will take at least a year and require careful study by the u.s. government. he is also doubtful whether biden, who played no significant role in the obama administration's opening to cuba, would be willing to invest the sort of political capital mr. obama did and throw a lifeline to cuba's leadership without anything in return."}
{"original": "mr. obama's removal of cuba from the state sponsors of terrorism list had been a major target of mr. trump, pompeo and other cuba hawks in the current administration."}
{"original": "cuba has repeatedly refused to turn over u.s. fugitives that have been granted asylum, including a black militant convicted of killing a new jersey state trooper in the 1970s. in addition to political refugee status, u.s. fugitives have received free housing, health care and other benefits thanks to cuba's government, which insists the u.s. has no legal or moral basis to demand their return."}
{"original": "but perhaps the biggest change since mr. obama's outreach in 2015 is cuba's strong support for maduro, who is considered by the a dictator whose pilfering of the oil-based economy has driven 5 million venezuelans from their homes."}
{"original": "cuba has had a long-standing alliance with maduro, although it has long denied it has 20,000 troops and intelligence agents in venezuela and says it has not carried out any security operations. cuban officials, however, have said they have the right to carry out broad military and intelligence cooperation that they deem as legitimate."}
{"original": "the relationship between the two countries has grown strong in the past two decades, with venezuela sending cuba oil shipments worth billions of dollars and receiving tens of thousands of employees, including medical workers."}
{"original": "in may 2020, the state department added cuba to a list of countries that do not cooperate with u.s. counter-terrorism programs."}
{"original": "in making that determination, the department said several leaders of the national liberation army, a colombian rebel group designated a terrorist organization, remained on the island despite colombia's repeated request they be extradited to answer for the 2019 car bombing of a police academy in bogota that killed 22 people."}
{"original": "cuba has rejected such requests, saying that turning over the leaders would violate protocols agreed to by colombia's government for peace efforts that were broken off after the deadly bombing."}
{"original": "in repudiating the allegations, president miguel díaz-canel has said cuba was the victim of terrorism. he cited an armed attack on its embassy in washington last april as one example. cubans see the blacklist as helping the u.s. justify the long-standing embargo on the island and other economic sanctions that have crippled its economy."}
{"original": "freshman congresswoman alexandria ocasio-cortez backs the idea of a green new deal for the u.s., a plan popular in progressive policy circles under which the federal government would pour billions of dollars into renewable energy. how would the new york democrat help fund such a costly program? raise taxes on the rich to their highest level since 1980, just before ronald reagan started hacking rates."}
{"original": "the top tax on the wealthy should rise to as high as 70 percent, ocasio-cortez told 60 minutes on sunday. that approach stands in stark contrast to the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act, which gave the lion's share of benefits from reducing federal income tax rates to top earners and corporations. not surprisingly, conservatives are bashing ocasio-cortez' ideas. americans for tax reform founder grover norquist wrote on fox news that her soaking the rich plan is the opening shot in a renewed war against middle class taxpayers."}
{"original": "raising the so-called marginal tax rate on the rich would mark a return to the more progressive tax structure of the 1950s and 1960s -- under presidents harry s. truman, dwight d. eisenhower and john f. kennedy, for instance, the rate on those in the top bracket topped 90 percent."}
{"original": "here's what you should know about ocasio-cortez's plan and how higher tax rates would work."}
{"original": "it's about higher marginal rates -- not a flat rate"}
{"original": "rep. steve scalise, r.-louisiana, tweeted that ocasio-cortez's approach would lead to the government taking away 70% of your income. yet that comment misleadingly suggests that every dollar earned by taxpayers would be docked at a flat 70 percent -- that isn't what ocasio-cortez is proposing."}

{"original": "her plan focuses on marginal tax rates, a progressive tax system that's the basis of the u.s. tax code. it works by taxing the lowest amount of income at the lowest tax rate, and then increasing it gradually as a person's income rises. the goal is to tax lower earners at lower rates, while assessing higher rates on wealthier americans."}
{"original": "sometimes lost in the criticism of ocasio-cortez' plan is the fact that higher marginal rates are paid only on each dollar earned above a particular tax bracket. for instance, single americans now pay at a rate of 10 percent on earnings up to $9,525, while any earnings between $9,526 and $38,700 are taxed at 12 percent."}
{"original": "currently, the top rate for single taxpayers kicks in at 37 percent for every dollar earned over $500,000 in annual income."}
{"original": "jacking up the top tax rate likely wouldn't impact you"}
{"original": "ocasio-cortez doesn't favor imposing a 70 percent tax on the merely rich. rather, that rate would be for people with annual income of at least $10 million or so. that's why it's not likely to hit your wallet -- only the top 0.1 percent of income earners are likely to come close to that, as this group enjoys average adjusted gross income of $7.3 million. and only 140,000 tax filers make this much money, compared with nearly 70 million who make up the bottom 50 percent of earners."}
{"original": "the economy still grew when tax rates were high"}
{"original": "the u.s. economy boomed in the '50s and '60s when, according to the nonpartisan tax policy center, the top rate ranged between 70 percent and 92 percent. of course, no time periods in economic history are directly comparable. in the post-world war ii era, for instance, the baby boom drove massive spending on the housing market and productivity was much higher than it is today."}
{"original": "but the point is that higher top marginal tax rates don't appear to cause lower economic growth."}
{"original": "other developed countries have high tax rates"}
{"original": "several advanced economies around the world have top tax rates approaching what ocasio-cortez favors, and by many measures they enjoy higher standards of living than the u.s."}
{"original": "what we have in mind ... and my policies most closely resemble what we see in the u.k., in norway, in finland, in sweden, she told 60 minutes."}

{"original": "a threat to the profit motive?"}
{"original": "ocasio-cortez's plan echoes findings by economists including nobel laureate peter diamond and berkeley professor emmanuel saez, who estimated that the ideal marginal tax rate should be 73 percent. most other economists (including many conservative and pro-business experts) agree that a fair and productive society includes some form of progressive tax system, even if they vary in their calculations of what that should be."}
{"original": "but what about the argument that high tax rates dissuade people from working? after all, if uncle sam is going to take most of your income, why bother working at all? but that may be looking at the wrong question. higher taxes on every dollar earned above $10 million isn't likely to lower multimillionaires' drive to remain rich (though it could arguably encourage them to seek ways to avoid taxes)."}
{"original": "perhaps a more relevant question: whether the tax system could encourage people to enter lower-paying yet socially useful jobs, such as teaching or scientific research. one study found that a radical policy of imposing taxes according to professions -- such as providing tax breaks to teachers while imposing higher taxes on hedge fund managers -- could grow the economy dramatically, its authors wrote in the harvard business review."}
{"original": "ocasio-cortez didn't address such ideas, but her goal in taxing the extremely rich at higher levels is to guarantee a job for every american at a fair wage. when you can't provide for your kids working a full-time job, working two full-time jobs. when you can't have health care. that is not -- that is not dignified, ocasio-cortez said."}

{"original": "count non-citizens in u.s. census again. this reverses president trump's order in july 2020 to not count undocumented americans, which would affect federal allocation of money and federal representation. rice on the wednesday press call said trump's was an approach that violates the constitution and the census act and is inconsistent with our nation's history and our commitment to representative democracy. the biden team's outline of the executive order said biden will ensure that the census bureau has time to complete an accurate population count for each state and that he will then present to congress an apportionment that is fair and accurate so federal resources are efficiently and fairly distributed for the next decade."}

{"original": "end so-called muslim travel ban, which in 2017 restricted travel and immigration to the u.s. from syria, iran, iraq, sudan, libya, somalia and yemen, before adding eritrea, nigeria, myanmar, kyrgyzstan, and tanzania in 2020. the state department is also instructed to restart visa applications for these countries."}

{"original": "taxing electronic cigarettes like regular smokes could result in fewer americans kicking the habit, some researchers think. a new study published by the national bureau of economic research estimates that taxing vaping products at the same rate as cigarettes could deter 2.7 million u.s. adults from quitting over a decade."}
{"original": "although there is no federal tax on e-cigarettes, some 17 states and the district of columbia have a vaping tax, according to the pew charitable trusts. more than half of those states imposed the levy this year amid growing concerns about the safety of e-cigarettes. the taxes come as the vaping industry faces mounting scrutiny for marketing practices that critics say targets younger americans."}
{"original": "a deadly spate of lung illnesses tied to unregulated vaping products also had the trump administration recently mulling a ban on flavored e-cigarettes and congress this month passing a law to raise to 21 the legal age to buy tobacco or vaping gear."}
{"original": "nearly a decade ago, minnesota became the first state in the u.s. to tax e-cigs. it initially imposed a rate of 35%, before sharply raising the levy in 2013 to a full 95% of the wholesale price for vaping products. the researchers — economists dhaval dave of bentley university and daniel dench, michael grossman and henry saffer, all of city university of new york — wanted to weigh the impact of these taxes to assess the impact on consumer behavior."}
{"original": "their main takeaway: in looking at the state's 600,000 adult smokers, minnesota's e-cigarette tax deterred more than 32,000 adult smokers from giving up regular cigarettes over a 10-year period. that's because the sharp increase in vaping costs in the state made the products more expensive, discouraging consumers."}
{"original": "not surprisingly, a nationwide vaping tax like the one imposed in minnesota could have a larger effect. should federal policy makers opt to tax e-cigs at the same rate as regular cigarettes, the price of the vaping products would rise about 62%, according to the study. that could deter up to 2.7 million smokers from quitting tobacco cigarettes, the researchers conclude."}
{"original": "roughly 34 million americans, or around 14% of the adult population, smoke cigarettes. and despite the potential impact of vaping taxes on smoking cessation, other considerations could still justify the added costs, the researchers said."}
{"original": "the public health benefits of not taxing e-cigarettes, however, must be weighed against effects of this decision on efforts to reduce vaping by youth, they cautioned."}

{"original": "the pay gap between male and female workers has been well documented. but there may also be an expectations gap in what men and women think they will earn during their careers."}
{"original": "according to a survey released friday by job services website careerbuilder, men and women have wildly different expectations for how much they will eventually earn. when asked to estimate the highest annual salary they thought they would earn during their careers, more than twice as many men than women said they expected to make more than $100,000."}
{"original": "some 44 percent of men thought their salaries would top out at more than $100,000, while only 20 percent of women did the same. about 12 percent of men expected a peak salary of $200,000 or more; just 3 percent of women gave that figure."}
{"original": "for perspective, only about 14 percent of people who worked full-time in 2015 earned over $100,000, according to census data."}
{"original": "the upshot: men's average peak salary was nearly double the women's, careerbuilder found."}
{"original": "those divergent expectations are not surprising considering that women are often paid less than men for comparable work and tend to cluster in lower-paid occupations, said ariane hegewisch, program director of employment and earnings at the institute for women's policy research."}
{"original": "you dream in context, and the context is what you observe others making, she said."}

{"original": "that plan was previously outlined by former law professor tai. he predicted that between 2020 and 2022, there would be 10 steps to mutual destruction which includes the pro-democracy bloc winning a majority in the legislature, intensifying protests, the forced resignation of chief executive carrie lam due to the budget bill being rejected twice, and international sanctions on the chinese communist party."}
{"original": "the concept of mutual destruction — in which both hong kong and china would suffer damages — is popular among some protesters and pro-democracy activists."}
{"original": "the plot is to create such mutual destruction that if successful ... will result in serious damage to society as a whole, said lee. that is why police action today is necessary."}

{"original": "the security law criminalizes acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign powers to intervene in the city's affairs. serious offenders could face up a maximum punishment of life imprisonment."}
{"original": "hong kong leader carrie lam had said at the time of the unofficial primaries last year that if their aim was resisting every policy initiative by the hong kong government, the election may fall under subverting state power, an offence under the national security law."}
{"original": "beijing had also called the primaries illegal and a serious provocation of hong kong's electoral system."}
{"original": "following the handover of hong kong to china by the british in 1997, the semi-autonomous chinese city has operated on a one country, two systems framework that affords it freedoms not found on the mainland. in recent years, beijing has asserted more control over the city, drawing criticism that it was breaking its promise of hong kong maintaining separate civil rights and political systems for 50 years from the handover."}
{"original": "human rights watch said the arrests suggest beijing has failed to learn that repression generates resistance. hrw senior china researcher maya wang said in a statement that millions of hong kong people will persist in their struggle for their right to vote and run for office in a democratically elected government."}
{"original": "in further remarks to the associated press, wang said it wasn't clear what provisions of the law were being cited to justify the arrests, but that local authorities seem less concerned with legal substance."}
{"original": "the very nature of the national security law is as a draconian blanket law allowing the government to arrest and potentially imprison people for long terms for exercising their constitutionally protected rights, wang said."}
{"original": "the veneer of rule of law is also applied in mainland china stripped of any meaning. hong kong is looking more like mainland china but where one ends and the other begins is hard to discern, she said."}
{"original": "it's increasingly trendy for restaurants and stores to refuse cash in favor of only accepting cashless payments — such as apple pay or credit cards — but that will soon be illegal in new york city."}
{"original": "the city council on thursday passed a bill that bans local businesses from not accepting cash. the bill also prohibits enterprises from penalizing customers who pay with cash by charging them higher prices. businesses that violate the law could face fines of up to $1,500."}
{"original": "intentional or not, cashless retail has a discriminatory and exclusionary effect on new yorkers who lack access to credit and debit cards, according to city councilman ritchie torres, who introduced the bill forbidding cashless-only payment. the practice of banning cash has sparked outrage against retailers like trendy restaurant chain sweetgreen, which had moved to a cashless policy in 2016, citing improved employee safety and speed of service."}
{"original": "last year, sweetgreen said it would again start accepting cash, explaining that the policy had the unintended consequence of excluding those who prefer to pay or can only pay with cash."}
{"original": "the new new york law will protect consumers who might lack access to banking services, but also reinforces the rights of those who want to pay with hard currency, torres said."}
{"original": "even if you have access to credit and debit, there are some new yorkers, especially senior citizens, who prefer cash because it's a familiar or habitual form of payment, torres told cbs moneywatch. whatever their reasons, consumers ought to have the right to choose their preferential method of payment."}
{"original": "torres acknowledged that cashless transactions can help businesses run more smoothly, but said the bill strikes a balance between equity and efficiency."}
{"original": "the bill will take effect within nine months after mayor bill de blasio signs it into law."}
{"original": "the law includes an exemption for businesses with machines that convert cash into a card that never expires, does not charge a fee and doesn't require a minimum deposit greater than $1. having the ability to install machines allows business to preserve their electronic approach, torres said."}
{"original": "nearly 1 in 4 new york households are unbanked or underbanked. nationally, about 6.5% of american households lack any bank accounts, while another 18.7% are underbanked, according to the federal deposit insurance corporation. underbanked consumers may have a traditional bank account, but often turn to sources of financing outside the banking system, such as payday loans."}
{"original": "we in the city council have real concerns that an increasingly cashless marketplace would have a real-world discriminatory effect on low-income communities — especially communities of color that lack access to credit or debit, torres said at a press conference ahead of the vote thursday."}
{"original": "he said the law protects those new yorkers who are undocumented or homeless and face deeply entrenched barriers to accessing credit."}
{"original": "while there's no formal tally of the number of cashless businesses in new york city, data from square, a credit card processing system, shows that americans are making fewer cash purchases than four years ago. from 2015 to 2019, the share of purchases under $20 made with cash declined from 46% to 37%."}
{"original": "some business owners are pushing back on the legislation, claiming it could slow the pace of service, reduce profits and jeopardize the safety of employees who are required to handle cash at night. restaurant owner michael ryan said safety concerns motivated him to go cashless at his west village taqueria flip sigi in 2015."}
{"original": "people would hide in bathrooms, and managers who were there alone late at night with cash were robbed, he said."}
{"original": "it also made sense from an efficiency and cost perspective. managers were spending 20 hours a week counting money and going to the bank, ryan said."}
{"original": "ryan said he'll likely invest in a cash machine that allows patrons to load their cash onto a card that can be used for payment."}
{"original": "other cities and states, including new jersey, philadelphia and san francisco, have approved similar bans. massachusetts has since 1978 required all retailers to accept cash."}
{"original": "ben crump, an attorney for jacob blake's family, spoke out wednesday against the kenosha, wisconsin, district attorney's decision to not charge the officer who shot blake in the back, saying it does nothing to help this issue of mistrust."}
{"original": "we have to have transparency and accountability to get that trust, crump said on cbsn wednesday."}
{"original": "we are going to file a civil rights excessive use of force 1983 civil rights lawsuit against the kenosha police department, he said."}
{"original": "police officer rusten sheskey, who is white, was responding to a domestic dispute on august 23 when he fired his weapon seven times as blake, a black man, attempted to get inside an suv. blake survived, but was left unable to walk."}
{"original": "the shooting sparked nationwide outrage in a year that saw intense scrutiny of systemic racism and how police officers treat black americans and communities of color. that outrage was rekindled tuesday when the district attorney announced that sheskey would not be charged."}
{"original": "to try to say 'we couldn't have used the least intrusive measures to respond in this matter,' but with black people, it always seems to be — and we saw this play out in 2020 like never before — you shoot first and you ask questions later, he said."}
{"original": "crump, a noted civil rights attorney who has represented a slew of other families of victims of police violence, compared police treatment of blake with that of kyle rittenhouse, a white teenager who is accused of killing two people in the ensuing protests over the summer and walked past police unharmed."}
{"original": "they don't see the young white man who just killed people with a gun walking towards them as a threat, but yet you say a young black man who is running away from you is a threat? crump said. it emphasizes that there are two justice systems in america — one for black america, and one for white america."}
{"original": "in his explanation, prosecutor michael graveley claimed blake was armed with a knife and was twisting toward sheskey just before the officer opened fire. investigators have said they found a knife inside the vehicle but his family has denied he was armed."}
{"original": "crump said sheskey's claim of self-defense was bogus. mr. blake never ever put them in harm's way. he was never an imminent threat to them. when you think about the elements that must be proved for self-defense, you have to prove that you were in imminent threat of bodily harm, he said."}
{"original": "he dismissed the accusation that blake had a knife as an attempt to justify the unjustifiable excessive use of force by police."}
{"original": "naacp head derrick johnson said blake's shooting and the lack of charges underscores the need for a racial equity adviser in president-elect joe biden's cabinet."}
{"original": "there needs to be someone to review our public policy to ensure there is racial equity, to ensure that there are justices brought against incidents such as this, he said on cbsn wednesday. this is not justice. this is an unfortunate reality that far too many young black kids will have to see."}
{"original": "in a statement released tuesday evening following graveley's announcement, the assistant attorney general for the doj's civil rights division and u.s. attorney matthew d. krueger said a federal civil rights investigation into the shooting of jacob blake is ongoing."}

{"original": "bundy's group, calling itself citizens for constitutional freedom, says it wants an inquiry into whether the government is forcing ranchers off their land."}

{"original": "the police report said the woman was uncooperative with officers, who were unable to locate a crime scene. the woman raised concerns about her ex-boyfriend's well-being. police tried calling manziel's cell phone and searching for him before it determined he was safe."}
{"original": "fort worth police are working with dallas police to determine if a crime occurred."}
{"original": "the browns had no immediate comment saturday."}
{"original": "beyond the legal matter, manziel could face discipline from the league. nfl spokesman greg aiello said in an email the league is aware and looking into it."}

{"original": "in october, police in avon, ohio, received an emergency call after manziel and colleen crowley were spotted fighting as they drove together near the quarterback's home on the west side of cleveland. manziel was not arrested but the matter prompted an nfl investigation to see if he violated the league's personal conduct policy."}
{"original": "crowley had told police that manziel hit her and pushed her head against a car window. the couple told police they had been drinking alcohol earlier in the day."}
{"original": "manziel was later questioned by a league investigator and cleared, but it was another mark on his already tainted reputation."}

{"original": "manziel was in concussion protocol at the time, and although he was not required to be at the browns' home finale against pittsburgh, the team was not sure of his location as reports surfaced he was partying in las vegas. he was fined for not reporting to the team's facility on jan. 3."}

{"original": "the supreme court on monday appeared ready to deal a major blow to the power and clout of organized labor as it considers the free speech rights of government workers who say they shouldn't be forced to pay fees to public-sector unions."}
{"original": "the high court's conservative justices seemed inclined during 80 minutes of oral argument to overrule a four-decade old precedent that allows public-sector unions to collect mandatory fees from non-members to cover collective bargaining costs."}
{"original": "a group of california public school teachers claims these fair share fees violate the first amendment rights of workers who disagree with the union's positions."}
{"original": "labor officials fear that union members will leave in droves if they realize they can get all the benefits of representation without paying for it."}
{"original": "but justice anthony kennedy rejected arguments made by lawyers for the state of california and the california teachers association that the current fee system is needed to prevent non-members from becoming free riders - workers who get all the benefits of union bargaining and grievance procedures without paying for it."}
{"original": "the union basically is making these teachers 'compelled riders' for issues on which they strongly disagree, kennedy said, noting the political nature of bargaining issues like teacher salaries, merit promotions and class size."}
{"original": "arguing in support of the union, california solicitor general edward dumont said the state needs a reliable bargaining partner that is funded by all the workers it represents. he said the fees for collective bargaining typically apply to non-political issues such as mileage reimbursement, working hours and other mundane issues."}
{"original": "chief justice john roberts dismissed that reasoning, saying even routine matters can become politically charged if they involve how the state spends money."}
{"original": "that's always a public policy issue, roberts said."}
{"original": "even justice antonin scalia, who in the past has expressed some sympathy for the free rider argument, said all the items negotiated in a collective bargaining agreement are necessarily political questions."}
{"original": "the california teachers want the high court to overturn a 1977 case that allows public unions to collect money from members and non-members alike, as long as the money doesn't pay for political action. the court in that case, abood v. detroit board of education, said the arrangement was justified to prevent non-members from becoming free riders."}
{"original": "but the teachers argue that unions have become more political over time. they say even a push for higher salaries and pension benefits raises political questions about the best use of tax dollars for cash-strapped localities."}
{"original": "a federal district court ruled against the teachers, saying the outcome was clear under abood. the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals affirmed that ruling."}
{"original": "half the states already have right-to-work laws banning mandatory fees, but most members of public-employee unions are concentrated in states that don't, including california, new york and illinois."}
{"original": "union advocates say the lawsuit is part of a conservative agenda to weaken powerful labor unions, known for reliably supporting democratic candidates and policies. the teachers are backed by the conservative center for individual rights."}
{"original": "arguing for the teachers, michael carvin said mandatory fees serve to inflate the union's war chest by people who really have not made a voluntary decision to do so."}
{"original": "justice elena kagan warned that the challengers come here with a heavy burden to overturn a nearly 40-year-old case on which thousands of contracts and millions of employees rely."}
{"original": "justice stephen breyer said overturning abood would require the court to overrule several related cases in which the high court has approved mandatory payments by lawyers to bar associations and mandatory student fees at public universities."}
{"original": "that's quite a big deal, breyer said."}
{"original": "carvin said abood's rationale is inconsistent with other free speech cases."}
{"original": "arguing for the california teachers association, lawyer david frederick said the first amendment applies differently to public employees performing their jobs. he said the state has a strong interest in promoting efficiency and avoiding costly workplace disruptions by designating the union as the exclusive bargaining representative for workers."}
{"original": "for decades, the growth of union workers in government has helped compensate for steep losses in manufacturing, construction and other private industries where unions once thrived. about half of all union members are now in the public sector, which has a membership rate of 36 percent. that's more than five times higher than that of the private sector, at 6.6 percent."}
{"original": "even if the court doesn't overturn settled precedent, it could still give the challengers a partial victory. the justices are also considering whether public employees should be required to opt in to paying the political portion of union dues. currently, workers must opt out of the political fees by checking a box on a form."}
{"original": "the opt in requirement could lead to more workers declining to pay the political portion of union dues, though it typically is a much smaller part of the overall payment."}

{"original": "mayorkas defended his involvement in the investor visa program, calling the law his north star. but he conceded in an exchange with utah republican senator mitt romney that the 2015 dhs inspector general's report taught him to better guard against the perception of impropriety to ensure trust and confidence in the decision making of government leaders."}
{"original": "mayorkas will likely play a key role in mr. biden's plans to reverse many of mr. trump's immigration changes, which collectively restricted avenues for people to immigrate to and stay in the u.s."}
{"original": "mr. biden, for example, has pledged to safeguard the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) initiative, a program for undocumented immigrants brought to the u.s. as children that mayorkas implemented in 2012. mayorkas, the son of jewish refugees who fled nazi germany and then communist cuba, will also be charged with helping to fulfill mr. biden's pledge to dramatically increase refugee admissions, which mr. trump slashed to historic lows."}
{"original": "but the task at the u.s.-mexico border would be formidable: reversing mr. trump's restrictive asylum policies without triggering a sharp increase in unauthorized migration, which could provide political ammunition for republicans and derail mr. biden's immigration reform bill."}
{"original": "mr. biden and his immigration advisers have said they want to avert a border crisis and that their plans to reverse mr. trump's asylum policies will take time amid the pandemic."}
{"original": "confronted with a string of questions about thousands of migrants heading north to the u.s.-mexico border, mayorkas said his officers would screen asylum-seekers to determine whether they qualify for u.s. refuge."}
{"original": "we are a nation of immigrants. and we are also a nation of laws, he told romney."}
{"original": "mayorkas commended cbp and immigration and customs enforcement (ice) for playing a critical role in the u.s. immigration system, saying he does not support defunding the agencies."}
{"original": "the secretary-designate promised to seek legal remedies to halt border wall construction if confirmed, but would not commit to removing barriers built by the trump administration. mayorkas also pledged to end the trump administration's remain in mexico policy that has forced tens of thousands of migrants to wait for their u.s. court hearings on the other side of the border."}
{"original": "citing mayorkas' statement on border barrier construction, missouri senator josh hawley announced after the hearing that he would oppose fast-tracking the confirmation process."}
{"original": "biden transition officials pledged last month to immediately start reviewing asylum cases of the most vulnerable migrants at the southern border. advocates still intend to keep up the pressure to ensure that mr. trump's obstacles to humanitarian protections are dismantled."}
{"original": "it would be unrealistic to expect that all of the problems that came from the trump administration and before to be undone in a single day, said kennji kizuka, a senior researcher for human rights first, but the incoming administration has the legal obligation to follow u.s. law and treaty obligations that the u.s. has taken on to protect refugees."}
{"original": "but a challenge enveloping all of dhs will be re-establishing trust in the sprawling agency."}
{"original": "david lapan, a retired u.s. marine colonel who served as dhs press secretary during the trump administration, remarked to cbs news that, the department of homeland security, the only federal agency whose primary mission is to protect the homeland — became under president trump, the department of immigration enforcement. the department of homeland security has not upheld its mission. and i think across the government, we've seen damage to institutions, both in terms of trust and credibility."}
{"original": "and kerlikowske, the ex-cbp head, said, the public trust issue is pretty tough right now in law enforcement generally. but when you look at (u.s. immigration and customs enforcement) or cbp, i think it's even more critical right now."}
{"original": "during the senate hearing, mayorkas stressed the need to expand intelligence gathering and information sharing with local law enforcement."}
{"original": "the divide between local law enforcement and the threat of domestic extremism is one of the greatest challenges that the department of homeland security confronts, mayorkas remarked."}
{"original": "reflecting on the capitol siege, mayorkas vowed to take swift action."}
{"original": "i will do everything i can to ensure that the tragic loss of life, the assault on law enforcement, the desecration of the building that stands as one of the three pillars of our democracy, and the terror felt by you, your colleagues, staff, and everyone present, will not happen again, he said."}

{"original": "local frustrations will likely intensify as the city's pro-beijing elite prepares to choose a new leader for the specially administered chinese region next year."}
{"original": "in unusually blunt comments, financial secretary john tsang predicted recently that hong kong's economy would eke out its smallest expansion in four years in 2016."}
{"original": "politics and economics are closely intertwined. political volatility will unavoidably impact on our economy, tsang said in his budget speech last month. tension and turbulence have left many in hong kong feeling suffocated by a confrontational atmosphere, said tsang, warning of even greater chaos ahead if tensions aren't resolved."}
{"original": "hong kong remains wealthier and freer than the mainland, but the city of 7.2 million is riven with inequality and faces growing competition from other chinese business hubs like nearby shenzhen and shanghai. meanwhile, chinese president xi jinping has sought to crush dissent in other regions like xinjiang and tibet, showing little sympathy for the yearning among many in hong kong for greater democracy."}
{"original": "investors aren't rushing for the exits yet, but in the financial industry, backbone of the economy, the mood is darkening."}
{"original": "if hong kong is gradually being taken over by all these chinese business practices -- and also politically there's more and more pressure and influence coming from mainland china -- this will definitely destroy hong kong in the end, said edward chan, an investment fund manager."}
{"original": "foreign investors might start to think that if hong kong does not have rule of law or anything, why don't they just move their investment directly to shanghai or beijing? what's the difference? he said."}
{"original": "as beijing increasingly opts more for the one country part of the one country, two systems framework guaranteeing its separate legal and financial systems until 2047, hong kong is paying a price."}
{"original": "dimming hong kong's image as a global financial center, hsbc (hsbc) decided in february not to move its headquarters from london back to hong kong despite a restructuring focused on pivoting toward asia. the hongkong & shanghai banking corp. was founded in the city in 1865 and shifted its headquarters to britain in the early 1990s."}

{"original": "hong kong's freedoms were on global display in late 2014, when hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets, blocking busy thoroughfares for 79 days to protest beijing's plan to restrict elections. the peaceful protests highlighted discontent with china's influence among local youths, but also among older hong kong citizens, many of whose families fled past political turmoil in the chinese mainland."}

{"original": "any economic weakness would surely stoke political anger, given the social grievances that underpinned recent protests, vickers said."}
{"original": "the bookseller disappearances shocked many hong kongers because of suspicions that mainland chinese security agents snatched lee and spirited him across the border, violating beijing's promise to stay out of most local affairs including law enforcement. gui apparently was apprehended in thailand and taken to mainland china."}
{"original": "many ethnic chinese in hong kong hold foreign passports as a sort of insurance policy in case of a crisis. the difficulties britain and sweden faced in getting consular access to lee and gui raised doubts about that strategy."}

{"original": "the economic setbacks have left kim with nothing to show for his ambitious diplomacy with president donald trump, which derailed over disagreements about sanctions relief in exchange for north korean denuclearization steps, and pushed kim to what is clearly the toughest moment of his nine-year rule."}
{"original": "kim's comments are likely intended to pressure the incoming u.s. government of joe biden, who has previously called the north korean leader a thug and accused mr. trump of chasing spectacle rather than meaningful curbs on the north's nuclear capabilities. kim has not ruled out talks, but said the fate of bilateral relations depends on whether washington abandons its hostile policy toward north korea."}

{"original": "the market has gotten so topsy-turvy that when friday's jobs report first came out, about an hour before the new york stock exchange opened, some investors wondered if it would cause relief or panic. the numbers were strong, but were they so strong as to push the fed to raise rates faster, which would be bad for stocks?"}
{"original": "i did find myself wondering how the market is going to react to this: are people asking, 'is this good?' said ernie cecilia, chief investment officer at bryn mawr trust. it just shows the environment we're in. it's uncertain how the market reacts, or overreacts."}
{"original": "expect the jitters to continue. reports are coming that will give investors clues about whether their fears of a possible recession are warranted, as well as updates on interest rates and trade policy. among the approaching milestones that could be the next to roil wall street:"}
{"original": "starting next week, companies will begin reporting their profits for the last three months of 2018, and expectations are high. analysts are forecasting 11.4 percent growth for s&p 500 companies, which would be the fifth straight quarter of gains topping 10 percent, according to factset."}
{"original": "those numbers are key because stock prices tend to track corporate profits over the long term. but even more attention will likely be paid to what ceos say about future profits."}
{"original": "we're going to have a nice, solid double-digit number for fourth-quarter earnings growth, said phil orlando, chief equity market strategist at federated investors. i think the market's bigger concern is how big the 2019 deceleration is."}

{"original": "apple's warning last week about slow iphone sales in china, the world's second-largest economy, shocked the market and sent apple's stock down nearly 10 percent. on the same day, delta air lines fell nearly 9 percent after it trimmed its forecast for fourth-quarter revenue."}
{"original": "orlando said he expects earnings growth will remain positive in 2019, just slower than last year, much like the economy. he nevertheless expects stocks to claw back their recent losses and return to a record by the end of the year, though with a lot of volatility in between."}

{"original": "the world's two biggest economies are battling over u.s. allegations that beijing uses predatory tactics to acquire advanced technologies, potentially undermining american technological dominance. according to a march report by the u.s. trade representative, china hacks into american companies' computer networks to steal trade secrets and forces foreign firms to share technology as the price of admission to the chinese market."}
{"original": "the standoff will be difficult to resolve before a march 1 deadline. that's when u.s. tariffs on $200 billion in chinese imports are scheduled to jump to 25 percent from 10 percent. chinese leaders have signaled their willingness to address u.s. complaints about america's massive trade deficit with china by buying more soybeans, natural gas and other u.s. products."}

{"original": "the next fed meeting comes in the last week of january, but most economists don't expect much action from it. the central bank is likely to leave rates alone after raising them four times last year."}
{"original": "investors instead will be more interested to hear what fed chairman jerome powell says in his news conference following the meeting. markets have parsed every word powell has said in public, hoping to divine clues about the path of interest rates. higher interest rates can forestall inflation, but they can also slow economic growth and drive buyers away from stocks."}
{"original": "after powell's news conference in december, for example, the s&p 500 slumped 1.5 percent on worries that the fed seemed set on raising short-term rates three times into 2020 and letting its portfolio of bond purchases shrink on automatic pilot."}
{"original": "the street is looking for some definitive evidence that this [fed] board of governors gets it and that three more rate hikes and [an inflexible approach to] balance-sheet shrinkage is too aggressive, orlando said."}
{"original": "investors heard some of that thursday when powell said the fed will be patient in raising rates and not rigid about unwinding the balance sheet. starting this month, powell will hold a news conference following each fed meeting, so investors will have plenty more opportunities to parse his words."}

{"original": "kerry, a surrogate for the former vice president, defended biden and said his 2002 vote in favor a resolution authorizing the use of force in iraq was a vote for the president to have leverage with respect to getting saddam hussein back to the ... inspections."}
{"original": "i think that bernie, regrettably, is distorting joe's record, kerry said sunday on face the nation. i mean, he doesn't have what joe biden has, which is eight years of sitting on the national security council and demonstrating his judgment."}
{"original": "kerry, who served in the senate alongside biden and also voted for the resolution, said it was very clear that those who supported the resolution were listening to a president who made a pledge that he was going to do diplomacy, that he was going to exhaust diplomacy, build a coalition. the resolution gave president george w. bush the authority to use military force to ensure iraqi dictator saddam hussein complied with u.n. security council resolutions."}
{"original": "biden has long faced criticism for his 2002 vote, including from sanders, who voted against the resolution as a member of the house. but as the country sees tensions between the u.s. and iran escalate following the drone strike that killed iranian military commander qassem soleimani earlier this month, biden's defenders have sought to use foreign policy experience as a way to differentiate him from the other democratic presidential hopefuls."}
{"original": "i think bernie is trying to drive a wedge in there, kerry said. i understand that, but i think the vice president has unparalleled, demonstrated accomplishment and success in foreign policy as chairman of the foreign relations committee and as vice president. and he, in my judgment, is the one person running for president who the moment he takes office, has the ability to be able to address a lot of questions, including the credibility of the united states."}

{"original": "riyadh, saudi arabia -saudi arabia unveiled a bold economic reform plan on monday aimed at weaning the country off its addiction to oil in a bid to prepare the next generation of saudi leaders for the domestic pressures of youth unemployment and revenues eroded by lower oil prices."}
{"original": "the project, which includes plans to float a stake in the world's largest oil company, aramco, and set up one of the world's biggest government investment funds, is meant to provide a blueprint for sweeping reforms to steer the opec kingdom away from its decades-long reliance on cheap-to-produce oil."}
{"original": "king salman said in a televised announcement that the cabinet approved the plan, known as vision 2030, and called on saudis to work together to ensure its success."}
{"original": "but it was left to the king's powerful son, deputy crown prince mohammed bin salman, to spell out details in an interview aired shortly after the announcement on saudi-owned broadcaster al-arabiya."}
{"original": "the 30-year-old second-in-line to the throne also serves as the country's defense minister and chairs a committee to oversee economic policymaking. that committee, the council on economic and development affairs, has been focused on reorienting the kingdom away from its heavy reliance on fossil fuels, creating jobs and boosting foreign investment."}
{"original": "the plan is ambitious. beyond selling state assets, it includes trimming government perks, like the estimated $61 billion spent annually on energy subsidies that saudi citizens have become accustomed to and which have helped secure political patronage for the al saud ruling family. just this week, the king sacked the country's water and electricity minister after complaints by citizens online over how increases in water tariffs had been implemented. the internet is one of the few spaces where people can discuss sensitive issues since there are no political parties and protests are banned."}
{"original": "though the plan stresses the importance of saudi women in the economy and expanding their job opportunities, it contained little to suggest the kingdom would accelerate its cautious pace of social reforms. women were granted the right to vote and run in local council elections for the first time last year, but they're still banned from driving and need the approval of a male relative -- usually a husband or father -- to travel abroad."}
{"original": "lower oil prices pushed saudi arabia into a budget deficit of nearly $100 billion last year and a projected deficit this year of $87 billion. despite efforts to limit reliance on its main export, oil accounted for more than 70 percent of the state's revenue in 2015."}
{"original": "masood ahmed, international monetary fund director for the middle east and central asia, said the plan's objective of diversifying the economy away from oil is exactly the kind of transformation that an economy like saudi arabia needs."}

{"original": "aramco boasts the world's largest oil reserves and produces some 10 million barrels of crude a day, giving it outsize influence over world energy markets. it traces its history to a 1933 agreement between the kingdom and the standard oil company of california to develop the country's oil reserves, and has been known as aramco -- an acronym for the arabian american oil co. -- since 1944. the saudi government took full control of the company in a series of buyouts that ended in 1980."}
{"original": "the prince also outlined plans to develop saudi arabia's $160 billion public investment fund and turn it into a $2 trillion sovereign fund that would go into developing the kingdom's cities. it would include cash generated from the aramco ipo, an existing $600 billion in reserves and state-owned real estate and industrial areas estimated to be worth $1 trillion, he said."}
{"original": "jason turvey, middle east economist for capital economics, said because plans for the fund reflect a shift of balance sheets rather than any new assets, it will not reduce the government's dependence on oil revenues."}
{"original": "we don't buy into mohammed bin salman's assertion that saudi arabia will no longer be dependent on oil by 2020, he wrote."}
{"original": "a bank of america merrill lynch report said the changes under king salman may herald a much more assertive role for royals in energy policy and cautioned that the concentration of power with the deputy crown prince could raise a succession risk going forward."}
{"original": "another major obstacle facing the saudi monarchy is unemployment, currently at 11.7 percent. the kingdom said it plans to reduce that to 7 percent by 2030 and to boost the private sector to alleviate pressures on the government to absorb its growing workforce."}
{"original": "more than half of saudis are under the age of 25, and in coming years millions will be looking for work and affordable housing. currently, 70 percent of saudis work in the public sector, where the government spends heavily on wages."}
{"original": "the deputy crown prince said another way to drive up nonoil revenue is by boosting the kingdom's own military production. saudi arabia was the world's third-largest arms buyer last year, with purchases of more than $87 billion, yet only 2 percent was for locally produced weaponry."}

{"original": "i was a private citizen and doing everything right and within my rights, rainey told the associated press on sunday."}
{"original": "a defense official told cbs news the army is investigating how many soldiers from fort bragg accompanied rainey to washington. rainey had resigned her commission after receiving a career-ending letter of reprimand for her actions at an earlier protest in the fort bragg area, martin reports."}
{"original": "because the process takes time, rainey was still on active duty when she led a group of protestors to washington and is due to leave the army next month. officials at fort bragg are now working to determine what other soldiers went to washington and whether they were part of the mob that stormed the capitol, martin reports."}
{"original": "rainey said she led 100 members of moore county citizens for freedom, which describes itself online as a nonpartisan network promoting conservative values, from north carolina to washington to stand against election fraud and support trump. she said the group attended the rally but she didn't know of anyone who entered the capitol and that they were headed back to their buses hours before an emergency curfew took effect."}
{"original": "rainey, 30, is assigned to the 4th psychological operations group at fort bragg, according to maj. daniel lessard, a spokesman for 1st special forces command. known as psyops, the group uses information and misinformation to shape the emotions, decision-making and actions of american adversaries."}

{"original": "police in southern pines, a community about 30 miles west of fort bragg, charged her with injury to personal property over the incident. the police told wral-tv that they let her off with warnings twice before after she tore down the tape closing off the playground."}
{"original": "in washington on wednesday, insurrectionists took over the house and senate chambers, smashed windows and waved trump, american and confederate flags. the riot followed the rally where trump repeated false claims that the election had been rigged against him and said he and his supporters are going to have to fight much harder to protect democracy."}
{"original": "so far, at least 90 people have been arrested on charges ranging from misdemeanor curfew violations to felonies related to assaults on police officers, possessing illegal weapons and making death threats against house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif."}

{"original": "members of the u.s. military are permitted to take part in political organizations and events out of uniform. however, there are caveats. the department of defense directive prohibits active-duty servicemembers from sponsoring partisan organizations. it is unclear if rainey's participation with her group on wednesday went against dod policy."}
{"original": "rainey said she attended the trump rally while on leave and didn't advertise that she was an army officer. she said sunday afternoon that her commanders had not inquired about her time in washington, but she did not immediately respond to a subsequent inquiry about the army's investigation."}

{"original": "the u.s. economy is booming, unemployment is at a 17-year low and wages appear to be picking up. so what's not to like?"}
{"original": "if you're one of the approximately 65 million americans in low-paid service jobs, getting a share of that economic prosperity may be unbearably difficult. jobs may be plentiful, but finding one that pays better than your current gig is much more rare than commonly believed, according to new research paper from the federal reserve bank of new york."}
{"original": "if you start in one of those low-wage occupations, you have a higher probability of becoming unemployed than moving up the career ladder, said todd gabe, a co-author of the paper, titled can low-wage workers get better jobs?"}
{"original": "the answer seems to be, with extreme difficulty."}
{"original": "the authors looked at 175,000 workers in so-called low-quality jobs -- with low pay, unpredictable scheduling and few or no benefits -- and examined how those people's jobs changed over a six-year period ending in 2017. of this group, only 5.2 percent were in a higher-paying job one year later, the authors found. by contrast, more than 10 percent left the workforce and 6.7 percent became unemployed."}
{"original": "in other words, a low-wage worker was three times more likely to stop working altogether than to move to a better job in a given year."}
{"original": "among those who did move from low-wage to higher-wage work, some common threads appeared. typical jobs they upgraded to included work as nursing aides, customer service representatives, administrative assistants or wholesale and manufacturing sales. none of the better jobs typical for workers leaving low-wage work were in production, the paper notes."}
{"original": "the single most common better job that low-wage workers moved into was truck driving. about one in 300 made this move. that's in line with other research that has found some kind of truck driving a common opportunity job, paying around the national average and accessible to people without college degrees. other opportunity jobs included clerks, automotive technicians and repair workers."}
{"original": "those who had a four-year college degree and were younger were also more likely to move into higher-paid work than their peers. don't underestimate the value of getting an education, gabe said."}
{"original": "these findings directly contradict the rosy discussion of today's job market. those who favor minimal regulation and oppose raising wages for service jobs often say such jobs are short-term and entry-level, providing workers with a first step on the ladder up job mobility."}
{"original": "the new york fed study's authors say, if low-wage jobs are simply a stepping stone to higher-quality jobs, then the problem of low-wage work can be solved via the labor market. but, they added, if, on the other hand, people tend to get trapped in low-wage jobs that are difficult to escape, then some more proactive policies may be warranted."}
{"original": "however, proactive policies don't seem to be coming. instead, public policy is pushing more people into the workforce while rescinding many protections working people have previously enjoyed."}
{"original": "still, the role of low-paid work in the u.s. is important. nine years after the great recession began, the largest and fastest-growing sector of the economy is in low-paid, service class jobs."}
{"original": "labor advocates and some academics have argued that rolling back economic polarization requires upgrading the jobs at the very bottom. as richard florida, a co-author of the new york fed paper, said in another paper he co-wrote: the only way to create a large number of family-supporting jobs that will rebuild the middle class is by upgrading the millions of precarious, low-skill, and low-wage service class jobs we already have."}

{"original": "the trump administration's $4.8 trillion budget has a number of winners, including nasa and defense spending. but among the losers would be social safety-net programs that are relied on by many low- and middle-class americans alike."}
{"original": "among the programs that would face cuts are medicaid, which provides medical insurance to low-income households, and the supplemental nutrition assistance program (snap), also known as food stamps. cuts are also directed at spending on people with disabilities and the children's health insurance program, or chip, which provides funding for uninsured children whose families earn too much money to qualify for medicaid."}
{"original": "while the trump budget has little chance of being enacted in its current state by congress, the proposal can be viewed as a blueprint for the administration's priorities, experts say. the plan would cut $1 trillion from medicaid and affordable care act premium tax credits over 10 years, pare assistance to people with disabilities, and slash food-stamp spending by about $180 billion over the next decade, according to the the left-leaning center on budget and policy priorities."}
{"original": "the proposed budget is stunningly harsh, robert greenstein, president of the liberal-leaning center on budget and policy priorities, said in a statement. it would take health coverage away from millions of people and cut aid to millions of families and individuals struggling to make ends meet."}
{"original": "in some cases, the administration may not require budgetary changes to pare spending. take the food stamp program, which has been targeted by new and proposed rules from the u.s. department of agriculture. about 5.3 million households could lose or see reduced food-stamp benefits under those new rules without any budget vote by congress."}
{"original": "the trump administration has disregarded congress before when it comes to funding priorities: congress passed a bipartisan farm bill that protected snap, and then the administration used three rule changes to make the cuts they wanted in the first place, said lily roberts, director of economic mobility at the liberal think tank center for american progress, in an email to cbs moneywatch."}
{"original": "under the proposed budget, spending for the snap program would be pared by almost $182 billion through 2030. the u.s. department of agriculture has said the food-stamp reforms will help workers become more self-sufficient."}
{"original": "the cuts would come at a time when the program's already shrinking. the program's costs have dropped from a peak of $80 billion in 2013 to about $58 billion in 2019 as the economy gained its footing following the recession, bringing more americans into the labor market."}
{"original": "the budget also revives the trump administration's plans for harvest boxes, which it describes as american-grown foods provided directly to households delivered in a box for food-stamp recipients, rather than allowing them to buy their own groceries at food stores with the benefits."}
{"original": "states would maintain the ability to provide choice to their participants, including by using innovative approaches for the inclusion of fresh products, the budget says."}
{"original": "these boxes aren't a new idea, having been proposed two years ago by the administration. critics have called the idea condescending and demeaning by taking away recipients' ability to make their own food choices."}
{"original": "the budget also calls for cuts to medicaid, partly by adding work requirements for able-bodied, working-age individuals between the ages of 18 to 65."}
{"original": "medicaid spending will grow at a more sustainable rate by ending the financial bias that currently favors able-bodied working-age adults over the truly vulnerable, the trump administration's budget states."}
{"original": "spending in medicaid and the children's health insurance program, which covers 8.9 million u.s. children, would be reduced by $193 billion over 10 years. together, medicaid and chip provide health coverage for about 4 of 10 children, the american hospital association says."}

{"original": "the letter indicates the offers are dependent on successful drug and background screenings."}
{"original": "employees at the homestead facility must undergo the fbi's fingerprint criminal history check, but the federal government has granted a waiver allowing the facility to bypass florida's child abuse and neglect background check system, according to hhs deputy assistant secretary for public affairs mark weber. the waiver was granted to virginia-based chs because companies that are not regulated by the state's child welfare and foster care authorities are not allowed to access its statewide automated child welfare information system database."}
{"original": "in an email to cbs news, weber said the fbi fingerprint background checks conducted on employees would show relevant information."}
{"original": "however, fbi checks would not surface what state policy refers to as verified maltreatment findings that are not necessarily prosecuted, but are logged in the system because a preponderance of credible evidence exists to support the allegations of abuse, neglect or abandonment."}
{"original": "that means there could be important information in potential employees' pasts that chs is missing, according to stacie schmerling, a partner at talenfeld law, a fort lauderdale, florida-based firm that specializes in child abuse cases."}
{"original": "the fbi search won't have the same information as the (state child abuse and neglect) database, schmerling said. this is a facility for unaccompanied children, so you'd want to approach it like foster care, where you try to gather as much information as possible about someone's history."}
{"original": "in june, cbs news reported that because homestead and the tornillo facility are on federal land, they are not subject to the stringent child welfare inspections required for all other shelters for unaccompanied children, which are on state land."}

{"original": "the shutdown does not appear to be slowing the rate at which new staffers are being hired. an employee of the homestead facility, who asked not to be identified, told cbs news applicants were being hired on the spot at the job fair — as promised in the company's facebook flyer. the employee complained that new hires were being brought on for supervisory positions, instead of those with seniority."}
{"original": "they're hiring so many people with no experience. some are getting jobs better than me, the employee said."}
{"original": "caliburn did not reply to a question about the experience levels sought for youth care workers, case managers, clinical counselors, educational instructors, drivers, and travel chaperones at the facility."}
{"original": "caliburn has also repeatedly declined to speak with cbs news about the homestead facility's rapid expansion. according to hhs, the facility currently employs 1,600 people while holding 1,250 children. it ultimately will fit 2,350 children, and will have to staff up to meet that need. the site is required to have no more than 12 children for every one adult supervisor, 24 hours a day, according to hhs, plus security, medical, case management and operations personnel at all times."}
{"original": "it is not clear how much caliburn is paid to operate the facility, but the revenue is not without risk, according to an october 9 sec filing."}
{"original": "in the past, we have received negative publicity for this work with (hhs), and it is possible that we may be subject to such negative publicity in the future as well, the company wrote. allegations of impropriety or reports mischaracterizing our activities or criticism of the missions that we are supporting have the potential to cause us reputational harm."}

{"original": "testing does not eliminate all risk, dr. robert r. redfield, the director of the cdc, said in a statement tuesday. but when combined with a period of staying at home and everyday precautions like wearing masks and social distancing, it can make travel safer, healthier, and more responsible by reducing spread on planes, in airports, and at destinations."}

{"original": "these accounts were engaged in sharing harmful qanon-associated content at scale and were primarily dedicated to the propagation of this conspiracy theory across the service, twitter said."}

{"original": "the following is a transcript of an interview with representative adam schiff that aired sunday, january 12, 2020, on face the nation."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: we're joined now by the chairman of the house intelligence committee, adam schiff. good morning to you, mr. chairman."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: you are part of the gang of eight, so you're part of that group that received the very classified briefing that the defense secretary was referring to. he said the intelligence was exquisite, and it was incredibly detailed. do you quibble with his characterization of what you were told?"}
{"original": "rep. schiff: i don't quibble with it. i think it's just plain wrong. there was no discussion in the gang of eight briefings that these are the four embassies that are being targeted and we have exquisite intelligence that shows these are the specific targets."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: what about u.s. embassy, baghdad?"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: he said that was specifically referenced."}
{"original": "rep. schiff: --well, i don't recall, frankly, in that briefing there being a specific discussion about bombing the u.s. embassy in baghdad. the brief was much more along the lines, frankly, of something that secretary pompeo admitted the other day when he said that we don't know precisely where and we don't know precisely when. that was much more the nature of the briefing that we got. in the view of the briefers, there was plotting. there was a- an effort to escalate being planned, but they didn't have specificity. and so when you hear the president out there on fox, he is fudging the intelligence and when you hear the secretary say, well, that wasn't what the intelligence said, but that's my personal belief, he is fudging. when secretary pompeo was on your show last week and made the claim that the intelligence analysis was that taking soleimani out would improve our security and not- and leaving them in would make us less safe, that is also fudging. that's not an intelligence conclusion. that is pompeo's personal opinion. intelligence--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: is that a polite way of saying they're lying?"}
{"original": "rep. schiff: well, you know, you could certainly put it that way. but frankly, i think what they are doing is they are overstating and exaggerating what the intelligence shows. and when you're talking about justifying acts that might bring us into warfare with iran, that's a dangerous thing to do."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: but to be fair, because you are the intel committee chairman, you know, the intel committee often or- the intelligence committee works in assessments, in judgments, in putting together mosaic pieces of information to come to a conclusion. when esper is working in beliefs and projections, isn't that just how it works? impossibilities and not necessarily always having one conclusive piece of the exact place and time?"}
{"original": "rep. schiff: well, that's exactly right. but that- that means that you need to be very clear about what you're saying the intelligence shows and what it doesn't. if we were to ask the intelligence agencies, will taking soleimani out make us safer or less safe? they would say to us, congressman, that's a policy judgment that the policy makers need to make. what we can tell you is if you take him out, here are the likely repercussions. those repercussions that we were briefed about were far more dangerous to this country than anything that soleimani was plotting, as far as i can tell. and so when you're talking about taking out a top government official of another nation, an act that might bring us into outright warfare, the burden of imminence, of showing imminence with very great specifics, i think is very high."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: so i- i just want to button up, because the defense secretary also said that in that gang of eight briefing, when he said there was sensitive information shared, though he said he wasn't in the room, that it was the gang of eight's decision not to share the information with the rest of congress. he said he'd be okay with it if sensitive bits were taken out."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: is this is a political decision?"}
{"original": "rep. schiff: he said a couple things. he said that what he was told by the briefers is that most or all of the members were completely satisfied. that's not correct. i can tell you i wasn't, and there were other members of the gang of eight who were equally unsatisfied with the proof of imminence. in terms of the- what he has described and others have described as the exquisite nature or sources and methods, we often don't share the most sensitive sources and methods with all of the members, but that's not an excuse for withholding from the members the underlying facts. and so if the intelligence showed that there were four embassies being targeted that should have been shared with the members. it wasn't because i don't believe that is what the intelligence showed."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: have you heard from members of the intelligence community that they objected to what the administration did?"}
{"original": "rep. schiff: they're not going to volunteer that. in other words, the intelligence community doesn't want to get crosswise with the white house and with—"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: you've spoken to cia director gina haspell?"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: this was, it appears, according to esper's description, also her assessment."}
{"original": "rep. schiff: well, i don't know whether esper has represented that the cia director supported or didn't support a strike on soleimani. the job of the cia director is to say, this is what our intelligence shows, this is what our intelligence analysts tell us will be the repercussions if you take soleimani out. that is the principal role. it's the president's call whether that justifies taking a strike, but that should be done in consultation with congress and approved by congress. and neither of those things happened here."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: should other irgc leaders be targeted?"}
{"original": "rep. schiff: i think that we have escalated enough, and--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: even though iran says its standing down and the president has used that phrase?"}
{"original": "rep. schiff: well, i think what we're likely to see, at least in the near term, is the end of iran's overt attacks, like the missile attack on our bases. i don't think that we conclude- conclude at all that we've seen an end to the- their use of shia and other proxies. and so the risk to american troops and to american civilians continues, i think is- is greater now as a result of the administration's actions. iran has been humiliated by- by this taking out of their top leadership, but also by their disastrous shoot down of this civilian aircraft."}
{"original": "rep. schiff: that makes them, i think, more dangerous and provocative in the sense that we may very well see covert retaliation against the united states."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: i want to switch gears, because in your role, you were also playing a key- a key- you are a key figure in the impeachment investigation up to this point. i'm wondering if you have a sense about whether you'll be an impeachment manager when this goes to a senate trial?"}
{"original": "rep. schiff: well, that'll be the speaker's decision. i don't want to get ahead of her--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: do you want to be?"}
{"original": "rep. schiff: --thinking. i've told the speaker that i will play whatever role that she and the caucus believe would be useful."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: and the speaker was on another network today and seemed to leave open the idea of subpoenaing john bolton, the former national security adviser to the president. is that something you would be looking at? are you looking at?"}
{"original": "rep. schiff: you know, it's certainly something that we are considering. but look, americans want to see a fair trial in the senate. they want to see a trial that's fair to the president and they want to see a trial that's fair to the american people, that brings all the facts forward. there's little sense in bringing bolton in to the house and not allowing the senators to see his testimony. if they're going to be the triers of fact and they will be they should hear from the witness directly. he has offered to come forward and testify. there is no reason not to have him testify unless you just want to cover up the president's wrongdoing. if mcconnell succeeds in making this trial a trial without witnesses, it will be the first impeachment trial in history where the subject of the trial didn't resign, mid trial where they didn't have witnesses. that's not a fair trial. that's a sham. that's a cover up. and i think one of the things that holding on to the articles has succeeded doing is --"}

{"original": "president trump selected grenell, the current u.s. ambassador to germany, to replace joseph maguire as the acting director of national intelligence last week. a vocal ally of mr. trump's, grenell is expected to serve in a temporary capacity until the president names a permanent director to lead the office that oversees the nation's 17 intelligence agencies."}
{"original": "grenell has come under scrutiny in the wake of his appointment for consulting work he did before he was confirmed as the u.s. ambassador to germany in 2018. propublica reported last week that grenell wrote op-eds in 2016 defending vladimir plahotniuc, a moldovan politician, and allegedly failed to disclose payments for his work on behalf of the oligarch."}

{"original": "senate democrats, meanwhile, have criticized mr. trump's selection. senate intelligence committee vice chairman mark warner, a democrat from virginia, said grenell lacks the intelligence experience needed to lead the nation's intelligence community and accused the president of attempting to sidestep the senate's constitutional obligation to advise and consent on such critical national security positions."}

{"original": "the point of the hearing on that day was for an immigration judge to explain the asylum process to the migrants, including their rights under u.s. immigration law. many of the people in the room had crossed into the united states illegally last fall. they were subsequently sent back across the border to wait in mexico until their asylum hearings, in line with the united states' migrant protection protocols, more commonly known as the remain in mexico policy."}
{"original": "this was their first opportunity to face a judge. but it would not be in person."}
{"original": "everyone faced a large video monitor. on the screen was judge sean clancy in a courtroom 30 miles away."}
{"original": "clancy is with the justice department agency that oversees immigration courts. accompanying him in the closed circuit broadcast was a spanish interpreter and a court clerk. a department of homeland security lawyer was seated off-camera. he spoke only six times and said no more than a couple of short phrases. the migrants never saw his face."}
{"original": "judge clancy began by asking the group, through his interpreter, if there was anyone in the room whose first language was something other than spanish. a 30-year-old man named alberto raised his hand. he was there with his seven-year-old son, carlos. the child looked small for his age."}
{"original": "alberto explained in halting spanish that he spoke k'iche, a mayan language common in the central highlands of guatemala."}
{"original": "without missing a beat, judge clancy dialed a number on a speaker phone and asked the attendant who answered to provide a k'iche translator. after less than a minute of the kind of hold music you would hear if you called a dentist, a cheerful man with a soft texas accent got on the line and began to speak to alberto in k'iche."}

{"original": "i recognize this possesses obstacles and difficulties but there is no way around it. it is what the law requires, clancy said. my role is to make sure you have a fair hearing."}
{"original": "judge clancy also told alberto and the other asylum seekers they would be given a list of legal aid organizations that could help them with their paperwork, but it would be the migrants' responsibility to pay for their own attorneys."}
{"original": "we were told by immigration lawyers in the area that the vast majority of asylum seekers ultimately end up representing themselves at these hearings."}
{"original": "alberto said he understood the judge but he was fearful of returning to mexico with his son because he did not speak spanish well."}
{"original": "see what you can get done on the application and we'll see where we can go from there, clancy said in a businesslike tone that was consistent throughout the hearing. the few times he did try to crack a small joke, they seemed lost in translation."}
{"original": "after alberto was given a date for his next hearing, clancy offered the same explanations on the process to the others with the help of his spanish interpreter. seven-year old carlos, who up to that moment had been remarkably patient for a child his age, began to hum. one of the guards won his silence with a small bag of snacks."}
{"original": "once clancy finished with his rundown of what was required of the asylum applicants, he asked how many people were afraid to return to mexico. one hand went up. that was followed by six others. a woman who was there with her 11-year-old daughter was the last to haltingly raise her hand."}
{"original": "some of us are afraid to say we are afraid to go back to mexico because we don't want to be sent to central america, she said. the woman was referring to new agreements the u.s. has with honduras, guatemala and el salvador to send migrants seeking asylum in the u.s. to those countries instead. the only agreement implemented so far is the one with guatemala."}
{"original": "judge clancy asked if she was afraid to wait in mexico."}
{"original": "judge clancy confirmed with the dhs lawyer just off-screen that he'd noted the migrants' fears of returning to mexico so that they may have an interview about their reasons for being afraid. it was unclear to us when that would happen."}
{"original": "the only asylum applicant who had a lawyer present was a 75-year-old woman from venezuela. she left her home country in october and took a plane to panama, then flew to mexico and illegally crossed the rio grande into the united states. she did not say why she wanted asylum."}
{"original": "the young lawyer who represented the woman was doing so pro-bono. she had only become aware of the woman's case at 11 o'clock the night before and was not fully acquainted with all the details of her asylum claim. as she leaned over to ask her client a question, judge clancy's interpreter began to translate the private conversation. judge clancy recognized it was a private attorney-client exchange, stopped his interpreter and apologized to the lawyer."}
{"original": "a lot of things would be easier to deal with if you are here, he noted about his closed circuit courtroom and the distance between all involved. then the screen temporarily went to black on his end."}
{"original": "i thought i lost you, clancy said with some relief once the live picture returned."}
{"original": "the judge gave everyone in the group a final opportunity to ask questions. they all declined. the next court date for most of the asylum seekers was scheduled for april 30. that's when they would be able to make their best case to stay in the united states."}

{"original": "what we've really done is made sure that anything that's harmful can't be put on the site in terms of regular content or groups or ads. when it comes to generalized political speech, whether that's in ads or that — we really think that, as one company, being the arbiter of truth is too much power and something that kind of sounds like we should do it, but as soon as we started doing it, everyone would be, like, 'oh my god, facebook's deciding what's true and false,' sandberg said. and political speech is very heavily scrutinized. one politician says something, they run it in an ad, they say it in a speech. the person running against them says it's false, and that process we think continues and needs the full-throated opportunities people have."}

{"original": "scion was formed in 2003 to attract younger buyers. it was known for its funky designs, like the boxy xb, and was the brand toyota used when it wanted to experiment with new kinds of marketing, like pop-up test drives at the mall, or no-haggle pricing."}
{"original": "twelve years ago, scion was courting generation x buyers, who didn't like their parents' brands and didn't trust traditional marketing, said bob carter, toyota's senior vice president of u.s. operations. but as those buyers matured, they started buying toyotas."}
{"original": "next came the millennials. for a while, that generation delayed car buying because they were underemployed and had too much student debt. but when they did buy, they liked their parents' brands and wanted toyotas, too."}
{"original": "for those buyers, frankly speaking, toyota as a brand is more aspirational than scion was, carter said."}
{"original": "there were other issues. scion's small, oddball lineup never connected with buyers and cost a bit more, since features like touchscreens that were optional on other cars came standard on scions. scion's best-seller, the tc coupe, starts at $21,330, or $2,600 more than a honda civic. scion also doesn't have any suvs, which are rapidly becoming the most popular style of vehicle in the u.s."}
{"original": "at the brand's height, in 2006, sales of all scion models combined reached just over 173,000. sales stood at 56,167 in 2015. by comparison, toyota sold more than 363,000 corolla sedans."}

{"original": "scion was the test bed, carter said."}
{"original": "sarah wall, a 39-year-old marketing and communications executive in san francisco, said she bought a scion xd in 2010 because of scion's no-haggle pricing policy. the car is distinctive, easy to park and has low maintenance costs, she said."}
{"original": "wall said she's devastated that scion will no longer be a separate brand. but she says she would consider a toyota in the future, especially if the brand adopts no-haggle pricing."}
{"original": "toyota's decision will have minimal impact on dealers and owners. scion, which is only sold in the u.s., canada and puerto rico, has no stand-alone dealerships. the brand is sold through 1,004 toyota dealerships, which will continue to service the cars."}
{"original": "it's not unusual for automakers to kill a brand or pull it out of a particular market. ford motor co. killed its mercury brand in 2010, and multiple brands, like izusu and renault, have left the u.s. market. but kelley blue book senior analyst karl brauer said this is the first time a u.s.-specific brand launched by a japanese manufacturer has been killed."}
{"original": "brauer says scion was a victim of the success of the toyota brand. the toyota camry sedan has been the best-selling car in the u.s. for 14 years, and the brand has a full lineup that appeals to millennials and baby boomers alike."}

{"original": "as they've indicated before, both biden and sanders pledged to back immigration reform legislation that includes a pathway to u.s. citizenship for most of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the u.s."}
{"original": "biden vowed to revamp the current asylum system at the u.s.-mexico border, where the trump administration has implemented a series of restrictive policies designed to deter u.s.-bound migrants. he promised to end the so-called remain in mexico policy, which requires asylum-seekers to wait in northern mexico for their chance to see a u.s. immigration judge, saying the program has forced thousands of migrants to live in squalor on the other side of the border."}
{"original": "the former vice president also touted a plan to hire more immigration judges to adjudicate asylum claims at the southern border, and seemed to make a bold promise to abolish the civil detention of migrants seeking humanitarian protections. as part of its deterrence policies, mr. trump's administration has expanded the practice of detaining asylum-seekers for the duration of their cases."}
{"original": "no one would be put in jail while waiting for their hearing, biden said."}
{"original": "asked if their proposed asylum changes could be criticized as open border policies, sanders strongly pushed back, saying most americans support a humane immigration agenda."}

{"original": "new york -- the new york police department says a sergeant has been stripped of her gun and badge and charged internally in the july 2014 chokehold death of eric garner."}

{"original": "he remains on modified duty and has yet to face departmental charges. a federal probe is continuing."}

{"original": "discrimination in auto buying is alive and well more than 40 years after the equal credit opportunity act outlawed discrimination in lending."}
{"original": "the national fair housing alliance said it sent eight pairs of car buyers -- one white, one not -- to shop separately at car dealerships in virginia. despite the fact that all the nonwhite test buyers were better qualified for loans, 62.5 percent received more costly pricing, which would have caused them to pay an average of $2,662.56 more."}
{"original": "three-quarters of the time, white buyers also were given more financing options than buyers of color, according to nfha's report, released thursday."}
{"original": "it is upsetting to find that in 2018, consumers of color are still facing discriminatory practices when making major financial purchases, said lindsay daniels, associate director of economic policy for unidosus in a prepared statement. being charged more for credit despite being financially qualified for better rates, especially on big-ticket items like a car, can have devastating impact on a family's monthly budget and financial stability."}
{"original": "the report was more a confirmation of earlier studies than a revelation about discrimination in lending. discriminatory practices have been chronicled frequently since the 1990s, when a yale law professor came up with the idea of sending identically situated testers of different races car dealerships to see how race factored into eligibility for loans. since then, dozens of studies have been conducted with the same results."}
{"original": "however, advocates said some progress was being made, thanks to a crackdown by the consumer financial protection bureau that started in 2013. the consumer watchdog, which won settlements from both honda and toyota's financing arms two years ago, is now under new leadership, and pending legislation would restrict the agency's ability to penalize violators."}
{"original": "this study points to the need for having a watchdog on the beat that is empowered to do their job, said delvin davis, senior researcher for the national fair housing alliance."}
{"original": "with the cfpb's continued commitment to fair lending unclear, car buyers would be wise to protect themselves. fortunately, new and improved tools put consumers in the driver's seat, providing more pricing transparency and negotiating power. what should you do if you're in the car market, regardless of your race?"}
{"original": "the best financing terms go to buyers who have high credit scores. generally speaking, a score of 720-740 (depending on the scoring system) should win you the best rates on auto loans."}
{"original": "consumers can get free credit scores in a number of ways. many credit card companies, including capital one (cof), chase (jpm), citi (c) and american express (axp), will provide free credit scores to their card holders. discover (dfs) will provide a free credit score to anyone who asks. website creditkarma also provides free scores and advice on what might be holding your score back."}
{"original": "before you walk into a dealership, check with your own bank or credit union and get pre-approved for an auto loan, suggested jack gilles, director of public affairs for the consumer federation of america and author of the car book. the car dealer, which may have access to subsidized rates from the manufacturer, could still beat that rate."}
{"original": "however, if the dealer can't or won't give you a better deal, a pre-approval means you don't need to accept higher-cost financing."}
{"original": "check prices online and negotiate via phone"}
{"original": "websites, including kbb.com and edmunds.com, can give you a good read on what a car should cost loaded with all of the extras that you want. these services will also link to specific car offers, including the list prices at various dealerships."}
{"original": "this can be a good starting point to shop online and over the phone, calling -- or emailing -- the relevant dealerships to begin your negotiating process. be sure to ask about the all-in price, including taxes, destination fees and any other mandatory dealer add-ons. email multiple dealers, asking for their best price on what you want. when dealers know they're competing, you often get better prices."}
{"original": "particularly if you're buying a used car -- each of which is unique because of wear and tear, options and mileage -- make sure you get the vin (vehicle id number) for any car you've negotiated down to a price that you find appealing. this can reduce the chance that the dealer will claim your specific car just sold, giving the dealer the ability to restart the negotiating process in person."}
{"original": "if you're a costco (cost) member, the club offers a free car-buying service, where the prices have been pre-negotiated at a discount to manufacturer's suggested retail. for a $250 fee, carbargains.org will also negotiate with five dealers for you."}
{"original": "however, you may be able to do even better by using these services and then expanding the list of dealerships that you price-check via email, using the pre-negotiated prices as your starting point and only buying when you get an even better deal."}
{"original": "if you have good credit, you have bargaining power. the best way to exercise it is to walk away when you feel the dealership is being dishonest or disrespectful. when finalizing your deal, be sure to read the financing documents and make sure they conform with the deal you negotiated."}
{"original": "there are thousands of car dealers. take your time and find one that treats you fairly and doesn't throw in unexpected costs when you're about ready to sign on the dotted line."}

{"original": "san juan, puerto rico — award-winning playwright and musician lin-manuel miranda is widely revered in many parts of puerto rico, where the new york city-born hamilton creator traces his roots. his family's hometown of vega alta, west of the capital, is adorned with several colorful murals of him and even a museum dedicated to his artistic and philanthropic work."}
{"original": "but after planning a three-week run of his broadway hit on the island, miranda and his musical encountered some unexpected hostility. as a result, miranda and his team announced in december — just three weeks before the show's opening on january 11 — that the production would relocate from a historic theater at the university of puerto rico's río piedras campus to another theater in san juan."}
{"original": "the university has a policy of limiting police presence on campus, which the hamilton team believed was necessary because of potential protests during the production."}
{"original": "in recent months, the university has been roiled by student demonstrations against educational cuts, faculty layoffs and tuition hikes that were ordered by the federal fiscal board, which congress established through the 2016 puerto rico oversight, management, and economic stability act — known as promesa."}
{"original": "although hamilton ticket sale proceeds will go to a charitable arts fund established by the miranda family, some puerto ricans seized on the musical's symbolism as a celebration of american government to continue their criticism of the unpopular federal oversight board, which miranda supports."}
{"original": "the protests reflect the student and local discontent with america's foreign policy, which affects us negatively, carlos ariel ortiz, a 43-year-old business administration professor at ana g. méndez university, told cbs news. it is a communal cry of protest."}
{"original": "ortiz said many puerto ricans feel like they have no voice and no vote to stop austerity measures imposed by the board, known locally as the junta. since it was established in 2016 to deal with the growing debt-crisis in puerto rico, the board has directed the island's government to make budget cuts to several welfare programs, as well as the educational system."}
{"original": "the relationship between the islands's residents and the junta, ortiz said, resembles a colonial system."}
{"original": "puerto rico has been under the control of the fiscal board for some time. it's a federal entity which governs local politics. this highlights our colonial status. we are the only colony in the world, he said."}
{"original": "lin-manuel miranda's father, luis miranda, who studied at the university of puerto rico, said he supports students' right to protest, mainly because he's a longtime activist."}
{"original": "i do it all the time — i did it all my life, he told cbs news' david begnaud on wednesday."}
{"original": "but miranda said the venue change was warranted."}
{"original": "we had security concerns because the university doesn't have its own police, it's difficult for police to go in, he said. so, if anything were to happen — even if the possibilities were remote — we didn't want to run that chance."}

{"original": "the trump administration has faced criticism over the availability of coronavirus test kits in the united states. vice president mike pence has said any american would be able to get tested for the disease it causes, covid-19 — but acknowledged this week, as the government raced to distribute tests, that the capacity wasn't there yet."}
{"original": "so what should someone do if they want to get tested?"}
{"original": "according to the american hospital association, people who think they have the coronavirus should call their physician to see if a test is warranted. if so, they will direct you to an appropriate testing site."}
{"original": "clinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with covid-19 and whether the patient should be tested, reads the cdc's website."}
{"original": "the cdc guidance urges doctors to consider local epidemiology — who the person came in contact with and their travel history — as well as a patient's symptoms. it also strongly encourages them to test for other causes of respiratory illness, such as the flu, before moving forward with a coronavirus test."}
{"original": "that guidance may evolve as the virus is better understood."}
{"original": "according to dr. rochelle walensky, chief of infectious disease at massachusetts general hospital, someone could potentially have the coronavirus and the flu at the same time."}
{"original": "what we don't know is about people who are asymptomatic ... where in the course of the disease does it turn negative, and where does it turn positive, walensky said."}
{"original": "testing for the virus involves both a nasopharyngeal (nose) and oropharyngeal (mouth) swab, which provide labs with upper respiratory tract specimens. the cdc also recommends – though does not require — that health care providers collect lower respiratory tract specimens — sputum or phlegm — if available."}
{"original": "the time it takes to get results varies."}
{"original": "test results processed by the cdc initially took four to five days due to constraints on personnel and the number of tests available, according to walensky. now, she said, the turnaround from the cdc is usually one to two days."}
{"original": "how long it takes to get results from other labs depends on where tests are conducted."}
{"original": "testing in california, where the most cases of covid-19 have been confirmed in the united states, takes about 48 hours, according to the california department of public health. cdc kits are already being used by 11 public health labs in california, and will expand to 20 labs in the coming weeks, the department said thursday."}
{"original": "dr. sarah turbett, a microbiologist and infectious disease specialist at massachusetts general hospital, said labs in massachusetts are able to determine results within 24 hours."}
{"original": "in washington, where 13 people have died from coronavirus, testing is taking place daily at the state's public health laboratory. according to the washington state department of health, the laboratory performed 209 tests for 91 people as of wednesday."}
{"original": "as of friday, 245 people had tested positive for covid-19 in the united states — a figure that could jump as more people are tested."}
{"original": "the availability of tests is expected to jump within the next few weeks as the cdc sends out a new batch and independent manufacturers ramp up production."}
{"original": "an initial coronavirus test distributed by the centers for disease control and prevention had a faulty reagent that prompted labs to report problems, delaying testing across the country. for one month, the cdc was one of only a handful of labs able to run a diagnostic test, according to the association of public health laboratories."}
{"original": "reporters pressed secretary of health and human services alex azar thursday on why the u.s. response hasn't matched that of countries like south korea, which has a large outbreak and has tested over 100,000 people."}
{"original": "azar said more production will put availability of testing in the u.s. far ahead of similarly impacted major countries around the world."}
{"original": "on friday, azar said as many as 4 million tests will be sent to public health labs, the private sector, and hospitals by next week."}
{"original": "the cdc sends kits to laboratories designated as qualified by the cdc, according to its website. these include u.s. state and local public health laboratories, department of defense laboratories and select international laboratories."}
{"original": "azar added that integrated dna technologies, idt, a manufacturer that works with the cdc, will make a million of its own tests available by the end of next week."}
{"original": "he also noted that an fda policy change that allows cdc-qualified labs to create its own tests before the fda has completed its review will radically expand availability of tests."}
{"original": "one such lab, quest diagnostics, said in a press release thursday that it would be able to provide testing as early as monday."}
{"original": "the new service is expected to employ respiratory specimens collected in appropriate health care settings, such as hospitals and physician offices, reads the statement. ... patients suspected of, or confirmed to have, covid-19 should consult with a physician regarding the best way to provide a specimen for testing by quest."}
{"original": "it's unclear which states and facilities will receive the new tests. right now… it is a challenge if you are a doctor wanting to get somebody tested, said azar."}
{"original": "on friday, azar said washington and california have received all the tests they've requested."}
{"original": "by this weekend, that broad network of hospitals, other labs, will be receiving from idt those million tests that we referred to… so that experience will get better within the next week, week and a half, two weeks, he said."}
{"original": "but do not be surprised if you hear concerns of doctors saying 'i have a patient i don't know how to get this done.'"}
{"original": "with more tests will come better data."}
{"original": "we're only testing people who are the sickest so it does make the mortality rate look quite high, turbett said."}
{"original": "an uptick in testing could be a double-edged sword, walensky said. the mortality rate will likely go down, but the number of confirmed cases could also go up."}
{"original": "i sort of like to think about it as turning the lights on, she said."}
{"original": "the best way to describe the source of president donald trump's broad economic and political impact is to take him out of the equation altogether, says economist mark blyth."}
{"original": "the first thing to do is stop focusing on trump if you want to understand this, the scotland-born brown university professor said on the latest episode of the takeout podcast. the bigger picture is simply a story of the breakdown of that regime, if you want to call it that, from the '80s through to the financial crisis, where basically a huge amount of wealth was generated globally, and it went into very few hands locally."}
{"original": "over breakfast tacos at food-truck-turned-restaurant, district taco, across the street from the cbs news dc bureau, blyth told cbs news chief white house correspondent major garrett and political director steve chaggaris that donald trump is a phenomenon on both the right and the left -- and not only in the u.s., but also in other countries across the globe."}
{"original": "and what it is, essentially, is a huge amount of dissatisfaction with the people who have been running the world for the last 30 years."}
{"original": "it's like the ubiquitous fast food chain mcdonald's, he says, drawing an extended metaphor: it's hard to find a bad mcdonald's in the united states, but if you eat there all the time, bad things can happen."}
{"original": "so a large part of the united states has been eating mcdonald's for 30 years. and they figured out that there's a kitchen on the coasts serving lobster.. and they're not invited."}
{"original": "blyth thinks that the ultimate tragedy of the trump presidency is that he may not be able to fix this imbalance. will trump's moment be a political one, absent the policy relevance needed to deal with the grievances his supporters elected him to solve?"}
{"original": "sadly, i think that's shaping up to be most likely outcome – that ultimately what you've got is someone who's portrayed himself as people's champion, blythe said. and he's come along and said, 'you know, we need to protect coal jobs.' all right, great sympathy for the people who are there who are doing this. but coal mining in the developed world is shutting down everywhere."}

{"original": "hong kong - china's economic growth slowed in the first quarter to 6.7 percent, largely in line with expectations, but its slowest pace since the global financial crisis."}
{"original": "data reported friday showed that the annualized growth rate for the world's second-largest economy ticked lower from the previous quarter's 6.8 percent."}
{"original": "but carefully targeted stimulus helped to prevent it from slowing even further, analysts said, raising hopes that growth may be stabilizing."}
{"original": "a prolonged slowdown took annual growth last year to 6.9 percent, the weakest annual expansion in a quarter century. the communist leadership is seeking to steer the economy toward greater reliance on services and private consumption, and away from a growth model based on export manufacturing and investment."}
{"original": "the economy is at a critical stage of climbing uphill and getting over the structural adjustment's hurdles and the pain of the adjustment process persists, national bureau of statistics spokesman shen laiyun said at a press conference. in the meantime the real economy is still in relative difficulty. therefore the downward pressure on the economy cannot be ignored."}
{"original": "still, the latest numbers matched most economists' expectations and suggest the economy is on track to meet the official full-year growth target of 6.5 to 7 percent. growth was the most subdued since a 6.2 percent pace seen in the first quarter of 2009 during the global financial crisis."}

{"original": "resorting to their usual policy tools, chinese officials have cut interest rates repeatedly and lavished money on public works construction to counter the unexpectedly sharp downturn over the past two years."}
{"original": "data from the investment-industry nexus show that the tried and tested stimulus measures of recent months have stirred up the physical part of the economy, especially towards the end of (the first quarter), while consumption remained relatively robust, said louis kuijs of oxford economics."}
{"original": "while such measures slow progress toward the goal of cutting reliance on investment, they reduce the risk of politically dangerous increases in job losses."}

{"original": "when mother's day became a national holiday in the u.s. more than a century ago, women were a relative rarity in the workforce. today's mom, by contrast, is largely a working mom."}
{"original": "in half of american households, women are either the primary breadwinner or contribute more than 40 percent of the income. for most families, the added income from women going to work is the only thing that's kept family income steady, as individual worker wages have stagnated for the better part of four decades."}
{"original": "so while moms nationwide might appreciate the usual bouquet of flowers or other gift to recognize their efforts, for this mother's day we look at public policies that could lift their spirits -- and economic security."}
{"original": "more women than men work in lower-wage jobs -- think health care, retail and administrative work. more than half -- 56 percent -- of minimum-wage workers are women. the sex differences are even starker among tipped workers, two-thirds of whom are women (and many of whom, according to a federal law last updated in 1991, have a baseline pay of only $2.13 an hour.)"}
{"original": "but the effect of raising the minimum wage goes beyond just low-paid workers. raising the wage floor also tends to lift the wages of higher-paid workers because their employers must compete with other companies offering higher pay."}
{"original": "to be sure, there is a tradeoff. research shows that raising the minimum wage can suppress job growth, since making something more expensive (in this case, hiring) leads to people doing less of it. when the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimated the effects of increasing the federal minimum wage to $10.10 a few years ago, it found that 16.5 million workers would see higher earnings, while about half a million who otherwise would have had jobs wouldn't get work."}
{"original": "many states and localities have raised regional minimum wages since that study, and those increases haven't had a discernible effect on employment."}
{"original": "the u.s. is unique among developed countries in not requiring businesses to provide any maternity or paternity leave for workers, paid or otherwise. (the family and medical leave act requires some businesses to provide unpaid leave, but it leaves out about 40 percent of workers.)"}
{"original": "the situation creates what is an untenable choice for millions of working moms, who effectively must choose between being with their children or keeping their job, which they need to help support the household. and a lack of paid leave, combined with increasingly expensive child care, forces many women to stop working."}
{"original": "women's participation [in the labor force] would be 6 percent higher if we had the same policies as other oecd countries, betsey stevenson, a professor of economics and public policy at the university of michigan, told cbs moneywatch earlier this year, alluding to the 35 wealthier nations that make up the organization for economic cooperation and development."}
{"original": "though lower-wage moms (and dads) are disproportionately affected by the absence of paid-parental leave in the u.s., it hurts higher-income women (and dads), too. according to research from former president obama's council of economic advisers, most women who don't take leave report having too much work."}
{"original": "offering paid family leave nationwide would remove the stigma for many workers. and research shows it's good business. paid leave increases the likelihood that workers will return to work after childbirth, improves employee morale, has no or positive effects on workplace productivity, reduces costs to employers through improved employee retention, and improves family incomes, found one study from the institute for women's policy research."}
{"original": "businesses are increasingly setting workers' schedules using software that tracks the flow of customers, diners or patients. while such technology may help companies cut their labor costs, the advent of on-call scheduling often makes it hard for employees to predict their work hours. that's a particular problem for workers with family obligations, leaving parents scrambling to arrange child care to pick up a shift they learned about only days, or sometimes hours, in advance."}
{"original": "every corporate retailer uses some sort of workforce management technology to schedule their workforce, said carrie gleason, director of the fair workweek initiative at the center for popular democracy, a group that advocates for workers, including laws that would require businesses to post schedules at least two weeks in advance and allow workers more input into their hours."}
{"original": "as a result, working families are scrambling for last-minute childcare, and can't set up regular routines because they're working different shifts from one week to the next. workers who turn down last-minute shifts can often find themselves penalized or find their overall hours cut, gleason noted, making it harder for them to advance."}
{"original": "it's hard to point to workers -- male or female -- who wouldn't gain from cheaper and more accessible health care. but women in particular would benefit, because they're disproportionately hurt by the current system."}
{"original": "new research from jpmorgan chase (jpm) shows that health catastrophes, defined as something that requires an extraordinary medical payment, affect 1 in 6 families in the u.s. but the effect of those payments hurts women more than men. women were in a weaker financial position than men to withstand an extraordinary medical payment, the banking giant found. one year after the medical payment, women had nearly 10 percent more debt than men."}
{"original": "with universal health care -- the system of choice for most developed nations -- seemingly off the table it the u.s., other policies could partly address the disproportionate impact of medical emergencies on women by tackling health issues that specifically hurt women. that could include reducing the cost of pregnancy, allowing access to family planning and providing social services for assault victims, to name just three."}

{"original": "wielding control of the house and a new set of investigative powers, democrats are preparing to bring education secretary betsy devos under the sharpest scrutiny she has seen since taking office."}
{"original": "devos has emerged as a common target for democrats as they take charge of the house and its committees, which carry the authority to issue subpoenas and call hearings. at least four panels are expected to challenge devos on her most polarizing policies, among them her overhaul of campus sexual assault rules and her rollback of for-profit college regulations."}
{"original": "we are going to hold secretary devos accountable for, in so many ways, failing to uphold federal protections for our students, said rep. rosa delauro, a connecticut democrat leading an appropriations subcommittee that oversees the education budget. it has to do with hurting student borrowers, protecting predatory for-profit schools and, above all, moving toward privatizing public education."}
{"original": "house democrats are increasing scrutiny of several top federal officials, but few have drawn as much attention as devos. along with the appropriations committee, devos is likely to see pushback from panels that oversee education, veterans' affairs and government oversight."}
{"original": "without control of the senate, democrats will have a tough time forcing devos' hand through legislation, but they can press her through subpoenas, hearings and the budgeting process. in contrast, devos was called before the house's education committee just once over the last two years of republican control."}
{"original": "much of the new scrutiny will come from rep. bobby scott of virginia, the top democrat on the education committee, who said he will call devos to testify as often as necessary."}
{"original": "we have not been getting answers to most of our questions, scott said in an interview, recalling when democrats were in a minority. it's kind of hard to do oversight when they're not answering our questions."}
{"original": "scott is particularly interested in exploring whether the education department is allowing states to skirt federal rules requiring them to address achievement gaps between students of different races."}
{"original": "education department spokeswoman liz hill countered that devos has been responsive to requests for information from congress and will continue to be."}
{"original": "she's ready to work with any member of congress who wants to rethink education and do better for america's students, hill said."}
{"original": "president trump has dismissed democrats' scrutiny of his administration as nothing more than harassment. but scott said he plans to work with republicans on his own initiatives, including a push for federal money to update the nation's aging school buildings."}
{"original": "the majority has certain powers, but hopefully we would have an ongoing dialogue, scott said. some of the hearings become spectacles that really don't add to solving problems."}
{"original": "part of the problem for democrats will be picking their battles. they have opposed devos on nearly all of her major initiatives, including her proposed rules on the handling of campus sexual assaults, her support for arming school staff members and her revocation of federal guidance on school discipline."}
{"original": "but devos' greatest opposition could stem from her rollback of rules targeting for-profit colleges. as mr. trump pursues a broader effort to scale back regulation, she has sought to undo policies that the previous administration crafted to rein in for-profit colleges accused of deceiving students. among them are the now-defunct corinthian colleges and itt technical institute chains."}
{"original": "a federal judge blocked devos from scrapping a policy that makes it easier for defrauded students to get loans erased. but her department has not enforced a separate rule meant to weed out shoddy for-profit colleges. most recently, devos drew criticism in november when she reinstated an industry accrediting group that federal officials shut down in 2016 over lax oversight."}
{"original": "scott has already vowed to dig into devos' decision on the accreditor, and he's joined by several other lawmakers concerned about for-profit college regulation."}
{"original": "rep. mark takano, a california democrat chairing the veterans' affairs committee, plans to hold hearings on the impact of devos' policies on military veterans. takano said looser oversight has allowed predatory schools to recruit veterans and collect their gi bill funding while ultimately leaving them with poor job prospects."}
{"original": "he also aims to investigate how for-profit colleges recruit on military bases."}
{"original": "where secretary devos has been insidiously effective is in undermining rules and undermining protections for students, he said."}
{"original": "rep. elijah cummings of maryland, the top democrat on the house oversight committee, said he, too, will conduct rigorous oversight of the education department and for-profit colleges, and explore whether devos exposed student borrowers to predatory practices and jeopardized their educational goals."}
{"original": "there's also debate among democrats about how closely to examine potential conflicts of interest within the education department. devos has hired several former executives from the for-profit college industry, which some democrats say is ripe for investigation. but scott said he would rather focus on policies than the people behind them."}
{"original": "we've found a lot of confusion between potential bias and conflict of interest, scott said. so long as they have no financial ties now with the industry, it would be hard to find a conflict of interest."}
{"original": "beyond oversight, some house democrats are optimistic they can reach a deal on the higher education act, a sweeping federal law that governs student financial aid and could be revised to address topics like campus sexual assault and student debt forgiveness."}
{"original": "the law has remained unchanged for a decade, but there's new interest in renewing the bill in the senate before the chairman of the education committee, republican sen. lamar alexander, retires after 2020."}
{"original": "democrats also aim to boost money for public schools that serve low-income students and those with disabilities. they're bracing for a fight if devos renews her push to fund vouchers for private schools."}
{"original": "ninety percent of our students are in public schools, and they need more resources to succeed, said rep. delauro, the connecticut democrat on the appropriations committee. we should not be siphoning off taxpayer dollars, which are in demand, to pay for vouchers."}
{"original": "the internal revenue service wasn't just letting calls go unanswered last tax season, the agency was also auditing fewer tax returns: 22 percent less than five years earlier."}
{"original": "that's according to the center on budget and policy priorities, a left-leaning think tank that analyzes the impact of federal and state government policies."}
{"original": "because of budget cuts that irs commissioner john koskinen has blasted as penny wise but pound foolish, the government's tax-collection arm no longer has the manpower to conduct as many audits of high-income taxpayers and businesses as in years past, the center found."}
{"original": "in 2010, the irs audited 1.2 million taxpayers, or 1.1 percent of individual returns, a count that declined by more than 350,000, or 0.8 percent in 2015, the lowest level in a decade, the center said in an update published earlier this month. given the agency's funding level is $900 million lower in fiscal 2016 versus five years earlier, there's little reason to believe the trend won't continue."}
{"original": "and while some tax payers may breath easier knowing the odds of having the tax collector at their door has lessened, others might be annoyed that the reduced enforcement means some are getting away with cheating uncle sam."}
{"original": "audits recovered about $30 billion, or 30 percent, less in the past five years than in the prior five years, the center said, while citing treasury estimates that every additional $1 invested in irs tax enforcement yields $4 in increased revenue. or, as irs commissioner john koskinen summarized, essentially, the government is losing billions to achieve budget savings of a few hundred million dollars."}
{"original": "the agency has been operating in an extremely difficult budget environment for several years, koskinen said in written testimony submitted thursday to a house panel."}
{"original": "the irs is not collecting about $6 billion a year in money owed, due to the agency's staffing shortages, the commissioner said in a march 24 speech to the national press club:"}
{"original": "these staffing losses have translated into a steady decline in the number of individual audits over the past six years. last year, in fact, we completed the fewest audits in a decade. plus, our audit coverage rate in 2015 was the lowest since 2004. that trend line of fewer audits will continue this year."}

{"original": "the knoxville news sentinel reported that tennessee plans to remove and replace lindsay x-lite guardrail ends around the state."}
{"original": "since june 2016 in tennessee, four people have died in three crashes in which the vehicles hit the ends of guardrails that included that model, according to the newspaper. one of the people killed was a teenage girl whose family was mistakenly billed $3,000 for the guardrail earlier this year."}
{"original": "at the time, her father told cbs knoxville affiliate wvlt-tv the state knew this was dangerous and that it wasn't performing well. they should have removed it, but their policy was to leave it on the road, playing russian roulette with people's lives."}

{"original": "doughty said the x-lite worked the way it was supposed to in the accident that killed the teenage girl in november 2016, but it impaled her car because of the angle of the crash."}
{"original": "guardrail ends are generally designed to telescope or slide into each other when struck, absorbing some of the impact of a crash and preventing the metal end from penetrating the vehicle."}
{"original": "however, the state department of transportation found the x-lite guardrail end didn't always work that way when hit at speeds higher than about 62 mph. tennessee officials have begun accepting bids for contractors to remove and replace most of the 1,700 or more x-lite ends on roads where speed limits exceed 45 mph."}
{"original": "the department made its concerns known to federal officials in an april 4 letter that also discussed its intention to replace the pieces."}

{"original": "the part's manufacturer, lindsay corp., told the newspaper the x-lite model has passed crash and safety tests and remains approved for use by the federal highway administration."}
{"original": "it is widely recognized that there are impact conditions that exceed the performance expectations of all safety equipment, and equipment's inability to singly prevent every tragedy does not indicate a flaw or defect, scott marion, president of the company's infrastructure division, said in a statement. while federal crash testing is intended to assess a variety of conditions, no test can replicate every possible scenario and factors, including severity of an impact, type and size of a vehicle, the installation and maintenance of the product, the angle at which a vehicle makes impact, vehicle speed, highway design, and many more."}
{"original": "doughty, of tennessee's transportation department, said, if you hit anything going 70 plus mph, it is probably going to be a devastating type crash. ... these devices are not a pillow for you to hit to gently stop your car."}
{"original": "state officials in virginia and missouri told the news sentinel the model of guardrail end was involved in crashes that killed three people, but those officials didn't make clear if the parts performed as designed in those cases."}

{"original": "green card holders may be subject to additional screening but can continue traveling between the u.s. and their home countries freely, as long as no derogatory information is uncovered in the screening process."}
{"original": "customs and border patrol agents process roughly 325,000 visitors to the u.s. each day. in the 24-hour period after order took effect, 109 prospective entrants were detained under the provisions of the executive order, but all were eventually allowed into the u.s. after extra screening (and rulings from federal judges). some 170 legal permanent residents were allowed into the u.s. after applying for and receiving entry waivers."}
{"original": "according to u.s. officials, at least 348 people were told by their airlines that they were not allowed to board their flights to the u.s. as a result of the executive order. officials told cbs news that there were also 394 legal permanent residents, or green card holders, who arrived at airports. of that group, 392 people were admitted to the u.s. for the two that were denied entry, one walked back across the canadian border and the other was arrested on an outstanding criminal charge."}
{"original": "after the executive order was issued, over the weekend, the pentagon was given the opportunity by the white house to provide a list of names of iraqi translators, drivers and others who had supported american forces past and present, according to pentagon spokesman capt. jeff davis. he would not say, however, whether defense secretary james mattis was aware of the contents of the executive irder before it was released and would not say whether the pentagon had initiated the request to provide the list of iraqis."}
{"original": "sen. john mccain, r-arizona, had raised the issue of iraqi pilots training in arizona and davis said the pentagon is looking into that but thought they were in the u.s. on a special type of visa."}
{"original": "as for non u.s. citizens serving in the military, davis said that there are roughly 18,700 green card holders serving in the u.s. military, but only a small fraction of them are from the seven countries affected by the ban."}
{"original": "on saturday night, a federal judge issued an emergency order temporarily barring the u.s. from deporting people from nations subject to mr. trump's travel ban, saying travelers who had been detained had a strong argument that their legal rights had been violated. the white house argued the judges' decision applied only to the people detained saturday at u.s. airports."}
{"original": "the white house claims that issuing waivers for legal permanent residents was always how its program was intended to work. the senior administration official complained that the media and protesters are overreacting to a very small percentage of entrants impacted by the new policy."}
{"original": "[e]very false, misleading, inaccurate, hyperventilating, confused, misguided or other kind of report, again covers a fractional, miniscule percentage of travelers to our airports on any given day, the official said to reporters on the call, dismissing the detention of the travelers at airports across the country over the weekend as an extremely minimal disruption."}
{"original": "the president's order bans visitors from seven majority-muslim countries: iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen. these countries were also named by the obama administration as potential sources of terrorism."}
{"original": "according to the senior trump administration official, the executive order was drafted by immigration staffers on capitol hill during the transition and refined over the last several weeks."}
{"original": "before the order was signed friday by the president, the senior administration official said the justice department's office of legal council signed off on the executive order. and it also underwent review by the national security council, homeland security council. senior staff at dhs were also briefed."}
{"original": "the white house stressed the u.s. is under no obligation to admit foreign nationals from any country and called previous screening procedures woefully inadequate."}
{"original": "removal from the banned list will -- according to the official -- depend on the ability of countries to comply with the trump administration's requests for information. within 30 days, the administration will lay out what we expect countries who participate in our immigration programs be able to provide about their nationals, the official said."}
{"original": "after that, countries will be have 60 days to comply with the updated requirements."}

{"original": "income inequality is creating what charity oxfam international calls a deeply shocking trend: billionaires are not only growing wealthier and adding to their ranks, but the poorest half of the world is losing wealth at a time when the world's economy is expanding."}
{"original": "the economic climate is accruing outsized gains to billionaires, whose fortunes rose by 12 percent last year, while the poorest half of humanity — 3.8 billion people — saw their wealth decline by 11 percent, oxfam found. its report will be released at the world economic forum in davos, switzerland, which begins tuesday and draws billionaires like microsoft co-founder bill gates, policymakers and corporate leaders."}
{"original": "with the benefits of the economic expansion shifting to the world's richest people, billionaires are adding $2.5 billion in wealth each day. and every two days, a millionaire jumps into the ranks of the billionaire class, oxfam said."}
{"original": "oxfam, which has been studying the dynamics of wealth inequality since 2011, said the latest findings suggest that a new economic approach is needed to help recenter the wealth distribution. many policy makers and economists have believed that economic growth will lift all boats, but that isn't playing out for billions of people across the globe. one reason: tax rates have dropped to recent historic lows, allowing the rich and corporations to hold on to more wealth, said paul o'brien, vice president for policy and advocacy at oxfam america."}
{"original": "the economic figures are going in the wrong direction. this isn't just another year of the same old reality -- it's getting worse in terms of the accumulation of extreme wealth, o'brien said. it's deeply shocking to us."}
{"original": "the top-heavy distribution of wealth has coincided with a drastic reduction in tax rates for the world's richest, oxfam said. it found that the top rate for the rich in developed countries plunged from 62 percent in 1970 to 38 percent in 2013. in 2017, president trump reduced tax rates for individuals and corporations, a decrease that favors the rich and businesses."}
{"original": "the leadership we've had has put in place the policies that widen the inequality gap, o'brien said. what we are calling for is leadership and policies that slow the gap."}
{"original": "to be sure, conservative policy makers believe that lowering tax rates on the rich and businesses will spur growth, eventually providing more jobs and higher wages to middle- and lower-income workers. yet there's little economic evidence that such policies deliver on their promises."}
{"original": "instead of an economy that stresses growth at any cost, oxfam is pressing for what it calls a human economy."}
{"original": "fundamentally the human economy is built from different principals than the growth economy, o'brien said. for years, the consensus was, 'growth solves everything.' but that has fallen apart. our planet has limited boundaries. we can't burn more, use more, and break through ecological boundaries that are essential for sustaining human life."}
{"original": "the human economy would provide health care, education and gender equality to people across the globe, he said. all the data show that educating your children is the best way to build a healthy economy and create genuine shared wealth. we need to get kids into quality schools, and get rid of these legal and cultural barriers to women being treated unfairly in the workplace, being burdened and discounted."}
{"original": "raising taxes on the world's richest people and corporations would help fund those programs, with oxfam calculating that boosting taxes on the richest by 0.5 percent would raise enough money to educate the 262 million children who currently don't receive an education and provide healthcare that would save 3.3 million people from preventable deaths."}
{"original": "whether the rich should pay higher taxes entered the political discourse this month after freshman congresswoman alexandria ocasio-cortez said the u.s. should raise taxes on the rich to their highest level since 1980, just before ronald reagan started hacking rates."}
{"original": "the top tax on the wealthy should rise to as high as 70 percent, ocasio-cortez told 60 minutes earlier this month. that approach stands in stark contrast to mr. trump's 2017 tax cuts and jobs act."}
{"original": "yet higher marginal rates on the richest americans would mark a return to the more progressive tax structure of the 1950s and 1960s — under presidents harry s. truman, dwight d. eisenhower and john f. kennedy, for instance, the rate on those in the top bracket topped 90 percent."}
{"original": "we totally agree with the congresswoman, oxfam's o'brien said. we think higher taxes for the extremely wealthy have to be a fundamental element of a healthy economy."}
{"original": "a patio heater that cost $150 on amazon back in late 2019 had soared to $699 a year later, one of hundreds of products the online marketplaces sells whose price surged during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a consumer advocacy group."}
{"original": "in an analysis of 750 products sold on the platform, u.s. pirg education fund found that 409 items saw prices jump more than 20% in 2020, while 136 at least doubled in price."}
{"original": "the spikes largely involved items viewed as necessities during the public health crisis, including surgical gloves, eye goggles, toilet paper and cough syrup. across 15 product categories examined by u.s. pirg, the highest price increases ranged from $13.10 to $4,000, with patio heaters showing among the 10 largest price jumps."}
{"original": "in the past year, 61% of patio heaters sold on amazon increased in price by at least 20%, and 45% at least doubled. the highest jump was $549, from $150 to $699. other products that saw similar spikes include oral thermometers, disinfection wipes and hand sanitizers. (see u.s. pirg chart below.)"}
{"original": "our research throughout the pandemic has revealed massive price spikes on amazon listings, u.s. pirg stated."}
{"original": "it's not meant to imply that this is true in all cases — only to reinforce the point that these price hikes can't always be blamed on heightened demand, grace brombach, a consumer watchdog associate and author of the study, told cbs moneywatch last week."}
{"original": "we believe amazon has the technology and resources to combat this, brombach said of the company, which reported record sales of $96 billion in the third quarter of 2020, a period that saw its profits tripling to $6.3 billion from a year earlier."}
{"original": "amazon acknowledges that the pandemic has boosted demand — and plumped up its profits — as millions of americans stepped up their shopping online. but the company said it has both the automated and the manual means in place to ensure prices are fair to consumers."}
{"original": "our systems are designed to meet the best available price amongst our competitors, an amazon spokesperson told cbs moneywatch in an email. sellers set their own product prices in our store. we have a long-standing policy against price-gouging, have processes in place to proactively block suspicious offers and monitor our store 24/7 for violations."}
{"original": "amazon blocked or removed more than 39 million offers and suspended more than 13,000 accounts for attempted price gouging last year and referred the most egregious offenders to federal and state law enforcement, according to the spokesperson."}
{"original": "amazon has worked with more than 40 state attorneys general to prosecute bad actors, and the company supports the idea of creating a federal price-gouging standard, he added."}
{"original": "retail analyst neil saunders, managing director at globaldata, faulted u.s. pirg for focusing exclusively on amazon in its latest report and not looking more deeply at pricing changes on other big venues for third-party sellers like ebay and walmart. you have to look across the whole industry to be fair, he said."}
{"original": "its report released last week built on earlier findings released in september that found escalating costs on amazon while prices on the same product from walmart, target and others remain(ed) largely unchanged, the group stated, acknowledging it had not looked at other retailers in its most recent analysis."}
{"original": "the price of essentials like toilet paper and hand sanitizer did go up, partly due to companies dispensing with offers and deals to discourage volume buying amid product shortages, saunders explained. prices are often determined by supply, demand and underlying cost factors, he said."}
{"original": "saunders points out that no one is forced to buy anything, a sentiment echoed by u.s. pirg's brombach, who said: our biggest advice to consumers is to shop around."}
{"original": "julián castro spoke with face the nation moderator margaret brennan from san antonio, texas, for the jan. 13, 2019 broadcast."}
{"original": "read more interviews of 2020 candidates on face the nation here."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: with dozens of democrats considering a 2020 presidential bid on saturday the former mayor of san antonio, julián castro, became the latest candidate. castro gained national attention when he delivered the keynote address at the 2012 democratic convention and he was also secretary of housing and urban development during the obama administration. the grandson of a mexican immigrant, julian castro has already been endorsed by a democratic member of congress, his twin brother, joaquin. and julian castro joins us from the site of his announcement. welcome to face the nation."}
{"original": "julián castro: thanks a lot. great to be with you, margaret."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: the president visited your home state of texas this week, went to the border, said there is a humanitarian and national security crisis. do you agree with him that there is a crisis at the border?"}
{"original": "castro: what i believe is that he's created a tragedy at the border. this policy of separating children from their parents and the terrible way that customs and border protection has managed its responsibilities, including the deaths of two children within the last few weeks. that's a real tragedy. and, you know, the folks down on the border know - and many of them have said - in fact, i just saw one border resident the other day on camera that said that a wall is not the answer. that we can have strong border security with personnel, with technology, but that the wall is not the answer. so the president may have his rhetoric but everybody else has the facts right that a wall isn't the answer."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: well that family separation policy has been paused at least. but there are a record number of family units crossing the border and that creates a lot of challenges. so what would you do? would you extend the amount of time that families can be held together in detention?"}
{"original": "castro: i don't believe that we should have family detention for people that are seeking asylum or refugee status, so that we should develop other ways to ensure that people are processed, that we're able to keep track of them in the country. and we- we have developed some ways to do that but that we don't detain them the way that we have been. so no, i don't agree with that. the other thing i'll say margaret, and this is very important is, i hope that folks remember that the president said that he wanted to do this family separation policy because it would deter more families coming from these countries. and actually the exact opposite happened. and so he's failed. he's a failed leader on this issue and now he's just trying to stoke his political base by bringing up the wall all the time. and it's just a failure of leadership all around. i would end this kind of family detention. i would make sure that we invest in sensible, smart and effective border security that includes personnel, that includes the smart use of technology, and that does not scapegoat these immigrants but tries to look for a way that we can get to comprehensive immigration reform to fix our broken immigration system."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: you've been calling immigration system broken for some time and you were critical even under the obama administration, specifically about their high level of deportations. so what do you offer as an alternative if you're not going to detain and you're not going to deport what do you do with illegal immigrants?"}
{"original": "castro: well, what i believe we could do and what the obama administration did do i believe toward the end of its tenure was to look at things like ankle monitors so that you're able to monitor where people are in the country and ensure that they report back when they need to and that they are part of, you know, legal proceedings. but we also need to be serious about recognizing the right of people to seek asylum. and the president is playing games with this, blocking people's right to seek asylum. i would change that. i would make sure that we push as hard as possible for comprehensive immigration reform so that for the people who are already here, if they've been law abiding, if they pay a fine, that- that they can get an earned path to citizenship. i still believe that that should be part of the answer."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: you announced your candidacy today and almost immediately the rnc issued a statement. i want to read it here to you. it says, julián castro has made history by becoming one of the biggest lightweights to ever run for president. he was a weak mayor who couldn't even handle being hud secretary. this is obviously just another desperate attempt to become someone else's running mate. these are sharp words, but it's the first official attack on you. how do you respond and- and how do you explain why you are qualified to be commander in chief?"}
{"original": "castro: well first of all, i think they could just dust off those same words, you know they're going to use those kinds of words for every single democrat that decides to run for president. i wouldn't put too much stock in that. i would just say to the american people directly, i've had executive experience. i've led one of the largest, most diverse cities in the country. i've led a federal agency at hud and- and done some great work to expand opportunity. i know what it takes to ensure that we have a government that functions well and to help inspire people. i also have a life experience that i think resonates with a lot of americans. you know i'm here in my neighborhood that i grew up in. grew up in a single parent household, went to the public schools here in san antonio. was able to go to college and law school and to reach my american dream. and i am motivated to make sure that every american can reach their dreams. and then, i have a strong vision for the country's future. i want to make sure that in this century, this 21st century, that we are the smartest, the healthiest, the fairest and the most prosperous nation on earth."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: you're going to have a- a lot of competition for the democratic nomination. it looks to be a very crowded field. how are you going to distinguish yourself?"}
{"original": "castro: i'm going to articulate a very strong positive vision for the country's future. i'm going to get out there and work hard. i'm gonna make sure that i let people know what i've actually accomplished in the executive experience that i have. and i think that right now people are looking for a leader that can show they can get things done. being a mayor is all about getting things done. and when i was cabinet secretary i got things done. they want government that functions well now and somebody that's trying to bring people together instead of tear them apart. so i'm going to go out there and make my case. and you know i'm under no illusion right now that- that i'm in the poll position or anything. i'm not a front runner but nobody who grew up here in these neighborhoods, including myself, has ever been a front runner. and i think in this country right now, that there are a lot of people who don't feel like front runners. and i'm going to go speak to them in this campaign."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: well some of the things you outlined as part of your platform today, medicare for all, universal access to prekindergarten education, a green new deal, these put you in the more liberal or progressive wing of the democratic party. so one of the challenges for you is how do you attract centrists or people who perhaps were alienated by the president but aren't comfortable with being so reliant on the government as their main provider?"}
{"original": "castro: what i hear out there is that there are a lot of folks, a lot of people, who want us to invest in universal health care. there are a lot of people- even people that call themselves centrists that think of themselves as- as not necessarily- you know they wouldn't call themselves liberal. but a lot of people are ready for universal health care. i mean look at the polls. when- when it's polled you know it gets over 60, 70 percent of support--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: medicare for all you mean."}
{"original": "castro: and so i think- that's right. and i believe that this country is ready for that. now you bring up the issue or one- one issue people bring up is ok well you know- of course, you know we're going to put forward a plan. and i'm sure people have other- have their own plans of how we would accomplish that. and i'm under no illusion that accomplishing something like medicare for all would be easy. but i do believe that in this nation, in the richest nation on earth, that not a single person should be without health care when they need it. and so i believe it is worth it, that that fight is worth it. and whether people call themselves liberal or centrists or conservative, what they want right now is they want to know that- that you're coming at them straight and that you're being honest with them. and i'm going to be honest with folks."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: so what is that going to cost taxpayers? because bernie sanders, when he ran in the last campaign, had a universal health care call and estimates showed it costing one point four trillion dollars a year. you gotta make some real changes there to be able to pay for it."}
{"original": "castro: no, you do. there's no question that it's going to take several things. i think it's going to take asking wealthier individuals to pay their fair share--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: what does that mean?"}
{"original": "castro: --we've had basically the- the last 40 years. well, i mean i think we've had the last 40 years essentially of- of lower and lower commitment on people at the very top. same thing goes for corporations. we have corporations - multinational corporations - that are hardly paying anything in federal taxes."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: you want to increase the corporate tax rate?"}
{"original": "castro: --we need to ask them to pay their fair share. i think that we can consider different ways, different proposals, to be able to raise more revenue from the wealthiest corporations. i also think it's interesting, margaret, you know, that i'm here in a neighborhood that was built up like a not- a lot of neighborhoods by small businesses. little convenience stores, little restaurants, little dry cleaners. and at the same time, that a company like amazon, that is one of the biggest companies in the world, can get huge tax- tax breaks, huge abatements, and also only begrudgingly end up paying their- their employees 15 dollars an hour."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: well how would you- how would you ask--"}
{"original": "castro: we need to change that in this country."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: how would you ask those same people to pay for the green new deal you're calling for? are you going to put a tax on gases and fossil fuels? how are you going to pay for that?"}
{"original": "castro: yeah, so i look forward during the course of- of this campaign to putting forward proposals on each of these things. and- and i think that- that a vast majority of the american people are ready for that."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: all right. we will be tracking you and your campaign and more details as you promise them there. thank you so much for joining us."}
{"original": "with nearly 40 million americans filing their taxes this week, many are likely wondering: how much does the government need my money, anyway?"}
{"original": "the federal government took in $3.3 trillion in tax revenue last year. more than 80 percent -- $2.7 trillion -- came from individuals through either income tax or payroll taxes that fund social security and medicare."}
{"original": "corporate taxes kick in just 9 percent of the government's revenue. after the recent tax cuts, the share from corporate america will go down even more. the office of management and budget projects corporate income taxes will drop to just 5 percent of government revenue in five years."}
{"original": "estate taxes make up even less. last year, less than 1 percent of the government's funding came from taxes on large inheritances (or, as the irs calls it, taxes on your right to transfer property at your death). now that the tax cut and jobs act has made more estates exempt, that tax will also be even less of a money-raiser."}
{"original": "more than three-quarters of the federal government's income last year came from individuals. the largest single source was the federal income tax; the second-largest was the payroll tax. business taxes, excise taxes and estate and gift taxes made up the rest."}
{"original": "individual income tax affects only half of individuals"}
{"original": "a relatively small population makes up the country's tax base: more than half of government revenue comes from just the top 5 percent of income earners."}
{"original": "some 76 million americans have no federal income tax liability, according to the tax policy center. that means they either earn too little to pay income tax or qualify for tax credits that cancel out their income tax payments."}
{"original": "the bottom half of earners together contributes just 3 percent of the total income tax revenue, according to a tax foundation analysis."}
{"original": "in economic terms, this is a progressive tax: higher earners are taxed proportionately more. many other taxes, like sales taxes, are regressive, meaning they cost poorer people more as a percentage of their income. sales taxes are imposed by states, but the federal government has a version called excise taxes, which it levies on alcohol, cigarettes and gasoline. excise taxes have fallen in importance in recent years, and today make up just 3 percent of government revenue."}
{"original": "with $3.3 trillion moving from individuals into the treasury last year, it may surprise taxpayers to hear that the irs, by its own estimates, isn't collecting all the tax it can. the agency calculated the so-called tax gap two years ago, and it found that it collects about 82 percent of the tax that is actually owed. americans who fail to file taxes, don't report income to the government or report less than they earned cost uncle sam $406 billion in 2010, the most recent year for which detailed analysis is available."}
{"original": "global stock markets were falling fast after the federal reserve cut its benchmark interest rate to near zero sunday evening to help blunt the economic damage from the fast-spreading novel coronavirus. fed chairman jerome powell called the actions strong measures but the emergency rate cut — the second in two weeks and an unusually large one-percentage-point cut, at that — seemed to unnerve investors."}
{"original": "stock-market futures indicated the dow jones industrial average and the s&p 500 would be sharply lower when stocks begin trading in the u.s. on monday morning. those futures began dropping almost immediately after the fed announced the rate cut on sunday. the central bank also said it was upping what's known as purchases of treasuries and other bonds by $700 billion, a policy known as quantitative easing, to encourage lending by financial institutions."}
{"original": "the fed's latest move does not change our expectation that the economy will slow dramatically in the near term, rubeela farooqi, chief u.s. economist with high frequency economics, told investors in a report after the fed's rate cut."}
{"original": "stocks cratered in europe, with shares in paris plummeting 9%, spain 8.7%, frankfurt 7.8 percent and london and milan 7.6%, according to agence france-presse."}
{"original": "on asian markets, shares in hong kong were down more than 4%, china's mainland shanghai exchange index lost 3.4% and japan's nikkei index was 2.5 lower in tokyo, despite moves by the central bank there to prop up the economy, afp said."}
{"original": "stocks in australia nosedived 9.7%, indicating investors there are concerned the coronavirus will continue to slow economic activity in china as well as throughout the region."}
{"original": "some wall street economists were optimistic that the fed's emergency moves could save the economy from sinking into a prolonged recession, and even spur a market rebound later this year."}
{"original": "broad fiscal spending and rate cuts are blunt instruments for dealing with the short-term economic impact of the virus, but should provide investors with some confidence that growth can be strong once the recovery gets underway, mark haefele, a chief investment officer at ubs's wealth management division, said. we expect the market to end the year at much higher levels than today."}
{"original": "but that optimism was not widely shared. bank of america's top u.s. economist, michelle meyer, predicted sunday that the fed's moves would be not be enough to arrest an economic slide driven by restrictions on public activity."}
{"original": "businesses are shutting doors globally and households are moving into quarantine, meyer wrote in a note to clients on sunday night. we are already forecasting negative gdp growth in the second quarter but the risk is that it proves to be a much deeper and more prolonged contraction in economic activity."}
{"original": "miami -- miami fraternal order of police president lt. javier ortiz has been reassigned, removed from the street and placed on desk duty without his gun, cbs miami reports."}
{"original": "the disciplinary action stems from a video shot by civilian claudia castillo, in which she captured her pursuit of miami-dade police officer daniel fonticiella. when she finally stopped him, she gave him a classic police lecture. thousands of people viewed the video."}
{"original": "ortiz apparently didn't agree with her social media shaming of fonticiella. ortiz posted her personal information on his social media accounts. he also posted several photos of castillo, including a few of her driving a boat with a beer in hand. one of the pictures included the caption, nobody is above the law except me when i'm driving."}
{"original": "ortiz's action prompted internal affairs to investigate. after 10 months, they found he violated the rules, but only reprimanded him."}
{"original": "on tuesday, march 21, miami's civilian investigative panel (cip), which looks into police complaints, found ortiz guilty."}
{"original": "lt. javier ortiz has been relieved of duty and administratively been reassigned with pay pending a court date of a restraining order signed by a judge, police said."}
{"original": "the cip reprimanded ortiz and said he'd broken department policy by posting her personal information, but that was the most they could do."}
{"original": "both ortiz and castillo were at the cip hearing at which ortiz was disciplined. documents later filed in court reveal that she feared for her safety after testifying."}
{"original": "on march 21st, 2017, i was at the civilian investigative panel hearing where javi ortiz was found guilty of harassment, discourtesy and improper procedure toward me, castillo wrote the court. javi was obviously angered by the decision, and when i attempted to leave city hall, he followed me toward the parking lot. javi was visibly upset and was stopped by several individuals including police officers who were present. i had to be escorted to my car because i was in fear for my safety."}
{"original": "ortiz posted castillo's personal information after she confronted a police officer who was speeding cbs miami"}
{"original": "the next day, castillo filed for an emergency restraining order against the union chief."}
{"original": "he is a lunatic with a gun and badge. and i fear for my safety. and i don't have a gun or a badge. i don't have anything to protect myself with. and the people who are supposed to be protecting me are on his team, she said."}
{"original": "speaking to cbs miami by phone friday night, castillo explained she had no choice but to get the restraining order."}
{"original": "this scared the crap out of her. it was obviously harassment. he was intimidating her, said danny suarez, a candidate for the miami commission."}
{"original": "suarez, who used to sit on the civilian investigative panel, says he escorted castillo out. he claims ortiz was doing everything he could to mess with her."}
{"original": "he is an evil man. he will attack you left and right. this is a guy who tried to boycott beyoncé for god's sake, he said."}
{"original": "today is just another attack on him because he's a strong leader for his men, said robert buschel, ortiz's attorney."}
{"original": "in fact, buschel alleges this may not be about castillo at all."}
{"original": "cbs miami obtained a 2012 miami police department incident report which describes a confrontation between an intoxicated suarez and ortiz outside a club. the officer wrote that suarez shouted profanities at ortiz and said i'm going to get you fired."}
{"original": "we are going to investigate that. it certainly is a lead we are going to follow up on. and that report explains a lot, he said."}
{"original": "suarez says he had no recollection of that conversation and that the report is a fabrication."}
{"original": "castillo maintains suarez had nothing to do with her restraining order."}

{"original": "epa spokesman jahan wilcox denied carper's allegations last week. samantha dravis has been a senior leader at the epa and has performed her duties faithfully for her entire tenure, wilcox told cbs news' arden farhi. he continued, it is completely baseless and absurd to assert that someone with her responsibilities and office would have been away from her duties and responsibilities for months at a time, as alleged."}
{"original": "but in a response to carper released monday night, arthur elkins, the epa's inspector general, said that his office had decided to conduct the requested review. elkins added that while his office lacks what it considers adequate funding for its various assignments, we have determined that the issues raised are within the authority for his office to look into."}
{"original": "late monday, dravis released a statement denying the allegations. senator carper should be ashamed that he is responsible for the government resources that will be wasted investigating his baseless and categorically false accusations, she wrote. i am confident that i have worked more hours and accomplished more in one month at epa than senator carper has accomplished during his year-long letter-writing campaign against members of this administration. i have never been absent from work for weeks at a time, nor have i neglected my duties during the time period in question."}
{"original": "dravis added that calendar records and timesheets from the period in question will show that she worked full time. agency sources said those documents would likely be made public later this week."}
{"original": "the senate has a constitutional duty to conduct oversight of any administration, especially when presented with credible information from sources within an agency and amid numerous ethical failings on the part of its leadership, a spokesperson for carper said in a statement to cbs news on tuesday. senator carper will continue to conduct appropriate oversight and looks forward to the outcome of the ig's investigation."}

{"original": "a german shepherd is finally back home with his family friday morning after united airlines mistakenly sent him halfway across the world. irgo was supposed to land in kansas city with his owners on tuesday, but united flew him to japan instead."}
{"original": "that mistake came after an incident earlier this week when a dog died mid-flight after a flight attendant insisted it go in an overhead bin. it's been a costly week for united airlines, but not just in terms of public relations. united flew irgo back to the u.s. on a private plane, the average cost for a flight that is more than $90,000, reports cbs news' vladimir duthiers."}
{"original": "despite the mix-up, the swindle family was all smiles as they reunited with their dog at the wichita airport thursday night."}

{"original": "i walked over to the kennel and i called his name. and up popped this great dane instead of my german shepherd. and it was just instant tears because this wasn't my dog and i had no idea where my dog was, swindle recalled. it has been the absolute worst nightmare. we already have so much going on and then to throw this into it. i don't know how much more i can take."}
{"original": "united transported more than 130,000 animals last year. eighteen of those died and 13 were injured, a much higher rate than any other airline. united has apologized for the mistake but swindle says it's not enough."}

{"original": "united airlines is still investigating how the mix-up happened and have not released any new information. they say the dogs were switched during their connection in denver. swindle says that if they travel with irgo again it will be on a boat, not a plane."}
{"original": "atlanta -- cities all over america are competing to host a new amazon headquarters and the jobs that go with it. on thursday, amazon whittled down the choices from 238 to 20."}
{"original": "finding a home for amazon's second headquarters -- the company calls it hq2 -- became corporate catnip to a frenzy of suitors coast to coast. american communities courted the company with gifts of land and tax incentives worth billions. stonecrest, georgia, proposed 345 free acres and even offered to change its name."}
{"original": "deliberations were secret, but amazon had a type in mind -- a metropolitan area of more than 1 million people that's a hub for top tech talent."}
{"original": "atlanta touted its airport, highways and business climate. the city made amazon's final cut."}
{"original": "the number of jobs and just how positively it could change the landscape of the city. it is a big deal, said atlanta mayor keisha lance bottoms."}
{"original": "these 20 names on amazon's new dance card fell heavily in the midwest, southeast and northeast. here's why: amazon, the world's largest internet retailer, proposes spending $5 billion to build hq2, and create up to 50,000 jobs that average $100,000."}
{"original": "i would hope that cities don't enter into a bidding war, said amy liu, an urban policy expert at the brookings institute."}
{"original": "liu warns suitors that overspending is only one potential pitfall. seattle, home of amazon's world headquarters, has seen a surge in housing costs and traffic congestion."}
{"original": "it will stress the housing market, it will stress the wages in the community, including really leaving some parts of the community behind, liu said."}

{"original": "the senate will vote tuesday afternoon on whether to block a treasury department proposal that would lift sanctions on three russian companies, including rusal, the world's second-largest aluminum producer."}
{"original": "the companies are all owned by russian oligarch oleg deripaska, who became the subject of u.s. sanctions last spring. but the punitive financial measures, triggered by what the trump administration called russia's malign activities, had an almost immediate impact on the global aluminum market. prices of the commodity surged, european allies warned of job losses, and american manufacturers complained about cost increases."}
{"original": "in response, the treasury department worked out a deal to remove three of deripaksa's companies — rusal, en+ and eurosibenergo — from the blacklist if he agreed to reduce his ownership stake to less than 50 percent."}
{"original": "senate minority leader chuck schumer, however, says the deal isn't good enough, calling it weak and deeply suspect. he's leading the charge to bring the issue to a vote."}
{"original": "the senate must consider that deripaska has deep ties to president putin and his intelligence apparatus, organized crime and mr. paul manafort, a subject of the special counsel's investigation, he said on the senate floor tuesday."}
{"original": "under the law, the house and senate have 30 days to consider the sanctions measure and try to block it. friday is the deadline. schumer is hoping he can convince enough republicans to join him and scuttle the deal."}
{"original": "i believe my senate colleagues will see the wisdom of keeping the current sanctions in place, he said."}
{"original": "but many of america's closest allies disagree. in november, eight european ambassadors sent a letter to schumer in support of de-listing rusal and the other companies. the sanctions, they wrote, had destabilized the european aluminum market and put at risk an estimated 75,000 jobs."}
{"original": "it is crucial that the sanctions avoid unintended consequences for european companies, they wrote. the delisting will help preserve existing supply chains which would otherwise likely be rerouted to china, further strengthening its global market position in the industry."}
{"original": "tuesday, the irish ambassador to the us daniel mulhall wrote an article warning that the sanctions could have negative, far-reaching foreign policy consequences for united states."}
{"original": "the wider ramifications of these sanctions for the european economy would, in my opinion, also be very damaging to transatlantic relations at this critical time when europeans and americans need to stand together in the face of rising threats to their shared values and interests, he wrote."}
{"original": "among the flurry of executive actions that president joe biden signed in his first day in office is a requirement that people wear masks inside federal buildings, while americans are being urged to wear facial coverings for 100 days. the idea is to contain the coronavirus and save lives, but there could be a secondary benefit: a boost to the economy."}
{"original": "a national mask mandate could add $1 trillion to the nation's gdp, according to a recent ucla study. that's because the spread of infections could be reduced to zero if used universally and in combination with other public health measures such as contact tracing, the authors found. other research from researchers at washington university in st. louis found that communities where mask wearing was mandated benefited from a 5% boost in consumer spending as people felt safer to shop."}
{"original": "but the question is whether mr. biden's mask order goes far enough to make a measurable impact. the mandate doesn't require all americans wear masks in public; rather, it applies only to federal buildings on federal lands and to federal employees and contractors. meanwhile, the nation has a hodge-podge of mask regulations, with 37 states requiring people to wear masks while in public, according to the aarp."}
{"original": "i am skeptical about whether this action covers enough workers to have a noticeable effect on the economy, said raphael thomadsen, professor of marketing at washington university in st. louis and a co-author of the study on consumer spending and masks, told cbs moneywatch about mr. biden's mask mandate. that said, any small effect is likely to be slightly positive."}
{"original": "but, he added, if more people start wearing masks because of mr. biden's order as well as heed his message that facial covering can help halt the pandemic, the impact could be more widespread — providing greater support for both public health and the economy."}
{"original": "bottom line: mask mandates are good for the economy and boost spending quite a bit, thomadsen said. they are only a small piece in managing this pandemic and economic recovery, but given the cheapness of the approach, and the significant positive benefits on spread and spending, they are a no-brainer as far as policy is involved."}
{"original": "president biden's call for 100 days of mask wearing is a smart and practical approach, and one that we are proud to join. - read the full statement from our president @suzanneuscc here: https://t.co/rropmu4rvs — u.s. chamber (@uschamber) january 20, 2021"}
{"original": "the u.s. chamber of commerce, a leading business organization, said it supported mr. biden's mask mandate and the campaign for americans to cover up for 100 days."}
{"original": "with 400,000 american lives now tragically lost, we must join together to fight the pandemic through multiple fronts: masks, social distancing and the vaccine, said suzanne p. clark, president of the u.s. chamber of commerce, in a statement."}
{"original": "the pandemic has now killed more than 400,000 people in the u.s., reaching that grim milestone a little over a month since the death toll hit 300,000. the virus could kill half a million people in the u.s. by sometime in february, experts predict."}
{"original": "the renewed surge has stopped the recovery in its tracks. hiring fell in december, its first decline since the pandemic first leveled the job market in april. businesses in the first week of january continued to cut workers as they coped with rising infection rates, new restrictions imposed by cities and states, and tighter spending at restaurants, bars and other service-oriented businesses as consumers retreated indoors."}
{"original": "overall, the country still has roughly 10 million fewer jobs than before the virus erupted last spring. hiring is unlikely to turn the corner until vaccines become widely available later this year, according to oxford economics. the economy will likely still be short of 4 million jobs at the end of 2021, oxford economics senior u.s. economist lydia boussour said in a january 12 research note."}
{"original": "among the sectors feeling the most pain are those that rely on in-person services, like restaurants and hotels. as coronavirus rates inch up across the nation, cities such as los angeles and new york have tightened their regulations on restaurants to help slow the spread of the disease. mask mandates could help consumers regain confidence in patronizing those and other businesses, research suggests."}
{"original": "we find that mask mandates do increase consumer spending by quite a bit: 5%, which is large as far as macroeconomic effects go, thomadsen said. we find that they help out every sector of the economy that we can find, including accommodation and food services."}
{"original": "even after the acquittal of the president, his lawyer, rudy giuliani, is pursuing allegations of corruption in ukraine. this past week, attorney general william barr said the justice department would carefully scrutinize what giuliani finds. last july, president trump made the phone call to ukraine that led to impeachment. he asked the president of ukraine to investigate a mysterious democratic national committee computer server that mr. trump said was hidden in ukraine. we have found that odd request is a story that has grown over the years and was influenced by moscow. you may have wondered how the president was impeached over ukraine of all places. the answer is in the story of the mystery server, a reminder that the u.s. and russia have been on opposite sides of a war in ukraine since russia's invasion in 2014."}
{"original": "few people understand what's at stake as well as ambassador bill taylor. he led the u.s. embassy in ukraine as the trump administration withheld military aid while pressing for investigations of democrats."}
{"original": "taylor's testimony carried the weight of his resume; westpoint, 101st airborne in vietnam, 33 years as a diplomat, and an expert on ukraine."}
{"original": "ukraine's security is important to our security and the reason i believe that is that ukraine is on the frontline, taylor told correspondent scott pelley. the russians are fighting a hybrid war against ukraine, but it's not just about ukraine, they are fighting a hybrid war against europe and against the united states."}
{"original": "the war that the russians are fighting in ukraine, pelley said to taylor, we have a stake in?"}
{"original": "we have a stake in, but it's not just the military war, taylor said. hybrid war is more than tanks and soldiers. hybrid war is information war, it's cyber war, it's economic war, it's attacks on elections and as we know they have attacked our elections."}
{"original": "the russian attack on the 2016 election included hacking the computers of the democratic national committee. u.s. intelligence agencies found, …the russian government aspired to help president-elect trump's election chances when possible by discrediting secretary clinton… former deputy national intelligence officer and cia russia analyst, andrea kendall-taylor worked on that report."}
{"original": "the report itself was based on a large body of evidence that demonstrated not only what russia was doing, but also its intent, kendall-taylor said. and it's based on a number of different sources, collected human intelligence, technical intelligence."}
{"original": "kendall-taylor said the evidence is convincing and it isn't a close call."}
{"original": "if you read the intelligence report, it's the consensus view of three intelligence agencies; cia, nsa and the fbi, kendall-taylor said."}
{"original": "the same conclusion was reached by the republican-led senate select committee on intelligence. the committee's report on russia interference was unanimously approved by all of its democratic and republican members. democrat mark warner is vice-chairman."}
{"original": "the russian project was a top down, government-run covert operation that hacked into the dnc and individuals' personal emails, and weaponized that information to release it at the most important times, warner said."}
{"original": "but the idea that the trump campaign was helped by russia, even unwittingly, was a unanimous judgment mr. trump would not accept."}
{"original": "and by the way folks just in case you're like, curious, no, russia did not help me ok? russia? i call it the russian hoax, mr. trump said at a rally in alabama in 2017."}
{"original": "mr. trump began a campaign to discredit the intelligence community's conclusions. he tweeted, so how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers? in mr. trump's telling, the fbi failed to look for evidence on the democrats' computer network. the story of the mystery server was born."}

{"original": "robert johnston dealt directly with the fbi as an investigator of the dnc hack for crowdstrike, a leading cyber security company hired by the democrats. he told us the fbi didn't physically examine the dnc servers because crowdstrike gave the bureau copies of the data from the servers."}
{"original": "if there is a server or a computer system of any kind that's involved in the incident you can take an exact bit for bit digital copy of what's on that system. now that digital copy is just as good as having the real thing, johnston said."}
{"original": "as far as you know, the fbi got what it needed and what it wanted? pelley asked johnston."}
{"original": "exactly and evidence of that is you don't hear the fbi complaining, johnston said."}
{"original": "he's right. a former senior government official, familiar with the investigation, told us the fbi would have preferred to work alongside crowdstrike's investigators, but the democratic national committee decided to give the bureau digital copies of its servers instead. the official told us this was acceptable, in fact even typical in fbi investigations."}

{"original": "what we can see is that russia did what russia does, and that is piling on, kendall-taylor said. they amplify those narratives in ways that then advance russia's own interests."}
{"original": "they look for conspiracy theories that are already out there? pelley asked."}
{"original": "they're picking up on elements or narratives that already exist in a society and amplifying those narratives that advance russian interests, kendall-taylor said."}
{"original": "the interest of putin was to drive a wedge between his enemy, ukraine and ukraine's most important ally, the united states."}
{"original": "a successful, prosperous, western-oriented ukraine provides a direct threat to putin's hold on power, kendall-taylor said. he can't have a successful ukraine on his southern border, because then it demonstrates to russians what is possible."}
{"original": "two weeks after mr. trump's inauguration, putin said, in a news conference, it was not russia that helped donald trump but ukraine that helped hillary clinton. russian media and u.s. conspiracy websites began to spin suspicion of ukraine. ultimately, those rumors appealed to mr. trump's private lawyer, rudy giuliani, who was working to discredit the investigations of russian meddling in 2016."}
{"original": "and there were concerns that there was another game being played, another channel that mr. giuliani was involved in, bill taylor said."}
{"original": "bill taylor and correspondent scott pelley"}
{"original": "as head of the u.s. embassy in ukraine, taylor was frustrated that giuliani was agitating for investigations that were never official u.s. policy. taylor said no one at the state department ever directed him to investigate whether there was a server in ukraine because, no one took it seriously."}
{"original": "no one, perhaps, except the president. in 2017, for the first time, he added ukraine to the story of the server. in an interview he said, why wouldn't … hillary clinton allow the fbi to see the server? they brought in another company that i hear is ukrainian-based."}
{"original": "that's what i heard, mr. trump said. i heard it's owned by a very rich ukrainian..."}
{"original": "the securities and exchange commission, shows that crowdstrike is incorporated in delaware and based in california. its largest shareholders are american venture capital firms. over the years, crowdstrike has been hired by both the democratic and republican parties."}
{"original": "so, the server, they say, is held by a company whose primary ownership individual is from ukraine, mr. trump said during remarks at the white house in october 2019. i'd like to see the server."}
{"original": "taylor said that, to his knowledge, there are no links between crowdstrike and anyone in ukraine."}
{"original": "was this something that the embassy was concerned about? pelley asked."}
{"original": "pelley asked johnston if, during the investigation he was leading, crowdstrike ever sent any of the dnc's computer hardware to ukraine."}
{"original": "no, johnston said. that-- that is-- that is insane. that is not within the realm of reality."}
{"original": "last july, reality suffered a final blow. the story mr. trump first adopted as a server the fbi was blocked from seeing, and then became the server investigated by a ukrainian company, finally morphed into the server hidden in ukraine. in the call, after the ukrainian president asked for anti-tank missiles to defend himself from russia, mr. trump replied, i would like you to do us a favor though… they say crowdstrike... i guess you have one of your wealthy people… the server, they say ukraine has it. this was the first favor mr. trump asked for even before his request that ukraine also investigate the son of vice president biden. this past november, mr. trump spoke, by phone, to fox and friends."}
{"original": "they gave the server to crowdstrike or whatever it's called which is a company owned by a very wealthy ukrainian and i still want to see that server you know the fbi's never gotten that server, mr. trump said. that's a big part of this whole thing. why did they give it to a ukrainian company, why?"}
{"original": "are you sure they did that? an anchor on the show asked the president. are you sure they gave it to ukraine?"}
{"original": "mr. trump replied, well, that's what the word is…"}
{"original": "the word, that ukraine was involved, was amplified by the president's defenders in the impeachment inquiry. they pointed to a 2016 opinion article and social media posts, written by ukrainians, that were critical of mr. trump, as though they were equivalent to russia's covert campaign targeting u.s. computer networks, voting systems and social media. fiona hill, mr. trump's former senior director for russia on the national security council, warned the committee."}
{"original": "some of you on this committee appear to believe that russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country—and that, perhaps, somehow, for some reason, ukraine did, hill said. this is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the russian security services themselves."}
{"original": "what are the chances that this whispering campaign about a democratic national committee server in ukraine is actually a russian intelligence operation, a russian disinformation operation? pelley asked taylor."}
{"original": "the russians are very good at that, taylor said. it's these fake stories that they have propagated. and that's what they do. they do it pretty well. we have to be on guard against that."}
{"original": "from vladimir putin's perspective it worked. last november, as impeachment played out and america's next election season was underway, he said, at a forum, thank god no one is accusing us of interfering in the u.s. elections anymore; now they're accusing ukraine."}
{"original": "we reached out to the white house multiple times on this story, but they did not respond."}

{"original": "washington — the trump administration announced on wednesday it will require brazilian asylum-seekers to wait in mexico for the duration of their u.s. immigration proceedings, subjecting the first non-spanish speaking population to the controversial remain in mexico policy."}
{"original": "the move to send portuguese-speaking migrants to mexico represents the latest expansion of the migrant protection protocols (mpp) program, a policy being challenged in court that has drawn scathing criticism from advocates but which the trump administration credits for a sharp drop in apprehensions of migrants along the u.s.-mexico border in the past seven months. up until now, the u.s. had generally not subjected brazilians and asylum-seekers from other non-spanish speaking countries to the mpp program."}
{"original": "more than 57,000 asylum-seekers from central america, cuba, venezuela and other latin american countries who would otherwise be in the u.s. have been sent to northern mexico, where they are often stranded in overcrowded shelters and squalid makeshift encampments, including in crime-ridden cities like ciudad juárez and matamoros, located in a region the u.s. government warns american travelers not to visit due to rampant violence."}
{"original": "the trump administration has hailed the policy as a successful tool in curbing migration and wednesday's announcement is likely designed to deter u.s.-bound brazilian migrants, who typically journey through central america and mexico to reach the u.s. southern border."}
{"original": "in a statement announcing the move, the department of homeland security said the number of brazilians reaching the u.s.-mexico border tripled in just the last year. border patrol apprehended more than 6,300 brazilians between september and december 2019, according to customs and border protection statistics that showed people from brazil made up the fifth largest group of apprehensions in that time span after migrants from mexico, el salvador, honduras and guatemala."}
{"original": "having an outlet for (brazilians) to wait outside the u.s. for their immigration hearings is super-helpful! ken cuccinelli, the second-highest ranking official at dhs, wrote on twitter, thanking the government of mexico for accepting the change in policy."}
{"original": "today is the one-year anniversary of the first person actually waiting in mexico under mpp, aka, the remain in mexico program. and on today's 1 year anniversary, the first brazilians were returned to mexico to await their u.s. immigration hearing. adding brazilians is big! — acting deputy secretary ken cuccinelli (@homelandken) january 29, 2020"}
{"original": "buzzfeed news and reuters first reported that officials were planning to subject brazilians to the mpp policy."}
{"original": "despite the praise from the trump administration, advocates and even some of the asylum officers implementing the program have strongly denounced the remain in mexico policy, saying it violates international obligations against returning migrants seeking refuge to dangerous places. the group human rights first has denounced hundreds of reported kidnappings and assaults."}
{"original": "a cbs news series last summer detailed the due process concerns about the policy, which makes it extremely difficult for migrants to secure u.s.-based lawyers generally needed for successful asylum claims. according to data by researchers at syracuse university, only about 4% of migrants in the program have had lawyers represent them in proceedings in the u.s. — which, for many migrants, now occur inside makeshift tent-like courts in the rio grande valley."}
{"original": "out of nearly 30,000 completed cases in the program, only 187 migrants have been granted asylum or some other form of protection, according to syracuse's transactional records access clearinghouse (trac). under an expansion of the policy in early january 2020, some asylum-seekers returned by the u.s. to mexico will have to travel more than 340 miles by car through territory where cartels often vie for control of the drug trade to attend hearings in a u.s. immigration court."}
{"original": "bob, welcome to the show. it is great to have you."}
{"original": "and great to be here, michael. thanks for having me."}
{"original": "you're welcome. so i need to start with a disclosure. the disclosure is i am a member of the advisory board at your research institute which we affectionately call c-post."}
{"original": "i don't receive any compensation for serving on that board. but our listeners should still know of my affiliation. and the bottom line here is i carry a bias in favor of c-post. and everybody needs to know that. transparency's important. bob, from my perspective, c-post is a national security research center housed at the university of chicago."}
{"original": "but, to me, it's a special type of national security research center. it does research on important issues. and it develops findings on those issues that have significant, timely application to policy, to intelligence and to law enforcement. and you share this research, i know, with the government in a variety of ways. and i think it's this relevance that makes c-post so unique and so special and just want to get your sense whether you agree with that and anything else you want to add about the center."}
{"original": "thank you, michael. and thank you very much also for serving on our board because the truth is, this isn't just research for research's sake. it's research to matter. and it should matter to our government. there are a number of issues in national security affairs that turn on things that no matter how good our cia is, no matter how good our government is, they just can't drill into because they're about human beings and how human beings operate such as the motives of suicide terrorists."}
{"original": "so my first work which started c-post, i collected the first complete database of all suicide attacks around the world. and it made a prediction. it said if we invaded and occupied iraq, we would touch off the largest suicide terrorist campaign in modern times."}
{"original": "even before the work was published, i gave that prediction to paul wolfowitz, then, our deputy secretary of state in october 2002. now, of course, we still did the iraq war. but he did move all of our forces out of saudi arabia, started an airbase in dela, 2004. and also in february 2004, the dod was the first funder of c-post which was, then, the chicago project on suicide terrorism, now the chicago project on security and threats. and we have been doing wave after wave after wave of policy-relevant research not to duplicate what happens in government but to augment and do things where we can answer some questions especially about how human beings operate that others can't."}
{"original": "which is a great transition because there's two specific threads of your research that i really want to drill into and talk about. and the first is what you call the american face of isis. so tell us about that research and its findings."}
{"original": "yes. a couple years ago, we got a research project to figure out what inspires people about isis propaganda in the united states. well, we had to start by finding out who was inspired by isis in the united states. so we collected the complete set of all individuals who were indicted in u.s. courts or who carried out attacks in the name of isis since the isis movement began in 2014. that's well over 150 cases. and we have court documents, detailed evidence about who they are."}
{"original": "well, something jumped right out at us, michael, that was just super crystal clear which is the core pool of who was attracted to isis today and other militant groups has changed fundamentally since 9/11. on 9/11, the 19 hijackers who attacked us and killed 3,000 people that day were all born overseas and radicalized overseas."}
{"original": "think of them as immigrants. well, that was the case for al qaeda in general. they were well over two-thirds immigrants. and so it was very reasonable to think immigrants were somehow a threat. isis is the opposite. over two-thirds of the isis recruits are born in the united states. that other one-third that's not born in the united states, they've been in the united states, many of them, for decades -- no syrian refugees. it's not--"}
{"original": "i think only two refugees in total. correct?"}
{"original": "two refugees in total, an iraqi and a bosnian who had been in the country many, many, many years. so they were born in the united states or radicalized in the united states. isis did this with video propaganda using the internet to infiltrate videos directly into our homes in chicago, in the east coast, in the west coast, in the south. this was a fundamentally new threat. we are not waging a war like we did on 9/11. and we've gotta stop fighting the last war."}
{"original": "and to show its application to policy, what does the research on the american face of isis mean for something like the muslim ban?"}
{"original": "it means, at best, the muslim ban is irrelevant because if the threat is fundamentally coming from inside, then, banning muslims from overseas who are not actually causing the threat will, at best, be irrelevant. but it's actually a little worse than that because in isis's propaganda that they use to mobilize people already in the united states, they use the travel ban as evidence that it's stage one in a cleansing campaign against muslims in the united states."}
{"original": "so it's not just the travel ban the way often we talk about it as, like, a border wall issue or something related to our politics, you know, democrat, republican. this is a security issue. and the bad guys are using the muslim ban to recruit."}
{"original": "okay. the second research thread is what you call the isis propaganda revolution. and this is the one i really want to spend some time on which is, basically, the story of how isis has been able to recruit so many americans. so walk us through that research and its findings."}
{"original": "so we have long known that isis has been using propaganda. but most people have thought about that propaganda as slick. it's video. it's kind of modern. somehow it has music associated with it. what i discovered when i got into this, basically, with meetings at the national counterterrorism center, is that there were precious few people actually studying the content of the propaganda, why it was so voluminous."}
{"original": "there were over 2,000 isis videos alone. that's 33 solid days of video watching. well, we at c-post decided to conquer the content problem and to really get inside what was actually being shown and that people were watching. and what we discovered is that there are narratives not just a theme, but a trajectory of a storyline that isis used that no islamic group, and i've been studying islamic groups now for over 20 years, no islamic group has used before."}
{"original": "so the standard islamic narrative, it's called, is a narrative where there's a community in peril, the muslim community. you identify who the attacker is, typically the west. and, then, you identify that you're going to attack the attacker."}
{"original": "and it's your duty as a good muslim. and to be sure, isis still has that narrative. but that presupposes you really care about the muslim community already. what isis did is they decided to go for a different mobilization pool, a different pool of people who may have very loose ties to the muslim community and not know any muslims hardly at all."}
{"original": "and what they did is they took a page right out of the hollywood, right out of our blockbuster superhero movies called the heroic narrative. and what they did is they focused on a narrative how an ordinary individual can become super empowered to help a community that he or she doesn't really even know. and think of wonder woman, she didn't know the people she was helping. and it's because they see their own personal power coming to floor. they're conquering their own inner demons by doing that."}
{"original": "well, that's a narrative that hollywood has honed for over 25 years. there are books. there are writers who have specialized in this. and isis has taken that, we call it the heroic narrative, to tap into people who are especially prone to take risks."}
{"original": "and what we discovered is they especially tapped into a pool that al qaeda had not tap into before in the west, criminals, people who have a prior history of incarceration or other backgrounds associated with violence."}
{"original": "this is a pool of individuals that al qaeda did not embrace. and we know this now with great detail. so we can compare who was an isis perpetrator versus who was an al qaeda perpetrator in the united states, apples-to-apples comparisons."}
{"original": "and we can see precious few with a criminal record for al qaeda, those couple that do exert no motives here associated with wanting to have personal power. with isis, we see a lot more criminals. we see them with people who have very little background either by family or otherwise to the islamic community. we see them coming out of prison. and we see them with people who are really caught by the idea they can be empowered to do things in the special world of isis they can't do here like behead people."}
{"original": "yeah. so can you give us an example of one of these heroic narrative on videos?"}
{"original": "yes. so a good example is this video called abu muslim. abu muslim, the video came out in the summer of 2014. and it's a story. it is a story of an individual who's a canadian who goes from being an individual, is not born in an islamic family. he's not islamic."}
{"original": "he becomes a convert. he has a criminal background. and, then, through the course of the narrative, he evolves into being what they call in the video one of the few of the few of the few who can really stand up and be brave in the glorious battles to win against all. and this, michael, looks a lot like our recruiting videos for some of the military."}
{"original": "it's the marines. it's a be all you can be, here. but it's special. the point of this video, the abu muslim, is not every muslim can do this. not every person can do this. you are one of the few of the few of the few. and that's what you're gaining glory for as you go forward."}
{"original": "flames of war, that's another very famous video which many of these perpetrators have watched. and we know this from their self-reporting. this is recounting glorious battle and the enthusiasm of the fighters as they feel these glorious battles coming into fruition. other perpetrators point to beheading videos. they want to be the person that is, i'm sorry to say it so blatantly, cutting off the head. and that's because that's something they can't do in their ordinary world. but isis gives them, essentially, a permission or the world in which they can act out these urges."}
{"original": "and thereby, be the hero in their own minds."}
{"original": "so but we don't know, right, how isis stumbled onto this? right. did they actually read these books that hollywood writers have written over the years about, here's how you tell a story? or did they just watch, you know, western movies and say, hey, here's a pattern that makes sense for us? we don't know. right?"}
{"original": "we actually don't, michael. and the truth is the books-- so there's a man very famous screenwriter in hollywood who's a disney executive called chris vogler. and in the early '90s, he wrote a very important book on the screenwriting of the heroic journey which he's had, essentially, effectively, students. this is now in-- i just mentioned wonder woman. so it's almost in every one of the blockbuster movies in some form or other. and so it doesn't really matter whether they got vogler's book. it doesn't really matter whether it's coming from vogler's followers. it doesn't matter whether it's just watching the moves. the key point they're seeing is they're stealing western ideas to recruit people who don't have strong ties to islam. and they're just living right in western society so that it's not like western society--"}
{"original": "because i, then, wanted to ask you that because one of your findings, right, is that it's especially appealing to converts to islam and to people with prior criminal records. you've explained that second piece, right, why it's so appealing to people with prior criminal records. but why is it so appealing to recent converts?"}
{"original": "well, we have to be honest. right now, we can't say 100% for sure because one of the things we want to do next, michael, and we're working with the fbi to do this is we would like to be able to interview, in some depth, some of these individuals to find out a little more. now, to give you some answer, at a surface level, there's a transformation that has occurred with converts from the pre-convert stage to the post-convert stage which, at least on the surface, tracks with the transformation of an ordinary person going through that heroic journey that i just mentioned to you."}
{"original": "but the fact of the matter is, this is one of those issues where we've done more than scratch the surface. but we haven't been able to give, like, final answers to every little corner. and that's one of the reasons why we're not stopping. we're in the middle of the research not at the end of the research. and one of the things we want to do is sort of learn a little more because we'd like to find out just how important it is that you are a convert because not all of them in our sample fit that."}
{"original": "so how easy it is to actually go interview all these people? do you need the fbi's permission to do that?"}
{"original": "no. it's not that. you need the prison warden's permission. so we've actually been in touch with the key parts of the prison system, the u.s. prison system here and worked with their behavioral psychol-- they have people with phds who overview requests like the kind we make."}
{"original": "and we have tried. but fundamentally, it's an issue of explaining the importance of our study to, essentially, the wardens because if you have myself and my team come in and even though it's just, say, a two or three-hour interview but we need to do it, like, a few dozen times, that can be somewhat disruptive. now, it's not hugely disruptive. but it would be, you know, more than just coming in and doing a half hour interview. and so they have to really be persuaded that it's valuable here for them to have a modest degree of disruption."}
{"original": "and where are you in that process of having that conversation with them -- because this is really important?"}
{"original": "well, so just before i came in, i'm working with the fbi. i'm planning on coming back to washington to brief fbi hq on the stuff that we're talking about here in more depth. i've already briefed their field offices here. and one of the big issues here is trying to have them find value in that further stage of the process."}
{"original": "bob, one of the big changes over the last two years has been the loss by isis of its caliphate. right?"}
{"original": "have we seen a corresponding decline in isis propaganda? or is it less so? is it still out there? what's your sense?"}
{"original": "so two answers to that. first, once propaganda has been produced, it's almost impossible to destroy. the internet was built to survive nuclear war. it was built for that information not to be destroyed in the event of a giant nuclear holocaust. and what that means is all the efforts to try to censor the internet, all the efforts to try to stop it, they can only go so far. so the information that's out there is effectively out there."}
{"original": "so there's hundreds of different narratives that you talked about."}
{"original": "they're out there. what about new content?"}
{"original": "new content has shrunk tremendously as the sanctuaries have shrunk. so one of the things that we have discovered is that there is a correlation which many people are finding surprising because when we think about the internet, we think about things that we can do in a small office here."}
{"original": "and you and i are just sitting in an office. and this is about to distributed over the internet. and there's only just the two of us. well, what we're discovering is there's a close correlation between the loss of the wilayahs, they're called, the provincial level areas of isis and the production from those provincial areas so that it looks from what we can see, is that as we have shrunk the sanctuary, we've also shrunk the production capability of the propaganda and done so in a surprising way. people that i've been showing these to are just really stunned that, well, i thought we could just do this anywhere. i didn't know we needed--"}
{"original": "yeah. pick a computer up and take it to afghanistan instead of syria or iraq."}
{"original": "the analogy i use is c-post. so we now have five offices. we have 40 people who work. and the truth is we could not have anywhere near the production and analysis if we tried to distribute that across the united states with 40 people. having them all come together, i have a research director, kevin ruby, having it organized and centralized, we're using the internet, of course. but i think we're discovering that there is some propaganda production that is seriously lost as the sanctuaries decrease."}
{"original": "so the other question, then, is that isis, as you know, is not the only jihadist extremist group out there. there are others. so are those others learning from isis?"}
{"original": "yeah. so the key answer is yes with two groups. so one is al-nusra. so al-nusra is a group that is not thought to be currently in conflict with the united states. in fact, we have worked with al-nusra. but there are al-nusra videos which have adopted and taken hook, line and sinker the heroic journey to attract brits to come to al-nusra. so this is something that's really important to see that there has been a genie that's let out of the bottle. and other groups are starting to-- we're also--"}
{"original": "so the point of the al-nusra is come to syria to fight with us?"}
{"original": "it is, at this point, to come to syria to fight not to stay in britain and attack. but that's a later stage in asking them what to do. the first step is recruiting people who wouldn't ordinarily be recruited. and that's the danger part because it's the fighter who's the danger here more than anything else."}
{"original": "so we need to see that these militant groups, it's not their technology that's a danger. it's their fighters that are the danger. those are the people that have to execute things and carry things out. so that's why i put a lot of emphasis on the fighters. al-shabaab's another story, more development here in especially--"}
{"original": "in somalia. they are fast becoming number two in terms of producing video recruitment. but what i have to tell you, michael, is that we need to take the study that we have done here focused on north america. and we need to replicate this in other areas of the world because the narratives that we've discovered, these, again, trajectories of story plots that are attracting specific sub-pools of individuals. we need to do that kind of analysis in the middle east, in europe and even in africa."}
{"original": "and do you think it might be different in different places?"}
{"original": "it could well be because the recruitment problem in, say, iraq is different. so the recruitment problem, and we started to see this in some of the isis arabic videos, the recruitment problem for somebody who already is a sunni living in iraq is do they side with the iraqi government? or do they side with isis?"}
{"original": "well, that's a very different problem than you have inside the united states. and what we're seeing is we're beginning to see what we think of is possibly a third narrative structure that's specifically trying to focus on switching sides. and that's something that's very important because a lot of the way we fight terrorists around the world is try to embrace and partner with local groups."}
{"original": "well, the bad guys are figuring that out. and they're trying to figure out ways to undermine our strategy. and so that's why it's very important to start to take and replicate parallel studies to what we've done in north america in local regions and, then, also another western region which would be western europe."}
{"original": "yeah. so bob, just one more question which is you've talked about two areas of future research. right. you've talked about interviewing the folks who are in jail here in the united states that have been inspired by isis to be understand that. and you've talked about doing a similar study abroad. what other research lies ahead?"}
{"original": "yeah. the most important third wave of research, our behavioral studies which are already underway which, in about six months, hopefully, we'll have the first results. i've partnered with world-class psychologists at the university of chicago to take the video discoveries that we have and to show them to different audiences so that we can truly drill into what are the key elements, psychological or otherwise, that are at work. and these are also not just with doing surveys but with fmris and also eegs so that as individuals are watching the videos, we're getting biofeedback to help us really precisely identify the triggers."}
{"original": "well, we're also doing this in not just chicago but also belgium. belgium, as you know, is the highest per capita producer of fighters for isis, perpetrators for isis. and so that means we're doing it in french. so we have french language capability. we are producing the systematic studies. and this is a way to really bring together the narrative analysis and behavioral analysis."}
{"original": "so any early results from this that you can share or too early?"}
{"original": "the number one result that we have is just a very basic result which is that these two narratives that i'm describing for you, the older islamic narrative which we call the social narrative and also the heroic--"}
{"original": "that's al qaeda's narrative. and, then, isis is new narrative that it turns out with over 150 participants, it's not just pape who thinks those narratives are different. it's not just some other professor who thinks it. it turns out they're fundamentally different for almost every audience who watches them."}
{"original": "and they are not all muddied together. so that's very important because we're, now, proving not just asserting, we're proving there are two distinctly different narratives. and that that's how the viewers watch them. and so this is important if we're going to also, then, later on, and this is the next step, show that there's distinct pools who are attracted to one but not the other."}
{"original": "so i should've asked a question earlier. and i'm going to ask it now even though i said only one more question. (laugh) does our understanding of how isis tells its story in these propaganda videos, does that give us insight into how we should push back against them?"}
{"original": "it absolutely does, michael. so one of the reasons we're working closely with the fbi is i've been a supporter for over ten years of sting operations inside the united states. in fact, i'm one of the first terrorism people to support this because they do much better because these people who are inspired often reach out to a terrorist group in the later stages which creates opportunities to intercept them. however, the sting operations--"}

{"original": "so they're going for what sells, you see. well, it's very helpful for the folks doing the sting operations to see how isis is trying to sell the product here in a tighter way. also community leaders, so we've been holding conference at the university of chicago with the city of chicago police, local community leaders to also give them an education because, see, those folks are not going on the internet. they're not actually seeing this."}

{"original": "ryan also predicted that the president would ignore stubborn problems like wage stagnation. i think he'll paper that over. i think he'll put up a bunch of straw man arguments, which to me is the most intellectually lazy form of debate. but we're kind of used to it."}

{"original": "ryan took over the speakership in october, and this will be his first time sitting behind the president during a state of the union address. he tried out the poker face he's been practicing on the reporters in the room, joking, i don't do that, i'm kind of an expressive person...i'm an irish guy, that's just what we do! lucky for him, he'll be sitting alongside fellow irishman vice president joe biden, who isn't known for his poker face either."}

{"original": "boehner also left behind a few cases of his cherished merlot, which isn't ryan's drink of choice. so i'm thinking about giving gifts out to members who do good things. a bottle of boehner merlot every time they do something. so i'm trying to think of a prize."}
{"original": "months before zero tolerance briefly became the law of the land, formalizing the separation of children from their parents at the southern border, employees in the u.s. department of health and human services raised alarm bells about the scope of separations and the harmful effects on minors in the agency's custody."}
{"original": "at the highest levels in the agency tasked with caring for unaccompanied migrant children, those concerns were largely ignored, and employees were even warned not to put their concerns in writing, according to a scathing report released thursday by the hhs inspector general. despite repeated warnings from within, the agency failed to prepare for what its own employees accurately predicted would be a result of family separation: overcrowding and lengthened time in custody for children, a population for whom each day detained is considered deleterious to long-term physical and psychological health."}
{"original": "i said (the office of refugee resettlement) was seeing much higher levels of separation, and that those separations were impacting particularly babies and young children. i said this so many times that i was called a broken record, one employee told the inspector general."}
{"original": "as part of its zero tolerance crackdown to criminally prosecute border-crossing parents, u.s. immigration officials separated more than 2,800 families in the spring of 2018. through a court mandate, most of them have been reunited. last october, however, the administration revealed it had separated another 1,556 migrant children from their parents between the summer of 2017 and the time zero tolerance was fully implemented across the border."}
{"original": "another employee told investigators she warned administrators about the harm separation might do to children."}
{"original": "i told them it was going to traumatize children to separate them unnecessarily. i said that to anyone i could, the employee said."}
{"original": "the report follows a 2019 exposé by the same inspector general that found the trump administration began separating families far earlier than originally acknowledged, in 2017 just months after the president took office."}
{"original": "in wednesday's report, investigators examined failures by hhs, which operates the office of refugee resettlement (orr), to act on warnings and plan for the eventual wave of unaccompanied children — both separated and not — that would overwhelm the agency in 2018 and early 2019. the failures were identified through interviews with senior hhs officials and staff, employees at 45 care provider facilities and review of thousands of internal and interagency documents and emails, according to thursday's report."}
{"original": "orr staff believed that the uac program lacked the bed capacity to accommodate a large increase in separated children and were also concerned about the trauma such a policy would inflict on children. at several points before the zero-tolerance policy was implemented, orr staff shared these concerns with the orr director, the acting assistant secretary for acf, and the counselor to the secretary for human services policy, the inspector general wrote. oig found no evidence that these three senior hhs officials took action to protect children's interests in response to the information and concerns raised by orr staff."}
{"original": "the response from administrators at orr was to warn staff against raising these red flags. the inspector general wrote that staff interviewed recalled receiving repeated, general reminders to be cautious about putting information in writing."}
{"original": "the inspector general concluded that these repeated reminders to limit written information may have had a chilling effect on frank discussion about the possibility that larger scale family separation would occur."}
{"original": "some bosses indicated to investigators that they did not believe family separation would impact basic hhs services. the inspector general wrote that the orr director during that era, scott lloyd, said a child that comes into orr's care as a separated child is treated the same as any child referred to the program."}
{"original": "the former acting assistant secretary for the administration for children and families, steven wagner, said separated children are not 'materially different' from other children entering orr care, according to the report."}
{"original": "one hhs administrator told investigators they were torn. she conceded that it is not great for children to be separated from their parents, but criticized the parents who take the risk of crossing the border with their children."}
{"original": "i do not know what the moral right thing to do is in this situation, the administrator, identified as the counselor to the secretary for human services policy, said."}
{"original": "she also said they felt handcuffed in how to respond to family separations amid a wider law enforcement crackdown on immigration."}
{"original": "there was tension between hhs and law enforcement, she said, noting that hhs suggestions regarding immigration policy were sometimes interpreted as obstructing law enforcement efforts."}
{"original": "officials also said the agency was focused on establishing a controversial memorandum of understanding that would allow sharing of biographic information between hhs and dhs. the agreement called for the fingerprinting of potential sponsors of unaccompanied migrant children — usually u.s.-based family members willing to take them in. it was scrapped months after implementation after officials concluded it led to a prolonged stay for minors in the agency's custody, while not sufficiently safeguarding their safety."}
{"original": "employees told investigators their warnings that the memorandum, too, would strain the hhs system were ignored. they accurately predicted that it would dramatically slow down the process by which children were released, and increase the length of time in custody."}
{"original": "by the end of 2018, a system that had for years averaged a stay of between 30 and 45 days for children in custody, increased to an average of nearly 100 days. meanwhile, the hhs system of facilities for children was pressed to its limits, forcing u.s. customs and border protection — which is generally required by law to transfer unaccompanied children to hhs custody within 72 hours after apprehending them — to hold children for far longer."}
{"original": "children that make it to hhs care receive comprehensive medical examinations within 48 hours of arrival. some border patrol facilities were not equipped with even toothpaste and soap for children, and could provide only basic health care. border patrol stations, generally designed to hold single adults, also do not provide vaccinations. in late 2018 and early 2019, six children died in u.s immigration custody."}
{"original": "in a thursday press briefing, assistant inspector general for evaluation and inspections, ann maxwell, said in response to a question from cbs news that child welfare should be the priority when hhs formulates policy."}
{"original": "we have to make sure that children's interests are prioritized and represented in decisions affecting a key program both internally discussions and decisions within hhs, maxwell said."}
{"original": "thursday's report also detailed how top hhs leadership was reluctant to play a vocal and active role in shaping immigration policy, seeing it as a task for the homeland security and justice departments. the acting assistant secretary for the administration for children and families division of hhs believed the department should not seek to affect immigration policy regardless of its impact on the uac program and that it should adapt to whatever policies are put in place, the report said."}
{"original": "our participation in immigration policy is very limited and well-defined. our job is to have a bed available for the next child that is brought to us by ice or cbp. that is what our role is and what we focus on. our role is limited to that, the acting assistant secretary said, according to the report."}
{"original": "in a response included in the inspector general's report, assistant secretary for children and families lynn johnson defended the agency and said it was beholden to decisions made by other agencies."}
{"original": "johnson said hhs does not have a role in shaping upstream immigration enforcement policy... in some instances, the department of justice of dhs may not communicate with hhs for law enforcement or other legitimate legal or policy reasons."}
{"original": "hhs' administration for children and families said in a statement after the report was released that, we treat the children in our care with dignity and respect, and deliver services to them in a compassionate and organized manner while we work expeditiously to unify each one with a suitable sponsor."}
{"original": "as noted in the report, orr is already taking steps toward implementing recommended changes that are within its statutory authorities, the agency said."}
{"original": "starbucks wants people to know: just because folks can now use its bathrooms without buying anything does not give all carte blanche to disrupt others."}
{"original": "or, as starbucks executive chairman howard schultz recently told the atlantic council in washington, d.c.: we don't want to become a public bathroom."}
{"original": "still, the coffee chain is going to run that risk, in light of its new policy of opening its space to all, whether paying customers or not."}
{"original": "we're going to make the right decision 100 percent of the time and give people the (bathroom) key, said schultz, discussing rules that took effect during the weekend."}
{"original": "a company spokesperson further clarified to cbs news on monday: the key piece here is that we are asking customers that when using a starbucks space, we respectfully request they behave in a manner that maintains a warm and welcoming environment by using spaces as intended, being considerate of others, communicating with respect [and] acting responsibly."}
{"original": "separately, a starbucks procedure manual for employees offered detailed instructions on what to do if someone is behaving in a disruptive manner. it said disruptive behaviors include smoking, drug or alcohol use, improper use of restrooms and sleeping."}
{"original": "the new rules come more than a month after a manager at a philadelphia starbucks called the police on two young black men, one or both of whom asked to use the washroom but had not purchased anything."}
{"original": "after a public backlash that included protests, boycotts and accusations of racism, starbucks said it would close more than 8,000 stores in the u.s. next tuesday for racial-bias training for its almost 175,000 employees. schultz recently told cbs this morning the manager in philadelphia, who is no longer employed by starbucks, was likely acting on her own unconscious bias."}
{"original": "starbucks last week apologized after a customer at a store in california found a derogatory term for mexicans printed on his coffee drink."}
{"original": "still, the company's new policy includes instructions for employees to call 911 if they feel someone is a safety threat, and adds that customers can be banned from starbucks stores if they're disruptive."}
{"original": "the policy includes a stipulation that spaces be used as intended, which could rule out some of the behavior that prompted some starbucks employees in new york to lock bathroom doors during a short-lived revolt in 2011 as a worker protest against having to clean up after people who left bathrooms a mess."}
{"original": "in recent years, starbucks largely left bathroom policies to individual locations."}
{"original": "president trump gave what he called a major announcement about the southern border and the partial government shutdown on saturday. in his speech, mr. trump cited the humanitarian crisis at the border, where he said young children were being exploited by coyotes and women were being sexual assaulted. he did not distinguish between illegal migration and asylum seekers."}
{"original": "the lack of border control provides a gateway -- and a very wide and open gateway -- to allow illegal criminal and aliens to get into the united states, mr. trump said, adding that he would keep to the promise he made as a candidate to fix this crisis."}
{"original": "mr. trump then presented what the white house believes could be a deal to end the shutdown, saying he was speaking to break the logjam."}
{"original": "it is a compassionate response to the ongoing tragedy at our southern border, mr. trump said about his planned deal, said he hoped democrat lawmakers would provide their enthusiastic support."}
{"original": "the radical left can never control our borders. i will not let it happen. walls are not immoral, in fact it is the opposite of immoral, mr. trump said."}
{"original": "the deal mr. trump laid out included $800 million in immediate humanitarian aid, $805 million for improved drug detection technology at legal ports of entry, hiring 2,750 new border agents and 75 new immigration judge teams to reduce court backlogs -- all of which democrats support. the deal also includes new system to allow central american minors to apply for asylum in their home countries."}
{"original": "however, it still contained the $5.7 billion demand for the wall, which he said would not be a concrete barrier from sea to shining sea, but would instead be steel barriers. he said that a wall would be built along 230 miles of the border."}
{"original": "he also said that he would extend protections for deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) for three years, as well as an extension of the legal status of temporary protected status (tps) holders. mr. trump announced that he planned to hold weekly bipartisan meetings at the white house to discuss immigration reform."}
{"original": "senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said that he would bring this legislation to the floor this week. the senate reconvenes on tuesday. gop sen. marco rubio also said that it sounded like a reasonable deal."}

{"original": "unfortunately, initial reports make clear that his proposal is a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total, do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people's lives, pelosi said. for one thing, this proposal does not include the permanent solution for the dreamers and tps recipients that our country needs and supports."}
{"original": "senate minority whip dick durbin also said in a statement that he would not support the rumored deal before the speech."}
{"original": "first, president trump and senate majority leader mcconnell must open the government today. second, i cannot support the proposed offer as reported and do not believe it can pass the senate. third, i am ready to sit down at any time after the government is opened and work to resolve all outstanding issues, durbin said."}

{"original": "saturday marks the 29th day of the longest government shutdown in history. mr. trump and congressional democrats are currently deadlocked over funding for a border wall. mr. trump refuses to sign any government funding bill that does not include money for a wall, and democrats are refusing to negotiate while the government is shut down. around 800,000 federal workers have been furloughed or working without pay since the shutdown began."}
{"original": "in recent weeks, mr. trump has considered declaring a national emergency, which would enable him to build the wall without congressional approval. mr. trump said earlier this month that i can do it if i want. so far, he has not. i think we might work a deal, he has said. but mr. trump went on to threaten, and if we don't, i may go that route. i have the absolute right to do national emergency if i want."}
{"original": "mr. trump's announcement will coincide with women's marches across the country that both protest trump administration policies and try to draw attention to other policy priorities for women."}

{"original": "efforts to solve the five-year syrian civil war reached a new roadblock monday when opposition representatives pulled out of the talks in geneva. increased fighting in syria in recent days indicates a possible crumbling of the partial cease-fire, brokered by the united states and russia in february."}

{"original": "is there a coming together in terms of ideas about peace and the ceasefire and who can do what to make syria a better place? cbs this morning co-host charlie rose asked mr. obama in an interview at the white house, soon after the leaders' conversation."}
{"original": "my call today to him was to indicate that we're starting to see it fray more rapidly. and if the united states and russia are not in sync about maintaining it and getting a political track and transition moving, then we could be back in a situation we were three, four weeks ago. and that would serve neither of our interests, mr. obama explained."}
{"original": "he added that he thinks the russians are also very much committed to maintaining the structure of the syrian state, which in theory, we don't object to either."}
{"original": "where we have continually butted heads -- and this has been true for six years now -- is his insistence that he cannot back unilaterally the removal of [syrian president bashar al-assad] -- that that's a decision that assad and the syrians have to make, he said."}
{"original": "in the last year of his two-term presidency, mr. obama also reflected on his foreign policy doctrine, which he said he has always shied away from labeling under one banner."}
{"original": "what i believe is that the united states as the world's singular super power has an obligation in all areas of the world, where there's mayhem and war and conflict, for us to try to be a positive force, mr. obama said. but that does not mean that we should be deploying troops everywhere where a crisis is taking place, that we have to be judicious about how we use military power."}
{"original": "however, some have criticized the president for thinking too much and not doing enough. mr. obama acknowledged he had heard that argument."}
{"original": "when we sat down together back in 2009 when i first came into office, we were still in the midst of two active wars, mr. obama told rose. and since that time, we've been able to wind down active combat in those two theaters. those countries are by no means in great shape. ... al qaeda at core has been dismantled. bin laden is dead. isil is losing territory. and so i've shown no hesitance to use our military where necessary to protect american lives, american interests."}
{"original": "in 2012, mr. obama said assad regime's use of chemical weapons would be the red line that could move the u.s. closer to military intervention in the syrian civil war. but he was criticized again for not attacking assad directly, which some say resulted in the country's current devastated state where hundreds of thousands of people have died in the civil war."}
{"original": "i think there's no doubt that there are many in the middle east who would've preferred me taking a shot at assad, mr. obama said in response to the criticism. but the reason is not because of some abstract notions of red lines. ... assad is a horrible leader, horrible dictator who has shattered his country. and it continues to be our position that we need to get him out of there."}
{"original": "you have said more than one time that we're the strongest military, we have the best economy. you've mentioned the culture ... america should own the 21st century -- your words. what could stop us? rose asked."}
{"original": "well, a couple things could stop us, mr. obama said. number one is if our political system continues to be dysfunctional. it's fascinating the degree to which the single most important question i'm asked these days from other world leaders is, 'what's going on with your elections?' ... the current presidential election just is the tip of a broader iceberg of dysfunction that we've seen."}
{"original": "as the president reflected on what he has learned during his presidency, he shared that big breakthroughs are typically the result of just a lot of grunt work."}
{"original": "there's a lot of just blocking and tackling. ... what is important is making sure that you've got an organization that has integrity, that is clear about its mission, that is doing things the right way and not taking shortcuts, mr. obama said. that you're not thinking in terms of short term politics or pr, but you're in for the long haul, and when you do that, than ultimately, you're going to get the good outcome."}

{"original": "san francisco -- employers cannot pay women less than men for the same work based on differences in their salaries at previous jobs, a federal appeals court said monday. pay differences based on prior salaries are discriminatory under the federal equal pay act, a unanimous 11-judge panel of the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals said."}
{"original": "the decision overturned a ruling last year by a smaller panel of 9th circuit judges that had been criticized by equal pay advocates."}
{"original": "allowing pay differences based on previous salaries would perpetuate wage gaps between men and women that are based on discrimination in the job market, judge stephen reinhardt wrote."}
{"original": "reinhardt -- considered among the most liberal members of the 9th circuit -- wrote the opinion before he died last month."}
{"original": "although the (equal pay) act has prohibited sex-based wage discrimination for more than fifty years, the financial exploitation of working women embodied by the gender pay gap continues to be an embarrassing reality of our economy, reinhardt wrote."}
{"original": "women made about 80 cents for every dollar men earned in 2015, according to u.s. government data."}
{"original": "the ruling came in a lawsuit by california school employee aileen rizo, who learned in 2012 while having lunch with her colleagues that male counterparts hired after her were making more money."}
{"original": "fresno county public schools hired rizo as a math consultant in 2009 for a little under $63,000 a year. the county had a standard policy that added 5 percent to her previous pay as a middle school math teacher in arizona."}
{"original": "an email to an attorney for the district's superintendent was not immediately returned."}
{"original": "the equal pay act, signed into law by president john f. kennedy in 1963, forbids employers from paying women less than men based on gender for equal work performed under similar working conditions. but it creates exemptions when pay is based on seniority, merit, quantity or quality of work or any other factor other than sex."}

{"original": "ratcheting up pressure on the russia investigation, the white house announced that top fbi and justice department officials have agreed to meet with congressional leaders and review highly classified information the lawmakers have been seeking on the handling of the probe."}
{"original": "the agreement came after president donald trump made an extraordinary demand that the justice department investigate whether the fbi infiltrated his presidential campaign. it's unclear exactly what the members will be allowed to review or if the justice department will be providing any documents to congress."}
{"original": "white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said trump chief of staff john kelly will broker the meeting between congressional leaders and the fbi, justice department and office of the director of national intelligence. she said the officials will review highly classified and other information they have requested, but did not provide additional detail."}
{"original": "during a meeting monday with trump, deputy attorney general rod rosenstein and fbi director christopher wray also reiterated an announcement late sunday that the justice department's inspector general will expand an existing investigation into the russia probe by examining whether there was any improper politically motivated surveillance."}
{"original": "rep. devin nunes, an ardent trump supporter and head of the house intelligence committee, has been demanding information on an fbi source in the russia investigation. and mr. trump has taken up the cause as the white house tries to combat the threat posed by special counsel robert mueller's investigation into potential ties between russia and the trump campaign."}
{"original": "mr. trump tweeted sunday, i hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the department of justice look into whether or not the fbi/doj infiltrated or surveilled the trump campaign for political purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the obama administration!"}
{"original": "with the demand, mr. trump entered into the realm of applying presidential pressure on the justice department regarding an investigation into his own campaign — a move few of his predecessors have made."}
{"original": "mr. trump made the demand amid days of public venting about the special counsel investigation, which he has deemed a witch hunt that he says has yielded no evidence of collusion between his campaign and russia. in response, the justice department moved to defuse the confrontation by asking its watchdog to investigate whether there was inappropriate surveillance."}
{"original": "if anyone did infiltrate or surveil participants in a presidential campaign for inappropriate purposes, we need to know about it and take appropriate action, rosenstein said in a statement announcing the move."}
{"original": "the justice department probe began in march at the request of attorney general jeff sessions and congressional republicans. sessions and the lawmakers urged inspector general michael horowitz to review whether fbi and justice department officials abused their surveillance powers by using information compiled by christopher steele, a former british spy, and paid for by democrats to justify monitoring carter page, a former campaign adviser to trump."}
{"original": "horowitz said his office will look at those claims as well as communications between steele and justice and fbi officials."}
{"original": "the back and forth between the justice department and congress began with a classified subpoena from nunes in late april. the panel didn't publicize the subpoena, but the justice department released a letter it sent to nunes rejecting the request for information regarding a specific individual. the department said disclosure could have severe consequences, including potential loss of human life."}
{"original": "the justice department said the white house had signed off on its letter, but nunes wasn't satisfied, and continued to pressure the department. negotiations between the house republicans and the justice department appeared to stall last week ahead of trump's tweet — an apparent reversal of the white house's initial policy."}
{"original": "rep. adam schiff of california, the senior democrat on the house intelligence committee, has called trump's claim of an embedded spy nonsense."}
{"original": "his 'demand' doj investigate something they know to be untrue is an abuse of power, and an effort to distract from his growing legal problems, schiff tweeted. never mind that doj has warned that lives and alliances are at risk. he doesn't care."}
{"original": "mr. trump's demand of the justice department alarmed many observers, who felt it not only violated presidential protocol but also could have a chilling effect on federal law enforcement or its use of informants."}
{"original": "the new york times was the first to report that the fbi had an informant who met several times with trump campaign officials who had suspicious contacts linked to russia."}
{"original": "the gop-led house intelligence committee closed its russian meddling probe last month, saying it found no evidence of collusion or coordination between mr. trump's campaign and russia. schiff and other committee democrats were furious and argued that republicans had not subpoenaed many witnessed they considered essential to the committee's work."}
{"original": "sunday was not the first time that mr. trump accused his predecessor of politically motivated activity against him."}
{"original": "without substantiation, mr. trump tweeted in march 2017 that former president barack obama had conducted surveillance the previous october at trump tower, the new york skyscraper where mr. trump ran his campaign and transition and maintains a residence. comey later testified to congress that internal reviews found no information to support the president's tweets. mr. trump fired comey over the bureau's russia investigation."}
{"original": "a growing number of states that have struggled to speedily distribute the covid-19 vaccine are enlisting the national guard for help."}
{"original": "washington is the latest. governor jay inslee on monday said he would deploy the guard to set up mass-vaccination sites, with a goal of ramping up to 45,000 inoculations a day from a current daily average of only 12,000. previously, like most states, washington had mostly planned to rely on hospitals and pharmacies to distribute the vaccine around the state. but its distribution numbers have lagged."}
{"original": "as of january 19, washington had administered only about 45% of the vaccines it had received from the federal government. that ranks washington no. 37 among all 50 states in terms of how much of the vaccine it has been allocated to date has actually gone into people's arms, according to the latest available data from the centers for disease control and prevention."}
{"original": "in all, about 20 states are using their local national guard troops for everything from leading the vaccination effort to distribution to giving people shots. president joe biden has said that he would lean more heavily on the federal emergency management agency and the national guard to help accelerate the rollout of the vaccine."}
{"original": "that's a shift. many state and federal officials were initially reluctant to rely on the guard in distributing the vaccine out of concerns that a military presence could scare away people who might fear the government was set to mandate inoculations."}
{"original": "as recently as october, paul mango, the deputy chief of staff for policy at the department of health and human services, predicted that the military would play almost no visible role in administering vaccines. the overwhelming majority of americans will get a vaccine that no federal employee, including the department of defense, has touched, mango said at the time."}
{"original": "some health experts now say that may have been a mistake. tinglong dai, who studies health care and operations management at johns hopkins carey business school, thinks using military personnel to speed the vaccination effort is a very smart idea, even if the sight of service members on america's street could jangle nerves."}
{"original": "nobody wants to see their city to look like it is under military occupation, dai said. will it scare off some people? i don't think right now. the demand to get a vaccine is very high."}
{"original": "encouragingly, the pace of daily covid-19 vaccinations has increased sharply in the past week. nearly 6.4 million americans got their initial doses in the past week, or just over 911,000 a day. that was up from a few hundred thousand a day the previous week, although still well short of the 2 million doses a day experts think is necessary for the country to reach herd immunity by late spring."}
{"original": "perhaps the biggest reason for the increase in vaccinations is the mounting public pressure on governors whose states were falling behind, dai said. that was also the reason more states appeared to be turning to the national guard for help."}

{"original": "in new york city, the jacob javits convention center has gotten its second pandemic makeover. back in the spring, when the coronavirus was spreading rapidly, the complex on the west side of manhattan was repurposed by national guard troops into a covid-19 treatment facility."}
{"original": "now the guard is at work turning the massive convention space into a mass-vaccination site. about 350 troops have been deployed to what is normally the home of the local annual auto show and new york's comic con gathering. those service members will do everything from controlling access to the site and conducting temperature checks at the door to ensuring people are in the right lines. city officials say vaccinations will take 20 minutes to 30 minutes from sign-in to check out once the facility is up and running."}
{"original": "while the national guard has been deployed to help with clean up after hurricanes and other natural disasters, there isn't much history of the military distributing vaccines. marcus plescia, the chief medical officer of the association of state and territorial health officials, has voiced concern about using the guard for vaccine distribution. plescia said he is worried that deploying the military to speed the process could give people false hope."}
{"original": "more specifically, the national guard might succeed in boosting distribution temporarily, but too little vaccine is currently in transit for even 20% of all americans to get shots, he said."}
{"original": "we are still a few weeks or months away from having enough supply of vaccine to open up that way, plescia said. you will have people who want the vaccine and people who are capable of administering it, but you still won't have enough vaccines."}

{"original": "it will, among other things, penalize people and countries for engaging in certain trade with cuba, and impose controls on some exports."}
{"original": "the trump administration had already limited the ability of cubans in the u.s. to send money to their families back on the island (remittances); put many new constraints on u.s. travellers wishing to visit cuba; limited commercial flights from the u.s. to a single city — havana; stopped cruise ships from coming here and effectively barred u.s. nationals from staying in any of cuba's hotels. and all of that came on top of the long-running, blanket u.s. economic, financial and trade embargo on the island."}

{"original": "overall, americans' views of cuba have grown more positive recently. fifty-one percent now have a favorable impression of cuba (similar to what a gallup poll found in february). prior to this year, gallup polling consistently showed more negative than positive views of cuba. back in 1996, nearly nine in 10 americans viewed the country unfavorably."}
{"original": "there are partisan differences: most democrats (56 percent) view cuba favorably, compared to just over a third of republicans (36 percent)."}
{"original": "as favorable opinions of cuba have risen so has interest in taking a trip there. forty-three of americans now say they would be very or somewhat interested in visiting cuba, up 10 points from the fall of 2014. still, traveling to cuba doesn't appeal to most americans - 57 percent have little or no interest."}

{"original": "we've been clear that we will take strong enforcement action on behavior that has the potential to lead to offline harm, and given the renewed potential for violence surrounding this type of behavior in the coming days, we will permanently suspend accounts that are solely dedicated to sharing qanon content, twitter said in a statement to cbs news."}
{"original": "a short time later, twitter permanently suspended president trump's own account due to the risk of further incitement of violence. that followed a 12-hours freeze earlier in the week after he posted a video where he appeared to sympathize with protesters who rampaged through the capitol and repeated false claims about the election."}
{"original": "qanon followers believe a nefarious group of global elites, including hollywood celebrities and democratic politicians, are engaged in a satanic child trafficking operation, and that only president trump can defeat them. critics have likened qanon to an apocalyptic religious cult, and the fbi has warned of the growing threat of violence from conspiracy theory-driven domestic extremists including qanon."}

{"original": "new york - with new options and conveniences, there's never been a better time for shoppers. as for workers ... well, not always."}
{"original": "the retail industry is being radically reshaped by technology, and nobody feels that disruption more starkly than 16 million american shelf stockers, salespeople, cashiers and others. the shifts are driven, like much in retail, by the amazon (amzn) effect -- the explosion of online shopping and the related changes in consumer behavior and preferences."}
{"original": "as mundane tasks like checkout and inventory are automated, employees are trying to deliver the kind of customer service the internet can't match."}
{"original": "so a best buy (bby) employee who used to sell electronics in the store is dispatched to customers' homes to help them choose just the right products. a walmart (wmt) worker dashes in and out of the grocery aisles, hand-picks products for online shoppers and brings them to people's cars."}
{"original": "yet even as responsibilities change -- and in many cases, expand -- the average growth in pay for retail workers isn't keeping pace with the rest of the economy. some companies say in the long run the transformation could mean fewer retail workers, though they may be better paid. but while some workers feel more satisfied, others find their jobs are just a lot less fun."}
{"original": "bloomingdale's (m) saleswoman brenda moses remembers the pre-internet era, when the upscale store was regularly filled with customers ready to buy. these days, department stores are less crowded, and the customers who do come in can make price comparisons on their phones at the same time as they pepper staff with questions."}
{"original": "you tell them everything, and then they look at you and say, 'you know what? i think i will get it online,' she said."}
{"original": "moses has seen her commission rate rise to 6 percent from a half a percent, but her hourly wage dropped from $19 as low as $10 before it came back up to $14. depending more on commissions means her income fluctuates, and she's competing with her colleagues for each sale."}
{"original": "now, moses said, you have to fight to make your money."}
{"original": "the same could be said for the retailing industry, overall. in 2017, 66,500 u.s. retail jobs disappeared (not taking into account jobs added in areas like distribution and call centers). in the past decade, about one out of every seven jobs have vanished in the hardest-hit sectors like clothing and consumer electronics, says frank badillo, director of research at macrosavvy. though department stores have suffered the most, smaller businesses also have struggled to compete with online sellers."}
{"original": "many of the survivors are rushing to adapt. of the retail jobs that remain, over the next decade as many as 60 percent will either be new kinds of roles or will involve revised duties, says craig rowley, senior client partner at korn ferry hay group, a human resources advisory firm. he estimates the number is about 10 percent now."}
{"original": "how fast retail jobs will change and what they'll look like depends on three factors, rowley said: the pace at which online shopping advances; the speed at which robotics and other technology progress; and shifts in the minimum hourly pay."}
{"original": "jobs for workers will get more interesting and be more impactful on the company's business, rowley said. but the negative side is that there will be fewer entry-level jobs, and there will be more pressure to perform."}
{"original": "some retail workers at the vanguard of the changes -- like laila ummelaila, a personal grocery shopper at a walmart in old bridge, new jersey -- speak glowingly of their new responsibilities."}
{"original": "walmart, the nation's largest private employer, has scrutinized every job in its stores as it looks to leverage its more than 4,000 u.s. locations against amazon's internet dominance."}
{"original": "the company now has 18,000 personal shoppers who fill online orders from store shelves, and 17,000 check-out hosts whose responsibilities are more extensive than the greeters of old, including keeping the area clean and making sure registers move efficiently."}
{"original": "the company has also shifted workers from back-room clerical jobs and eliminated some overnight stocker positions in favor of more daytime sales help. the customers like the changes, company officials say, pointing to more than three years of sales growth at its established u.s. stores -- a contrast with other, suffering retailers."}
{"original": "ummelaila became a personal shopper after joining the company three years ago. to meet her store's goals, she must pick one item per 30 seconds. if she can't find something, she has to quickly get a substitute that's as good or better."}
{"original": "you start to get to know the customers, you know what they like, she said, how they like their meat ... and how long they keep milk in the fridge."}
{"original": "best buy has begun a free service in key markets using salespeople to sit with customers in their own homes and make recommendations on setting up a home office to designing a home theater system. best buy said shoppers spend more with a home visit than they do at the stores. the project follows amazon, which reportedly has been testing a program that sends employees to shoppers' houses for free smart home recommendations."}
{"original": "at steve frederick's townhouse in chicago, billy schuler offered advice about speakers that can be adjusted from a smartphone. schuler, who had previously worked at best buy for 14 years, returned to the company to take on the new role."}
{"original": "customers are more relaxed when they're in their home, he said. we can do a walkthrough of the house and see their needs. he likes to break the ice by calling the person and chatting a day or two before the visit."}
{"original": "frederick, who's spending close to $20,000 on the equipment, describes himself as old-school and said he needed a lot of help. he thinks it was worthwhile."}
{"original": "when you're spending that kind of money, you want to have someone come in and explain it, he said."}
{"original": "schuler declined to give specifics but says he is well compensated. ummelaila says her pay went up to nearly $12 per hour from $10 when she became a personal shopper."}
{"original": "target (tgt) credits its strategy of assigning dedicated sales staff in areas such as clothing, consumer electronics and beauty for helping increase sales, and said having visual merchandisers create vignettes like shoppers would see in specialty stores inspires people to buy. you're making an outfit and telling a story on each rack, said crystal lawrence, who works at a target store in brooklyn, new york. she likes the variety in her new job, and target said it plans to keep paying higher wages for those specialized roles."}
{"original": "but a survey of nearly 300 retail workers -- conducted by the center for frontline retail and community development project at the urban justice center -- found that of those workers whose job responsibilities have changed, more than 40 percent said they hadn't received pay increases to reflect that."}
{"original": "wages for hourly retail workers have risen less than 9 percent since 1990, compared with 18 percent for overall workers in the private sector. they've made some progress recently, with some of the biggest retailers, like walmart and target moving to increase pay in the face of low unemployment and competition for workers."}
{"original": "for a long period, these retail jobs were just terrible on average, said michael mandel, chief economic strategist at the progressive policy institute. retail stores have been following one strategy: high turnover, low wages. that strategy is no longer viable."}
{"original": "mandel sees hope in technology, which he said has historically created more and better-paying jobs than it has eliminated."}
{"original": "the national retail federation trade group points to government data showing that even in large supermarket chains where self-checkout has become standard, the number of employees per store has held steady over the 15 years through 2014. and the demand for grocery cashiers increased in the past few years, said burning glass technologies, a company that analyzes labor market data."}
{"original": "mcdonald's (mcd) said the self-serve kiosks it has been rolling out won't result in mass layoffs, but it will mean some cashiers shift roles to accommodate changes like offering table service."}
{"original": "however, a report prepared by cornerstone capital group for the investor responsibility research center institute predicted that more than 7.5 million retail jobs are at risk of being eliminated by automation over the next several years."}
{"original": "amazon is testing a grocery store in seattle without cashiers, using cameras and shelf sensors to keep track of the items that shoppers grab and charge them. eatsa, an automat-style restaurant in san francisco, lacks cashiers as well -- diners order at kiosks, and workers prepare the food behind an opaque wall, with virtually no interaction between them."}
{"original": "a labor group representing 1.3 million grocery and food workers is trying to combat automation by highlighting that workers' specialized skills -- like the care they take in icing a rose on a wedding cake, or arranging flowers, or the ability of human workers to recognize spoiled food -- provide a benefit to shoppers."}
{"original": "separating progress for the consumer, for the worker, for the economy versus the stockholders ... those are completely different things, said erikka knuti, a spokeswoman for the united food and commercial workers international union."}
{"original": "others said automation and happy workers are not necessarily incompatible."}
{"original": "walmart ceo doug mcmillon foresees fewer sales associates at his stores, but they'll be better paid and better trained. walmart has trained 225,000 supervisors and managers on topics like new apps and better customer service. it said managers who go through the academies have better retention rates than those who do not. workers who report to those managers stay longer. and entry-level workers who complete a new training program are more likely to remain."}
{"original": "it's a shift retailers may have to speed up. government figures show the rate of retail workers quitting their jobs in 2016 was at its highest since 2007."}
{"original": "alfredo duran, who started as a sales associate at gap (gps) and worked at six retailers over 15 years, left the industry two years ago. as a manager at clothing chain mango, he was making $75,000 a year. but once the store closed, he had trouble finding another job in retail because no one wanted to pay him for his experience."}
{"original": "it has gone down. one person is doing three jobs. and you can't move up, said duran, 38, of queens, new york."}
{"original": "he's now a concierge at a manhattan hotel, making half of what he used to earn -- but happy he left retail."}
{"original": "the senate confirmed dozens of trump nominees by voice vote wednesday evening, the last day of the 115th congress before the 116th congress is seated thursday. the confirmation of 77 nominees was a rare moment of bipartisanship for the senate."}
{"original": "several ambassadorships positions were filled wednesday evening, notably one in yemen, where a saudi-backed civil war has ravaged the country. the senate also confirmed a new director of national drug control policy, as well as a census director for the 2020 census."}
{"original": "the upcoming census has been a contentious issue for some democrats, as commerce secretary wilbur ross added a citizenship question. critics argue this question would leave states with large undocumented populations undercounted -- possibly affecting representation in congress. the citizenship question is being challenged in court."}
{"original": "most of the nominees confirmed wednesday were for executive branch positions. only a few judicial nominees were confirmed, as democrats have opposed many of president trump's nominations to the federal bench."}
{"original": "the odds of being audited by the irs are shrinking -- and that's especially good news for wealthy taxpayers."}
{"original": "about 934,000 returns were audited during fiscal year 2017, the lowest number since 2003, according to new irs data."}
{"original": "among households with income above $1 million, just 4.37 percent faced audits. that's less than half the 9.55 percent rate in 2015, and the lowest audit rate for millionaires since the irs first began tracking it in 2004."}
{"original": "the audit rate for taxpayers earning $200,000 or less fell to 0.59 percent, the lowest level since 2002."}
{"original": "the main reason for the decline: the irs's budget and staff levels have been under pressure for years."}
{"original": "the irs is also auditing fewer companies and nonprofit organizations. the audit rate for businesses with assets of $250 million tumbled to 15.2 percent in the most recent fiscal quarter, less than half the 33.8 percent rate in 2013. less than 1 percent of all tax-exempt organizations were audited in 2017."}
{"original": "look, we have a voluntary tax system. it relies on people's goodwill and it relies to some degree on their fear of being audited, said howard gleckman, a senior fellow at the tax policy institute, in an interview with cbs."}
{"original": "the tax legislation passed in december creates new burdens for the irs, especially by encouraging some businesses to change their reporting structure."}
{"original": "it creates more opportunities for people to claim business deductions than they might have before, said gleckman. i don't quite know how the service is going to keep track of them."}
{"original": "moreover, gleckman thinks the rules are so badly written than even taxpayers with the best of intentions will mess-up because they don't understand how to comply."}
{"original": "taxpayers seeking help from the irs often have difficulties finding it because its staff has shrunk by 20,000 over the past 8 years. the agency's proposed budget is a 1.7 percent increase from last year, but still less than the budget in 2012."}
{"original": "this is an unsustainable situation for the agency that brings in 93 percent of the nation's revenue, and it will worsen with additional cuts proposed in the administration's 2019 budget, said tony reardon, president of the national treasury employees union."}
{"original": "an irs spokesman declined to comment."}
{"original": "with more than 5,800 cases and at least 100 deaths, the u.s. is at a critical point in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic, according to surgeon general jerome adams."}
{"original": "in an interview with cbs evening news anchor norah o'donnell, adams emphasized that the next 15 days will be crucial for fighting the pandemic in the u.s. he also warned that if americans don't take it seriously, the nation could face an outbreak like italy's — in which more than 31,000 people have been diagnosed."}
{"original": "read norah o'donnell's interview with adams below."}
{"original": "norah o'donnell: there is a new study out today from the national institutes of health that says the virus can live on surfaces for up to days. twenty-four hours on cardboard, two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. what do americans need to know to protect themselves?"}
{"original": "dr. jerome adams: well, the most important thing for americans to know is that they should clean their surfaces frequently and that they should wash their hands frequently because the two ways you're going to transmit coronavirus from a surface is by having a dirty surface around your house and by not washing your hands after you touch that surface."}

{"original": "the mayor of new york city said he is considering a shelter in place policy. if major cities did that, would that help slow the spread of this invisible enemy?"}
{"original": "well, i'm glad you brought that up because tony fauci and i talk multiple times a day, every day. and as tony says, if it seems like an overreaction right now, then you're probably about where you need to be."}
{"original": "again, it's why the administration put out these guidelines for all of america, not just for certain areas, but for all of america to look at the ways that they can prevent transmission of disease in their communities. and i wouldn't fault any mayor, any governor, for what they're considering in their communities. but at the very least, limit social gatherings to less than 10, stay at home if you can from work and avoid non-essential travel."}
{"original": "let me ask you as a doctor, what's your message to adults over the age of 60 who are healthy and they say, i'm not worried about getting coronavirus?"}
{"original": "my message is to everyone: fifteen days, you can do anything for 15 days. stay at home as much as possible, limit the spread, we do not want to look like italy does two weeks from now."}
{"original": "i know you're a dad, i'm a mom — many parents have this question: can my kids have playdates, should they?"}
{"original": "we said no playdates. my wife just finished cancer treatment. she's at higher risk. i actually myself, have chronic medical conditions. i'm pre-diabetic, and it's just not worth the risk to the two of us, but it's not worth the risk of our kids being spreaders and potentially taking it to someone else."}
{"original": "correction: a previous version of this article misstated the number of deaths in italy."}
{"original": "the first 2020 democratic presidential primary is more than a year away, but candidates are already making history with the number of women in the running. new york sen. kirsten gillibrand's entrance into the race this week marked the first time that more than one woman competed for the party's nomination -- and still more are expected to join the fray."}
{"original": "what may be more remarkable -- and welcome -- is the variety within the field of women. the fact of their sex is not a consideration in their decision to run. there's not a 'women's lane,' says christina reynolds, vice president of communications for emily's list, which recruits and supports typically democratic female candidates. the upshot? having multiple women means that hopefully they will not only be judged by their gender, so we can talk about the candidates, says reynolds."}
{"original": "the 2020 democratic field could have as many as five women, including gillibrand. massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren was the first to join the race with the announcement of an exploratory committee on new year's eve, and has traveled to iowa and new hampshire. tulsi gabbard, a 37-year old lawmaker from hawaii and one of the first two female combat veterans ever to serve in congress, has also announced a bid."}
{"original": "california sen. kamala harris, the first south asian-american and second african-american woman elected to the upper chamber, is preparing a run and is currently on a book tour. minnesota sen. amy klobuchar is also seriously considering a campaign for the presidency."}
{"original": "in 2016, hillary clinton made history as the first woman presidential candidate nominated by a major political party, and she secured nearly 3 million more votes than donald trump in the general election, but she still lost her bid for the white house. if that election raised concerns about whether a woman can win the presidency (though there were certainly other significant factors in clinton's loss), the 2018 midterms--which sent a record number of women to congress--appears to have helped to put them to rest."}
{"original": "let's be crystal clear: today, women are the heart and soul of the democratic base and the fuel that is driving victories up and down the ballot, ilyse hogue, president of naral pro-choice america, recently wrote."}
{"original": "kelly dittmar, an associate professor at rutgers university and a scholar at the university's center for american women and politics, said that having multiple women candidates of different ages, race, and ideological positions would push back against the sort of homogeneous ideal type of a woman running for higher office."}
{"original": "i think that any time we have more women running, and greater diversity among those women, it just challenges those monolithic conceptions of what it means to be a woman candidate, dittmar said."}
{"original": "but being a woman does not mean that these candidates will be restricted to campaigning on women's issues, which are often narrowly defined by topics like paid family leave and sexual assault."}
{"original": "they're not all running on being a woman. they are running on their records and their visions, says rebecca katz, a new york-based democratic strategist who advised cynthia nixon's gubernatorial campaign in 2018."}
{"original": "i think it's important that we not relegate women to just one set of issues as though they aren't living full lives, senator harris told bustle."}
{"original": "harris promotes her experience as a prosecutor, which could become a key pitch of her presidential campaign. warren has built a national brand on economic issues, particularly consumer protection and wall street accountability. gillibrand has made combating sexual misconduct, particularly in the military, a hallmark of her political career since entering the senate."}
{"original": "dittmar said that the number of women in the race would not necessarily mean introduction of new topics to the national conversation, but would provide new perspectives."}
{"original": "it's more about the lens by which they're going to be viewing, talking about, and in fact creating their own policy agenda, she said."}
{"original": "those varying lenses have already been on display. during the confirmation hearings for supreme court justice brett kavanaugh, she asked, can you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body?"}
{"original": "klobuchar also received national attention for her questioning of kavanaugh. she discussed her own history as a child of an alcoholic father, and asked if kavanaugh had ever blacked out while drinking. kavanaugh retorted, no, have you? while male politicians often use their personal histories to make a point, klobuchar presented a vulnerability in her questioning which is often missing in politics."}
{"original": "when talking about economic disadvantages, warren has invoked the story about how her aunt helped her watch her two kids while she worked. otherwise she would have had to give up her career. without child care, i was a goner. and i know how lucky i was because so many working moms don't have an aunt bea who can fly in and help out, warren said at a keynote address to the national women's law center in october."}
{"original": "but just because more women are running for president doesn't mean the stereotypes and other standards have disappeared. indeed, the likeability factor that has long been a pesky measure disproportionately applied to women candidates, mustered its way to the national conversation early on."}
{"original": "warren, to whom critics have drawn misguided comparisons to clinton, took the issue head on. i hear women candidates are most likable in the quiet car! she tweeted from her seat on the acela."}
{"original": "gillibrand has also drawn comparisons to clinton, as another blonde senator from new york. clinton was often criticized as shrill and unlikeable, and female presidential candidates are already drawing unwelcome comparisons. dittmar said that comparing current women candidates to past ones -- and to each other -- showed how women are still considered outliers in the political field."}
{"original": "we never assume that mitt romney was john mccain, dittmar said, referring to the 2012 and 2008 republican candidates for president. we assume and allow greater individuality and separation among male candidates than among women candidates."}
{"original": "during a book tour stop at the view, harris was asked about the likeability factor."}
{"original": "despite a woman's role in the world, there are still certain myths of what a woman can and cannot do, she said."}
{"original": "sill, at least one candidate plans to lean into a gender archetype during her campaign: gillibrand is aiming to carve out a niche in the crowded field by embracing the gender issue. i'm going to run for president of the united states because as a young mom, i'm going to fight for other people's kids as hard as i would fight for my own, she said on the colbert show."}
{"original": "facebook, twitter and youtube have taken down a video in which president trump addressed his supporters as a mob of pro-trump protesters stormed the u.s. capitol wednesday afternoon. the sites said the video, in which mr. trump seemingly sympathized with protesters and repeated false claims about the election, contributed to ongoing violence and violated misinformation policies."}
{"original": "twitter and facebook went a step further and locked the president's accounts."}
{"original": "facebook ceo mark zuckerberg said thursday that its block would remain in place through the end of the president's term and potentially indefinitely."}
{"original": "we believe the risks of allowing the president to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great, zuckerberg said in a statement. therefore, we are extending the block we have placed on his facebook and instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete."}
{"original": "twitter froze the president's account for 12 hours and required him to take down the tweets. it said if he continues to violate twitter rules after that, the @realdonaldtrump account will be permanently suspended."}
{"original": "in the now-removed video, mr. trump told his supporters: i know your pain. i know you're hurt. we had an election that was stolen from us — a claim he continues to make even after his own attorney general confirmed there was no evidence of such fraud and courts threw out his lawsuits."}
{"original": "the president continued in the video, but you have to go home now. we have to have peace."}
{"original": "we have to have law and order. we have to respect our great people in law and order. we don't want anybody hurt, he said, before reverting to a message of defiance: ...there's never been a time like this where such a thing happened where they could take it away from all of us, from me, from you, from our country."}
{"original": "but we cant play into the hands of these people, he told his supporters. we love you. you're very special. you see what happens you see the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil. i know how you feel, but go home and go home in peace."}
{"original": "twitter first flagged the video and blocked mr. trump's followers from commenting, retweeting or liking the video, before taking it down and then locking his account for 12 hours. the president will have to remove the tweets in order for his account to be reinstated, twitter said."}

{"original": "in this episode of intelligence matters, michael morell speaks with will wechsler, the director of middle east programs at the atlantic council, about why the region is still of strategic importance to the u.s. wechsler discusses the perception in the middle east that the u.s. is withdrawing, the influx of young men in the region and the potential for more negotiations after the abraham accords."}
{"original": "widespread perception of u.s. withdrawal in the middle east: if i was going to put my finger on the single most important factor that explains the largest number of actions that are taking place in the region today, it is the widespread perception of american withdrawal. now, the reality is that unless you compare it to the high points of our occupation of iraq or afghanistan, in which case the numbers of troops have gone down from then. but if you compare it more historically, the united states really hasn't withdrawn. we still have a lot of military forces. our diplomatic presence is second to none, our intelligence efforts, our economic engagement. but this perception remains. the perception is not without merit. the perception comes from actions that consecutive u.s. presidents have taken. it comes from the rhetoric that one hears from the united states."}
{"original": "the most dangerous people in any society: when you look at the poor economic growth, when you look at the very high demographic growth, what you see is a region that has a lot of challenges ahead of it. there are very few things that are true for every country in the world. but one of those is that the most dangerous people in any society are young men. testosterone is a hell of a drug. there are lots of young men in this part of the world that don't have avenues to channel their innate aggression into productive, constructive forms. they are attracted to destructive avenues."}
{"original": "ties between israel and the gulf: what can be done right now are smaller achievements. what can be done are limited agreements on individual topics that can alleviate some palestinian misery. i think actually over the long run, the abraham accords and growing ties between israel and the gulf can actually help potentially set the stage for better negotiations when the circumstances are more opportune."}

{"original": "michael morell: welcome to intelligence matters, it is great to have you on the show."}
{"original": "will wechsler: thank you very much for having me."}
{"original": "michael morell: i should mention that i am on the board of the atlantic council, which is where you currently serve. full transparency here to my listeners. i think that's important. will, this episode is part of a series of episodes that we're doing between now and the inauguration on the key national security issues that we are facing as a nation and that president-elect biden will face. we started the conversation with h.r. mcmaster, who gave us an overview of what's going on in the world. we've now done episodes on both china and north korea. today with you, we turn to the middle east."}
{"original": "let me start by by asking you to explain why the middle east is still important to the united states, even though we are now, as a nation, energy independent?"}
{"original": "will wechsler: u.s. policies change and presidents change, but our interests remain stable or at least long lasting until there are deep changes. one of those deep changes that has happened is that the united states, thanks to a fracking revolution, has become an exporter of oil instead of an importer of oil. that's a real change and that has important implications. however, that change can be overstated as well."}
{"original": "what it really does mean is that, in the absolute worst scenarios, nobody can do to us what we did to japan before world war two, which is cut off our source of energy in context of a war. if worse comes to worse, we can go to autarchy. we can produce the energy that we need, at least the oil that we need, in the united states. that's a really good thing. but that doesn't mean that the united states is isolated from the world. it doesn't mean that the price of oil and energy and gas in the world doesn't affect the united states. the reality is that price is a global price and that price is not just dependent on us production. us energy producers do not give americans a discount for being americans. american consumers do not pay more for gas when it's produced in the united states. this is a global market."}
{"original": "the reality is that a very significant proportion of all that energy still comes out of the middle east. because of the nature of the sources of energy in the middle east. saudi arabia still is the swing producer and has very disproportionate impact on those global energy prices. we saw that recently when because of a dispute between saudi arabia and russia, saudi arabia decided to push energy prices into negative territory. something that we have never seen. thus, demonstrating their clout and their power in the world. these are realities in the world and realities that the united states policies have to take account for."}
{"original": "michael morell: are there other reasons why the middle east is important? one of our key allies, israel, sits right in the middle of it. sources of extremism, refugees. are there other reasons why we need to pay attention?"}
{"original": "will wechsler: absolutely. the counterterrorism challenges that we all face are at a low ebb at the moment. but we've seen them be at the low ebb previously and we've seen them get much larger and more powerful and more directly threatening before. there's no reason to expect that can't happen again. we have a real concern about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons in this region, especially iranian nuclear weapons."}
{"original": "we have a real concern about israel. israel is more secure and more prosperous than it's ever been before. but that doesn't mean that there are no threats to israel anymore and a lot of which come from iran and its proxies. we generally, ever since really the eisenhower administration, have acted as a status quo power, trying to return the region to the status quo when it's been upset in order to build a foundation for general security and general prosperity in the region. because we believe that overall serves us interests. we have a variety of those interests which aren't going away. despite the very popular view out in the american public- that's expressed by people on both sides of the aisle in the congress and almost everyone that was running for president that the united states- that we should do less in that part of the world. that doesn't mean that we should be doing nothing in that part of the world."}
{"original": "michael morell: do you find yourself more and more having to explain why the region is still important?"}
{"original": "will wechsler: absolutely. there's a lot of reasons for that and very understandable reasons for that. for the last 20 years, starting with george w. bush's war in iraq, the united states really changed its policy that it had been following for roughly five decades before that. instead of supporting the status quo, it became one of the most important threats to the status quo. on top of that, the failures and mistakes in the implementation of that policy has led a lot of people in the region and a lot of americans to ask why are we still in this part of the world? why should we be spending our treasure? why should we be having our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines die for this part of the world? what's really in it for us? the president of the united states, president trump, says this repeatedly, even when probably at the high point of his administration, at least in this part of the world, when he was announcing the recent abraham accords between the united states and the united arab emirates, from the oval office, he couldn't control himself. he went off script and said, 'i don't know why we have any of our forces there protecting the energy resources anymore.'"}
{"original": "michael morell: big picture. why has the middle east been such a mess for so long?"}
{"original": "will wechsler: there are lots of reasons why the region is unstable. the most important of which is that the countries themselves are not natural countries in terms of aligning towards ethnic, tribal, religious lines. they have a lot of internal incohesion to them. they are relatively new countries. many of them have not too distant colonial pasts, where there were lots of dysfunctions that were built into the colonial architecture that was created. the lines were drawn by european powers, and the minority groups were promoted by those colonial powers intentionally. that is still a destabilizing factor. almost all these countries are fundamentally nondemocratic, which in the short term sometimes might have some advantages when it comes to stability, but over the longer term is inherently unstable."}
{"original": "michael morell: there seems to be a long-term struggle with governance in many of the countries in the region."}
{"original": "will wechsler: indeed, many of the leaders did not for many decades see their chief objective as improving the well-being of their populations. that's changed in some of the countries and the region. it will have to change if the region is going to become less stable over time. but when you look at the poor economic growth, when you look at the very high demographic growth, what you see is as a region that has a lot of challenges ahead of it. there are very few things that are true for every country in the world. but one of those is that the most dangerous people in any society are young men. testosterone is a hell of a drug. there are lots of young men in this part of the world that don't have avenues to channel their innate aggression into productive, constructive forms. they are attracted to destructive avenues."}
{"original": "michael morell: how important is the strategic competition between iran and its sunni rivals with regard to stability in the region?"}
{"original": "will wechsler: it's very important right now. i can take one step back. i believe that today and actually for the last 5 or 10 years, there are a lot of different factors that are affecting trends in the region, lots of different micro factors that affect individual countries, lots of local rivalries. but if i was going to put my finger on the single most important factor that explains the largest number of actions that are taking place in the region today, it is the widespread perception of american withdrawal."}
{"original": "now, the reality is that unless you compare it to the high points of our occupation of iraq or afghanistan, in which case the numbers of troops have gone down from then. but if you compare it more historically, the united states really hasn't withdrawn. we still have a lot of military forces. our diplomatic presence is second to none, our intelligence efforts, our economic engagement. but this perception remains. the perception is not without merit. the perception comes from actions that consecutive us presidents have taken. it comes from the rhetoric that one hears from the united states. if you're a country in the region whose security architecture has depended for many decades on the united states, are you going to depend on that in the immediate future? of course. but looking ahead, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, these countries are not going to bet the existence of their country on the united states staying the course as it has. they already experienced this. their fathers, in some cases, experienced this when the british left in the early 70s after promising that they would not leave."}
{"original": "this widespread perception exists and that perception itself is creating a vacuum that other actors are moving into. china is moving in economically, politically, to a degree. but not yet from a geostrategic point of view, china is very actively not trying to take the united states position, and they would much rather free ride off of our security guarantees for as long as as possible. but they're an important actor to note."}
{"original": "but aside from them, there are three other non-arab powers that all have historical legacy aspirations in the region and have all been moving very actively, very aggressively into the region. those are iran, turkey, and russia. all of whom have advanced their position quite significantly and materially in the last number of years. if you look back historically, when any of those actors have tried to move into this region, they've had to confront the historic arab powers in the region, those powers in cairo, in damascus and in baghdad. the leaders in those cities were the ones that had the ear of the arab street. they had the armies. they had disproportionate interest, disproportionate power, not only in their countries, but around the region. all of those places are at very weak moments in time right now. cairo, damascus, and baghdad are unfortunately each closer to being a failed state than they are to being regional leaders."}
{"original": "the historical european powers with interests in the region are similarly either not capable or not willing largely to play any types of roles with the exception of france. but even france is limited in what it can do and wants to do, mainly to lebanon and to some degree in north africa. what's left is a coalition that should have emerged a while ago, but for a number of reasons didn't. but it's finally emerging now between states, israel and the gulf, that have largely been interested in their own defense, but not been larger regional players. they are coming together now to position themselves to be able to protect the region against massive encroachment from these non-arab powers. quite frankly, that's a good thing because a region that ends up being dominated by iran or turkey or russia is not a region that serves our interests."}
{"original": "michael morell: let's start with iran- its nuclear program, its regional ambitions, its malign behavior. how would you think about a strategy of dealing with the iranians?"}
{"original": "will wechsler: i think the american strategy of dealing with the iranians has to look really hard and learn the correct lessons from both the obama administration and the trump administration. in my view, the obama administration was absolutely right to consider diplomacy with iran on its nuclear program. the results of that diplomacy contributed indisputably to positive outcomes on the nuclear file. but there were some weaknesses with that approach. one of the key weaknesses was the division between the united states and its traditional friends and partners in the region, in particular israel and the gulf. a sustained approach to diplomacy has to bring those partners along with it rather than being perceived to be cutting them out. the trump administration took a very different approach to this, a maximum pressure approach to to iran. they got out of the nuclear deal formally, which i think was was a mistake. i don't think it was a mistake to add sanctions on iran at all. in fact, the nuclear deal very specifically allowed for such sanctions to be increased on iran as long as those sanctions weren't on the nuclear file. unfortunately, iran has a lot of other malign behavior in the region that merit sanctions. but the trump administration decided to go a different path."}
{"original": "the big strategic problem with the trump administration's approach was that internally it never really came to a conclusion about what the purpose of its maximum pressure campaign was. at the outset, there were groups in the trump administration, some groups that just wanted to increase sanctions in order to make it more difficult for iran to conduct its malign behaviors. there were other groups in the administration, i include the president of the united states in this group, that wanted to increase sanctions in order to get to a 'better negotiated outcome.' there were other groups that really saw this as an opportunity to promote regime change. unfortunately, the devil is in the details. the way one goes about constructing a sanctions regime differs depending on which outcome you desire. the way that the sanction regime was constructed appears to be most in line with the people who wanted regime change and not in line with people who wanted to facilitate additional negotiations. what i think we should do now, what i hope an incoming biden administration does, is opens the door for diplomacy, but use the leverage that the trump administration gives it with the existing sanctions to try to drive a hard bargain that would bring our partners along with it."}
{"original": "our partners in the region, the arab countries on the western side of the of the persian gulf and israel, they only one year ago all sent emissaries rushing to washington because they were terrified that the maximum pressure campaign was driving them in a direction of a regional war with them on the front lines. they want to de-escalate as well. so i hope the goal is de-escalation. i hope the goal is confidence building measures. i'm a little skeptical, quite frankly, about whether or not a new nuclear agreement can be reached. i think that iran has turned much more hard line. in the interim, windows of opportunity open and close for such things. i hope i'm wrong on that. but i don't see a downside in trying."}
{"original": "michael morell: second issue is extremism, isis in syria and iraq, and al-qaida in syria. what should the u.s. role be here?"}
{"original": "will wechsler: the salafi jihadist terrorist groups are different from other kinds of terrorist groups, are different from other kind of islamic terrorist groups, are different from other kinds of sunni islamic terrorist groups. we find that with terrorist organizations that have this particular kind of ideology, wherever they are able to achieve a degree of physical sanctuary where they believe that they can act with impunity, they have a one hundred percent record of doing external attacks. that's just a sad reality. our goal should be to deny them that kind of sanctuary."}
{"original": "the united states has tried a lot of different approaches to achieving that goal. we've tried invading and occupying countries. we've tried dropping hell fires from the sky to take out high value targets. what we've learned is that the most effective way of combating these kinds of terrorist adversaries is indirectly, is working by, with, and through the local actors who can themselves conduct these kinds of counterterrorism missions. sometimes these are through military channels. sometimes through intelligence channels. sometimes these are through law enforcement channels. sometimes that effort involves the united states doing nothing more than passing information and allowing our friends and partners to take action. but sometimes it takes more. sometimes it takes efforts to equip these partners, to train these partners, to advise these partners, to assist them in what they do and sometimes even to accompany them on their missions."}
{"original": "all of these are different fundamentally than direct action, where the united states has to do it on its own and and has to do the finish against these terrorist actors. what i hope is that the united states doesn't look at the world as it is today where al-qaida and the islamic state have, thanks to great work that people like you were doing for quite a long period of time, has been diminished. and imagine that current state will be the state in the future. as long as there are underlying sunni grievances in so many of these places, we will find young men who will be attracted to this salafi jihadist ideology and we'll need to work with our partners to disrupt their external attacks. at the same time, we need to do the kind of work to prevent the extremism from catching on. helping our partners change their educational system, provide more economic opportunities. here, the united states isn't the the largest actor, the most important actor at all. we're not going to be the ones that are going to win the ideological battle for the heart of of islam. but we can do things to avoid making it more difficult for our partners, and we can assist our partners. that's necessary."}
{"original": "michael morell: next is the two-sided coin. that is mohammed bin salman in saudi arabia. one side of the coin being the reformer, the other side of the coin being the autocrat."}
{"original": "how should the united states should approach saudi arabia?"}
{"original": "will wechsler: we can't write off saudi arabia, let's just say that out front. we have interests. there are a number of countries around the world where there are challenges to working with them. turkey is another one. it'd be a mistake to write off any of these countries. i include saudi arabia in that category. however, there are real challenges with with mohammed bin salman. if i can take one step back, right now, saudi arabia, no matter who's running saudi arabia, they really have three existential threats. i don't use the word existential lightly. the first threat is from a transition in leadership that is not yet finished. saudi arabia, like it or not, is a monarchy. anybody who has watched game of thrones knows the particular dynamics that come into effect when a transition in the monarchy is not finished. this is a particularly challenging transition as compared to other transitions that have happened in saudi arabia, because it's a transition to a new branch of the family. it's a transition to a new generation in the family. it's a transition in the fundamental way of doing business in saudi arabia from a very consultative, collaborative model to a more centralized model. that's the first existential challenge. until that's complete, that will continue."}
{"original": "the other challenges, the need for reform on virtually every aspect of saudi society. this one, mohammed bin salman has recognized in a way that none of his predecessors had. that's a really good thing. it's a really challenging set of problems that they have economically, socially, politically and so forth. when franklin roosevelt met with mohammed bin salman's grandfather, i think saudi arabia had about three million people and now it has roughly ten times that. saudi arabia is a rich country, but it's a country that has lots of poor people in it. we've already talked about the challenges of having young men that are aimless. there's a massive need for reform in saudi arabia."}
{"original": "the third one is iran. if you're sitting in riyadh as compared to 20 years ago, you see iran vastly expanding its placement and access and encircling you. it trying to- whether it's in iran, iraq, syria or in yemen- trying to build in yemen the kind of threat against saudi arabia from the south that they've been able to build over the decades against israel from its north. so these are really huge issues. the person that has to deal with them, mohammed bin salman, is somebody who was not trained all his life to deal with these problems. most americans know the story of the murder of jamal khashoggi. that was a horrible crime. in the old line in war and peace, 'it was worse than a crime. it was a mistake.' it really set saudi arabia back, but it was not isolated. it was the end to a year and a half of poor, rash decision makings by mohammed bin salman on a series of of issues. it wasn't like mohammed bin salman was inventing problems, but the the way that he chose to deal with these problems made the individual problem worse. one hopes that mbs, if he is able to move from crown prince to king, that he has learned from that experience because we could all be living in a world where he's going to be the king for many decades to come and our interests will remain there for quite a long time."}
{"original": "if he has not learned from that experience that he's had, then we're in for a very bad situation."}
{"original": "michael morell: i have two more issues i want to cover. the first is the israeli-palestinian issue. how do you think about that?"}
{"original": "will wechsler: there is not a very high probability of a solution for the israeli-palestinian problem today. the only real solution, the only lasting solution is a two state solution. that's really clear to anybody who's looked at it. unless you want to imagine solutions that are really horrific. the challenge is that the circumstances are not set at the moment for those kinds of negotiations to continue. i suspect it's going to require generational change. we've had three u.s. presidents in a row, bill clinton, condi rice under george w. bush, and john kerry under barack obama, who spent a wildly disproportionate amount of their time trying to get to a holistic solution to this problem. all of which have failed. i don't think a fourth attempt is going to do any better in these circumstances. what can be done right now are smaller achievements. what can be done are limited agreements on individual topics that can alleviate some palestinian misery. i think over the long run, the abraham accords and growing ties between israel and the gulf can actually help potentially set the stage for better negotiations when the circumstances are more opportune."}
{"original": "michael morell: what's the one piece of advice that you would give to president-elect biden on the region?"}
{"original": "will wechsler: the one piece of advice is to really understand how much the perception of american withdrawal is affecting the region and how much his personal relationships with leaders there will be able to impact their continued thinking on that subject."}
{"original": "michael morell: will, thank you so much for joining us. it's been a real education on the region, which i think is absolutely necessary at this time."}

{"original": "curtis lovelace was a very hard working kid, smart kid, said gough."}

{"original": "i mean quincy, illinois, doesn't produce a ton of all-big ten players, gough noted."}
{"original": "he wasn't just any player. lovelace, who studied business administration, was considered one of the top offensive linemen in the big ten -- a team captain who lead the university of illinois to the big ten championship his senior year."}
{"original": "was two-time all-big ten, even got a look in free agent camp in the nfl, gough explained. had a bad knee injury, which, not sure if he woulda made it or not, but that certainly didn't help the situation. but being a smart kid curtis already had other goals in mind."}
{"original": "while at school, curtis started a long distance relationship with cory didriksen. they met in high school, but only started dating when they left for college. she was studying communications at the university of iowa."}
{"original": "she just had a perfect smile, cory's mother, marty didriksen, told cbs affiliate khqa. and she just smiled at everyone. and she just did stuff."}
{"original": "cory was vibrant, dynamic. a little bit of stubbornness, and she was a pistol and i loved her for that. i think that was her most endearing quality, said friend steve belko."}

{"original": "in 1991, just one year after graduation, they were married. belko was curt's best man and dobrzynski was cory's bridesmaid."}
{"original": "it was one of the best days, you know, in our lives, said belko."}
{"original": "cory was beautiful. it was a great night. they were very happy. the pictures you know, you could see on their faces. whether it was cutting the cake or dancing or walking around and talking to people. it was a magical night, dobrzynski reminisced."}
{"original": "with cory by his side, curtis lovelace had grand plans. he attended law school and eventually became an assistant state's attorney in the city they both loved, quincy."}
{"original": "what did cory want to do with her life? ... what were her dreams? maher asked dobrzynski."}
{"original": "cory was all about family. she had a great childhood growing up, she replied. she wanted the big family. ...the happy marriage."}
{"original": "that dream came true in 1993, when their first child, lyndsay, was born. they would later have three sons: logan, lincoln, and larson."}
{"original": "she was a beautiful person, lyndsay lovelace said of her mother."}
{"original": "lyndsay, now 22, told khqa reporter jenny dreasler how she and her mother loved listening to the music group abba."}
{"original": "we would just have girl moments and just dance around and sing 'dancing queen.' i still listen to them because it brings me so much joy from that, she said."}
{"original": "lyndsay's dad was a man on the move. in 2005, he opened up his own law firm while still at the state's attorney's office. years later, he left to concentrate on his own practice. and, if his schedule wasn't busy enough, lovelace was elected president of the school board. he became a captain in the illinois national guard, and an adjunct professor at quincy university."}
{"original": "he definitely was a pillar of this community, no question about it, gough remarked."}
{"original": "but friends say with power, came ego."}
{"original": "i just felt he kinda started to talk down to me more and more each time i saw him, said schrader."}
{"original": "he became arrogant more and more, yes, belko said. there was a little bit of holier than thou. ...maybe you were entitled to this living. i think he lost friends over time because of that."}
{"original": "the situation at home had also been changing. while curtis had spent years focused on his professional life, the long hours away from cory and the kids were starting to take a toll on their personal life."}
{"original": "from what we learned now, and he eventually admitted, they had a volatile relationship, said gough."}
{"original": "neighbors around the lovelace house on kentucky street say that in the months leading up to her death, they had heard loud and contentious arguments between cory and curtis. by many accounts, both were heavy drinkers. and in this small community, it was known that at times there was a tremendous amount of turmoil in their home."}
{"original": "she suffered from bulimia. this is something her family has admitted, dreasler said. and the rumors started coming out. ...known alcoholism. the community knew that too. there've been people who've even told me ... i saw her out drinking here or out drinking there. people knew that she had an alcohol problem, but i don't think that they knew to the extent."}
{"original": "cory and curtis lovelace steve belko"}
{"original": "amazingly, curtis and cory managed to keep their problems from their closest friends, like belko, who years before, had moved away from their small town."}
{"original": "was there a point in time where any of you started to see things changing between the two of them? maher asked the friends."}
{"original": "no indication that there was trouble coming up? maher asked."}
{"original": "i never had any, belko replied."}
{"original": "cory was a great person, very confident, she had everything under control. and she wasn't one to you know whine or complain, dobrzynski said. she could handle it."}
{"original": "but everything fell apart on valentine's day 2006, when belko got a call from curtis's father that cory had died."}
{"original": "he said, 'listen i got some bad news.' ...and i just couldn't believe it. no, that doesn't happen. she's my age. she's healthy. this just doesn't come from nowhere, belko said. something's wrong. there was no doubt something is terribly wrong."}
{"original": "on feb. 14, 2006, love was in the crisp winter air of quincy, illinois. at 1869 kentucky, it was a school day and cory lovelace would usually have her hands full."}
{"original": "cory was a stay at home mom, gough explained. she was always hustling, always trying to get the kids wrangled around and to where they needed to be."}
{"original": "that morning seemed like so many others. according to curtis lovelace, cory helped get the kids ready. they had breakfast and jumped in dad's car. it was 8:15 a.m."}
{"original": "curtis then took the three oldest children to school, gough said. they left the youngest, the 4-year-old, there."}
{"original": "and little 4-year-old larson went upstairs to see his mom."}
{"original": "went in and he said that he said her name and he thought he poked her. but she didn't answer, dreasler explained. so he ... sat and waited for his dad to get home."}
{"original": "then when he got back, the youngest was still there ... said something that he couldn't wake his mom up, said gough."}
{"original": "by then, it was about 9 a.m."}
{"original": "curt went upstairs to use the restroom and glanced back in the bedroom and saw something wasn't right. went in to see cory, tried to shake her. and nothing, said belko."}
{"original": "that was the moment a normal valentine's day morning turned into a mystery. behavior turned suddenly strange, starting with curtis lovelace."}
{"original": "took the youngest to cory's mother's house. gave the youngest child to cory's mother and said, 'cory's dead' and left, gough said. the first call was not to 911. the first call was not to the paramedics. the first call was his boss, the state's attorney."}
{"original": "still strikes you as odd, maher noted."}
{"original": "who walks over to their mother-in-law's house, gives them their youngest ... and says, 'your daughter's dead, here's my child. take care of him,' maher commented."}
{"original": "the whole scenario was bizarre, said gough."}
{"original": "people do process grief differently, sure. if it was my wife, i think i'd have called 911 screaming and ranting and trying to perform cpr, which he didn't do, said gough."}
{"original": "the grim details of the day would be embedded in the minds of those who were there. e.m.t cole miller was among the first on the scene."}
{"original": "she was laying in the bed and her arms were drawn up by her chest, he explained, holding up his arms to show how cory's were positioned. and i went in there to check for signs of life, checked her carotid pulse in her neck, and then checked her wrist and saw that it was cold and stiff."}
{"original": "it was just surreal, said dobrzynski."}
{"original": "when i did find out i was very shocked, said schrader."}
{"original": "what happened in the house that morning, when it happened -- just how long cory lovelace had been dead -- would be questions that would haunt a town and destroy a family."}
{"original": "she'd been dead long enough that there was no need to start cpr. it wouldn't do any good, said miller."}
{"original": "quincy police detective jeff baird would not speak to 48 hours. but that day he did speak with curtis, who told his version of events -- a morning curtis swears to police and to friends, cory was still very much alive."}
{"original": "what did he say happened? maher asked steve belko."}
{"original": "that cory had been ill the night before ... had thrown up and wanted some tylenol and he got her some, he explained. apparently she did come down to help. he told me he just remembers her at the bottom of the steps, they walked out and he took the kids to school."}
{"original": "according to curtis, his wife cory was not feeling well that valentine's day morning. she came down the stairs and sat down for a while. detective baird said that three of the children also told him they saw their mother alive that morning."}
{"original": "he interviewed the three oldest children. those interviews were not recorded, video or audio. he just took notes and then turned in a report in which he spoke to the three oldest children individually, without their father being there. and they all told him they had seen their mother that morning, said gough."}
{"original": "why is the time cory lovelace died so critical? ask a man who deals in death for a living, deputy coroner james keller. that valentine's day morning, he was there to transport cory's body."}
{"original": "upon entering the bedroom, i notice the female lying on the bed on her back with her hands kind of in an upright position, keller explained."}
{"original": "can you show me? maher asked."}
{"original": "hands kind of above her, he said, holding his arms up, elbows bent, in front of his chest. kind of this direction here ... a very odd position."}
{"original": "however long cory lovelace had been dead, to keller it certainly appeared that medical rigor mortis had set in -- a process he says usually takes close to 12 hours."}
{"original": "she was in the state of full rigor, said keller."}
{"original": "almost like a mannequin? maher asked."}
{"original": "keller was told that cory saw the kids off to school, handing one a valentine's class project. and someone on the scene told keller cory lovelace had died in the morning."}
{"original": "keller's response to that was, what day?"}
{"original": "did it make any sense to you that they were saying it was that morning? maher asked."}
{"original": "it did not, keller said. it just didn't seem to add up."}
{"original": "over the years, james keller has learned one undeniable truth of his trade: the dead do speak."}
{"original": "a body always tells a story the way you find them, he said."}
{"original": "what is the story that cory's body was telling you? maher asked."}
{"original": "that she had passed earlier that prior evening or day, keller replied."}
{"original": "ten to 12 hours earlier, possibly?"}
{"original": "but that medical assessment of time of death wasn't matching what curtis and the kids were saying -- that cory has been alive that morning."}
{"original": "it was just not what she was telling. it was just not what she was saying, said keller."}
{"original": "did you tell anybody about that afterwards and as the inquisition went on? maher asked."}
{"original": "there's numerous people ... the coroner gary hamilton, he replied. ... everybody had some reservations, maybe concerns."}
{"original": "james keller was a deputy coroner at the time, second to sitting coroner gary hamilton, who was also at the lovelace home. an autopsy, including toxicology test, was conducted the day after cory was found dead, and hamilton signed off. the cause of death was undetermined."}
{"original": "well 'undetermined' ... if you don't have a cause ... leaving it 'undetermined' was the right thing to do, said keller."}
{"original": "despite the odd position of cory's arms and despite an unexplained cut on her lip, two days later, at her mother's request, cory lovelace was cremated and quincy police officially closed the investigation."}
{"original": "and life went on? maher asked gough."}
{"original": "eight years would pass, and then a curious cop followed a hunch."}
{"original": "you had a detective in the quincy police department, adam gibson, gough explained."}
{"original": "and lookin' at the photos ... and with -- with cory's body bein' in that condition, it just -- it just didn't make sense to me, said det. gibson."}
{"original": "a fresh look at the case"}
{"original": "within six months after the mysterious death of his wife, cory, on valentine's day 2006, curtis lovelace rekindled his love life and began dating a student in a class he taught at quincy university. the woman, named erica, was eight years his junior. they married two years later, but she and his then-14-year-old daughter, lyndsay, didn't get along. lyndsay became estranged from her father."}
{"original": "lyndsay, apparently, didn't have a place in that family. why, i don't know, said steve belko."}
{"original": "lyndsay then moved out of her father's house and in with her grandmother marty didriksen, cory's mom."}
{"original": "curt chose his second wife over his daughter, said belko."}
{"original": "marriage number two fell apart in 2013."}
{"original": "but once again, curtis lovelace didn't stay single for long. he got married for a third time months after his divorce in 2013, this time to his current wife, christine, whom he had known in high school and reconnected with years later."}
{"original": "christine and curtis lovelace christine lovelace"}
{"original": "he is a funny, charming, sweet, kind, compassionate, wonderful husband, she told 48 hours. we're actually best friends."}
{"original": "while the end of 2013 marked a new beginning for curtis and christine ..."}
{"original": "we'd go on dates not typical of romantic date nights -- eat fried chicken, go across the bridge to missouri, have hot fudge sundaes with extra cherries, she said."}
{"original": "... it was around that same time that a newly-promoted detective at the quincy police department, adam gibson, took a fresh look at cory's death."}
{"original": "sometimes it takes fresh eyes to see things, said det. gibson."}
{"original": "and i was at the office ... just reading old case files, and the lovelace case popped into my head, he said."}
{"original": "the more det. gibson read about the 8-year-old case, the more he was intrigued."}
{"original": "what in that file made you say, 'huh, i'm gonna go find the pictures and the hard copy of this file? maureen maher asked the detective."}
{"original": "just the general description of the position of her hands, he replied."}
{"original": "and when you saw the pictures, what was your first reaction?"}
{"original": "it did not appear to me that could've been a natural death, said det. gibson."}
{"original": "a drawing by artist bill beard of a graphic photo of cory lovelace"}
{"original": "the pictures show cory's body in bed - lifeless, but with her arms bent at the elbows and bizarrely frozen in the air."}
{"original": "that didn't really make sense, and there was no real explanation for 'em, said det. gibson."}
{"original": "gibson consulted king county coroner james keller, who was the deputy coroner in 2006."}
{"original": "it bothered me for years, said keller."}
{"original": "so when you found out that detective gibson was moving forward, what was your reaction? maher asked."}
{"original": "i think it -- it is definitely time to open, keller replied."}
{"original": "detective gibson kept investigating the old case secretly, out of the public eye. he consulted the original pathologist, dr. jessica bowman, who had ruled the death undetermined. bowman told gibson she would no longer participate in the case, but sent him for another opinion to another pathologist she knew in chicago, dr. shaku teas."}
{"original": "she said basically that she saw nothing suspicious about the death, det. gibson said of dr. tea's ruling."}
{"original": "so why wasn't that the end of it for you? i mean, you have dr. bowman who says undetermined, you have now dr. shaku teas, who is accredited and is telling you, 'look it's undetermined, i don't see a problem with it,' maher asked the detective."}
{"original": "because i didn't believe that the information that dr. teas had given was credible to what i already knew, he replied."}
{"original": "so det. gibson sought yet another opinion. enter dr. jane turner, an assistant medical examiner in st. louis."}
{"original": "what do you remember as the first thing that struck you about that file? was there anything in there that you looked at and said, 'well, that's interesting,' maher asked dr. turner."}
{"original": "yes. it was the scene photographs ... the presence of rigor mortis and the position of the hands is unusual ... the hands weren't resting on a surface. they were almost suspended in air, which tells me that there was ... an object that had been there previously that had been removed, she replied."}
{"original": "could you show me, put ... my arms in the position that you saw cory lovelace's body in while she was laying down still in the bed? maher asked dr. turner."}
{"original": "so she was on her back. and her arms were like this. a little bit lower than that, she replied, positioning maher's arms, as shown in the photo above."}
{"original": "and-- if they were stuck in this position, they're in rigor-- what does that tell you at that point? maher asked."}
{"original": "well, that more time has passed than the witness stated, dr. turner replied."}
{"original": "the witness being curtis lovelace, who said he had talked to his wife less than an hour before finding her dead."}
{"original": "in my report, i stated 10 to 12 hours. rigor mortis develops maximally at 12 hours. and with her arms in that position, which -- with the -- the emergency responders coming in, they were still in that position, suggests to me that she was in full rigor, said dr. turner."}
{"original": "based on the photos, the autopsy report and police reports, dr. turner pinpointed the cause of death: suffocation at the hands of another."}
{"original": "what did you determine would have caused the suffocation? maher asked."}
{"original": "well, with the position of the hands, it suggests that there was an object between her hands and her body. ...and it appears that there is a pillow missing, dr. turner replied. so i suppose that a pillow was used to suffocate her."}
{"original": "while det. gibson had a new timeline and a cause of death, he also had one big problem. remember, the three oldest lovelace children insisted they saw their mother alive that morning, sitting on the stairs."}
{"original": "the one thing i do know is, the science of cory lovelace doesn't match that story, said gibson."}
{"original": "gibson believes the children may have simply been mistaken. maybe that's because they weren't interviewed by the original detective, jeff baird, until two days after their mother's death. but if curtis lovelace did kill his wife the night before, as dr. turner believes, what was his motive?"}
{"original": "was there a life insurance policy, maher ask gough."}
{"original": "...he said there was no life insurance, he replied."}
{"original": "i have not heard that, said gough."}
{"original": "so what's the motive? what does he gain? maher asked."}
{"original": "...he told one of the witnesses that their last 90 days of their marriage hadn't been good, gough replied."}
{"original": "people fight and argue all the time, maher noted to det. gibson."}
{"original": "how did it lead to murder in this situation? maher asked."}
{"original": "that's the million-dollar question, det. gibson replied."}
{"original": "a new detective ... found a doctor to give him the answer he was looking for. there's not one bit of evidence ... that cory ... was murdered, said christine lovelace."}
{"original": "how certain are you now that curtis lovelace murdered his wife, cory?"}
{"original": "i'm 100 percent certain. the science tells me that, said det. gibson."}
{"original": "in august 2014, eight years after the death of cory lovelace, curtis lovelace was leaving his law office at lunchtime when police confronted him - and arrested him for his wife's murder."}
{"original": "nobody had any idea that this was, this was happening. none of the local media, said khqa reporter jenny dreasler."}
{"original": "the same day as a grand jury indictment comes down, he's arrested in broad daylight, cuffed and stuffed right outside his law office and taken down to booking, said local journalist bob gough."}
{"original": "a good friend who works for a news station in quincy, he texted me ... said 'christine, curt's been arrested for cory's murder,' christine lovelace told 48 hours. i said,'that makes no sense, cory was not murdered.'"}
{"original": "there was nothing to prepare us for this, it was probably worst day of my life, she said."}
{"original": "the former golden boy would spend the next 17 months in jail, held on $5 million bond."}
{"original": "i was a little stunned, friend steve belko said. he looked old, haggard. something i'd never seen before."}
{"original": "curtis lovelace pleaded not guilty, awaiting his trial until just over three weeks ago."}
{"original": "a decade after cory lovelace's death, the murder trial of her husband was about to begin at the adams county courthouse. after hearing all the evidence, it may come down to just one question for the jury: do they believe cory's children, who say they saw their mother alive that morning? or do they believe two medical examiners who insist the science says she was killed the night before?"}
{"original": "some of the jurors who would decide curtis' fate spoke with 48 hours."}
{"original": "and by show of hands, how many of you knew curtis lovelace and his family or knew of them prior to this? maher asked the group. four of the six jurors raised their hands. ok, so a majority of who are here."}
{"original": "is it the trial of century in quincy? maher asked gough. yes, he replied."}
{"original": "and why is that, just because of who he is?"}
{"original": "yes. absolutely, gough replied. i mean, bigger they come, the harder they fall."}
{"original": "quincy was consumed with this trial on social media and in the coffee shops."}
{"original": "i don' think the case should've been brought to start with ... all they got is circumstantial evidence, no smoking guns, a resident told 48 hours."}
{"original": "the prosecution laid out its dramatic case -- that curtis lovelace smothered his wife, cory, the mother of his four children, with a pillow the night before valentine's day."}
{"original": "jurors heard from world-renowned pathologist dr. michael baden and dr. jane turner. they both testified that cory had to have died the night before."}
{"original": "it's the whole picture -- she had drying artifact of her lips. she had drying artifact of her eyes. again, something that develops with the passage of time after death, dr. turner told maher. rigor mortis develops maximally at 12 hours. and with her arms in that position ... suggests to me that she was in full rigor."}
{"original": "the prosecution uses dr. turner to explain how a cut found during the autopsy on cory's lip was caused by her being suffocated."}
{"original": "there's a bruise on the inside of the lip and -- and with it a laceration. and that's from blunt force trauma. so some forceful pressure was applied to the mouth, she explained."}
{"original": "but then, in this battle of the experts, the defense counters with their own, dr. george nichols. he says cory most likely died of causes related to an enlarged liver due to drinking and her bulimia."}
{"original": "i think she died as a result of natural diseases related to her liver disease. but the corroborative tests to confirm that were not performed, so i cannot come to that conclusion scientifically, said dr. nichols."}
{"original": "my opinion is, there's no proof that this woman was murdered, he said."}
{"original": "and as to dr. turner's claim that the degree of rigor mortis shows she had to be dead 10 to 12 hours?"}
{"original": "as i said repeatedly in there, rigor mortis does not occur at a specific, fixed time. there's huge variability from person to person, dr. nichols stated."}
{"original": "further, he said, dr. turner was only working from photos -- she never actually saw cory's body in person."}
{"original": "and as to that single cut on cory's lip? nonsense, says dr. nichols."}
{"original": "that's eliminated, because she does not have sufficient injuries to the inner surface of her lips, he told 48 hours."}
{"original": "but she did have that one injury, a 48 hours producer pointed out."}
{"original": "one. not multiple. how many teeth do i have? dr. nichols said, showing his teeth. ok? each of those is capable of making at least one, if not more, injuries to the inside of my lips as i'm fighting back against someone who's holding a pillow over me."}
{"original": "if the testimony of the dueling pathologists had jurors scratching their heads, it was in stark contrast to the testimony of the lovelace boys, which clearly pulled at their hearts."}
{"original": "the kids will be in my mind probably forever, said juror theresa tarr."}
{"original": "the prosecution called the youngest son, larson, who was 4 years old at the time of his mother's death, who recounts his story about poking mommy to wake her up. juror theresa tarr was struck by the image."}
{"original": "it was an emotional testimony, she said. thinking that a four-year-old mighta been pokin' his dead mom, it was very emotional."}
{"original": "my children have dealt with enough pain in their life for them to feel any kind of pain, an emotional christine lovelace said."}
{"original": "then, the defense called the two older sons, logan, now 18, and dressed in his military uniform, and lincoln, now 17. a normally stoic curtis breaks down when each of the two older boys takes the stand, recounting how curtis came to school that day to tell them their mother had died."}
{"original": "news report: this is the first day we saw any real emotion out of curtis lovelace as he broke down in tears as his two oldest sons took the stand."}
{"original": "both boys emphatically tell the court, they are 100 percent certain they saw their mother alive that morning. logan said he even remembers asking his ailing mom if he could stay home from school to take care of her."}
{"original": "there are people who have accused the kids of lying, that's not who the kids are, christine lovelace said. kids will share experiences as they know them, not what they're told to."}
{"original": "and then came lyndsay, the final key testimony for the prosecution. she was 12 at the time her mother died, and now she's the star witness at her father's trial."}
{"original": "so how important is lyndsay's testimony? maher asked gough."}
{"original": "oh, it's critical. it's the whole ballgame, he replied."}
{"original": "up until this trial, lyndsay had always insisted she saw her mother alive that morning. but now, at age 22, and under oath in the courtroom, she says can't be sure about what she remembers from that day."}
{"original": "and i've had a long time to think about that and it's almost frustrating not to remember, because you want to, she said in an interview with dreasler."}
{"original": "and yet, immediately afterwards, defense attorneys show a videotape made just two years earlier, where lyndsay tells det. adam gibson she absolutely remembers seeing her mom alive that morning."}
{"original": "in the end, if you can't, you can't remember, she said. ...and just say, 'i'm sorry. it was 10 years ago i can't remember.'"}
{"original": "were you surprised by lyndsay's testimony when she got up and said, now i don't remember. i can't definitively say anything? maher asked det. gibson."}
{"original": "yeah. you never know what anybody is gonna say, he replied."}
{"original": "lyndsay changing her story, the testimony of her brothers, and the dueling medical experts -- it all had the jurors heads spinning."}
{"original": "she didn't remember, and that, to me, was very hard. because two years earlier, she had given a statement to adam gibson, that she remembered a lot, said jury foreperson adam buss."}
{"original": "in the course of deliberations, i changed my mind, said juror mike hayden."}
{"original": "you answer one question. but it spawns another question, maher noted."}
{"original": "on feb. 4 2016, closing arguments begin. curtis lovelace, who has prosecuted cases in this very courthouse, walked in for the conclusion of his own murder trial. his new wife, christine, says the trial has taken a toll -- especially on curtis' sons."}
{"original": "we know that everyday the focus is bringing their father and my husband home, she said. it's so cumbersome to be raising a family while we're still doing all that we're doing. we're managing, it's difficult but we're managing."}
{"original": "for det. adam gibson, who started it all, the stakes couldn't be any higher."}
{"original": "i want people to remember cory outta all this ... she deserves to have her day just like everybody else, he told maher. the jury will decide if somebody took that life from her."}
{"original": "and you'll live with the decision, whatever it is? maher asked."}
{"original": "whatever it is, det. gibson replied."}
{"original": "but that decision may not be so easy."}
{"original": "the length of time that it takes for rigor mortis to set in, i think i've heard it a half a dozen different ways, so i'm not sure. and if i'm not sure, i'm not sure a jury member is sure, gough pointed out."}
{"original": "how many of you thought it boiled down to you either believed the kids, or you believed the science? maher asked the group of jurors. all six raised their hands."}
{"original": "going back on the hands thing, that was the most debated thing in that deliberation room, as far as i'm concerned, juror adam buss said. i mean, we had jury members on the floor, you know, just - 'how do we lay? how you know, do we hold the covers?'"}
{"original": "jury members got on the floor -- put themselves in this position like this. to try and figure it out, maher commented."}
{"original": "and did that help? did the show-and-tell of it help you?"}
{"original": "it did. but it--it almost left more questions than answers, he said."}
{"original": "meanwhile across town, lyndsay lovelace -- estranged from her father, stepmother and brothers -- awaited the verdict from the comfort of the home she shares with her grandmother."}
{"original": "yeah, we need a verdict. we need some kind of closure -- some kind, said steve belko."}
{"original": "and hopefully the boys, the family, the grandparents--that everybody can get back together again someday down in the future, said beth dobrzynski."}
{"original": "if found guilty, curtis lovelace could spend the rest of his life behind bars."}
{"original": "i haven't gotten a lot of sleep in the last year-and-a-half. every minute is spent thinking about what we could we be doing ... with the goal of bringing curtis home and proving his innocence, said christine lovelace."}
{"original": "after 16 1/2 hours of jury deliberations over two days, lyndsay received that much anticipated call."}
{"original": "breaking news here inside the adams county courthouse. judge hardwick did just now declare a mistrial, jenny dreasler reported.curtis' current wife could be seen sobbing ... the three lovelace boys all holding hands before that verdict was reached."}
{"original": "it was unreal and ... i felt so empty and out of breathe and the only thing i could do was hug my kids and let them know it is going to be ok and it is going to be ok, christine lovelace said of the jury's decision."}
{"original": "this is just dragging it out more. but if they're hung, they're hung. and there's nothing we can do about it. we just wait for the next round, lyndsay said of the outcome."}
{"original": "it's set for retrial. and we plan to retry it, said prosecutor ed parkinson."}
{"original": "if there's no new evidence, how do you paint it in a different light and not put yourself in a position of a hung jury again? maher asked."}
{"original": "maybe not paint in a different light. might paint it in the same light and with a different jury, he replied."}
{"original": "but this jury fought until the end."}
{"original": "did it ever become contentious? maher asked the six jurors."}
{"original": "it did. i think, probably five of the jurors said, 'there is no way anybody is ever gonna change my mind.' and two of those, i think, were for guilty, three for not guilty, juror mike hayden said. and that just deflated me so much."}
{"original": "joyce ... you believe he did it? maher asked."}
{"original": "i believe he did it, said stevens."}
{"original": "he's not guilty. and they didn't prove it to me, said tarr."}
{"original": "i had a feeling, after that first day, we weren't gonna come to a unanimous decision, said stevens."}
{"original": "it was pretty -- it was pretty obvious, stevens affirmed."}
{"original": "steve, do you think that curt killed cory? maher asked steve belko."}
{"original": "i don't know. i don't wanna believe it. because everything i know about curt, he could not have done it. and -- i don't even know if it would've been done in a crime of passion, he replied. i think of cory on that. because i know cory is -- is one tough cookie. she'd have fought to the death to defend her children."}
{"original": "i don't hear anyone in this little triad saying, 'no way, no how, he didn't do it,' maher said to the lovelace's friends. there's nobody here pounding their fists saying, 'my friend didn't do it.'"}
{"original": "i wouldn't go that far. i'm not entirely sure, said belko."}
{"original": "i wouldn't go that far, either, said beth dobrzynski."}
{"original": "it's definitely put a huge question in my mind. was there something-- some reason she died other than natural causes, said bret schrader."}
{"original": "as the entire town awaits this new trial, speculation and gossip continue."}
{"original": "the question everyone has: what does the future hold for curtis lovelace?"}
{"original": "how does he get his life back ... in his hometown? said gough."}
{"original": "because in the court of public opinion, you think people will always feel like he did something, said maher."}
{"original": "yeah. yeah. and again when this ends ... i just don't see how he's gonna be given the benefit of the doubt, said gough."}
{"original": "christine lovelace says she will never stop fighting to clear her husband's name."}
{"original": "there's nobody guilty for this crime because there was no crime committed, she said. we will not allow him to sit in that jail cell for one day longer than he has to."}
{"original": "...whatever it takes to make sure my husband is exonerated and the truth is known and that he comes home. that's what matters, she continued."}
{"original": "with curtis' fate in limbo, lyndsay lovelace and her grandmother, marty didriksen, continue to try to move forward while keeping the focus on the cherished life they lost."}
{"original": "you don't want to lose sight of cory. she died too young. she left children. there's a family here. i mean, lindsey and her brothers. so try to put that back together if we can and move forward, she said."}
{"original": "i just want everyone to find happiness again. and be able to remember the good times rather than the bad times, said lyndsay."}
{"original": "she was an amazing woman ... she loved with the biggest heart. she had a beautiful personality, lyndsay said of her mother. she touched so many people and that's who she needs to be remembered as."}
{"original": "curtis lovelace's new trial date is scheduled for may 31."}
{"original": "his bail was set at $5 million. he remains in jail."}
{"original": "east lansing, mich. -- a woman who attends michigan state university filed a federal lawsuit against the school monday alleging that three former men's basketball players sexually assaulted her at an off-campus apartment in 2015 and that she was discouraged from reporting what happened. the woman and players are not named in the suit, which was filed in u.s. district court in grand rapids. it seeks compensatory and punitive damages."}
{"original": "michigan state has been rocked for months by a sexual assault scandal involving a former sports doctor that now includes his ex-boss. three ex-football players also were charged last year with sexual assault."}

{"original": "the lawsuit accuses michigan state of failing to comply with title ix requirements by not providing the woman with equal protection under the law and says the school created an unwritten, official policy that created a culture in which male msu athletes felt entitled and emboldened to commit sexual assaults without consequence."}

{"original": "hoax peddlers on the internet falsely claimed that maatje benassi was somehow the world's covid-19 patient zero. over time, conspiracy theorists posted at least 70 videos across multiple youtube channels claiming that benassi had brought the virus into the world. along with those videos came death threats, which benassi and her husband, matt, took seriously."}
{"original": "but at first, the couple did not know how to respond. trolls hiding behind aliases on the internet were almost impossible to find, and the benassis could not sue youtube for allowing the content to be posted because of a now-controversial law known as section 230."}
{"original": "since 1996, section 230 of the communications decency act has been a key legal shield for the tech industry. it protects any interactive computer service from liability for the content people post on their platforms. in other words, companies like facebook and youtube can't be sued if their users behave badly."}
{"original": "politicians and activists have blamed the law for enabling some of the worst activity on the internet. members of the tech industry, however, say the law is misunderstood — and a vital component for how the internet operates."}
{"original": "still shaken from their experience, the benassis are confident that something about the law must change."}
{"original": "section 230, when that was written, it was probably done with the intent that social media companies would police themselves in some manner, matt benassi told 60 minutes. and social media companies haven't done that very well. they need to police themselves quicker or the government needs to step in figure out some mechanism to make them liable, because making them liable would make them police themselves."}
{"original": "the crux of section 230 amounts to one sentence: no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."}
{"original": "when congress first established the legislation, their goal was not for online platforms to be neutral outlets where anything goes. rather, they wanted the platforms to be able to make the judgments needed to moderate content—without risking liability. that's according to us naval academy cybersecurity professor jeff kosseff, who wrote the book the twenty-six words that created the internet, an in-depth look at the history of section 230."}
{"original": "prior to section 230, distributors — like a newsstand or bookstore — were liable for what they sold only if they were able to know the material was illegal. companies that actually produced the material — book publishers or newspapers, for example — were liable because they controlled the content they created."}
{"original": "in the early days of the internet, legal challenges against two service providers, compuserve and prodigy, showed the law needed to rethink that distinction when it came to the internet."}
{"original": "compuserve had decided not to regulate what their users posted, while prodigy employed moderators to validate content and clean up foul language. both companies were eventually sued because of content their users posted. compuserve was found not liable because it was solely a distributor, having no say over what its users posted. prodigy, however, did not receive the same immunity. because it actively moderated its content, the court decided it had taken a more editorial role, making its site more like a newspaper's letters to the editor."}
{"original": "the key precedent the suits set at the time was that online platforms could reduce their liability if they did not moderate users' content. section 230 was intended to change that."}
{"original": "an addendum to section 230 known as the good samaritan clause allows platforms to remove content they find objectionable, even if that speech is protected by the first amendment. this leaves the policing of content to the discretion of websites themselves, while still protecting them from liability."}
{"original": "according to kosseff, congress did not want to overburden the then-fledgling internet industry with regulation."}
{"original": "if a service just did not do any moderation, the idea, at least, was that people wouldn't really want to go to it because it would be filled with garbage, kosseff told 60 minutes. or if a site did too much moderation, consumers generally would say, 'well, i don't really want to use that site because they're deleting everything.' so, let the market decide."}
{"original": "the government is free to say, 'hey, this is how you should enforce hate. this is how you should enforce harassment.' we would follow those laws. but we don't see those laws. – youtube ceo susan wojcicki"}
{"original": "today, section 230 covers any website or app that hosts user-generated content. while this includes large, well-established platforms, such as facebook and twitter, it also applies to smaller websites, like local news websites that allow comments. as a result, kosseff argued, the law remains necessary."}
{"original": "section 230 is still important because the industry that's built is built around user content, he said."}
{"original": "the companies that want to become the next facebooks and twitters, they rely on section 230 heavily. their practices really could not exist how they do right now without section 230."}
{"original": "politicians on both sides want it amended"}
{"original": "more than two decades later, the law has been linked to the proliferation of some of the worst corners of the internet, including hate speech, violent videos, foreign trolls, and revenge porn. public pressure is increasing to limit the broad leeway online platforms currently enjoy under section 230, and politicians on both sides of the aisle want to take up the charge."}
{"original": "democrats say section 230 has not done enough, allowing, for example, platforms like facebook to become a place where foreign governments disseminate propaganda without consequence. republicans feel the law has gone too far, arguing that, because section 230 allows companies to judge what content violates their terms of service, they use it to censor conservative viewpoints."}
{"original": "president-elect joe biden last year said section 230 should be revoked, immediately should be revoked in an interview with the new york times. since then, he has not made many comments about the law, except to respond to an executive order signed by president donald trump in may. the executive order requested regulators reinterpret the breadth of section 230 and clarify when its liability protections apply."}
{"original": "joe biden understands that no president should use executive orders as menus to abuse the power of the presidency, biden campaign spokesperson bill russo told buzzfeed news at the time. vice president biden believes that social media companies should be held accountable for disseminating content they know to be false, just as any other private company would be."}
{"original": "however, while biden himself has not said much about section 230, the man he has tapped to be his deputy chief of staff has been vocal in his opposition to the law. bruce reed, who was biden's chief of staff when he was vice president, co-authored an essay calling section 230 an irresponsibility cloak."}
{"original": "washington would be better off throwing out section 230 and starting over, reed wrote last month, along with co-author james steyer, the ceo of common sense media. the wild west wasn't tamed by hiring a sheriff and gathering a posse. the internet won't be either. it will take a sweeping change in ethics and culture, enforced by providers and regulators. "}
{"original": "reed's perspective of section 230 will likely influence the incoming white house team. according to reporting by the new york times, reed is leading biden's team of tech advisers."}
{"original": "the current occupant of the white house, meanwhile, has made his disdain for section 230 known. in addition to his executive order earlier this year, president trump tweeted about the law in the run up to the election, writing repeal section 230!!! last month, he vetoed a defense spending bill because it did not include a provision to repeal the law."}
{"original": "the house of representatives and senate both later voted to override the veto."}
{"original": "president trump's ire for section 230 stems, in part, from his belief that it unfairly allows platforms like twitter to label his tweets about the election when they include unsubstantiated or false information. however, section 230 also allows twitter to host trump's tweets without the risk of being sued over their content."}
{"original": "a staunch republican ally of the president, south carolina's sen. lindsey graham last month introduced a bill that would repeal section 230 in two years, unless congress acts to change it."}
{"original": "the time has come for these largely unregulated big tech giants to either be broken up, regulated, or subject to litigation for their actions, graham said in a press release. it's time we put the section 230 protections these companies enjoy on the clock."}
{"original": "not everyone stands for the repeal of section 230, which the electronic frontier foundation calls the most important law protecting internet speech."}
{"original": "sen. ron wyden and former rep. chris cox, who wrote the law's language in 1996 when they were both congressmen, wrote an op-ed in the usa today last month to defend section 230. getting rid of the law, they explained, would return us to the legal no-man's land that prohibits even good samaritan censorship."}
{"original": "it would also force every website hosting user content to create round-the-clock legal and editorial review teams staffed with hundreds or thousands of people to continually monitor every message, video, photo, and blog, they wrote. alternatively, websites would face exorbitant legal damages at every turn. that is not realistic."}
{"original": "leaders in the tech industry also want to see a version of the law remain. the senate commerce committee in october summoned the ceos of facebook, google, and twitter to testify in a hearing about reforming section 230, during which republican senators argued for stripping the protections granted to web companies by the law."}
{"original": "appearing remotely, the tech giants addressed the proposed changes. facebook ceo mark zuckerberg said congress should update the law to make sure it's working as intended, while the chiefs of twitter and google cautioned lawmakers about making changes."}
{"original": "as you think about how to shape policy in this important area, i would urge the committee to be very thoughtful about any changes to section 230 and to be very aware of the consequences those changes might have on businesses and customers, google ceo sundar pichai testified in his opening remarks."}
{"original": "twitter's jack dorsey highlighted that the law enables tech companies to police harmful content. undermining section 230 will result in far more removal of online speech and impose severe limitations on our collective ability to address harmful content and protect people online, he said."}
{"original": "in an interview with 60 minutes in november 2019, youtube's ceo susan wojcicki also highlighted the importance of section 230 in shaping today's online experience."}
{"original": "it's basically enabled the internet as we know it, wojcicki said. it's enabled us to have people upload content, not have every single comment be reviewed, not every single video be reviewed. and so, it has enabled new types of communication, new types of community, new types of content that we just wouldn't have had beforehand."}
{"original": "the freedom of that open platform enables users to upload some 500 hours of video to youtube every minute, according to company estimates. but with all that content, youtube's system for monitoring has come under scrutiny."}
{"original": "during the 2016 presidential campaign, youtube failed to detect more than 1,100 videos that russian trolls posted, almost all intended to influence african americans. when a white supremacist in march 2019 killed dozens of muslims in christchurch, new zealand, he live-streamed the video on facebook. that video was then uploaded on youtube tens of thousands of times."}
{"original": "wojcicki said the good samaritan clause of section 230 enables her employees to remove hateful content, like the christchurch shooting video, from her site. she also said that, if congress were to pass further laws limiting what content youtube can host, the company would comply."}
{"original": "honestly, if there [were] laws that said, 'this is the type of content you can't have,' then we remove it… wojcicki said. we are making a decision to be responsible because we think it's important for our society right now. and we're allowed to do that because of section 230. and so, the government is free to say, 'hey, this is how you should enforce hate. this is how you should enforce harassment.' we would follow those laws. but we don't see those laws. those laws aren't out there right now."}

{"original": "businesses added just 148,000 jobs in december and the unemployment rate stayed unchanged at 4.1 percent, the labor department reported on friday. the figure undershot economists' predictions of about 180,000 jobs added. hourly earnings continued their modest rise, growing 2.5 percent in december year-over-year."}
{"original": "the jobs report, which marks the 10-year anniversary of the start of the great recession, underlines that the labor market has largely recovered from the 2008 economic collapse, with unemployment is at its lowest level since 2000."}
{"original": "yet those gains haven't diffused across the labor market, leaving hundreds of thousands of workers on the sideline. muted wage growth has also left experts mystified, given that stronger employer demand for labor is supposed to boost workers' paychecks."}
{"original": "surprisingly, there are few indications that the tight labor market is leading to stronger wage growth, a disappointment given that the expansion is now more than eight-and-a-half years old, stuart hoffman, senior economic adviser with pnc financial services group, said in a note."}
{"original": "by industry, manufacturing was strong for the second month in a row, adding 25,000 jobs in december after a gain of 31,000 the previous month. over 2017, the sector gained nearly 200,000 jobs. construction and food and drinking places also grew robustly, adding 30,000 and 25,000 jobs, respectively. retail trade lost a seasonally adjusted 20,000 jobs in december and professional and business services added just 19,000."}
{"original": "it's just striking that you have the service sector not adding as many jobs as you had a few years ago, said guy berger, chief economist at linkedin. some of the fastest growth in hiring has been in ... goods-producing industries."}
{"original": "the year's monthly average of 171,000 new jobs is below the previous year's. [i]t is, notably, the slowest year for job growth since 2010, elise gould, an economist at the economic policy institute, said in a note."}
{"original": "however, lower-paid and less-educated workers are finally making gains after not seeing much improvement in the past few years, with unemployment ticking down slightly for those with only a high school degree, to 4.2 percent."}
{"original": "the people with less education in the past year or two have made the biggest gains in the labor market, said jed kolko, chief economist of indeed.com, a job-posting site. to be sure, wages are still higher for people with more education, but the gaps have narrowed slightly."}

{"original": "but be warned. that bedbug, the size of an apple seed, is now part of your life. it will hitch a ride home to live with you as an unwanted reminder of that expensive five-star hotel stay. and it will cost not only you, but the hospitality industry, insurers and cities nationwide a large sum of money."}
{"original": "they are opportunistic, nondiscriminatory and -- worst of all -- stealthy, warns calvin sugiyama, a risk service specialist with allianz global corporate & specialty services (agcs), who handles bedbug claims. you might think you just have a mosquito bite or, because they bite multiple times, a rash."}
{"original": "a unit of allianz, the largest insurer in the world, agcs has put a yardstick on the cost of the bedbug invasion in its latest report on liability claims. and for such a little bug, it causes a big problem. domestic claims involving bedbugs rose 50 percent from 2014 to 2015, and they continue to climb. this figure is supported by the bed bug registry, which confirms that bedbug sightings in new york city hotels alone jumped by 44 percent during the same time frame."}
{"original": "don't let this happen to you: bedbug bites all over. joel carillet"}
{"original": "but new york city, which receives 50 million visitors a year, isn't this country's worst metropolitan area for bedbugs. that distinction goes to baltimore, which now sits atop the least-wanted list in a report from pest control company orkin, which seeks to turn bedbugs into dead bugs. to put this in perspective, bedbugs were virtually unheard of in the u.s. 10 years ago, said orkin entomologist ron harrison."}
{"original": "here are some additional facts from allianz. bedbug incidents account for almost one-third of all animal-related liability claims, right behind rutting deer that ram or are rammed by cars and trucks. but while deer tend to migrate mostly in the fall, bedbugs are prolific year-round, although infestations peak in the warmer months."}
{"original": "bedbugs accounted for nearly 400 of the claims paid out in a five-year period, double the number of other insect bites and nearly four times as many dog bites."}
{"original": "allianz's figures include only insurance claims by it and other insurers. since many hotels, bed and breakfasts and private homes handle the problem themselves with the assistance of a fumigator, it's tough to figure out the total cost of these critters."}
{"original": "landlords, hotels and businesses typically pay for the elimination of bedbugs on their own, said loretta worters, a spokesperson for the insurance information institute, which represents the industry. but she warns that can be extremely expensive."}
{"original": "for starters, the property owner could be liable for any bodily injury. bedbugs aren't deemed to be dangerous and haven't yet caused a fatality, but they are very, very annoying. and claims against hotels range up to $400,000, said worters. defending against these claims costs a lot of money because lawyers can draw blood too."}
{"original": "then there's the reputational risks for a hotel that's known for bedbuggery or has to shut down for fumigation. allianz's clients are covered under its general liability policy, but other insurers offer specific policies, sometimes in conjunction with exterminators, to help the hospitality industry hang out a no vacancy sign for pests, worters said."}
{"original": "allianz's sugiyama, who admits he was once bitten by bedbugs, is now twice shy when it comes to staying at hotels, which he has to do frequently. i take a big flashlight with me, he said. i check the bed, particularly the seams of the sheets, and if i see anything that looks like rust, i call management."}
{"original": "if you're able, turn over the mattress, no matter what size. bedbugs like to congregate in dark places."}
{"original": "examine your luggage when you repack and inspect it for any black or brown spots. believe it or not, the safest place in a hotel room to keep your luggage is in the bathtub."}
{"original": "launder all the clothing you brought with you -- with the hottest water -- when you get home."}
{"original": "since most hotels are well aware of the bedbug problem, they keep an exterminator on retainer, and housekeeping is trained to spot any problems as well. dogs, particularly beagles, are sensitive to the sweet musky odor of bedbugs, so if you see one sniffing around your hotel, it may be more than a pet."}
{"original": "but despite all the precautions, entomology isn't on your side in the battle of the bedbugs. they're blood eaters, but they can be stealth fighters and live an entire year without a meal. and they love to be under the covers with you, which is why they're usually found within five feet of a bed."}
{"original": "fumigate all you want to kill the critters, but will you ever feel secure where you were when you started that itching? it never quite feels the same, said a woman whose apartment was infested after a stay in a southern hotel during a flood. when i moved, i was so happy to say goodbye to that place."}
{"original": "the partial government shutdown has glided into its third week with no end in sight. if the government is not reopened before march, millions of americans who receive benefits from the supplemental nutrition assistance program (snap) — the nation's food stamp program — could have their assistance disrupted. the funding provided for snap and other programs through february is only a temporary fix."}
{"original": "the u.s. department of agriculture, which oversees snap at the federal level, is one of the agencies unfunded during the partial government shutdown. usda secretary sonny perdue announced tuesday that snap would be funded through february, thanks to the funding bill that expired on dec. 22, which included a provision allowing federal agencies to make obligated payments to support certain programs for 30 days after its expiration date."}
{"original": "in september 2018, the last month for which data is available, $4.7 billion in snap benefits were disbursed throughout every state. if the shutdown continues through march, there will be no remaining funding for snap, endangering food security for millions of americans."}
{"original": "according to the nonpartisan center on budget and policy priorities, 42 million americans received snap benefits in 2017. more than 68 percent of participants were in families with children, and more than 44 percent were in working families."}
{"original": "other programs were in even more immediate danger than snap. the food distribution program on indian reservations and the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children (wic) were not receiving federal funds at all during the shutdown, but can continue to operate at the state and local level with any funding and commodity resources that remain available, according to the usda in december."}
{"original": "however, the usda announced tuesday that wic would continue to operate through february, thanks to prior year funding which usda will begin to provide states this week."}
{"original": "in the first five months of 2018, around 7 million americans received wic benefits each month. wic is provided for pregnant, postpartum and breastfeeding women, infants, and children up to age 5 who fall within the poverty index and are at nutritional risk. the wic program granted nearly $5 billion to every u.s. state and territory in 2018, as of september."}

{"original": "u.s. customs and border protection blamed girón's death on human smugglers who encouraged her to try to climb the wall. in a statement, gloria chavez, the chief for the border patrol's el paso sector, said the authorities would work with mexico to find those responsible for placing these lives in danger."}
{"original": "despite the best efforts of our border patrol agents and medical professionals, sadly more lives have perished at the hands of human smugglers, chavez said. someone in mexico guided this 8 month pregnant woman from guatemala to this section of the border and encouraged her and helped her climb the steel mesh border barrier."}
{"original": "cbp acting commissioner mark morgan told reporters that girón and her partner were taken to the border by smugglers and left there in the darkness. they were attempting to climb when she fell. border patrol agents reached her and called medical authorities, who took her to the hospital but tragically, the mother and the child died from their injuries from the fall, he said."}
{"original": "according to guatemalan authorities, girón fell more than 19 feet (6 meters) on saturday. her partner, who is believed to have been the baby's father, eventually found border patrol agents who called for an ambulance."}

{"original": "paniagua said he could recall at least seven cases this year in which guatemalans had injured themselves trying to climb u.s. border walls. he says such cases are rising because more migrants from guatemala and other central american countries wracked by violence and poverty no longer surrender en masse to the border patrol."}

{"original": "we finally have a major advancement in rocketry, he told cbs news during an earlier interview at the base of pad 39a. i'm not sure whether this will be lost on people, whether they'll appreciate it. i hope they do, because the era of the very large rocket went away with saturn 5 and with the space shuttle."}
{"original": "i find it odd that the falcon heavy is twice the thrust of anything from russia, china, boeing, lockheed or europe, musk continued. and i hope it encourages them to raise their sights."}

{"original": "he put the odds of a successful flight at somewhere between 50 percent and 70 percent."}
{"original": "made up of three side-by-side falcon 9 first stages and an upper stage carrying the tesla, the falcon heavy will easily be the most powerful rocket in the world when it takes off, generating 4.7 million pounds of thrust with 27 merlin engines firing in concert, nine per core stage."}
{"original": "later versions flying at full throttle will generate more than 5.1 million pounds of push, enabling the rocket to boost payloads weighing up to 140,660 pounds to low-earth orbit or 37,000 pounds to earth-escape velocities needed for missions to the moon, mars or beyond."}
{"original": "nasa is currently building an even more powerful rocket known as the space launch system, or sls, that will generate 8.8 million pounds of thrust in its initial configuration and up to 11.9 million pounds in a follow-on cargo variant. the initial version will be able to boost more than 50,000 pounds to earth-escape velocity."}

{"original": "i think this could be an extremely significant launch, first of all because it's happening in 2018, not whenever sls is going to launch, it is going to be, if it succeeds, the most powerful rocket in the world, and that enables lots of different things, said john logsdon, a noted space historian and space policy analyst."}

{"original": "it poses a competitive challenge to the nasa way of doing business. just as spacex has posed a challenge to (competitor) united launch alliance that seems to be succeeding, it could well pose a challenge to nasa's launch strategy."}
{"original": "if all goes well, the tesla and its dummy passenger will be released onto a deep space trajectory about six hours after launch, breaking free of earth's gravity at nearly 25,000 mph while david bowie's space oddity plays in the background."}
{"original": "assuming it makes it through the high-radiation environment of earth's van allen belts, and assuming the falcon heavy's second stage propellant doesn't freeze or boil away after six hours in the deep cold of space, the tesla will be released on a trajectory carrying it slightly farther than the orbit of mars."}
{"original": "we expect it'll get about 400 million kilometers away from earth, maybe 250 to 270 million miles, and be doing 11 kilometers per second, musk said. it's going to be in a precessing elliptical orbit with one part of the ellipse being at earth orbit and the other part being at mars orbit. so it'll essentially be an earth-mars cycler."}
{"original": "we estimate it'll be in that orbit for several hundred million years, maybe in excess of a billion years, he said. at times, it will come extremely close to mars, and there's a tiny, tiny chance that it will hit mars (someday). extremely tiny. i wouldn't hold your breath."}
{"original": "new rockets making their first flights typically carry dummy payloads, or mass simulators. but not the falcon heavy."}
{"original": "it's just for fun, musk laughed. a lot of people (wondered,) what's the purpose of sending a car to mars? there's no point, obviously! it's just for fun and to get the public excited. normally, when a new rocket is tested, they put something really boring on like a block of concrete or a chunk of steel or something. ... the car is just the most fun thing we could think of."}
{"original": "spacex typically attempts to recover its falcon 9 boosters after launch. for the falcon heavy, the company will attempt to recover all three core stages after the heavy climbs out of the lower atmosphere."}
{"original": "the two previously flown outside boosters will separate, flip around and fly back to the cape canaveral air force station for side-by-side rocket-powered descents to touchdown at spacex's landing zone 1. the central core stage will attempt to land on an off-shore droneship."}
{"original": "the recovery of all three stages would push spacex's record to 24 successful landings in 27 attempts. musk was particularly animated describing the landings and the dual sonic booms that will thunder across florida's space coast as the two returning boosters slow down for landing."}
{"original": "but it's the launch, seeing the most powerful rocket since the space shuttle climbing away from pad 39a, that has sparked such widespread interest. and no wonder."}
{"original": "at liftoff, with all 27 core stage engines firing together, the heavy will enjoy more than twice the liftoff power of a united launch alliance delta 4 heavy, the most powerful currently flying u.s. rocket, and more than one-and-a-half times the power of a european ariane 5."}
{"original": "for comparison, the soviet union's ill-fated n1 moon rocket holds the all-time record with a thrust of 10.5 million pounds, but it catastrophically failed in four launch attempts. nasa's successful saturn 5, the gargantuan booster that propelled apollo astronauts to the moon, generated 7.5 million pounds of push while the space shuttle rocketed away atop 6.8 million pounds of thrust. the soviet union's short-lived energia booster generated 6.6 million pounds."}
{"original": "musk said the debut of the falcon heavy does not mark the rebirth of an apollo-like program, but it's arguably a prelude to a new apollo, and it's going to be the only heavy- to super-heavy-lift rocket in the world."}
{"original": "this will be more than twice the thrust and capability of any other rocket currently flying, he said. and if it reaches orbit, it will have the most payload of any rocket since the saturn 5. you could actually send people back to the moon with the falcon heavy, you could, with orbital refueling, send people to mars."}
{"original": "musk said last year that he planned to send two unidentified paying customers on a flight to loop around the moon, but he said today spacex is now focusing on building a new, even more powerful rocket known as the bfr, a huge machine he says can be used to help colonize mars."}
{"original": "the business end of the falcon heavy, showing 27 merlin engines at the bases of three core stages. firing together, the engines will generate about 5 million pounds of thrust. spacex"}
{"original": "it's not yet clear how the falcon heavy figures into that plan or whether enough customers, including nasa, might line up to buy the heavy for commercial satellite-launching missions, to send interplanetary probes into deep space or possibly to send space tourists into space aboard a piloted version of spacex's dragon spacecraft."}
{"original": "the falcon heavy is definitely capable of sending the crewed dragon vehicle around the moon, musk said. we may still do that. it depends on how quickly the bfr development goes. if that development's looking good, then we will try to push everything to bfr. if that's looking like it's going to take longer than expected, then we'll send people around the moon using falcon heavy and dragon."}
{"original": "but the bfr is the clear focus, a rocket system that he says will be ideal for interplanetary colonization and for establishing a large base on the moon and a city on mars. but this (the falcon heavy) is a prelude to that, this is going to teach us a lot about what's necessary to have a huge booster with a crazy number of engines."}
{"original": "there are numerous unknowns when it comes to flying a powerful new rocket, even one utilizing multiple flight-proven stages like the falcon heavy. as the rocket climbs away, consuming propellant and losing weight, it will rapidly accelerate, subjecting it to hard-to-model aerodynamic and mechanical stresses as it plows out of the thick lower atmosphere."}
{"original": "it is also difficult to model the vibration and acoustic environment at the base of the rocket where the 27 merlin engines will be firing. the engines were test fired at the pad on jan. 24 and spacex said later there were no problems. but, musk warned monday, there's so much that can go wrong here."}
{"original": "there are a lot of experts out there saying there's no way you can do 27 engines, all at the same time, and not have something go wrong, he said. you've got the booster-to-booster interaction, acoustics and vibration that haven't been seen from any man-made device in a long time."}
{"original": "even so, he told reporters later, i'm really hopeful for this flight going as planned. we've done everything we could do to maximize the chances of success of this mission. i think once you've done everything you can think of and it still goes wrong, well, there's nothing you could have done. but i feel at peace with that."}

{"original": "santa ana, calif. -- unlike similar escapes where dangerous inmates fled into rural areas, the three men who broke out of a southern california lockup escaped into densely populated suburban communities where they have close ties."}
{"original": "hundreds of officers are focusing on neighborhoods where the trio charged with violent crimes could be hiding among friends, family or fellow gang members, particularly orange county's huge vietnamese population, authorities said tuesday, the fourth day of the manhunt."}
{"original": "it is just a few miles from the jail where the trio broke out friday, and two of the inmates, jonathan tieu, 20, bac duong, 43, have deep ties to the community, which is among the largest in the u.s."}
{"original": "sheriff's officials put out a call in both english and vietnamese on monday for help in finding them. the two may be embedded there, said sheriff's lt. dave sawyer, who is leading the investigation."}
{"original": "we sincerely need input from the community to help us, sawyer said."}
{"original": "tieu, duong and hossein nayeri, 37, are considered dangerous and all were awaiting trial for separate violent felonies, authorities said. they have now each been charged with the escape."}
{"original": "tieu had been held since 2013, accused of murder and attempted murder. duong faced attempted murder and assault charges in the shooting of a man on his front porch. nayeri was arrested in 2014 on charges including kidnapping and torture. authorities said nayeri abducted a marijuana dealer, burned him with a blow torch and cut off his penis because nayeri thought the man had buried money in the desert."}
{"original": "the men were gone for as long as 16 hours before officials noticed they were missing from the common dorm they share with more than 60 other inmates at orange county central jail. an attack on a guard delayed a friday night head count by hours. the trio sawed through a quarter-inch-thick grill on a dormitory wall, got into plumbing tunnels and then sawed through half-inch-thick steel bars as they made their way behind walls to an unguarded area of a roof atop a five-story building."}
{"original": "there, they moved aside razor wire and rappelled to the ground using a bed linen."}
{"original": "the sheriff's department has been slow to add more rooftop security cameras at the jail despite a grand jury's recommendations for eight years straight, according to a report monday in the orange county register."}
{"original": "the department has said since 2008 that budget constraints prevented upgrades to the camera systems at the five county jails. the escape was eerily similar to one last year in new york, where two inmates cut through a portion of a wall hidden under a bunk bed and used piping and tunnels inside the facility to get out. but the search for the pair focused on nearby woods instead of a dense urban population."}
{"original": "a major question for california investigators will be how the men could plan and execute their escape with such precision, said kevin tamez, a managing partner for mpm group, a philadelphia-based firm that consults on prison security, management and infrastructure."}
{"original": "there is no evidence so far that the trio had help from the inside, but authorities know it's a possibility, orange county sheriff's lt. jeff hallock said. it's likely someone slipped them blueprints or told them how the bowels of the jail were laid out, he said."}
{"original": "if i were whoever's investigating, there are some people who would be on a polygraph, i guarantee you, tamez said. they had to have had some inside help."}
{"original": "motion sensor cameras - available for $55 and often used as baby monitors - can be installed along interior tunnels and pipes to catch inmates, tamez said."}
{"original": "thorough searches of dorms likely would have discovered tools or damage to the vent grill, he said. it was the first escape in nearly three decades from the california facility, which was built in 1968. it holds 900 men and is in santa ana, about 30 miles southeast of los angeles."}
{"original": "hallock said the jail's general policy is to do walk-throughs every hour to check on inmates. more thorough searches are done randomly, he said, declining to give more details."}

{"original": "by now, most high school seniors have college offers on the table, leaving them only a few days to decide which one to choose. will it be the glamour school with a big price tag? the reliable state school? a commuter or community college?"}
{"original": "making a solid choice means weighing what will be the best fit and value for your family's budget, your student's personality and academic interests. but even though time is short, you can still work on getting better aid offers until colleges need a final decision, which is usually may 1."}
{"original": "kalman chany, a college financial counselor and author of paying for college without going broke, said from the time students and their families get the acceptance notices until may 1, the student and their family is in the strongest position -- as the ball is now in a different court with the school no longer being in control."}
{"original": "why are families in a great position now that offers are in front of them? chany noted this is prime time because once you lock into a school, you lose a great deal of leverage, so you still have time to improve a financial aid offer -- which shouldn't include loans but often do (i discourage anyone from going into deep debt for most degrees)."}
{"original": "here are four strategies to keep in mind:"}
{"original": "if the aid offer falls short, appeal it. but this isn't the same process as trying to get a better price on a refrigerator. one should never use terms such as negotiate, bargain or 'goose up' when dealing with the aid office, chany noted."}
{"original": "better to say you wish to 'appeal' or 'request reconsideration.'"}
{"original": "do your homework on the school's ability to dole out grants and scholarships. this means don't ask for nonloan aid from schools that are in financially struggling states or those with meager scholarship resources. look at a school's endowment, the often enormous kitty that has been built up over years."}
{"original": "colleges with billion-dollar-plus endowments certainly have the resources to meet your financial need. others simply may have no-loan policies, which is desirable even if you don't completely meet their financial assistance thresholds."}
{"original": "what you're looking for in vetting a college's cash reserves is endowment per student, which should be on the university's website or findable through a simple online search. this is the amount the school is doling out from its endowment. the higher the number, the more generous it can afford to be."}
{"original": "don't pay attention to retail price tags. the sticker price of tuition, fees and housing may not be what most families pay. it depends on a college's aid policy. if a school is committed to meeting all or most financial need, that means generous combinations of grants, scholarships and tuition discounts."}
{"original": "also don't think because a private college's sticker price is much higher than a public school's that your net cost -- after all nonloan aid is awarded -- is going to be higher. you could get a much better deal at a private school because many have more money to offer and are in a position to dole it out. a good way to gauge a college's aid-giving record and net price is by searching college abacus."}
{"original": "one will have a better chance with an appeal at a private college then at a public university, chany has found. the key is having a thorough understanding of the aid formulas to know how the colleges and the government are determining your eligibility for aid."}
{"original": "consider hiring an aid consultant. these professionals go to bat for your family to help you garner more aid. while they charge for their services (they're expensive and rates vary), they can make a difference if you're staring down a six-figure college bill."}
{"original": "if one is thinking about private colleges -- which usually require much more extensive documentation than just the federal fafsa form -- the cost of a consultant may be just a penny on the dollar, given the sticker price for four years is now $250,000 to $300,000 at many of them."}
{"original": "how do you find an aid consultant? you can ask other parents and guidance counselors for referrals. just be careful. some consultants supplement their income by selling financial products you don't need. one neighbor told me a consultant insisted that her family needed an annuity, an often-expensive retirement product that has nothing to do with college financing."}
{"original": "a good place to start finding an adviser who does aid planning is through the association of certified college planning specialists. they train and certify a variety of financial professionals who can share prudent tax, financial, cash flow and lending advice that can help families lower the cost of college and pay the tuition bill."}
{"original": "if you have some time -- that is, if you're not making a decision about college offers in the next week, planning ahead is still the best strategy for maximizing your aid. chany suggests that you start working with your child as early as 9th grade."}

{"original": "sotloff, a 31-year-old miami-area native who freelanced for time and foreign policy magazines, vanished in syria in august 2013 and was not seen again until he appeared in a video released last month that showed fellow journalist james foley's beheading. dressed in an orange jumpsuit against an arid syrian landscape, sotloff was threatened in that video with death unless the u.s. stopped airstrikes on isis."}
{"original": "later, a video was distributed documenting his death."}
{"original": "the lawsuit contends syria is liable because it provided financial, material and military support to isis. syria has not yet answered the lawsuit."}

{"original": "the last several years have been tumultuous for many colleges in the united states, as undergraduate enrollments have declined, endowments have shrunk and many private institutions have become increasingly dependent on tuition for survival. now, many in higher education fear that the unprecedented combination of difficulties presented by the coronavirus pandemic could sound a death knell."}
{"original": "the pandemic has upended almost every aspect of our operations, from teaching and student life to research to athletics to admissions and recruitment to the financial model that sustains all of it, michael schoenfeld, vice president for public affairs and government relations, and chief communications officer for duke university, tells cbs news. this is all happening in real-time, so it will be a while before we can fully assess the impact across the institution, and indeed across higher education. in the short term, we are evaluating a range of options with regard to the coming academic year, which will depend on both health and public policy considerations. we are also looking at the long-term effects and opportunities, which will be considerable as well."}
{"original": "a staggering 6.6 million americans sought jobless benefits last week, meaning that roughly 10% of the country is now unemployed. oxford economics expects the crisis to intensify as the weeks of coronavirus closures drag on, predicting as many as 30 million u.s. job losses – three times the number of jobs that vanished as result of the housing crash of 2008."}
{"original": "families will have less money. many of them won't have jobs for a while. you know, if they're relying on investments, they'll have less investments, said dr. thomas bailey, president of teachers college, columbia university."}
{"original": "and he said that could pose a very real problem for colleges and universities across the country that are very tuition dependent and aren't particularly selective."}
{"original": "if you look at the industry press over the last several years, you quite periodically read about institutions that have closed, he said. i think the elite, well-financed, high reputation institutions will be able to weather this. but many colleges and universities – small, private, less selective institutions – were already under a lot of stress. so, i think this will just make it that much more difficult."}
{"original": "to make matters worse, the current social distancing and quarantine guidelines make it impossible for students to tour campuses or attend admitted students events, which often help sell a university to its prospective classes."}
{"original": "that will definitely have an effect, dr. linda lemura, president of new york's private jesuit institution, le moyne college, tells cbs news. in our situation, when students come to campus and they feel the strength of the community, the friendliness of the community, the accessibility of the professors, they get a feel, a vibe, and they say to themselves, 'i can see myself here.' it's very different when you're selling your college in an online or a virtual environment. it doesn't affect the senses in the same way."}

{"original": "when asked whether she thought next year's freshman class would be as full as usual, lemura replied gravely, i don't. i don't."}
{"original": "i want to be wrong in the worst way, but i really think that the modeling that we all use, the assumptions are now completely faulty, she continued. because when we launched the recruitment season, we weren't counting on a pandemic. we don't know how that's going to affect family behavior, family finances. it's possible that recruiting outside of your area will be restricted because families want to keep their children closer to home. all of those things now are unknowns. whereas we could have predicted a class with a variable of roughly 25 students, we could be looking at a difference of 200 students. we just don't know."}
{"original": "across the board, regardless of the size of the institution or whether it is public or private, endowments have plummeted as a result of the recent turmoil in the stock market, putting further stress on schools' operating budgets. most development offices have temporarily suspended asking alumni for donations. and to make matters worse, events like reunions, which ordinarily play a key role in inspiring donations, have been cancelled as well."}
{"original": "we rely heavily on the nature of relationships on residential campuses, lemura told cbs news. bringing people back to campus and having the alums meet with the next generations of students, that is the impetus for generating gifts and philanthropy. so, without a doubt, the more distance we have, the harder that it is. it can be done, but it's just an enormous challenge. the entire enterprise, really on a campus like ours, is based on the ability to connect human-to-human. and the online environment and canceling those kinds of events cuts into the bottom line."}
{"original": "it's a bottom line that has already been hammered by the refunds of meal plans and room and board that most schools had to make when covid-19 necessitated the early closures of campuses across the nation this spring semester."}
{"original": "there's no question, lemura said. most institutions have refunded room and board on a prorated rate and so that will affect the bottom line for this academic year, in terms of whether or not we end the year with a margin or in deficit. and then, moving forward, if we have to open up the campus at a later time in the fall, that's another revenue hit, not to mention it changes the nature of developing a cohort model, which is so effective in residential campuses. all those things combined really equate to a major disruption."}

{"original": "public institutions are not immune either. penn state, which has committed to paying all of its employees through april and set up an emergency fund for its students hardest hit by the crisis, told cbs news in an email that it had frozen hiring and terminated a number of service contracts in effort to stem financial losses."}
{"original": "penn state has incurred significant financial losses in auxiliary and other units that are dependent on self-generated revenue to fund their operations, the statement read. these operations include penn state's two hotel and conference centers, the university airport, and housing and food services in the university's extensive residence hall operations, which typically serve approximately 20,000 students daily. total revenue losses across the university through the spring semester are estimated to be well above $100 million."}
{"original": "ordinarily, higher education is countercyclical, so its outlook doesn't necessarily move in the same direction as the rest of the economy during a downtown. the question is whether the current global predicament is so unique that it defies past models of behavior."}
{"original": "it's possible that students might say, 'you know, i really want to have that in-class experience, so let me wait a year,' says bailey. on the other hand, higher education is countercyclical. after the recession 12 years ago, we had huge enrollment increases. so, it's possible that somebody who's out of a job temporarily may say, 'okay, this is a time for me to go back to school to pick up some courses, maybe to pick up an extra degree that i can use.' but of course the problem with that is that people may not have the money to pay for it. if you have a recession that goes to 7 or 8% unemployment, that might work. if we have much higher unemployment, then i'm not sure that that countercyclical argument will work."}
{"original": "lemura anticipates this recession will hit higher education harder than the last one."}
{"original": "i think there'll be more pressure to charge significantly less for online education, she said. and let's face it. institutions over the past, i don't know, 200 years have been investing mightily in physical infrastructure, so now you're going to have that overhead of all those buildings that are under capacity on the balance sheet. and that's a heavy lift for any institution."}
{"original": "it's also unclear how the coronavirus pandemic will affect universities' ability to enroll international students, who often pay higher tuition than their domestic counterparts. however, despite travel restrictions, annelise riles, executive director of the buffett institute for global affairs at northwestern university, told cbs news that northwestern's office of international student and scholar services is still continuing to process immigration document (i-20 and ds 2019) requests, so that international students slated to begin programs at northwestern can be as prepared as possible for any scenario in these uncertain times."}

{"original": "with the futures of many u.s. academic institutions now uncertain, bailey cautioned that a blow to higher education would reverberate through society as a whole."}
{"original": "higher education is absolutely crucial. it provides a foundation for so much that we rely on in society; not only advancing society technologically, culturally and scientifically, but also providing opportunities for low income students to develop a better life and more opportunities, he said. science, culture, equity, those are fundamental things that we're trying to develop in higher education. and if we're just scrambling to stay afloat, we're not going to be as effective in pursuing those goals."}
{"original": "there are simply some intangible losses that can't be marked down on a balance sheet."}

{"original": "the clark county black caucus said thursday that it would throw its support behind bernie sanders, the latest in a flurry of nevada endorsements this week as he seeks to shore up support in a key early contest."}
{"original": "when you look at his platform and his consistency, over the years he has a long history fighting for civil rights and economic justice, yvette williams, chair of the clark county black caucus, tells cbs news."}
{"original": "we've interviewed him as well, and he has concrete plans in place that will address many of the inequities, inequalities, and injustices of black america, williams added."}
{"original": "clark county includes las vegas and is far and away the most populous county in the state. racking up supporters in the county is essential for any candidate who hopes to win the nevada caucuses on february 22nd."}
{"original": "the clark county black caucus' endorsement comes as other nevada groups have rallied to sanders. on tuesday, the immigrant rights group make the road action made public its plans to leverage their organizing heft in nevada for the sanders campaign. meanwhile, the clark county education association, nevada's largest teachers union, announced monday that it too would back the vermont senator."}
{"original": "sanders has invested heavily in nevada, which votes third after iowa and new hampshire. the contest is seen as a crucial test of candidates' support among hispanic and asian american voters, as well as the powerful labor unions that dominate democratic politics in the state."}
{"original": "the nevada caucuses could also be an early barometer for neighboring california, the mammoth super tuesday contest where the sanders campaign has also focused significant resources."}
{"original": "sanders boasts 10 offices and over 100 staffers in nevada, the most of any candidate the state. and if not for a heart attack that sidelined the senator in las vegas more than three months ago, he would have recorded the most days publicly campaigning in nevada of any candidate in the race."}
{"original": "the clark county black caucus represents the diverse coalition we're building in nevada and i am proud to gain their support, sanders said in a statement."}
{"original": "their voice and leadership has brought meaningful change in the lives of the communities they serve, and together, we will fight against a government and political system that have historically oppressed african americans, he added in part."}
{"original": "the clark county black caucus, which backed sanders in 2016, had endorsed cory booker late last year after a vote among its membership of some 400 nevadans. at the time, the group indicated that sanders was their second choice."}
{"original": "booker, who suspended his campaign for president on monday, suggested tuesday in an interview with cbs this morning that he was not yet ready to endorse a democratic candidate for president. however, multiple backers of booker tell cbs news they have already been aggressively courted by other campaigns."}
{"original": "recent polls in nevada show sanders in a tight race with joe biden this year. but while biden's team is dwarfed by the staff sanders has amassed, the former vice president has nabbed the support of key progressive leaders in the state."}
{"original": "the leadership of the influential nevada culinary union has remained publicly skeptical of medicare for all, the single-payer healthcare proposal at the heart of the sanders platform. and just this week, a usa today/suffolk survey showed sanders still trailing the biden among black nevada caucus-goers."}
{"original": "williams hopes the clark county black caucus can help boost the senator's chances among that demographic and is planning events to support the campaign in its home stretch. early voting in nevada kicks off in just a month, on february 15th."}
{"original": "i have no ill will with biden. but i just strongly believe that it's time for change for black america. it's time for bernie sanders and his policy that's going to provide for an america that's more racially just, said williams."}
{"original": "many of the 27 million people taking a cruise this year will spend a fair amount of shipboard time cozying up to the bar. but liquid lubrication may cost consumers more than it's worth."}
{"original": "that's because drinking alcohol can void your travel insurance policy, or what travel insurance website squaremouth warns is one of the biggest mistakes cruise-goers make. in other words, don't drink on board and assume your emergencies will be covered if you incur an injury."}
{"original": "the health insurance policies that protect americans where they live and work don't always extend to cruise ships. because of that, many cruise passengers buy an additional policy from companies such as axa, berkshire hathaway and nationwide. those policies include coverage for medical emergencies, but there's sobering fine print: coverage doesn't apply to intoxicated passengers."}
{"original": "travel insurance can cover expensive cruise ship medical costs unless the traveler is intoxicated, said squaremouth director of marketing carolyn leckie. this is a standard exclusion in all policies. the language used is 'claims resulting from expenses incurred as a result of being intoxicated above the legal limit.'"}
{"original": "it's important to realize that a serious injury, such as a fall on a stairway or in one of the ship's pools, can mount into an emergency that costs far more than it would on dry land. if onboard medical personnel don't have the skills or equipment to treat the passenger, they might decide to lift the passenger by helicopter to an onshore hospital at a cost of up to $25,000. international evacuations could be even more costly."}
{"original": "chartering a plane to then fly the patient back to a u.s. hospital from a foreign country with limited medical services could tack on another $100,000. none of this is ordinarily covered by a standard health insurance policy."}
{"original": "a cruise passenger involved in an accident while drunk may mount the same defense as a motorist charged with driving under the influence, claiming they weren't intoxicated. but this is where the passenger and the cruise line could part company. the cruise line will have to provide documentation during the claims process, such as medical records or a police report, that could undermine the passenger's claim for coverage, according to squaremouth."}
{"original": "cruise lines aren't unique in excluding drunkenness as a reason not to collect on travel insurance. it also applies to both domestic and international resorts."}
{"original": "if a traveler has a medical emergency while intoxicated, they will not be reimbursed for those medical expenses, said leckie. travel insurance policies can also exclude dangerous activities, such as bungee jumping or skydiving, as well as lower impact activities like kayaking or riding in a hot-air balloon."}
{"original": "cruise lines may offer cheap deals during wave season, from january to march, but the discounted price is often made up by the high profit margin earned on the onboard sale of liquor, which is free-flowing and always available. before passengers drink up, they may want to give a sobering thought to the downsides."}
{"original": "the federal reserve finds itself between the proverbial rock and a hard place as it has embarked on a path of raising interest rates in the face of a slowing u.s. and global economy."}
{"original": "after much postponing in the face of low inflation and concerns about the global economy, the u.s. central bank in december officially pulled the plug on an unprecedented period of easy monetary policy, raising the federal funds rate from at or near zero to 0.25 percent and signaling four additional moves in 2016."}
{"original": "the fed is in a tricky position today, rick rieder, blackrock's global chief investment officer of fixed income told cbs news at the world economic forum at davos. they are starting to move in a period of time where we've seen growth in the world slow."}
{"original": "the blackrock portfolio manager is among a growing number of investors and analysts who have dialed back expectations that the federal reserve would raise interest rates four times this year."}
{"original": "the fed has described how they are going to move four times this year. i don't think they are going to move four times this year, said rieder, who believes there will be at most two hikes by the fed in 2016. growth in the world is difficult, volatility is higher in the world, said rieder of the hand the fed has been dealt."}
{"original": "art hogan, chief strategist at wunderlich securities, concurred, saying that the stock market's wild and mostly downward ride in recent weeks is in part due to the mixed messages from the fed. we need a little more clarity as to why they are sticking to a four narrative when the data doesn't support that."}
{"original": "the fed is tightening monetary policy as u.s. economic growth loses steam, with the gains made in the u.s. labor market unlikely to be sustained at the same robust pace in the months ahead, rieder said."}
{"original": "the fed has had a window to move rates for a couple of years -- they are going to have to be slower now, rieder said. you've had this tremendous growth in terms of payrolls, i think you've seen some of the best days in terms of that growth."}
{"original": "thoughts that the global economy would grow more slowly than expected in 2016 have roiled global markets, pushing the s&p 500 (spx) to a 21-month low earlier in the week. but u.s. stocks on friday were poised for their first weekly gain of the year, extending a rally into a second day on thinking central banks overseas -- including the european central bank (ecb) -- would further their stimulus, even as the fed moves in the opposite direction."}
{"original": "the scenario makes the fed's tight-rope walk that much more dicey, rieder said."}
{"original": "you have aggressive monetary policy, like what the ecb is doing, that could drive the dollar higher and slow the u.s. economy -- it's part of why i think they could have gone a number of months ago in terms of beginning this policy."}
{"original": "a federal appeals court in california on friday initially blocked a centerpiece of the trump administration's network of restrictive policies at the southern border, ordering officials there to stop sending asylum-seekers to mexico, where tens of thousands of latin american migrants returned by the u.s. have been stranded for months."}
{"original": "but later on friday, the same court temporarily paused its own order, granting an emergency request filed by trump administration lawyers who rushed to defend the controversial migrant protection protocols (mpp) program."}
{"original": "through its initial ruling, the 9th circuit court of appeals had prohibited the government from continuing to enforce the program, known as remain in mexico, finding that it is likely illegal. the decision was a major setback for the administration since officials have touted the program as one of the main reasons it curbed an unprecedented influx of central american families last year that overwhelmed officials and stations across the southern border."}
{"original": "since early 2019, the u.s. has required nearly 60,000 asylum-seekers to wait in mexico for the duration of their immigration court proceedings under this program, which has drawn scathing criticism from advocates. they believe the policy violates both domestic and international refugee law, pointing to the high levels of violence and insecurity in the areas of northern mexico where the u.s. has been sending migrants placed in the program."}
{"original": "the program's hours-long halt was a short-lived victory for the american civil liberties union (aclu), the group spearheading the legal challenge against the policy, and immigration advocates and lawyers, some of whom traveled to border checkpoints to see if any of their clients could get relief under the initial ruling."}
{"original": "this is a temporary step and does not change the fact that courts have ruled multiple times against this illegal policy. we will continue working to permanently end this unspeakably cruel policy, judy rabinovitz, the top aclu attorney in the case, said in a statement."}

{"original": "hours after the court's initial ruling early friday afternoon, u.s. citizenship and immigration services (uscis) asylum officers — who interview asylum-seekers in the remain in mexico program — were instructed in an email to immediately cease all mpp processing, including cases pending decision service. customs and border protection (cbp), the agency that places migrants in the remain in mexico program, also said it had issued a cessation of processing under the program."}
{"original": "on friday night, top cbp officials, including acting commissioner mark morgan, said the agency was reinstating the program."}
{"original": "this evening, with support of doj attorneys and cbp's declaration, the 9th circuit granted a stay of its earlier order enjoining mpp. @cbp will immediately reinstate mpp! — acting commissioner mark morgan (@cbpmarkmorgan) february 29, 2020"}
{"original": "in their initial order, which upheld a preliminary injunction issued by a federal judge last spring, two circuit judges on a three-judge panel in san francisco appeared to share the concerns raised by advocates, writing that migrants returned to northern mexico risk substantial harm, even death, while they await adjudication of their applications for asylum."}
{"original": "u.s. district judge william a. fletcher, who was appointed by president clinton, said in his majority opinion that the asylum-seekers and legal groups the aclu is representing are likely to succeed on their two main challenges to the policy: that it violates the non-refoulement principle in international and u.s. law of not returning asylum-seekers to places where they may face persecution, and that a 1996 law the administration has been citing to defend the legality of the program does not allow officials to return all asylum-seekers to countries that border the u.s. like mexico."}
{"original": "circuit judge ferdinand fernandez, an appointee of president george h. w. bush, dissented."}
{"original": "officials across the administration denounced the initial ruling on friday. the trump administration has acted faithfully to implement a statutory authority provided by congress over two decades ago and signed into law by president clinton, a justice department spokesperson said in a statement. the ninth circuit's decision not only ignores the constitutional authority of congress and the administration for a policy in effect for over a year, but also extends relief beyond the parties before the court."}
{"original": "though he called the first order reckless, acting homeland security secretary chad wolf said his department has other tools to maintain the end of catch and release, presumably referring to recently created rapid deportation programs, as well as deals with countries in central america's northern triangle that allow the u.s. to re-route asylum-seekers there."}

{"original": "democratic congresswoman veronica escobar, who represents the border district in el paso, praised the 9th circuit's initial decision. but she called for more than a halt to the policy. dhs must now follow the law, issue guidance for the nearly 60,000 asylum-seekers who have been returned to mexico, employ alternatives to detention, and guarantee the humane treatment of all asylum-seekers, escobar said in a statement."}
{"original": "as a result of the mpp policy, tens of thousands of asylum-seekers from central america, cuba, venezuela and other latin american countries who would otherwise be in the u.s. are stranded in overcrowded shelters and squalid makeshift encampments in northern mexico, including in crime-ridden cities like ciudad juárez and matamoros, located in a region the u.s. government warns american travelers not to visit due to rampant violence."}
{"original": "advocates and even some of the asylum officers implementing the program have been withering in their criticism of remain in mexico, saying it violates international obligations against returning migrants seeking refuge to dangerous places. the group human rights first has denounced hundreds of reported kidnappings and assaults."}
{"original": "a cbs news series last summer detailed the due process concerns about the policy, which makes it extremely difficult for migrants to secure u.s.-based lawyers generally needed for successful asylum claims. according to data by researchers at syracuse university, only about 5% of migrants in the program have had lawyers represent them in proceedings in the u.s. — which, for many migrants, now occur inside makeshift tent-like courts in the rio grande valley."}
{"original": "out of about 35,500 completed cases in the program, only 263 migrants have been granted asylum or some other form of protection, according to syracuse university's transactional records access clearinghouse (trac)."}
{"original": "despite the criticism, the administration has defended the remain in mexico program as an effective tool in reducing border apprehensions, which have dropped for eight consecutive months since may."}
{"original": "the policy had been briefly blocked by a federal judge in april, but the 9th circuit ruled in may that the administration could proceed with the policy as it considered the merits of the legal challenge mounted by several advocacy groups. after the panel's decision, the administration dramatically expanded the program with the consent of the mexican government, which accepted the expansion last summer after mr. trump threatened to impose tariffs."}
{"original": "in a separate ruling on friday, another panel in the 9th circuit upheld a lower court injunction that has blocked a rule that would render migrants who cross the border in between ports of entry ineligible for asylum."}
{"original": "once again the courts have recognized there is tremendous danger facing asylum seekers along the entire southern border, and that the administration cannot unilaterally rewrite the laws, said lee gelernt, the top aclu attorney in that case."}
{"original": "the idea that the federal reserve might take interest rates below zero in hopes of stimulating economic growth has recently picked up steam in financial markets. on wednesday, fed chair janet yellen acknowledged that she's not certain the central bank could legally implement the scenario."}
{"original": "during her testimony to the house financial services committee, yellen said she did not foresee the federal open markets committee (fomc) being in a situation anytime soon where it would see a need to cut rates. still, the possibility of negative rates is something the fed should look at, given europe's experience, she added."}
{"original": "the european central bank and the bank of japan recently reduced their benchmark rates into negative terrain in an effort to add further stimulus."}
{"original": "the issue has presented itself in the u.s. amid worries about the global economy and what tools the fed has at its disposal to fight another downturn, given it only in december hiked short-term interest rates off record lows for the first time since 2006."}
{"original": "responding to questions from lawmakers, yellen said: i am not aware of anything that would prevent us from doing it, but i'm saying we have not fully investigated the legal issues -- that still needs to be done."}
{"original": "i would say that remains a question that we would still need to investigate more thoroughly, yellen added."}
{"original": "the question in question is whether or not the law that gives the fed the power to pay banks interest on reserve balances deposited at the fed -- the financial services regulatory relief act of 2006 -- also empowers it to charge interest."}
{"original": "for yellen, the issue goes beyond one of legality. could the plumbing of the payment system in the united states handle it? is our institutional structure of our money markets compatible with it? we've not determined that."}
{"original": "but from yellen's public stance, the fed continues to anticipate a gradual rise in rates by the central bank, even as the recent upheaval in the markets and uncertainty about global economic growth could take the fed off course from the four increases that had been forecast by the fed this year."}
{"original": "the monetary policy makers next gathering to mull a rate increase comes at a two-day session starting march 15."}
{"original": "while yellen is not ruling out an increase next month, fed funds futures are pricing in no hikes this year."}

{"original": "the justice department on saturday night filed an appeal to a court order halting president trump's travel ban, requesting that implementation of the controversial executive order resume immediately."}
{"original": "the 125-page filing states that friday night's injunction harms the public by thwarting enforcement of an executive order issued by the president, based on his national security judgment."}
{"original": "the justice department lawyers write that mr. trump has determined that '[d]eteriorating conditions in certain countries due to war, strife, disaster, and civil unrest increase the likelihood that terrorists will use any means possible to enter the united states,' and that our nation accordingly must take additional steps 'to ensure that those approved for admission do not intend to harm americans and that they have no ties to terrorism.'"}
{"original": "the initial injunction, handed down by u.s. district judge james robart in seattle, effectively paused all implementation of mr. trump's signed executive order, which prohibited entry into the u.s. to all refugees and citizens from seven countries with muslim-majority populations."}
{"original": "the ruling was the result of a lawsuit brought by the states of washington and minnesota against the trump administration challenging the ban. robart issued a temporary restraining order to pause its implementation until the case was heard, saying the states had legal standing to contest the president's directive and had showed their case was likely to succeed."}
{"original": "the departments of state and homeland security complied immediately with the order by the seattle-based judge."}

{"original": "for years, the federal reserve has kept interest rates low to spur investment and encourage individuals to borrow. but that policy, an effort to boost economic growth after the 2008 financial crisis, has come at a cost for the millions of americans with savings accounts."}
{"original": "that has been especially painful for people living on fixed incomes, such as retirees. a decade ago, a high-yield savings account with a balance of $25,000 would have generated $1,150.62 in annual interest. today, consumers are lucky to find accounts paying 1.05 percent interest, which would generate annual interest payments of $263.88, or almost $900 less than a decade ago, according to a study from financial site nerdwallet."}
{"original": "extrapolated to the national level, that means savings account holders have missed out on $7.7 billion in interest during the last decade, nerdwallet said."}
{"original": "yet while workers and retirees have had even less of an incentive to sock away money in the low-interest rate environment, they're saving a bit more than they did a decade ago -- about 5.2 percent of disposable income now, compared with 3.3 percent in 2006. placing that money in a savings account might not be the best choice on a number of levels, nerdwallet banking expert devan goldstein said."}
{"original": "with rates as low as they have been, your savings might not keep up with inflation, he said. we all need a savings account, but it might actually cost you money to save when you measure it against inflation. that was stunning to of all of us."}
{"original": "even though americans are saving more than in 2006, it's still not enough to create the three-to-six month cushion that financial experts recommend. about four out of 10 american households don't have enough liquid savings to handle a $2,000 expense, the pew charitable trusts found in a 2015 study. about eight of 10 admitted they have lower savings than households similar to theirs should have."}
{"original": "even though nerdwallet found that americans are saving more than they did a decade ago, goldstein cautions that the numbers may reflect the considerable gains experienced by america's top earners, whose income growth has far outpaced those in the middle- and lower income brackets."}
{"original": "the first step for most americans is simply to start saving more, with goldstein recommending a beginning goal of socking away 10 percent of income, and looking beyond savings accounts for a more lucrative haven."}
{"original": "it's a reality that people who have fixed incomes do rely on savings accounts. that's something we would recommend against, he said. somewhere in the toolkit between savings accounts and an index fund is a low-risk but slightly higher return vehicle."}
{"original": "those include bond funds, annuities and cds. other options to consider are alternatives such as real estate or precious metals, goldstein noted. each of these products carry their own risks and may not be appropriate for everyone. others might limit liquidity, such as cds, which require investors to tie up their money for a period of time."}
{"original": "with the fed evaluating a series of rate hikes, it's possible that savings account rates will go up, and we want to help people to be prepared by having good savings habits right now, goldstein said."}
{"original": "tony, great to have you on the show."}
{"original": "thanks, mike. great to be with you."}
{"original": "tony, you have a particularly interesting story about how you came to be interested in foreign policy. can you share that with us?"}
{"original": "yes. you know, i think we're all sort of products of the conversations we hear around the dining room table, the kitchen table in our families. and in my family, a lot of the stories were about the fact that so many of the people that came before me were refugees or immigrants of one kind or another. i had a grandfather who came here at the turn of the last century fleeing pilgrims in what's now ukraine, was welcome to the united states, built a life for himself, for his children, a stepmother who fled communism, literally, in the dead of night on a train, made her way, at a very young age with her mother, to the united states."}
{"original": "she, too, was welcome here. and, then, finally, my stepfather who passed away a few years ago, he was one of 900 children in his school in bialystok, poland before world war ii, the only one of those 900 to survive. his entire immediate family was wiped. bialystok was the center of jewish living in poland."}
{"original": "he wound up in virtually all of the concentration camps one can remember from history, auschwitz, dachau, majdanek. at the very end of the war, he made a run for it. they were on a death march out of one of the camps in bavaria. and he made a run for it with some of his friends. and somehow, they made it into the woods."}
{"original": "how old was he at the time?"}
{"original": "at this point, he was 16. so he was in the camps from age 12 to 16. and somehow, they made it to the woods. and they hid out during the day and moved around at night. and after a few days of this, one day, they heard this rumbling sound. and as he looked out from their hiding place, what he saw was a tank."}
{"original": "but instead of having the dreaded iron cross or a swastika on it, he saw something else. he saw a five-pointed white star. and in a kind of crazy way, he ran to the tank. and the hatch opened up. and an african american gi looked down at him. and he got down on his knees. and he said the only three words that he knew in english that his mother had taught him before the war, god bless america. and at that point, the gi lifted him into the tank into freedom, in effect, into the united states. that was kind of the image that i had of my country growing up, what it represented to people around the world. and i think that's what motivated me as much as anything else to get into foreign policy."}
{"original": "so i don't want to jump too far ahead. but what we're seeing in our country now with the feelings about immigrants and refugees must cut to the core with you."}
{"original": "it does. and, you know, on the one hand, look, i think we all get it. people feel a tremendous sense of confusion right now and chaos and a loss of identity. they don't recognize themselves. they don't recognize the country. and it's deeply, deeply, deeply confusing."}
{"original": "at the same time, we know from our own history that we've gone through successive waves of migration each of which has made the country stronger but each of which, at different points in history, had a counterweight whether it was irish, whether it was italians, whether it was jews, whether it was asians, whether it's latinos."}
{"original": "and we know that this is incredibly disruptive. and it takes some time to sort it all out. each time, it's made the country stronger. but during these periods of transition, it's tough. and we have to find a way forward that works for all of our communities as well as working for the people that want to come here."}
{"original": "so in those previous moments of backlash, how did we emerge from them?"}
{"original": "you know, in these previous moments, there was a transition period. and it was challenging. and i don't want to minimize the disruptions that took place. but there was a recognition the economy might improve as we saw success, as we saw what immigrants were bringing to the country. there was a recognition that this made sense for america. now, when we look across the broad swath of the economy, look at every pursuit. who are the folks who are picking our crops?"}
{"original": "who are the folks serving food at our tables, cleaning our homes and, then, as you move up the ladder, nursing the sick in underserved communities, doctoring them and, then, at the highest end, half of our fortune 500 companies foundered or co-foundered by immigrants or the sons and daughters of immigrants, half of the startups in silicon valley, the same thing."}
{"original": "so we see the success time and time again. but now, in this particular moment, these disruptive forces are more intense and more acute than they've been. and you get a feeling things are just moving in fast motion. and it's very hard for people to be grounded and have a sense that they're going to come out okay on the other side."}
{"original": "so with this historical understanding, are you confident that we're going to come out the other end here?"}
{"original": "look, this could be the exception that breaks the rule. it's hard to be fully confident. you know, i'm reminded of the late john mccain who said, it's always darkest before it goes completely black. but all of that said, i don't believe that."}
{"original": "i think that most of us have a sense of optimism based on our history because we've been through incredibly tough periods before. the 1960s, to take a recent example, the late 1960s were far more disruptive than the period that we're going through now. the dawn of the progressive era, to me, this is maybe most closely approximate to that."}
{"original": "we had, before the progressive era, capitalism fully unleashed in this country producing tremendous wealth and, in many ways, tremendous progress but also in a way that was not evenly distributed, that was leaving too many people out, too many people behind."}
{"original": "and thankfully, we had a progressive era in which the rough edges of capitalism were rounded off. more people were brought into the mix. we made major investments in education, in healthcare, in infrastructure, progressive taxation. now, in a sense, we need a progressive era but on a global scale. that's really the change of the moment to figure out how we can take these incredible forces that are at play, bringing tremendous advantages globalization, but in way that doesn't leave too many people out of the deal."}
{"original": "yeah. so i heard warren buffet say not long ago, you know how there's things that people say that stay with you for the rest of your life, this was one of those moments, he said, i believe that capitalism was the greatest force for good in the history of mankind, which i believe, too. and, then, he said, but i fear we're going to lose it unless we take care of the people that it leaves behind."}
{"original": "i couldn't agree more. there is a crisis of legitimacy for capitalism that we're going through now. and, again, we've been through it before. this is what happened before the progressive era. it happened before the new deal. and in a sense, it's happening now but, again, on a global scale."}
{"original": "and we figured out how to get through these periods before. now, could this be different? absolutely. at each big transformation there was a transitional period. and somehow, we wound up on the other side in a better place. that may still happen. but you still have to get to the other side. and that's the challenge we're in now."}
{"original": "okay. then, the impact of all of this on our foreign policy and our role in the world, how do you think about that?"}
{"original": "well, i think there's increasingly recognition that whatever foreign policy we pursue, it actually has to work for people here at home. and if it doesn't, then, it's going to be very difficult to sustain it. and so, for example, if we have a foreign trade policy, an economic policy that's not also working to materially improve the lives of the people here, it's not going to be sustained."}
{"original": "if we have a foreign policy that people perceive is somehow getting us into problems that we shouldn't be involved in, that may be difficult to sustain as well. so being clear with our fellow citizens explaining what we're doing, why we're doing it, what the objectives are, how it's going to actually make their lives better is usually important. but, mike, i'd say another thing, we shouldn't be a prisoner to history. but we should at least be informed by it. and i think the period after world war ii was hugely instructive and remains very instructive because that was a period in time when, after the war, we could've retreated as we did after world war i."}
{"original": "we could've pulled back. or we could've used the tremendous power that we had to, basically, lord it over others. and we didn't do either of those things. famously, we spent time building the institutions, developing the norms, the rules that others live by but also ourselves. and that seemed counterintuitive."}
{"original": "and spending a tremendous amount of money rebuilding our enemies."}
{"original": "absolutely. but here's what we got out of it, we did, we invested in their prosperity. we invested in their security. but we got new markets for our products. we got new partners to deal with global challenges. we got new allies to deter aggression. those investments, we got ten, 20, 100 times over in return. and that's why, as we think about today, we shouldn't be blind to what we did in the past because it does hold lessons."}
{"original": "so, tony, one of the things that i worry about is that we national security folk, foreign policy folk, have a hard time articulating for the average american why america's role in the world is so important to them. i mean, i've been places in the country where people say to me, mr. morell, why does it matter what vladimir putin does in ukraine? or why does it matter what the chinese do in the south china sea? how does that affect me? how do you answer that question?"}
{"original": "you know, i spent about 25 years in government. and one of the things i took away is this, the world doesn't govern itself. and over the past 70-plus years, the united states has played a lead role in helping to govern the world, again, establishing the institutions but also defending them, helping to put in place the rules and the norms."}
{"original": "and we know this, if we're not doing it, if we're not playing a lead role, then, one of two things: either someone else will and probably not in a way that advances our interests and values or even worse, perhaps, no one does. and, then, the forces of anarchy and chaos prevail. and in the past when that's happened, that's created big global conflagrations world war i, world war ii."}
{"original": "it's pay now or pay a lot more later. and the other thing i'd say is this, we have extraordinary resources in this country. and with those resources, with that wealth, with that success i think comes a certain amount of responsibility to at least do our part in advancing the common good. but it's also something called enlightened self-interest. yes, it's doing right by others. but, ultimately, that does well by us."}
{"original": "okay. let's do an around the world kind of hotspots approach. and as we do these, tony, i would ask you to kind of assess the situation, assess the trump administration's approach to that issue. and if you disagree with it, say what would you recommend to the president instead. okay. so let's start with saudi arabia."}
{"original": "saudi arabia, i think the administration has missed a tremendous opportunity to use a horrific, terrible event, the murder of this journalist, khashoggi, to use that as a way to influence saudi behavior and saudi policies in a way that better reflect our interests and our values. there was a moment to go to saudi arabia and say a few things. one, your new leader or de facto leader, the crown prince, acts in impulsive and sometimes reckless ways."}
{"original": "we're not telling you who should lead your country. but we are telling you he needs to be reined in in some fashion. you choose how. second, this horrific war in yemen that is doing extraordinary damage to tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of innocent civilians, that needs to end."}
{"original": "you need to actually take the first step in helping to end it. we're here to defend you. we will defend you from any aggression by the houthis in yemen. but you need to take steps to end this war. and we won't be complicit in it anymore."}
{"original": "third, this crazy division with qatar, that needs to end. you need to resolve it. and you also need to demonstrate to the world that the things you're talking about in terms of liberalizing your country you mean. and that means letting people who've been simply trying to advance and advocate for their rights out of jail."}
{"original": "there was a moment to do all of that. that moment seems to have been squandered. saudi arabia seems to have a blank check. this is not about ending the alliance or the partnership with saudi arabia. it is making sure that the alliance actually reflects our interests and our values not just saudi arabia's."}
{"original": "your view on the likelihood that mohammad bin salman is going to change, because, i mean, there's been such a pattern here of reckless behavior. right? and it seems to flow from both an arrogance and a paranoia. and people who have paranoia, as they get older, it tends not to go away. so i'm really wondering here about how likely he is to change, ultimately."}
{"original": "look, i'm skeptical, which is why i think saudi arabia needs a governor on his impulsiveness and his recklessness of their choice -- whether it's a regent, whether it's a council, something. but look, he is whatever he is, 33, 34 now. i don't want to rule that out either."}
{"original": "you know, i met him when he was 29. he had just become defense minister. and this was just after the houthi aggression taking over sana'a and yemen and then, moving on the rest of the country. and then, the saudis and the emirates intervened with our backing. and i was dispatched to saudi arabia to say two things. one was to make it clear that we were committed to saudi arabia's defense if they were attacked in any way by the houthis, we would be there."}
{"original": "but two was to ask them, 'what are you trying to accomplish in yemen? what's the strategic objective?' and the answer i got from mohammad bin salman in the meeting with him was, immediately, 'to remove every last vestige or iranian influence in yemen,' to which i responded, 'good luck, not going to happen.'"}
{"original": "my hope is that with experience, including the experience of what he has brought on himself through this horrific, horrific action and murder of a journalist, that if he's going to remain around, that he learns something from it. but the jury's out."}
{"original": "we'll see. just across the persian gulf, iran."}
{"original": "look, i think the irony with iran is that we have a lot of problems and challenges posed by iran including its support for terrorism, including its meddling in various countries in the region, including, of course, its abysmal record at home on human rights. the irony is this: the one thing we got right, actually curbing its nuclear weapons program and putting a check on it, is the one thing we just tore up -- which makes no sense. and now, it actually makes it more difficult to deal with the other challenges posed by iran."}
{"original": "two reasons, first, i think the reason the obama administration focused like a laser on trying to deal with the problem that was an urgent problem, which was iran having the capacity to move to a nuclear weapon very, very quickly, to have the capacity to have enough fissile material on very short order to build a weapon was urgent, because of the immediate threat that that would pose if they actually developed a weapon -- but also because it would allow them to act with even greater impunity in these other areas where they posed a threat to our interests and to what we were trying to achieve in the region. now, i think we have the worst of both worlds. iran, for the time being, continues to abide by its obligations under the deal. it's trying to see if it can get the economic benefits it bargained for from europe and from other countries. and we'll see if that's sustainable."}
{"original": "what i worry about it this, given the administration's efforts to squeeze iran economically and to use the leverage that we have with our economy to force other countries to abandon any kind of economic relationship with iran, at some point, those in iran who are against the nuclear deal from the beginning will reassert themselves and say, we're no longer abiding by our obligations. and, then, mike, we'll be right back where we were before we got into the deal which is iran on the threshold of having enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon. and we'll be faced with the binary choice that we tried to avoid."}
{"original": "right. right. and we're sending a signal, a very strong signal, whether it's the policy or not, i don't know. but we're sending a signal that we're all about regime change. and if you're the iranians, why would you ever negotiate with people who want you to go away?"}
{"original": "that's right. that's right. the idea that iran is now going to do more and get less under duress doesn't make any sense."}
{"original": "afghanistan -- we've been there for 17 years."}
{"original": "this is one of the toughest problems and i think one of the most enduring frustrations that i've had. and i have to acknowledge here that i actually think president trump's instincts are probably right on this, which is, it's time. it's time to cut the cord."}
{"original": "and this goes against a lot of, i think, instincts that a lot of us have because we know what the taliban regime meant to the people of afghanistan -- and not in a good way. we know that real progress has been made in improving the lives of people in afghanistan. at the same time, the position we're in is not sustainable."}
{"original": "and where i'm particularly frustrated is this --and you'll remember this well -- virtually every year, we would hear from our colleagues, we just need one more year, just one more year. and it will be self-sustaining. the afghans will be able to fend for themselves."}
{"original": "the military will be able to control the security situation along with the police. and year after year, it was just one more year. i think our finger's been in the dyke in afghanistan for a long time. i, obviously, worry what will happen when we take it out. but i also think that, at this point, it's just not sustainable."}
{"original": "and we also have to remember why we were there in first place. as much as one can appreciate some of the successes that the international community had in improving the lives of afghans, the bottom-line, hard reality is that we were there because of 9/11 and because of al qaeda. and that threat has been, if not eliminated, significantly reduced to the point where i think it can be contained without having 15,000 americans in afghanistan."}
{"original": "i mean, one of the ways i think about it is to ask if we weren't there now, would we go? and the answer to that is no."}
{"original": "i think you've got it right."}
{"original": "absolutely. russia, putin's aggression on a number of fronts, right, whether it's with his neighbors, whether it's what he's doing in syria, whether it's what he is doing in terms of weaponizing social media, a whole bunch of issues. how do we deal with that?"}
{"original": "putin is playing a losing hand brilliantly. russia, by virtually every metric, is actually in decline. and, yet, he succeeded in reasserting russia on the world stage, to some extent to distract from problems at home, to some extent to try to realize a vision that he has of a greater russia, but mostly i think for this reason -- the biggest threat to putin's continued leadership in russia is really the success of democracy."}
{"original": "and that's true, by the way, for just about any autocrat. and he has a profound strategic interest in trying to demonstrate to his own people that democracies are failing, that our system is no better than his. it's not delivering better results. to the contrary, it's chaotic, not stable. and so, unfortunately, whether we like it or not and even if we pull back and didn't engage russian aggression, i believe he would continue to try to create trouble in europe, in the united states, within our societies and between them. so this is a huge challenge for us."}
{"original": "how do we engage him in a way that makes this much better?"}
{"original": "a few things. first of all, let's take ukraine and let's take russian aggression with regard to some of its neighbors. first, i think it's a good thing that we expanded nato. there's a big argument over whether nato expansion actually has provoked russian behavior."}
{"original": "i asked myself where would the baltic states be right now if they were not in nato? where would poland, hungary, the czech republic be in their own ways? i think that's proved to be a tremendous deterrent to russian aggression. but states like ukraine that are not in it, there's a reason that we got involved in leading the effort to put pressure on russia to stop its aggression, and, we hope, actually return sovereignty to ukraine. and it's not because on a basic level ukraine, itself, is that critical to the united states or to countries in europe. it's because the norms that were violated in terms of aggressing a democratic country on russia's borders, changing its borders by force, trying to dictate to people their choices about with whom they would ally or associate, if you allow that to stand, it is an open invitation to aggression and anarchy throughout the world."}
{"original": "so we have to stand up against that. and i think sustaining that is important. and we've sustained it. and the trump administration, despite what the president says, the administration, itself, has sustained it. but at home, we have to do a much better job, of course, at defending our democratic institutions from the kind of meddling not only in the elections in 2016 but everything that's followed since."}
{"original": "and i think we've got a couple of big challenges there. first, we're not properly defended. second, we don't have a clear and effective deterrence policy. we need to actually be very clear about what we'll actually do if we're attacked, and mean it and actually do it. and, then, we probably have to look at how we would use these tools ourselves, and also what the right responses would be. and they may well be asymmetric, responding tit for tat, for example, against some kind of cyber--"}
{"original": "the problem, of course, is that politics has got in the middle of this issue, right, and has not allowed the discussion that you want to have on this to actually occur."}
{"original": "this should've been a unifying issue. this should've brought people together because the attack is not on democrats or on republicans or anyone else. it's on our democracy. and that's the one thing that should unite us. and, unfortunately, that's what we're losing right now."}
{"original": "so on north korea, look, i think that there was some merit in president trump throwing the deck of cards up in the air and seeing what came from it, because the fact of the matter is the policy that successive administrations have pursued over the last decades has not worked."}
{"original": "north korea's gotten more dangerous, not less dangerous. its arsenal has gotten bigger, not smaller. and so, at some point, you say, maybe it's worth trying something new. and i don't object to direct diplomacy even with someone as heinous kim jong un. but, unfortunately, thus far at least, the art of the deal has really been the art of the steal and all in north korea's favor."}
{"original": "i think the president in having the meeting with kim jong un gave kim jong un something that he deeply, deeply valued and that none of his predecessors were able to get. and that was the legitimacy that comes from meeting with the leader of the free world being on the same stage."}
{"original": "that was the questioned they always asked, he and his father, when can i meet with the president? when can i meet with the president?"}
{"original": "so president trump would say, see, i did something that no previous president did. well, there was a good reason that previous presidents didn't do it. or if you're going to do it, at least make sure you're getting something. and, unfortunately, thus far at least, we haven't."}
{"original": "north korea's program has continued. we continue to see reports in the press from our intelligence agencies and others showing that far from pulling back, they're moving forward. at the same time in elevating kim jong un, in declaring success and even saying, at one point, that the nuclear problem was resolved, the president gave a green light to other countries, starting with china, to go back to something approaching business as usual. what had been working and where the administration deserves credit was it not only continued, but it actually deepened the pressure program that the obama administration put in place to cut off every economic tie that north korea had, diplomatic ties, political ties. and that was starting to have an effect."}
{"original": "china, of course, is a key to that. now, the president has, basically, said to china, hey, if the problem's resolved, why should china have to continue doing this?"}
{"original": "the chinese, the russians and the south koreans have all loosened up."}
{"original": "that's exactly right. that's exactly right. you know, again, i give him some points for trying a different playbook, the way he's played it, i think, is making things worse, not better."}
{"original": "how would you fix that? i mean, if you could say to mike pompeo, here's what i think you need to do?"}
{"original": "look, i think we were on the right track. and we need to figure out a way to get back to it, which was a sustained pressure campaign that's internationally coordinated but that has an objective not of regime change but conduct change. the hard reality is it's, if not impossible, highly unlikely that we will achieve in any near term the complete denuclearization of north korea. i just don't see that as realistic in the near term."}
{"original": "what i think we can get is an arms control and, over time, disarmament process put in place. but that requires enough pressure, sustained and comprehensive to get north korea to the table. and that requires china. it requires south korea. it requires russia. it requires others. it's doable. but it takes time. it has to be sustained. and it has to be comprehensive. so there's a play there. but we haven't seen signs of the administration being willing to do it."}
{"original": "okay. the toughest one of all, china. right. what should our strategic approach to china be?"}
{"original": "we had an approach for decades that sought to bring china more and more into the international system starting with the international economy on theory that this would actually liberalize china at the same time. and thus far, at least, that theory has not borne out."}
{"original": "now, history is long -- especially chinese history. so maybe we're assessing the situation too soon. but clearly, the consensus that had developed over the right approach, the responsible stakeholder approach right now, at least, is in serious doubt. but i still think the basics of what we were trying to do, which was work to cooperate with china where we can, compete with it where we must but compete in a way that has a level playing field and basic fairness, is still the right approach."}
{"original": "but now, we're stuck in a different dynamic. and that is a veering wildly between confrontation on the one hand and abdication on the other hand. so on the one hand, a very confrontational approach over trade and related issues which is not wrong in the sense that the lack of reciprocity in the commercial relationship was totally un-sustained."}
{"original": "these are real issues. the president was right to confront the issue, i think profoundly wrong in the way he's doing it; throwing out the trans-pacific partnership, a huge strategic mistake. this was our best lever to change chinese behavior. 40% of world gdp with us in it represented, something that china would want to get into, not stay out of, that's gone. not making common cause with our allies who are similarly situated when it comes to china, who are aggrieved in the same way with technology transfer, the theft of intellectual property, the lack of transparency, unfair competition from state-owned enterprises."}
{"original": "we should've been on the same team with them. instead, of course, starting a tariff war against our closest partners has made that more difficult. but that needs to be dealt with. but i think that as we're doing that, we can't abdicate our leadership in the region."}
{"original": "and, again, out of tpp is an abdication of our leadership. telling our allies, 'you know what, you're going to be on your own. we don't want to pay for this anymore,' that's an abdication of leadership. and if there's a vacuum, look, what have we seen? a profound irony."}
{"original": "we've seen xi jinping try to assert himself as a leader of the global community who is in favor of a free and open trading system, who supports globalization, who supports the united nations, peacekeeping, whose voting shares are increasing in the international financial institutions at the same time when we're pulling back from all of that. and that means that, again, in the absence of american leadership, in the absence of an american model, a chinese model could win by default not because it's better."}
{"original": "so one of the two outcomes you talked about earlier."}
{"original": "right. right. tony, you have been fantastic with your time. i just want to ask you one final question. you worked very closely with two people who may run for president in 2020, joe biden and john kerry. what i'd love to hear you talk about a little bit is how would a biden foreign policy or a kerry foreign policy be different from an obama foreign policy because i think most people think it would be exactly the same. and i'm just wondering what you think."}
{"original": "look, i can't speak for either secretary kerry or vice president biden when it comes to what policies they would pursue if they, you know, were to continue in public life in some fashion. i think, in fact, in either case, the basic principles were the same."}
{"original": "but we're also in a different moment. and it's the moment we talked about at the very outset, a moment in which there are people in our own country, people in allied countries, people around the world who are feeling a sense of chaos, confusion and vulnerability because of the rapidity and profundity of change, technological change, the flow of information, at the same time, a paradox when, by so many metrics, we're better off than we've ever been in history and, yet, too many people left out and left behind in that situation."}
{"original": "the best way to look at it is, on the one hand, over the last 30 to 40 years extraordinary success in alleviating poverty around the world. and, yet, inequality is growing at the same time. and those two things put together create a lot of disaffected people either economically or culturally and, then, finally, huge power shifts not only among countries but beyond them, between them, the rise of china that we talked about but also super empowered groups and individuals, corporate chieftains, the mayors of megacities, all of these new actors making it more difficult for nation states to get the results that they would get in the past. that's an increasingly new reality. and technology's driving a lot of it."}
{"original": "but the next president's going to have adjust to."}
{"original": "the next president, whoever it is, has to deal with that. and i think that, again, this comes down to a president who understands that whatever foreign policy we pursue, it has to actually work for people here at home. it has to show them that it's making their own lives safer, more prosperous. and, ultimately, that's the test."}
{"original": "tony, thank you for being with us."}
{"original": "great to be with you, mike, as always."}
{"original": "president donald trump and his economic advisers focus on trade deficits when it comes to china, and mr. trump has said a trade war would be easy to win. but trade relationships — and their impacts — are far more complex."}
{"original": "chinese data released overnight show the trade gap between the world's two largest economies was at a record high in 2018, and it may signal a broader global economic slowdown, according to economists. an alarming point in the latest chinese trade data was a slowdown in the country's exports in december, shrinking by 4.5 percent to $221.2 billion, while imports declined 7.2 percent to $164.2 billion."}
{"original": "that led global stock markets to slide in monday trading as fears mounted that global growth is slowing. in the u.s., the s&p 500 lost 0.5 percent, and the dow industrials fell 0.4 percent."}
{"original": "here's a rundown on what the latest numbers show."}
{"original": "china's 2018 trade surplus with the u.s. surged to a record $323.3 billion. that means the u.s. purchased that much more in goods and services from china than it shipped to the country."}
{"original": "mr. trump's trade war with beijing may be starting to take a toll both at home and in china, even though the white house is holding back on additional tariff measures until march while the two sides try to negotiate a trade deal. u.s. and chinese officials ended a three-day negotiating session last week with no sign of agreements or word on what their next step would be."}
{"original": "but penalties of up to 25 percent already imposed on billions of dollars of each other's goods remain in place, raising the cost for american and chinese buyers of soybeans, medical equipment and consumer goods, from purses and bicycles to furniture and tech gear."}
{"original": "tariffs are taxes paid by companies, not countries, to import goods and services. yet tariffs are just one of the many factors in china's slowing growth, economists at capital economics wrote in a note to clients. they estimate a cooler chinese economy could cut about 0.2 percentage points off global gdp in 2019 compared to the 2018 pace. other experts have pointed to a potential hit to the u.s. economy from the current partial government shutdown."}
{"original": "admittedly, u.s. tariffs may have played a small part in the sharp fall in china's export growth last month, the capital economics economists wrote. but growth in exports to the rest of the world also slowed significantly, indicating that softer demand was the main culprit, and that a trade truce with the u.s. would be no guarantee of a strong recovery."}
{"original": "the trade figures were another sign that growth in the global economy is slowing too, weighing on stocks, the capital economics wrote. it expects economies in europe and the booming u.s. to slip this year."}
{"original": "what does it mean for the u.s.?"}
{"original": "in the u.s., consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 percent of economic activity. american households also save far less than their counterparts in europe and asia. the personal savings rate among americans has hovered at less than 5 percent for years as their spending has boomed, according to the federal bureau of economic analysis."}
{"original": "an overwhelming majority of economists point to the high consumption levels and low savings rates in the u.s. as a major determinant of large u.s. trade deficits in general, and china in particular, michelle casario, an associate professor at villanova university, said in an email to cbs moneywatch."}
{"original": "tax cuts passed signed into law in late 2017 by mr. trump likely gave the u.s. economy a quick lift last year by boosting disposable income. that means americans are spending even more, while the tax cuts are ballooning the u.s. budget deficit. that could have consequences down the line as the pace of spending will likely slow as the impact of the tax cuts fades."}
{"original": "the trump tax cuts not only increased the budget deficit, they also increased disposable income, at least for now, which increases consumption, casario said. the irony here is that the tax cuts indirectly increased the trade deficit, which has been at the center of trump's policy agenda."}
{"original": "unless the large federal budget deficit shrinks and the low savings rate rises, the u.s. will continue to experience the world's largest trade deficit, casario said. tariffs do not reduce trade deficits, they simply reduce (or have the potential to reduce) trade flows. the asymmetries in trade will persist."}
{"original": "year-end stockpiling may also be a factor"}
{"original": "another reason for the trade deficit's jump last year is that u.s. firms may have hiked their imports of chinese goods in reaction to mr. trump's threat to increase tariffs before he postponed them until march in a december decision."}
{"original": "some companies have shifted production of goods bound for the u.s. from china to avoid u.s. tariffs. others are lining up non-chinese suppliers of industrial components and may have rushed to get some in hand before year-end."}
{"original": "in anticipation of tariffs, u.s. firms increased their orders from china to avoid the higher costs of imports, villanova's casario said. this may continue as u.s. businesses are concerned that trump will increase the tariffs on the most recent $200 billion from 10 percent to 25 percent, and/or levy tariffs on an additional $250 billion."}
{"original": "at the same time, chinese leaders are trying to reduce the country's economic reliance on trade and stoke self-sustaining growth based on domestic consumer spending. but their plans call for keeping exports stable to avoid politically dangerous job losses."}
{"original": "mr. trump could use the latest trade deficit report as ammunition to boost tariff rates or add new ones after the march 1 truce deadline, casario said."}
{"original": "as china's growth slows, it's investing less in the u.s."}
{"original": "chinese direct investment in the u.s. plummeted to $4.8 billion last year after a steep decline in 2017 to $29 billion, itself a sharp drop from a record-high $46 billion in 2016, a report released over the weekend from rhodium group shows."}
{"original": "past free-trade agreements gave foreign companies incentive to invest in the u.s., typically in manufacturing and in startup companies. that created more u.s. jobs. but imposing tariffs can make it difficult for a country and its companies to invest in the u.s."}
{"original": "policies such as how the u.s. uses the committee on foreign investment in the u.s., known as cfius, to more tightly examine transactions with chinese companies pushed abandoned deals to an all-time high, the rhodium report said."}

{"original": "bp (bp) has cut chief executive bob dudley's 2016 pay package by 40 percent to $11.6 million, the latest british bluechip company to rein in executive pay after a wave of shareholder revolts."}
{"original": "the oil company has reduced dudley's payout and introduced changes from this year that will lower executives' performance incentives. the cuts come after around 60 percent of shareholders opposed bp's pay policy at last year's annual general meeting."}
{"original": "executive pay has come under growing scrutiny in britain after a string of corporate scandals, such as the collapse of store chain bhs, which has fueled mistrust of the high levels of pay awarded to company bosses."}
{"original": "we applaud the bp remuneration committee for being proactive in responding to the shareholder revolt last year and see this as a milestone in the engagement between companies and shareholders, said ashley hamilton claxton, corporate governance manager at royal london asset management."}
{"original": "bp's pay policy changes, which will apply for the coming three years if approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting in london on may 17, include lowering dudley's maximum long-term payout to five times salary from seven times and cutting bonus payments by a quarter."}
{"original": "i have consulted widely with shareholders and listened to and sought to act on their concerns, and have been sensitive to developments in the society in which we work, ann dowling, chair of bp's remuneration committee, said in the company's annual report published on thursday."}
{"original": "dudley's 2016 pay cut was a result of downward discretion to the four components of his total pay, the company said."}
{"original": "even after a cut of nearly $8 million, dudley's pay remains well above that of rival european oil companies."}
{"original": "shell's ben van beurden was awarded an 8.263 million euro ($8.8 million) pay package for 2016, a 60 percent jump year on year, while total's patrick pouyanne took home 3.8 million euros last year."}
{"original": "bp chief financial officer brian gilvary's overall pay package will be cut by 18 percent to 4.2 million pounds ($5.2 million)."}
{"original": "other large british companies, such as reckitt benckiser and glaxosmithkline, have also cut executives' pay after shareholders had voiced concerns about their remuneration plans."}
{"original": "bp's annual report also showed the oil company cut a net amount of 2,400 jobs in 2016, after reducing 4,700 roles in 2015, as part of plans to rein in spending in response to weak oil prices."}
{"original": "washington -- janet yellen was put on the spot about whether she made a mistake in raising interest rates in december. ben bernanke was quizzed about what it felt like to be called a traitor by the governor of texas."}
{"original": "alan greenspan was asked if he purposely sought to confuse congress with his answers. and paul volcker was queried about being hung in effigy after he pushed interest rates to levels not seen since the civil war."}
{"original": "the event was an unprecedented gathering of leaders of the federal reserve -- past and present -- to discuss what it feels like to hold what is considered the world's most powerful economic policy-making job."}
{"original": "the four fed leaders appeared thursday evening at an event to launch a speaker's program honoring volcker at the international house in new york, a residential dormitory for foreign students. greenspan appeared by video link from washington."}
{"original": "together, the tenures of the four participants cover more than one-third of the fed's 102-year history. their leadership included the double-digit inflation of the 1970s, the global banking and financial market crises of the 1980s and 1990s and, beginning nearly a decade ago, the worst financial crisis and recession since the great depression."}
{"original": "fareed zakaria of cnn, who moderated the discussion, asked how the four felt in a job with so much concentrated power that opened them up to criticism when the economy was not doing well."}
{"original": "greenspan, who was often accused of trying to dodge tough questions at congressional hearings with big words and incredibly long sentences, did not deny employing that tactic. but he said, the real problem is that monetary policy is largely economic forecasting and our ability to forecast is limited. ... how do you convey what you know without going into the area of forecasting beyond our knowledge?"}
{"original": "bernanke said he didn't like it in 2011 when he was called a traitor by rick perry, who was then governor of texas and a republican presidential candidate. but he said he realized that criticism came with the job, especially in times when the fed was trying to pull the country out of the worst recession since the 1930s."}
{"original": "we had tremendous responsibilities to address these terrible risks, bernanke said. i didn't take the job for adulation."}
{"original": "volcker's policy of high interest rates contributed to pushing the country into two recessions in the early 1980s. but he said even with unhappy farmers and home builders attacking the central bank's policies, the fed could not have done what it did without broad support from the public for the central bank's attempts to deal with a prolonged bout stagflation, a toxic combination of high inflation and weak economic growth."}
{"original": "people were unhappy with malaise and inflation going up, volcker said. they felt we were doing something."}
{"original": "yellen, who succeeded bernanke in february 2014, was quizzed about whether she felt the fed's rate hike in december, a quarter-point move, had been a mistake. in january, the global economy slowed and financial markets went into a tailspin triggered by rising oil prices and increased weakness in china."}
{"original": "i certainly don't regard it as a mistake, yellen said. she said despite the global weakness, the u.s. economy remains on a solid course. she also disputed the suggestion that the fed's low rates could be fueling a bubble economy."}
{"original": "this is an economy on a solid course, not a bubble economy, she said, during the hour-long program."}
{"original": "yellen said that in december the fed indicated that the pace of future rate hikes would be gradual and she said that remained the fed's expectation. the central bank's quarter-point move in december was the first rate hike after seven years in which the benchmark rate was kept at a record low near zero. many private economists believe the next hike will not occur until june."}
{"original": "we think that a gradual pace of rate increases will be appropriate, yellen said. the prospects for continued growth and progress in the labor market look good."}
{"original": "all the fed leaders stressed that they had not acted alone but with the support of a large group of policymakers and a talented fed staff, but volcker said that didn't mean there were not times that they worried about their decisions."}
{"original": "i did worry. i worried all the time, volcker said."}
{"original": "he said he sometimes paced so much in his office that he worried about wearing a hole in the rug."}
{"original": "washington -- the senate has voted to confirm president donald trump's nominee to serve as u.s. trade representative, despite clear frustration among some republicans with the administration on trade."}
{"original": "the vote was 82-14 to confirm robert lighthizer."}
{"original": "he was deputy u.s. trade representative under president ronald reagan and has worked on trade issues as a lawyer representing various manufacturers and high-tech companies."}
{"original": "lighthizer will take his cues from a president who's broken with most republicans in his criticism of free trade agreements and who's spread the work on trade policy beyond the trade representative."}
{"original": "some of lighthizer's strongest support has come from democratic lawmakers."}
{"original": "sen. ron wyden of oregon says lighthizer not only understands how the global trading system works, but also how it sometimes breaks down."}
{"original": "sens. john mccain, r-arizona, and ben sasse, r-neb., announced their opposition to lighthizer a day before the vote because of his position on nafa."}
{"original": "senate majority leader mitch mcconnell's home in louisville, kentucky, was vandalized early saturday morning. spray-painted messages over the republican leader's front door appear to be in response to his opposition to increasing coronavirus relief checks to americans from $600 to $2,000."}
{"original": "one message reads weres (sic) my money, another, mitch kills the poor, according to photos shared by cbs louisville affiliate wlky-tv. mcconnell blocked a vote on increasing the checks for three days in a row last week, calling the proposal socialism for rich people."}
{"original": "mcconnell and the gop argue that the bill would benefit the wealthy. mcconnell, however, previously supported the $1 trillion 2017 tax cut, which disproportionately benefited the wealthy. the gop leader also takes issue with how much money the bill would cost the government. bigger checks would amount to an estimated $530 billion, about $385 billion more than what $600 checks would cost, according to heights securities. the senate, led by mcconnell, on friday approved a $740 billion defense policy bill known as the national defense authorization act, ndaa."}
{"original": "to approve the ndaa, the senate had to override a veto by president trump, marking the first time congress has voted to override mr. trump during his entire presidency."}
{"original": "after blocking the house bill that would have authorized $2,000 stimulus checks, mcconnell then introduced a bill that linked the increased payments to two separate issues valued by mr. trump: nixing section 230, a legal shield for internet companies, and creating a commission to examine election integrity. the president also tied a repeal of section 230 to the ndaa, but several members of congress, including some republicans, successfully argued that it was not relevant to national security."}
{"original": "here is the deal, mcconnell said in remarks on the senate floor earlier this week. the senate is not going to split apart the three issues that president trump linked together just because democrats are afraid to address two of them."}
{"original": "kentucky governor andy beshear, a democrat, called the vandalism to mcconnell's home unacceptable in a tweet on saturday. while the first amendment protects our freedom of speech, vandalism is reprehensible and never acceptable for any reason, beshear wrote."}
{"original": "mcconnell said in his own statement that vandalism and the politics of fear have no place in our society."}
{"original": "i've spent my career fighting for the first amendment and defending peaceful protest. i appreciate every kentuckian who has engaged in the democratic process whether they agree with me or not, reads his statement. my wife and i have never been intimidated by this toxic playbook. we just hope our neighbors in louisville aren't too inconvenienced by this radical tantrum."}
{"original": "it appeared house speaker nancy pelosi's home in san francisco was also vandalized this weekend, cbs san francisco reports. the garage door of a residence in the neighborhood of pacific heights was spray painted and a pig's head was left on the sidewalk."}
{"original": "the graffiti, which said cancel rent and we want everything, also appears to be related to the coronavirus stimulus checks. democrats are in support of bigger checks, and pelosi herself implored mcconnell not to block a vote on the bill. mitch mcconnell, remove the obstacle that you have to the american people having the opportunity to have that direct payment, and do it now, she said."}
{"original": "san francisco police would not confirm whether the residence belongs to the speaker. pelosi is currently in washington, d.c."}
{"original": "freshman congressman dan crenshaw said he knew what was in confidential documents about the war in afghanistan not because he had read them before they were published in the washington post, but because he saw the failures of u.s. policy firsthand as a navy seal deployed in the county."}
{"original": "the texas republican, a former navy seal, was deployed to active combat three times as a member of seal team three. in 2012, while on his third deployment in helmand province, afghanistan, crenshaw was hit by an ied blast that exploded next to him. the blast killed a member of his unit."}
{"original": "it's like being hit by a truck, but everyone in the truck is shooting you with shotguns, crenshaw told major garrett on this week's episode of the takeout. the blast destroyed crenshaw's vision in his right eye and severely impacted vision in his left, but he remained in the seals and was deployed in non-combat roles twice after he recovered."}
{"original": "in december, the washington post published the afghanistan papers, an investigation into 2,000 pages of previously unpublished notes of interviews with people who played a direct role in the war, from generals and diplomats to aid workers and afghan officials. the investigation revealed that although u.s. officials said they were making progress throughout the 18-year conflict, they knew those declarations were false."}
{"original": "crenshaw told cbs news he was pleased the afghanistan papers were released because they confirmed what the military — and the soldiers he served with — knew: that taking control of the region and then giving that control up was a politically-driven decision."}
{"original": "what you're seeing from the afghan papers is what you would see from any large, complex organization doing a very complex mission. there's going to be very different opinions on how well things are going, crenshaw said. you're going to talk about the good stuff and you're going to make it sound that way. i think it's good the afghan papers came out actually and forced us to rethink that."}
{"original": "the u.s.' current involvement in afghanistan hinges on one question, according to crenshaw: whether the u.s. would be better off if the u.s. allowed afghanistan to be controlled by the taliban."}
{"original": "it's deterrence against future strongholds for terrorists, that's really what it comes down to, crenshaw said. crenshaw favors keeping the current troop levels in afghanistan, in order to engage in anti-terror operations and to train and equip afghan government forces."}
{"original": "the days of roaming around grape fields where i was getting blown up, those are over, crenshaw said. unless we're going to put 200,000 troops [in afghanistan] and hold the territory, it's over and it needs to be over."}
{"original": "garrett and crenshaw also discussed the numerous instances of misconduct that have come to light recently involving navy seal soldiers, including the highly publicized accusations of war crimes by edward gallagher. gallagher was acquitted on most of the charges but was found guilty of posing with a corpse. the navy board also considered stripping gallagher of his status as a navy seal. in november, president trump intervened and restored gallagher's rank."}
{"original": "is there a wide-scale disciplinary problem in the seal teams? i don't have all the data to really say one way or another, crenshaw said. it doesn't mean you ignore the problems that exist. it just means that you should be balanced about it and be honest about what's happening and what isn't happening."}

{"original": "here's an open secret: open office plans are the worst. about 70% of american work spaces are set up as open, where architectural walls disappear, stripping any creative boundaries between you and your cubicled colleagues."}
{"original": "shared space enables team-building, so y'all can value add, and shift paradigms while you move the needle! except it doesn't work that way, according to science – and everyone who's ever had to work in one of these open hell holes."}
{"original": "recent research shows that open office plans result in approximately 73% less face-to-face interaction, as well as a significant increase in electronic activity, because all the hubbub causes workers to tune out with their headphones; and the lack of privacy means your colleague emails you rather than asks you to brainstorm all over everyone's desks."}
{"original": "but we didn't need science to prove how much open offices suck the life out of your work day."}
{"original": "since the rows of cubicles and pods of bean bags resemble a library, an open office adopts the rules of a library, meaning silence at all costs."}
{"original": "when your sister calls to fight over thanksgiving plans, you hunt for an empty conference room. when you have to pitch an important client, you squat in a storage closet."}
{"original": "not to mention if you love your chair and don't want it swiped, you'd better mark it in some way!"}
{"original": "open office spaces were sold to us as a way to create an egalitarian feel. but the truth is, they save money: like the airlines, your company just wants to cram as many of you in as possible and call it pop-up synergy."}
{"original": "there is some upside: if it's someone's birthday, it's cake for all! if it's someone's 11 a.m. hoagie, it's the smell of processed meat for all! if it's take your child to work day, it's someone's four-year-old for all!"}

{"original": "just ask this guy how an open door office policy works out:"}
{"original": "we go to an office to get away from it all, which is why open office plans put the funk in cross-functional collaboration. it's fun to drill down with your cohort, but it's not fun to hear them chew."}

{"original": "a growing number of babies and toddlers are landing in the emergency room for injuries related to strollers, cribs and other nursery products, a new u.s. study finds."}
{"original": "those er trips rose nearly 24 percent between 2003 and 2011, after more than a decade of decline, the researchers found."}
{"original": "however, only 1 percent of those er trips were blamed on actual product failures."}
{"original": "that does not mean the nursery products on the market are perfectly safe. they can still be more intelligently designed to help prevent accidents, said tracy mehan, of nationwide children's hospital in columbus, ohio, where the study was conducted."}
{"original": "much of the increase in injuries was related to concussions: the rate of concussion diagnoses more than doubled between 2005 and 2011, the researchers found."}
{"original": "that may be due, at least in part, to better recognition of concussions, according to mehan, who was not an author on the study."}
{"original": "in recent years, the issue of childhood concussions has gotten increasing attention, partly because of kids' sports-related head injuries."}
{"original": "so, parents may be more likely to bring their child to the er after a fall or other mishap, explained mehan, who is manager of translational research at nationwide's center for injury research and policy."}
{"original": "in 2014, more than 69,000 babies and young children landed in the emergency room for injuries related to nursery products, according to the u.s. consumer product safety commission (cpsc)."}
{"original": "those are only the injuries serious enough to be treated in the er, mehan pointed out. so, the actual number of injuries is probably much higher."}
{"original": "the study findings, published online march 13 in the journal pediatrics, are based on figures from a federal injury surveillance system."}
{"original": "the nationwide researchers specifically looked for er visits among children younger than 3 who had injuries attributed to nursery products."}
{"original": "on average, there were just over 66,000 such incidents each year. but the trend shifted over time."}
{"original": "between 1991 and 2003, er trips declined by over one-third, the study found. that improvement was largely due to an 86 percent drop in injuries related to baby walkers, jumpers and exercisers."}
{"original": "according to mehan, that represents a big success story."}
{"original": "walkers, for instance, allowed babies to move around quickly, before they were developmentally ready. we started seeing these serious injuries from falls, mehan said."}
{"original": "that led researchers to work with lawmakers and manufacturers to devise tougher safety standards and product revisions -- like making the walkers too wide to fit through doorways."}
{"original": "but since 2003, the nationwide study found, er trips related to nursery products have been on the upswing."}
{"original": "the juvenile products manufacturers association did not respond to requests from healthday for comment on the findings."}
{"original": "no one product seemed to drive the injury increase after 2003. but one type of injury -- concussion -- stood out."}
{"original": "dr. barbara pena is research director for the emergency department at nicklaus children's hospital in miami."}
{"original": "that rise in concussions is no surprise to pena, who said her er sees children with head injuries every day."}
{"original": "i think that years ago, there wasn't as much concern when a child fell or hit his head, pena said. but now, parents are more likely to bring their children in."}
{"original": "it's also common, she said, to see young children with injuries related to nursery products."}
{"original": "in this study, baby carriers were the product most commonly involved: they accounted for more than half of injuries among babies younger than 6 months."}
{"original": "often, babies were injured when the adult using the carrier tripped and fell."}
{"original": "cribs and strollers were also commonly implicated. cribs can present a risk of entrapment or suffocation, according to mehan -- especially if parents use a mattress that is not designed for the crib, or if they put blankets, bumper pads or other soft objects in with their baby."}
{"original": "with strollers, youngsters can be hurt if the stroller tips over or rolls away, for example."}
{"original": "parents and other adults can take steps to help prevent those mishaps, pena said."}
{"original": "make sure you're using these products carefully, and use every safety feature 100 percent of the time, she said."}
{"original": "with strollers, pena noted, parents often like to hang bags on the handles. that extra weight can tip the stroller over."}
{"original": "mehan pointed to four rs that parents should keep in mind:"}
{"original": "research: before you buy a nursery product, do some digging using a trusted resource, like the american academy of pediatrics or the cpsc."}
{"original": "recalls: periodically check whether any of your nursery products have been recalled, using the federal website recalls.gov. parents can also sign up for email alerts, mehan said."}
{"original": "register: products come with forms that allow consumers to register them with the manufacturer. if the product is recalled, the company can contact you."}
{"original": "read the manual: take the time, mehan said, to be sure you know how to use the product and all of its safety features."}
{"original": "when it comes to cribs, mehan also advised buying one made after 2011, because it will meet the latest safety standards."}
{"original": "she noted that many parents buy or borrow used nursery products. if you do that, make sure you inspect it carefully, and look for any broken pieces, missing parts or chipped paint."}

{"original": "the scenario violates the carrier's policy, which states in part: pet traveling in cabin must be carried in an approved hard-sided or soft-sided kennel. the kennel must fit completely under the seat in front of the customer and remain there at all times."}

{"original": "the federal reserve took emergency action sunday and slashed its benchmark interest rate by a full percentage point to nearly zero to try to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak. in another move to boost growth, the central bank also said it would purchase $700 billion in treasury and mortgage-backed securities to encourage lending."}
{"original": "the fed said in a statement that the effects of the outbreak will weigh on economic activity in the near term and pose risks to the outlook. policy makers said they will keep rates at nearly zero until they are confident the economy has weathered the storm, which a number of economists say could push the u.s. into recession."}
{"original": "these are strong measures, fed chairman jerome powell said in a rare sunday news conference, warning that growth in the second quarter would be slow. the virus will run its course and economic activity will resume. in the meantime, we will act to support the flow of credit to companies and individuals."}
{"original": "the fed also said that it was working with central banks around the world, including the european central bank, the bank of canada, the bank of japan and others, in a coordinated effort to make it easier for financial institutions to trade currencies and get u.s. dollars."}
{"original": "the fed's latest move to ease borrowing costs, which followed another emergency cut on march 3, is one of the most drastic steps the central bank has taken since the depths of the 2008 financial crisis. it is an effort to loosen up the country's monetary supply and stimulate to try to counter the coronavirus's growing damage to the u.s. economy and global financial markets."}
{"original": "paul ashworth, chief u.s economist with capital economics, said the fed cuts resemble its actions to shore up the economy during the global financial crisis more than a decade ago."}
{"original": "so now we have the entire crisis playbook enacted before asian markets open — with the fed doing everything in its power, not just to support economic activity, but to keep the financial system afloat and keep credit flowing to affected households and businesses, he said in a research note."}
{"original": "the fed had been expected to take action at its scheduled meeting on wednesday. but its preemptive move underlines policy makers' concern at how quickly the virus is shutting down key sectors of the american economy, including travel and sports."}
{"original": "president donald trump, who has repeatedly attacked powell for his handling of monetary policy, said in a news conference on sunday at the white house that the fed's latest cut makes me very happy."}
{"original": "i think that people in the markets should be very thrilled, mr. trump added."}

{"original": "the fed's latest move does not change our expectation that the economy will slow dramatically in the near term, rubeela farooqi, chief u.s. economist with high frequency economics, told investors in a report."}
{"original": "with the virus' spread causing a broad shutdown of economic activity, the fed faces a daunting task. its tools — intended to ease borrowing rates, facilitate lending and boost business and consumer confidence — aren't ideally suited to offset a fear-driven halt in spending and traveling."}
{"original": "we have been urging this action for some time and we're very happy that the fed did not wait until wednesday's meeting, said economist ian shepherdson, chief economist of pantheon macroeconomics. in one line: great news, but not enough on its own."}
{"original": "shepherdson said congress and the white house may need to consider at least $1 trillion in emergency spending to help support small and mid-sized businesses, the self-employed and millions of households under varying levels of quarantine facing the prospects of months of little to no business or income. this could include financial help for the nation's travel and hospitality industries, which have seen unusual plunges in business in barely two weeks."}

{"original": "i didn't want to crash into the ocean, but from watching han solo navigate an asteroid field to watching movies like 'perfect storm,' it would always kind of get my adrenaline up, and i knew it was something i wanted to do, she said."}
{"original": "but she faced resistance along the way, such as a teacher who told hegar that her ambition was not fit for a girl."}
{"original": "that was the first experience of many where i realized the vast majority of people that i encountered along the way were very supportive and only cared about whether or not i was competent, but every now and then you got somebody who didn't give you a chance."}
{"original": "how do you push past that when you get that kind of resistance? asked co-anchor anthony mason."}
{"original": "to be honest with you, even from a young age it just motivated me. it really did. it motivated me. it was almost like a dare."}
{"original": "commissioned into the air force in 1999, hegar was later selected for pilot training by the air national guard. she would serve three tours in afghanistan, flying medevac and combat search and rescue missions."}
{"original": "she flew a sikorsky mh-60 pave hawk, a rescue version of the blackhawk helicopter, pulling wounded soldiers from the battlefield."}
{"original": "how many women are flying those helicopters? asked co-anchor norah o'donnell."}
{"original": "more than you might think, [but] fewer than there should be! hegar said. i had probably two or three in my unit."}
{"original": "when asked to describe her experience of being shot down in afghanistan, hegar said, at the time it wasn't really that scary. it was what we were trained to do. we were just doing our jobs."}
{"original": "you say 'trained to do.' you were wounded and bleeding, remarked co-anchor gayle king."}
{"original": "hegar replied, it happened so fast, you know?"}
{"original": "you say battle readiness has nothing to do with gender and everything to do with capability."}
{"original": "right. i've seen men and women who were fit for combat that i wanted to fight beside, and men and women who i really wouldn't want to go back into combat with. it really doesn't have anything to do with gender. i feel i have a warrior's heart, and it doesn't have to do with anything —"}
{"original": "what is a 'warrior's heart'? asked mason."}
{"original": "just a drive to protect people and to run toward the emergency when everybody else is running away, hegar explained. you know, i think that that's not something you can choose to do. it's just something that you reflex-do, or you don't."}
{"original": "when asked to describe the backlash she experienced for speaking out in support of women in combat positions, hegar said, it was significant, but i think it's a very vocal minority. the vast majority of the messages that i receive are, 'please keep doing what you're doing, you're inspiring my daughter or you're inspiring my son, you're fighting for us.' but there are some really determined people out there who see it very threatening that a woman can do these jobs."}
{"original": "does she think the military needs to do more?"}
{"original": "absolutely. they're doing a lot, more than they're getting credit for. i think we have some amazing leaders. but then we have some leaders who turn a blind eye to things that contribute negatively to a really difficult culture for women, she said."}
{"original": "king noted one scene in her book, after the crash, involving a briefing: people are patting themselves on the back, you're the only one in the meeting, m.j., that says basically, 'where the hell were you guys?' because you thought you'd been left stranded by another group. you're the only one who said that."}
{"original": "that gets me into trouble a lot! megar laughed. yeah, i kind of looked around and i can't understand why nobody else is speaking up. later when i faced the backlash of speaking up, i realized why nobody did. but at the time i kind of looked around, like, 'why isn't anyone saying anything? i guess i will.' and that's been my whole life."}
{"original": "hegar's book is being developed for the big screen by tristar pictures, with angelina jolie slated to star. oscar-nominated screenwriter jason hall (american sniper) is attached to the project."}
{"original": "murfreesboro, tenn. -- a tennessee police chief has offered an apology after his officers arrested 10 elementary school students."}
{"original": "murfreesboro police chief karl durr told the tennessean he's so sorry this incident happened and that he thinks it could have been avoided. durr said the arrests were connected to a bullying and assault incident. the newspaper reports there are no plans to dismiss the charges."}
{"original": "the comments to the newspaper came after angry parents demanded action during a community meeting at a church after the arrests occurred at hobgood elementary school and other locations on april 15. some students were handcuffed, but it was unclear how many."}
{"original": "durr reiterated that an internal review of the incident is ongoing. he said the department would also review its handcuffing policy, which currently says officers should take into consideration whether to handcuff children under 12."}
{"original": "another federal judge on friday ruled that chad wolf was likely unlawfully appointed to his position at the helm of the department of homeland security (dhs), issuing a decision that blocked a set of broad asylum limits slated to take effect monday."}
{"original": "in a scathing 14-page decision, judge james donato of the u.s. district court in san francisco agreed with other federal judges who have concluded that dhs failed to follow proper legal procedures when installing wolf as the department's acting secretary. he said trump administration lawyers recycled arguments to defend the legality of wolf's appointment, as if they had not been soundly rejected in well-reasoned opinions by several courts."}
{"original": "in effect, the government keeps crashing the same car into a gate, hoping that someday it might break through, donato wrote."}
{"original": "based on this conclusion, donato said wolf did not have the authority to greenlight a regulation that would erect new restrictions at every stage of the u.s. asylum process, including rules that generally disqualify victims of gang violence, gender-based persecution, domestic abuse and torture staged by rogue government officials from u.s. refuge."}
{"original": "donato issued a nation-wide preliminary injunction against the policy, which advocates dubbed the death to asylum rule."}
{"original": "this is the most far-reaching of the midnight asylum regulations unveiled in the trump administration's final days, said sabrineh ardalan, the director of the harvard immigration and refugee clinical program, one of the groups challenging the policy. but try as it may, this administration cannot destroy our asylum system and rewrite our laws by executive fiat."}
{"original": "on saturday, u.s. asylum officers were instructed not to rely upon the new rules when interviewing migrants or adjudicating applications, according to an internal u.s citizenship and immigration services (uscis) email obtained by cbs news. andrew davidson, the chief of the asylum division, said officers must continue to follow current guidance and procedures."}
{"original": "along with the government accountability office, congress' investigative arm, several other federal courts have also questioned the legality of wolf's appointment and blocked actions he has approved, including the suspension of the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program for undocumented immigrants who came to the u.s. as children."}
{"original": "wolf was tapped to lead dhs in november 2019, following the departure of former acting secretary kevin mcaleenan. unlike mcaleenan, wolf was nominated by president trump to be the senate-confirmed secretary of the department, but his nomination was withdrawn this week by the white house."}
{"original": "the rules blocked on friday represent the most ambitious effort by the trump administration to restrict access to u.s. asylum through numerous procedural and substantive changes. the outgoing administration has argued that its restrictions — which include a policy of requiring migrants to wait in mexico for the duration of their u.s. court cases — are necessary to prevent border-crossers from abusing the asylum system."}
{"original": "president-elect joe biden, a democrat, has pledged to undo many of mr. trump's asylum changes, including the remain in mexico program. while he has not addressed the rule blocked on friday, mr. biden's advisers have said they intend to reverse mr. trump's asylum restrictions for victims of gang and domestic violence."}
{"original": "dhs representatives did not immediately respond to a request to comment on friday's order."}
{"original": "defense secretary ash carter on monday made it clear that congress will have to change the law if the government wants to move some remaining detainees at the guantanamo bay prison to a facility on u.s. soil."}
{"original": "speaking to reporters at the pentagon, carter said that safety is his top priority and there has to be alternate detention facility created for the detainees."}
{"original": "now, that can't be done unless congress acts, which means that congress has to support the idea that it would be good to move this facility or the detainees to the united states, said carter, who reiterated that closing guantanamo bay would save the u.s. a lot of money."}
{"original": "carter went on to say that the closure plan, unveiled by the white house last week, could not be fully implemented until congress takes action."}
{"original": "so it is good if it can be done, but it cannot be done under current law. the law has to be changed, he said. that is the reason to put a proposal to put in front of congress."}
{"original": "part of the plan calls for the administration for work with congress to find a location in the u.s. to house fewer than 60 detainees. many of the other remaining detainees, under the plan, would be transferred to foreign countries."}
{"original": "last fall, president obama signed a defense policy bill that barred the administration from transferring detainees to u.s. soil."}
{"original": "at a congressional hearing in november, attorney general loretta lynch acknowledged that the law is clear."}
{"original": "with respect to individuals being transferred to the united states, the law currently does not allow that, she told the house judiciary committee. certainly it is the position of the department of justice that we would follow the law of the land in regard on that issue."}
{"original": "when mr. obama announced his plan last week, he explained that the u.s. has already had to house terrorists in the u.s. and the government has kept the country safe."}
{"original": "part of my message to the american people is we're already holding a bunch of really dangerous terrorists in the united states because we threw the book at them and there have been no incidents. we've managed it just fine, he said."}
{"original": "republicans in congress, meanwhile, blasted the president's plan and largely declared it dead on arrival on capitol hill."}
{"original": "the u.s. food and drug administration has suggested britain's drug regulator may be gambling with public safety by expanding the time gap between administration of the first and second doses of pfizer's coronavirus vaccine beyond that proven safe and effective by trial data. the fda warned in a statement on monday that there was a potential for harm if people believed they were protected against covid-19 by a first dose of pfizer's vaccine for longer than available data demonstrate."}
{"original": "facing a dramatic surge in both infections and hospitalizations — fueled, according to u.k. officials, by a more infectious strain of the coronavirus discovered in southeast england — british officials decided last week to change their inoculation strategy."}
{"original": "the focus is now on getting as many people as possible a first dose of either the pfizer shot or the other approved for use in the u.k., developed by oxford university and astrazeneca. under government policy, the second doses of both vaccines can be put off for up to 12 weeks."}
{"original": "oxford scientists have said their trial data supports allowing a window of up to 12 weeks between shots, and that their vaccine will provide protection to the full extent possible (up to 74% effective at preventing symptomatic covid-19 infection) for that full period."}
{"original": "pfizer hasn't said that, however. along with its german partner biontech, the american pharmaceutical maker has made it clear that their trial data only shows efficacy for 21 days after a first dose."}
{"original": "the u.k. regulator appears to be making an assumption based on the available data from the pfizer-biontech phase 3 human trials."}
{"original": "the decision was made to update the dosage interval recommendations for the pfizer-biontech vaccine following a thorough review of the data by the mhra's covid-19 vaccines benefit risk expert working group, a spokesperson for the u.k.'s medicines and healthcare regulatory agency told cbs news on tuesday."}
{"original": "the spokesperson said the working group concluded that vaccine efficacy will be maintained with dosing intervals longer than 21 days… based on clinical trial data that showed the vaccine was 90.5% effective against preventing covid-19 after the first dose once the protection that starts at around 12 days kicks in, and there was no evidence to suggest that the effectiveness of the vaccine is declining towards the end of the 21-day period following the first dose."}
{"original": "but as the fda and pfizer have said, there's also no data to show that the effectiveness of the first dose lasts until the 12-week mark, or anything near it. the fda approved the pfizer vaccine for emergency use with a maximum of 21 days between the first and second doses."}
{"original": "suggesting changes to the fda-authorized dosing or schedules of these vaccines is premature and not rooted solidly in the available evidence, the u.s. agency said in its statement. without appropriate data supporting such changes in vaccine administration, we run a significant risk of placing public health at risk, undermining the historic vaccination efforts to protect the population from covid-19."}
{"original": "if people do not truly know how protective a vaccine is, there is the potential for harm because they may assume that they are fully protected when they are not, and accordingly, alter their behavior to take unnecessary risks, the fda warned."}

{"original": "with the worst covid-19 epidemic in europe, and one that is worsening fast, britain's strategy was clearly born of urgency. it's a bid to provide as many people with some immunity as fast as possible to try and stem the dramatic spread of the virus, and it the u.k. isn't alone in considering the measure."}
{"original": "german health minister jens spahn confirmed this week that the government was considering extending the length of time between the first and second doses of the pfizer-biontech vaccine, citing the example set by the u.k."}
{"original": "spahn stressed, however, that germany's health ministry would await guidance from the standing committee on vaccination at the national health agency, the robert koch institute, before making a final decision."}
{"original": "washington -- district of columbia schools have canceled recess at 13 schools near the national zoo because of an escaped bobcat, even though zoo officials say the animal poses no danger to humans."}
{"original": "school system spokeswoman michelle lerner says the decision to not let students outside on tuesday was made out of an abundance of caution. she declined to comment on how long the policy would stay in place."}
{"original": "zoo spokeswoman pamela baker-masson says she spoke to the school system's chief operating officer and emphasized that the animal is not dangerous. she says the zoo and the school system will keep in touch as the search for the missing bobcat continues."}
{"original": "the national zoo tweeted on tuesday that the bobcat was still missing, and that overnight calls indicated she may be in the area."}

{"original": "a child pornography case involving a california doctor has revealed that best buy's geek squad technicians allegedly worked with the fbi to uncover data on customer's computers for years, cbs pittsburgh reports. a non-profit organization claims that the nature of the fbi's relationship with the technicians may have violated the u.s. constitution."}
{"original": "the electronic frontier foundation (eff) filed a freedom of information act (foia) lawsuit last year after it learned that the fbi allegedly paid geek squad employees to pass along information about illegal materials on devices sent in by customers for repairs."}
{"original": "one search led to felony child porn charges against dr. mark rettenmaier after a technician reportedly went through the oncologist's deleted files and called the fbi in 2011. in 2017, a judge ruled that the images found in rettenmaier's computer could not be considered child porn and the invasive search was illegal. all of the charges were dropped and the case was dismissed after a judge said an fbi agent made false and misleading statements to obtain a search warrant for the doctor's house."}
{"original": "eff says their foia request revealed that best buy has been working with the fbi for at least 10 years. an fbi memo acquired in the lawsuit shows that best buy hosted a meeting and tour of their kentucky repair facility for the fbi's cyber working group in 2008. the memo and related email also claim that agents maintained close liaison with the geek squad's management in an effort to glean case initiations and to support the division's computer intrusion and cyber crime programs."}
{"original": "other court records uncovered in the foia search found that geek squad technicians were paid between $500 and $1,000 to actively search a client's computer."}
{"original": "the reports have raised concerns that the fbi is using the geek squad to bypass the fourth amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures."}
{"original": "best buy spokesperson jeff shelman denied the claims in 2017. shelman said their technicians don't do anything other than what is necessary to solve the customer's problem, according to the washington post. shelman added that if illegal material is found during those repairs, geek squad employees are obligated to contact law enforcement."}
{"original": "in a statement provided to our partner site zdnet, best buy confirmed that three of four managers who received payments from the fbi are no longer at the company. the statement reads in full:"}
{"original": "as cbs news senior national security correspondent david martin reported on thursday, president trump appears to be standing firm on his decision to pull american forces out of syria. the president himself has not yet commented on the topic since four americans were killed in a targeted attack by isis in northern syria on wednesday. but vice president mike pence did reiterate mr. trump's assertions, not long after the u.s. confirmed the casualties, that isis had been defeated in syria and it is time to bring american troops home."}
{"original": "visiting the front lines of the ongoing war this week with u.s.-backed kurdish fighters, however, cbs news correspondent charlie d'agata saw a different reality. what follows is his report from the front-line town of ash sha'fah, in eastern syria."}
{"original": "ash sha'fah, syria -- president trump and vice president pence may continue to insist that isis is defeated in syria, but the frontlines here tell a very different story, with u.s. forces and their allies on the ground battling a persistent enemy that refuses to surrender."}
{"original": "even as we made our way toward the fighting, we were warned that isis terror cells lurked among the ruined villages, launching counterattacks and planting bombs on the only road in and out."}
{"original": "we travelled to the front lines in eastern syria, the very last pockets of isis resistance. once these areas are taken back, isis will not be considered a territorial force here."}
{"original": "we arrived in ash sha'fah to see kurdish-led forces firing a barrage of mortars toward isis positions not much more than a mile away."}
{"original": "nearby, vital reinforcements: u.s. troops and military hardware. an american position is just a few hundred yards away from the kurdish forces we're embedded with. the u.s. forces have been firing mortars in the direction of the isis holdouts since we got here."}
{"original": "they're playing a very big role, kurdish commander simko shkak told us. their forces have been very effective. we give them coordinates for isis locations and their air force and artillery do all they can."}
{"original": "in addition to roughly 2,000 u.s. ground forces here, the american-led air campaign has been pummelling this territory, carrying out airstrikes on 1,100 targets in the first two weeks of january alone. the missiles have focused on the sliver of land still under isis control."}
{"original": "commanders here tell us the final push could take a month or more. but as the tragic deaths of four americans among more than a dozen killed in the manbij attack on wednesday shows, isis is already morphing into an insurgency that has begun striking targets far beyond these battlefields."}
{"original": "americans are considering their travel plans as the coronavirus spreads across the globe, with the world health organization on friday upgrading the global risk from the disease to very high. travelers are weighing what happens if they decide to cancel flights because of fear of infection, including whether they'll get refunds."}
{"original": "the answer: refunds are unlikely unless they bought cancel for any reason insurance, which isn't as widely used by travelers because it costs about 40% more than standard travel insurance. but more common insurance policies won't cover the cost of a ticket if you opt against traveling because of the outbreak."}
{"original": "a key phrase for travelers to understand: unexpected event — that's what insurance companies are offering to cover when you buy a standard travel policy. but now that the virus has spread across the globe, insurers are excluding the disease as a trigger for coverage because it's no longer an unexpected event, according to squaremouth, a travel insurance comparison site."}
{"original": "once an event becomes common knowledge, it also becomes excluded by travel insurance policies – this is because insurance providers consider it to have a foreseeable impact on travel, squaremouth said on its blog."}
{"original": "insurance companies designated the coronavirus as a foreseen event between january 21 and 24, which means policies sold after those dates aren't going to cover issues related to the outbreak, said karen johnson, a travel insurance program leader with usi insurance services."}
{"original": "some travelers may not need to rely on insurance given that a few airlines are waiving fees for canceling or changing flights due to coronavirus concerns. jetblue became the first u.s. carrier to introduce the policy when it said this week that it would suspend these fees for trips booked between february 27 through march 11 for travel completed by june 1. some airlines in asia, where the disease is most widespread, are also waiving fees."}
{"original": "still, travelers concerned about needing to cancel a trip because of the outbreak may want to pay more for cancel for any reason policies. in exchange for a higher insurance rate, travelers can expect to recoup about 75% of their travel costs if they need to cancel."}
{"original": "i'd expect we'll see more people buying it because they want to say, 'no, i don't want to go because i don't think it's safe for my family', said lisa lindsay, executive director of the private risk management association."}
{"original": "the good news about cancel for any reason policies is that they can be purchased after you make a deposit on a trip, although you typically have a window of about 14 to 21 days to buy it, usi's johnson said. (the window for purchasing a policy depends on the insurance company.)"}
{"original": "in other words, if you bought tickets for an italian vacation two weeks ago — before the coronavirus spread across the country's northern region — you could still purchase one of these policies to protect your ticket purchase."}
{"original": "there are some caveats, johnson added. for instance, you must insure the entire cost of your trip, and if you cancel, you need to do so before 48 hours of your scheduled departure date. other than that, you are good to go — or not go."}
{"original": "literally you can cancel for any reason. if you can see it's going to rain the entire week, well, you can cancel, johnson noted. for an event like this, where we don't know how long it's going to be around or if it's just going to explode, this is a perfect example why someone would buy cancel for any reason insurance."}
{"original": "flight insurance isn't the only consideration for travelers, lindsay said. people going overseas also should consider medical coverage, including whether you would want to be treated by local health care facilities if you fall ill."}
{"original": "some insurers are still offering medical coverage for travelers, which would cover emergency medical treatment and evacuation to those who contract the virus during their travels, squaremouth said. but it's important to read medical policies' fine print to understand what's covered and what isn't."}
{"original": "more generally, travelers should also create a preparedness plan. we ask people to think about the trip and think what might happen, and if it does happen, what do we need to know? lindsay said."}
{"original": "for instance, it's important to have a communication plan with your family when you travel. pick a family member or friend who isn't traveling with you, and let them know that you'll check in with them at a specific time each day. a text that says the trip is great and we're all fine can help allay fears — and also alert loved ones if something goes awry, she said."}
{"original": "likewise, check cell phone coverage and internet access before traveling, including the costs of international coverage and whether you'll encounter any problems. have a plan in place in case you get sick, such as designating someone in your group to call your insurance carrier."}
{"original": "always, always check and see if your insurance coverage is going to cover you while you are abroad, lindsay said. if it's not going to cover you while you are [out of the country], you should buy a temporary policy that will provide you with coverage."}
{"original": "most americans — 59 percent — oppose the building of a wall along the u.s.-mexico border. however, 8 in 10 republicans favor a wall. two-thirds of independents and 84 percent of democrats oppose a wall."}
{"original": "democrats and republicans also have different priorities when considering immigration policy."}
{"original": "most democrats (67 percent) say it's more important to focus on dealing with illegal immigrants already in the u.s. for republicans, securing the border is the top immigration priority (75 percent)."}
{"original": "when americans are asked which issue is most important for the president and congress to address, health care outranks immigration. republicans, however, see immigration as the higher priority."}
{"original": "senate democrats are expected to bring their long-awaited health care reform bill to the floor next week. and just as in the house, which passed its bill last week, senators are divided over the issue of abortion, reports cbs news correspondent nancy cordes."}
{"original": "the fight over abortion rights has become a thorn in the side of both parties now. it all started when anti-abortion democrats, led by michigan's bart stupak, began demanding that health care reform include strict new language banning abortion coverage."}
{"original": "what i'm saying and a number of my democratic colleagues are saying is no public funding for abortion, period, stupak said."}
{"original": "government rules have prohibited abortion coverage in federally funded plans since 1976. federal workers, medicaid recipients and women in the military do not have abortion coverage except in extreme cases like rape."}
{"original": "but the health care reform bill creates an unprecedented scenario. millions of low-income americans get some federal assistance to help them buy insurance. stupak's amendment bars any woman who gets even a dollar of federal funding from buying a plan that contains abortion coverage."}
{"original": "i remember the days of back alley abortions and this amendment takes us one step back to those days, said rep. barbara lee of california."}
{"original": "the amendment passed with the support of 64 democrats and all but one republican."}
{"original": "now the traditionally pro-abortion rights democratic party is at a crossroads."}
{"original": "this is an internal fight, a civil war within the democratic party, said stu rothenberg of the rothenberg political report."}
{"original": "that internal fight spilled over into the gop on thursday, when politico revealed that even the republican national committee provides coverage for elective abortions in its health care plan."}
{"original": "rnc chairman michael steele swiftly axed the policy, saying, money from our loyal donors should not be used for this purpose."}
{"original": "now a group of female senators is scrambling to find a compromise on abortion funding. but even if they succeed, there are a number of other major issues, like the public option, and how to finance reform, that have democrats at odds as well."}
{"original": "the government shutdown -- the longest in u.s. history -- is estimated in 31 days to have cost the american economy almost as much as the $5.7 billion president trump has demanded for his proposed southern border wall."}
{"original": "average weekly direct and indirect costs of the partial shutdown, which began dec. 22, currently add up to $1.2 billion, according to beth ann bovino, s&p global's u.s. chief economist. monday marked the start of the shutdown's fifth week, and the closure will have caused roughly $6 billion in damage to the economy if the government does not reopen by the end of the week, bovino estimated in a recent research note."}
{"original": "and the average weekly cost of the shutdown is expected to grow as the damage to industries and consumers both widens and deepens. the longer this shutdown drags on, the more collateral damage the economy will suffer, bovino wrote."}
{"original": "direct effects of the marathon shutdown include lost productivity from the hundreds of thousands of furloughed workers who haven't been paid since the dec. 22 closure. while the precise impact has not been calculated, the bureau of economic analysis estimates that federal employees' lost hours during a 16-day shutdown back in october 2013 reduced fourth-quarter gdp by 0.3 percentage points."}
{"original": "as in previous shutdowns, the productivity lost from furloughed government workers will never be regained. in real terms, gdp will be lower since no 'product' was created, the s&p global note said."}
{"original": "federal workers will be compensated when the government reopens, but workers in the roughly 4 million private-sector jobs that depend on the federal government won't receive back pay, according to capital economics."}
{"original": "the longer the shutdown extends, the more grave its impact could be if it starts to affect unpaid workers' consumption, for example."}
{"original": "the partial closure of the securities and exchange commission will delay companies' plans to file initial public offerings, at least until it reopens, and the treasury's shutdown threatens to delay income tax refunds, which could have a dampening effect on sectors that tend to benefit from tax-refund spending, including auto retailers, according to raymond james."}
{"original": "private businesses that depend on visitors to national sites are also feeling the pinch as americans cancel their vacations to national parks, museums and monuments that are closed."}
{"original": "an extended shutdown could reach even further into american households by causing these businesses to reduce their staffs -- taking wages away from private citizens."}
{"original": "the u.s. chamber of commerce, the nation's largest business association, last week urged mr. trump and congress to end the shutdown. consequences from the shutdown are wide and growing, neil l. bradley, the group's chief policy officer, wrote in a letter tuesday. he listed a wide range of affected programs, data and functions."}
{"original": "small businesses are unable to receive assistance from the small business administration. companies are delayed in their ability raise additional capital or complete the process of going public. the review of mergers and acquisitions is suspended. companies ranging from manufacturers to brewers are unable to receive the approvals required by law to sell their products, he wrote. travelers are delayed."}
{"original": "processing of imports is hindered, and tariff exclusion requests are unprocessed. safety inspectors are sidelined, mortgage approvals are delayed, and research is halted. national parks are closed and trash at the parks is not being collected. grants, contracts, and payments for goods and services already provided are delayed, the letter continued. federal rulemakings are halted, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees and contractors go without pay."}
{"original": "according to data compiled by bloomberg, the thousands of businesses with contracts tied to the federal government could lose a cumulative $200 million a day."}
{"original": "over the past 40 years, damage from major weather and climate disasters has cost the united states nearly $2 trillion dollars. a closer look at the data reveals that recently the cost of such incidents has been escalating quickly, due in part to human-caused climate change."}
{"original": "according to noaa's assessment of the biggest u.s. weather disasters — those with an inflation-adjusted cost of a billion dollars or more — the economic toll rose from an average of $17.8 billion a year in the 1980s to over $81 billion a year in the 2010s."}
{"original": "now a new study from stanford university puts a number value on the portion of the increasing costs caused specifically by the rise in floods linked to climate change. the study, published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences, examines flooding related to rain and snow events and finds that of the $199 billion in u.s. flood damage from 1988 to 2017, more than one-third is directly related to trends in intensifying precipitation."}
{"original": "two recent disasters that come to mind in which flooding made up the vast majority of economic damage include 2017's hurricane harvey, which cost the u.s. a staggering $125 billion, and the historic 2019 midwest floods which devastated the heartland and cost around $3 billion."}
{"original": "flooded homes are shown near lake houston following hurricane harvey, august 30, 2017, in houston, texas. win mcnamee/getty images"}
{"original": "but how much of the financial toll of disasters like these is due to climate change making things worse, and how much is due to socioeconomic factors like increased population and value of assets? this study helps to clarify this debate among many experts who work in disaster-related fields. that's important because, with the impacts of climate change continuing to mount, there's an urgency among scientists and economists to quantify how much climate change is costing us and how much it may cost us in the future."}
{"original": "dr. noah diffenbaugh, co-author of the research and professor of earth system science at stanford university, says obtaining this quantification was the motivation for this study. there has been a lot of research about the impacts of climate change on different natural and human systems, but relatively little of that has focused on generating hard numbers quantifying the financial costs of those impacts, diffenbaugh said. this study provides those numbers for flooding, which is one of the most costly natural disasters."}
{"original": "the mechanism behind why climate change is causing more extreme floods is very straightforward: a warmer ocean and atmosphere provides more energy to fuel more extreme weather systems."}
{"original": "to start with, a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture and dump more precipitation. a simple equation called the clausius-clapeyron rate calculates that for every 2 degree fahrenheit increase in air temperature, the atmosphere can hold 8% more moisture, and thus produce more rain or snow."}
{"original": "however, the extra energy in the earth system goes a step further. a warmer atmosphere and ocean can also power more intense weather systems, which increase rainfall rates and also the overall precipitation which falls in a storm. so, even if a region's average rainfall is decreasing, individual storms still tend to produce more precipitation."}
{"original": "in recent decades, heavy rain and snow events are increasing due to a warmer atmosphere. this is especially true in the midwest, great lakes and northeast. climate central"}
{"original": "the most extreme events have been intensifying more rapidly as a result of climate change, and this is a pattern that is true across the country, even in regions where average precipitation has not changed or has decreased slightly, explains the study's lead author, frances davenport, a phd student at stanford earth."}
{"original": "when asked how much of the increased extreme rain was due to climate change versus natural pattern changes, davenport said, while natural climate variability has also had some effect on precipitation over the historical time period, the observed changes in extreme precipitation are very consistent with what we expect to occur as a result of human-caused climate change."}
{"original": "davenport says that the flood damage cost from rainfall in hurricane harvey, which dumped up to 60 inches of rain on texas's gulf coast, made up about 20%of the $199 billion evaluated in her study. a series of studies after harvey found that climate change resulted in the storm dumping up to 38% more rainfall than it otherwise would have."}
{"original": "these more extreme precipitation events more easily overwhelm infrastructure like flood barriers and drainage, which were built for the tamer climate of the 1900s, not the souped-up climate of the 2000s. the image below shows this is also true for rivers and streams, many of which have seen an increase in streamflow since the 1980s."}
{"original": "while some rivers have seen a decrease in streamflow, the majority of u.s. rivers are seeing increases, which are leading to more flooding events. climate central"}
{"original": "in order to calculate which portion of the flood damage between 1988 and 2017 was due to increases in extreme events on a warmer planet, the team started with higher resolution climate and socioeconomic data and then applied advanced methods from economics and statistics. using these tools they constructed an economic model to analyze the relationship between observed precipitation and flood damage month by month and state by state."}
{"original": "they also used the model for a counterfactual analysis in which they calculated what the damages would be if there were no changes in extreme precipitation."}
{"original": "together, these analyses revealed that climate change has contributed substantially to the growing cost of flooding in the u.s. overall, the study found 36% of the cost of flooding over that time period can be attributed directly to increasing extreme precipitation events, or almost $75 billion of the estimated $199 billion total."}
{"original": "and with much more climate heating anticipated in the future, the team says the proportion of costs due to extreme events will only get worse."}
{"original": "our analyses show that exceeding the 2 degrees celsius level of global warming identified in the u.n. paris agreement is likely to result in further intensification of extreme precipitation, says diffenbaugh. so, if the future is anything like the past, we can expect continued increases in flood damages from future changes in precipitation."}
{"original": "beyond the impact from flood events, diffenbaugh says the study goes further by establishing a methodology for economists to apply on various forms of extreme weather going forward. the study provides a framework for calculating how much climate change is likely to cost in the future, as well as the economic value of reducing emissions in order to limit the level of global warming, he said."}
{"original": "much of the concern about taking action to limit global warming has been framed around how much it will cost to transition from fossil fuels, diffenbaugh added. indeed, it will cost too much is a familiar refrain among those who oppose action to combat climate change, to which the climate-concerned always counter: we can't afford not to. that's because as the planet gets warmer, the impacts of climate change increase exponentially."}
{"original": "the team's findings provide a method to separate the costs of the different variables — vital pieces of the puzzle for policy makers who must weigh the costs of action versus inaction. armed with this understanding, they can use cost-benefit calculations to determine how, and how much, to invest in climate mitigation and adaptation."}
{"original": "the need for these calculations is becoming more and more important, because as the climate warms, diffenbaugh says, the costs of inaction continue to increase."}
{"original": "this study shows that changes in precipitation are already costing billions of dollars, and that we can expect more global warming to further intensify the precipitation events that are driving those climate-related costs."}
{"original": "were you recently rear-ended at a red light by a driver who was texting? if so, you probably got a double dose of bad luck, according to a just-published study by the consumer federation of america (cfa)."}
{"original": "it showed that drivers in major cities nationwide end up paying more -- as much as $400 in queens, new york -- when they apply for insurance after they've suffered a fender-bender, even if it's the other motorist's fault. and that's in addition to the already substantial premium insurers charge for living in an urban area and having a moderate income, the study claimed."}
{"original": "it's another 10 percent for people who already got a sizable whack, said the cfa's insurance expert doug heller."}
{"original": "so it should come as no surprise that insurance industry representatives immediately attacked the study as skewed."}
{"original": "they threw a lot of things at the wall, said bob passmore, assistant vice president with the property casualty insurers association of america (pci), which represents 1,000 car insurers that write more than 40 percent of the nation's automotive policy premiums."}
{"original": "assigning fault in an accident is rarely a zero-sum process where one driver is 100 percent at-fault, whereas the other driver is zero percent at-fault, said loretta worters, a spokeswoman for the insurance information institute, which represents the industry."}
{"original": "but the news wasn't entirely negative for motorists or the insurance industry. according to the cfa, while progressive insurance (pgr) used the no-fault penalty most aggressively, charging almost a 17 percent average penalty for not-at-fault accidents, the largest u.s. auto insurer, state farm, doesn't assess any markup for motorists who weren't responsible when their cars were hit."}
{"original": "the study, which ranked only five of the top car insurers, included berkshire hathaway-owned geico (brk.a) with a 14 percent increase, farmers at 11 percent and allstate (all) at around 5 percent."}
{"original": "and there was some good news: california and oklahoma don't allow car insurers to increase premiums for motorists who weren't responsible for an accident, said the cfa."}
{"original": "but other states and urban areas weren't so lucky. while queens was the highest, baltimore ranked second on the hit parade at $258, and minneapolis came in third at $213. at the bottom of the cfa's list of cities where insurers charged more was atlanta, where they boosted premiums by only $60."}
{"original": "while lower-income drivers fared worse, with a 9.6 percent hike after a not-at-fault collision, upper-income motorists still experienced a 6.6 percent markup on their premiums."}
{"original": "cfa director of insurance robert hunter said any increase in premium wasn't fair if the accident isn't your fault. as a former insurance commissioner of texas and the industry's severest critic, hunter said charging people for accidents that weren't their fault is not only unfair, but discourages them from filing legitimate claims and using the policy they've already paid for."}
{"original": "the cfa survey trolled the websites of the major insurers and used two fictional women motorists to get quotes. they had similar ages, cars and driving records, but differed in likely income."}
{"original": "insurers don't ask for income, but factors such as job and home ownership provide the clues, so one applicant was a bank executive with a master's degree, while the other was a bank teller with a high school education. not surprisingly, the bank executive made out better, both with and without the fender bender."}
{"original": "the pci's passmore said the survey was imprecise because of the lack of specifics, such as the imaginary bank teller not having had car insurance for the past six months -- a red flag, particularly when referring to an accident. the vague question of not your fault on the application didn't address how severe the accident had been or what were the costs."}
{"original": "worters also said the survey was flawed because it didn't go far enough."}
{"original": "underwriting a new auto insurance policy requires the collection of much more information than is gathered through an auto insurer's website, she said."}
{"original": "but passmore and worters didn't challenge the fact that car insurers often charge more, even if an accident may not be your fault."}
{"original": "so what, if anything, can you do about it? shop around, said the cfa's hunter. ask the insurance agent or his company whether they charge you more if someone careens into you. and if you are abused, complain to your state insurance department. two states already ban this and a little push from consumers might encourage other states to do the same."}
{"original": "the number of u.s. kids accidentally or intentionally overdosing on adhd medications may be on the rise, a new study suggests."}
{"original": "researchers found that between 2000 and 2011, there was a 71 percent increase in calls to u.s. poison control centers related to kids' ingestion of drugs prescribed for adhd (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder)."}
{"original": "after 2011, there was a small -- but not statistically significant -- dip."}
{"original": "most cases were accidents, the study authors said. young children got their hands on pills such as ritalin or adderall, for example, or kids were mistakenly given a double-dose of their prescription."}
{"original": "but 18 percent of calls were made after a teenager intentionally abused an adhd medication, or took it in a suspected suicide attempt, according to the new report."}
{"original": "calls to poison control centers are often made by worried parents whose kids aren't actually sick, but might have been exposed to a drug."}
{"original": "so an exposure to a medication does not necessarily mean there's been a poisoning, said senior researcher dr. gary smith."}
{"original": "still, it's concerning to see such calls going up, said smith, who directs the center for injury research and policy at nationwide children's hospital, in columbus, ohio."}
{"original": "and in some cases, the kids did suffer an overdose, the findings showed."}
{"original": "just over 6 percent of calls ended with a hospital admission, the investigators found. and three teenagers died -- two from abusing adhd medications, and one in a suspected suicide."}
{"original": "the scenario of the medication exposure varies greatly depending on the age group, smith said."}
{"original": "that means various solutions are in order -- from safer medication storage, to education on the risks of abusing adhd medication, he added."}
{"original": "adhd affects how kids function in school and in everyday life. stimulants such as amphetamine and methylphenidate are frequently prescribed to help control behavior and improve focus."}
{"original": "the study findings are based on calls to u.s. poison control centers between 2000 and 2014. over the years, smith's team found an average of 29 calls a day related to kids' exposure to adhd medications."}
{"original": "those numbers steadily rose until 2011, when about 12,300 calls were made -- up from just over 7,000 in 2000. then from 2011 to 2014, calls declined slightly -- to fewer than 11,500."}
{"original": "it's not clear whether the recent dip represents any turnaround in the problem, smith said."}
{"original": "overall, kids reportedly suffered symptoms in 28 percent of cases -- including agitation and irritability, elevated heart rate, and drowsiness or lethargy. about one-quarter of all kids were taken to a medical center and released soon after, while just over 6 percent were admitted to a hospital."}
{"original": "when children younger than 6 were involved, it was usually because they'd stumbled upon pills that were left out or improperly stored, smith said."}
{"original": "with children that age, it's all about safe storage, he stressed. keep all medication in child-proof containers up, away and out of sight."}
{"original": "anita siu is a clinical associate professor at rutgers university school of pharmacy who specializes in pediatric pharmacy."}
{"original": "she made the same point about younger children -- and said that also applies to any over-the-counter medicine or supplement that could mistakenly get into little hands."}
{"original": "with kids aged 6 to 12, the study found, they typically had a prescription for adhd medication and were accidentally given an extra dose."}
{"original": "parents can prevent those mishaps, smith said, by having a system that helps them remember whether their child has taken that day's dose -- using a smartphone app, for instance."}
{"original": "pill boxes can be helpful reminders, siu said. but, she stressed, they can also make it easier for young kids to get their hands on pills."}
{"original": "with kids in the 6- to 10-year age range, siu said, an adult should always supervise medication use. but parents can start to educate them on label reading and the importance of taking medications only as directed."}
{"original": "with teenagers, it's a different situation. in this study, half of the teens had intentionally abused an adhd drug or used one in a suspected suicide attempt."}
{"original": "that figure is striking, smith said."}
{"original": "siu said, with preteens and teenagers, education is key. they should know that taking someone else's prescription -- or sharing their own with a friend -- is dangerous."}
{"original": "and if parents have any concern their child might be abusing a medication, they should talk to their health care provider, siu and smith said."}

{"original": "seoul -- north korea may be preparing to conduct a long-range ballistic missile test on the heels of its recent underground nuclear test, according to the south korean defense ministry."}
{"original": "the u.s. and its allies are still formulating their response -- and trying to work out differences with china, north korea's closest ally -- to the nuclear test carried out earlier this month."}
{"original": "that test, which american officials do not believe was of a device nearly as powerful as the hydrogen bomb touted by north korea, was a violation of united nations sanctions against the isolated, totalitarian state. ballistic missile tests are also forbidden by the sanctions against north korea."}
{"original": "we predict that north korea's next significant military provocation will be carried out in a surprising manner, defense ministry spokesman kim min-seok said thursday at a news conference in seoul, amid unconfirmed reports the launch could be just days away. the south korean military is continuing to keep a close watch on any signs of north korea's long-range missile test."}
{"original": "the new information, based on satellite imagery from one of north korea's established rocket launching sites, came a day after u.s. secretary of state john kerry urged china to keep a lid on north korea's military ambitions during a meeting with senior chinese leaders in beijing."}
{"original": "kerry described north korea's growing nuclear capability and related missile technology as a threat the united states must take extremely seriously during a joint news conference with his chinese counterpart, foreign minister wang yi."}
{"original": "north korea last tested a long-range missile in december 2012, when it successfully launched a unha-3 (galaxy 3) rocket into space carrying a satellite."}
{"original": "pyongyang insisted the launch was merely to put a weather forecasting satellite into space, but experts in the u.s. and south korea accused the north of conducting a thinly veiled test of its intercontinental ballistic missile capability."}
{"original": "analyzing the rocket debris from the launch in 2012, south korean officials described the north as having possibly secured a missile range of up to 6,200 miles, which would put the western coast of the u.s. mainland within reach. most experts, however, agree that north korea has yet to master the technology to fit a nuclear warhead onto such a missile."}
{"original": "south korean officials say the north completed a major upgrade last year to its main missile launch site in the country's northwest. the upgrade is believed to have extended the launch pad's height to about 67 yards, which would allow the north to launch a more powerful rocket than the unha-3."}
{"original": "satellite imagery has shown several screens erected around key parts of the site in recent days -- an apparent attempt to elude satellite surveillance, according to south korea's yonhap news agency. local news reports also speculated thursday that an underground railroad may be delivering necessary parts to the site."}
{"original": "north korea's testing of a long-range missile would likely push south korea closer to deploying the terminal high altitude area defense (thaad) missile shield championed by the u.s."}
{"original": "the thaad system, which is designed to shoot down short, medium, and long-range ballistic missiles, has been described as an insurance policy against north korea's missile attacks, but has been vehemently opposed by china."}
{"original": "with the reports of a possible imminent missile test, japanese prime minister shinzo abe convened a national security meeting in tokyo on thursday. several south korean media outlets reported that japan was considering shooting down any north korean missiles that cross into japanese airspace."}
{"original": "many experts in south korea see the isolated regime's continued military provocations as a carefully calculated move, with tangible objectives."}
{"original": "north korea appears to be intent on driving a wedge between the u.s. and china, kim han-kwon, a professor at the korea national diplomatic academy, told south korea's ytn news network. kim said a new long-range missile test would cajole the international community to push for stronger sanctions against the north, which would force china -- fearing the north's political collapse and the mass exodus that would cause more than its military ambitions -- to fend for its treaty ally."}
{"original": "from north korea's perspective, a schism between china and the u.s. is the ideal situation, kim said. because of the strategic interests at stake, china will be forced to further embrace north korea."}
{"original": "a proposed law that would require people on food stamps to get a job or receive work training is unlikely to deliver the cost savings that its proponents hope, a government analysis shows."}
{"original": "most of the savings from the plan -- which would bump 1.2 million people from the food-stamp rolls -- would be consumed by new administrative costs for the program, according to a report from the congressional budget office. the analysis, released late wednesday, examines several proposals in the farm bill, which was introduced in the house last month."}
{"original": "the work requirement would lower spending on food stamps by about $9.2 billion over the next 10 years, but the costs from the provision would add $7.7 billion in new costs over the same period. that leaves a net savings of $1.5 billion over a decade, the report found."}
{"original": "the bill, sponsored by rep. michael conaway, r.-texas, would require food-stamp recipients between the ages of 18 to 59 who aren't disabled or caring for children younger than 6 to either work or participate in a government-sponsored training program for at least 20 hours a week. by 2026, that would jump to 25 hours a week."}
{"original": "some would receive exemptions, such as pregnant women and people who taking care of an incapacitated person. within a month of receiving food stamps, recipients would have to prove they are working or in job training."}
{"original": "the measure, known formally as the agriculture and nutrition act of 2018, has made its way through committee and now awaits a floor vote in the house."}
{"original": "food stamps, or the supplemental nutrition assistance program (snap), provides grocery money to 41 million americans. following the recession, the program swelled to almost 48 million recipients, but enrollment has declined since 2013 as the economy strengthened. its annual costs run to about $70 billion, or roughly 2 percent of the federal budget."}
{"original": "proponents of the work requirement argue that the goal isn't to save money, but rather to encourage poor americans to find a job or sign up for job training. conway, who is chairman of the house agriculture committee, described the requirement as a springboard out of poverty to a good-paying job."}
{"original": "most of the cost of the proposed snap changes would stem from funding job-training programs for food stamp recipients, the cbo said."}
{"original": "they key question is whether this change will improve working families' employment and earnings, or just leave working age adults and in many cases their children with less food assistance, said stacy dean, vice president for food assistance policy at the center on budget and policy priorities, a liberal-leaning think tank, in an email."}
{"original": "she added, there is no research evidence that people will be better off under these types of changes."}
{"original": "the plan to impose work requirements to get food stamps may result in additional costs that the cbo isn't calculating, dean added. for instance, people who lose snap benefits may turn to food pantries or local charities, burdening local communities. the report also focuses only on federal spending, and states may incur new costs because of the job training mandate."}
{"original": "meanwhile, families may feel another type of cost: hunger and health issues, dean said."}
{"original": "given the research evidence that participating in snap is linked with lower health costs and higher educational achievement, a snap cut would likely have ripple effects that are difficult to measure in the aggregate, but very real for people struggling to put food on the table, she said."}
{"original": "some analysts argue that the requirement isn't necessary since most food-stamp recipients who can work are already working. many are employed in low-wage jobs without guaranteed hours or apply for the food benefit when they are between jobs. about two-thirds of food-stamp recipients aren't expected to work because they are disabled, children or senior citizens, according to the cbpp."}
{"original": "about 17 percent of current food-stamp recipients are between 18 to 59, aren't disabled and aren't caring for young children, the cbo said. the proposed work requirements would cut off about 7 percent of that group from food stamps. but most would likely continue to receive food assistance because they're working enough hours or would receive a waiver, such as if they lived in a high-unemployment area, the analysis said."}
{"original": "dean said, the primary effect of the changes will be to increase hunger and hardship for people who are unable to comply with the new requirements or get caught in the bureaucracy of proving they are already working or are in between jobs."}
{"original": "president trump posted an edited video on social media showing house speaker nancy pelosi repeatedly ripping up a paper copy of his state of the union address as he honored a military hero and other guests. pelosi's office asked twitter and facebook over the weekend to take it down, but the companies refused to do so."}
{"original": "the video, entitled powerful american stories ripped to shreds by nancy pelosi, was made by freedom fights — part of the conservative activist group turning point usa — and shared by mr. trump on his twitter account last week. the 5-minute clip juxtaposes shots of mr. trump praising a tuskegee airman, military families, mothers and children, with shots of pelosi tearing apart the speech between each. the video has more than 11 million videos as of monday afternoon."}
{"original": "in fact, at the address tuesday night, pelosi ripped up her copy only after mr. trump finished delivering it — not in response to any of those specific honorees. afterwards, she said she did so because the president's speech was a manifesto of mistruth, accusing him of repeating falsehoods about health care legislation, infrastructure and other policies."}
{"original": "after the edited video was posted, some democratic lawmakers and pelosi's deputy chief of staff, drew hammill, called out social media giants for allowing it to circulate. hammill said the video was deliberately designed to mislead and lie to the american people."}
{"original": "the american people know that the president has no qualms about lying to them — but it is a shame to see twitter and facebook, sources of news for millions, do the same, hammill tweeted friday, adding that every day that these platforms refuse to take it down is another reminder that they care more about their shareholders' interests than the public's interests."}
{"original": "a facebook spokesperson, andy stone, fired back at hammill. sorry, are you suggesting the president didn't make those remarks and the speaker didn't rip the speech? stone tweeted. hammill responded, what planet are you living on? this is deceptively altered. take it down."}

{"original": "the banks have already been granted one of their wishes after nelson last weekend sent an open letter to his group's members calling on the u.s. central bank to lower interest rates by at least a half of percentage point. the fed did just that on tuesday, though the reaction from the market was mixed."}

{"original": "industry critics accuse the banks of not letting a good crisis go to waste. the banks are trying to seize this moment when people are rightly concerned to push for changes that are unrelated and they have wanted for years, said michael barr, a law professor at the university of michigan who wrote and helped implement the federal dodd-frank bank regulations enacted in 2010 after the financial crisis."}
{"original": "barr added that he doesn't see a connection between what the banks have proposed and anything related to the coronavirus. i don't think it would be helpful for the fed to take these recommendations."}
{"original": "dennis kelleher of better markets, a pro-regulation non-profit that was co-founded by a hedge fund manager and a former corporate lawyer, said the fed should force banks to suspend dividend payments and halt stock buybacks if the industry shows signs of financial distress. that would ensure banks have enough capital to cover bad loans, which could spike if the u.s. fell into recession because of the coronavirus."}

{"original": "the researchers found that liquid laundry detergent packets -- as opposed to granules -- were the most harmful when ingested by children. these exposures resulted in 17 comas, six cases of respiratory arrest, four cases of pulmonary edema, and two cases of cardiac arrest."}
{"original": "two deaths occurred as a direct result of ingestion of laundry detergent packets."}
{"original": "the authors say the detergent packets are more concentrated than traditional detergent, making them more toxic."}
{"original": "kids under the age of 3 accounted for the majority of cases in the study, with 2-year-olds making up slightly more than 16 percent of dishwasher detergent exposures and about 30 percent of laundry detergent exposures."}
{"original": "children at this age will explore their environment by putting things in their mouth and if they simply bite down on one of these things, they'll burst and those contents will shoot to the back of their throat, smith said."}
{"original": "smith said that the study findings provide enough basis to recommend parents opt for traditional laundry detergent over the packets."}
{"original": "there is no reason why children should be rushed to hospitals in a coma and with swelling down their lungs and we have to intubate them, he said. there's no reason why children should die when we have effective, safer alternatives for detergents."}
{"original": "if parents or adults with young children visiting their home do have these products, he urges that they be treated like any other poison."}
{"original": "they should be kept up away and out of sight of children and preferably in a locked cabinet, smith said, because really the time it takes you to pick up a pair of dirty socks and throw them into the laundry is all it's going to take for a child to put one of these in their mouth, bite down, and have it squirt down their throat."}
{"original": "while ingestion causes the most harm, contact with the eyes or lips can also lead to irritation and pain."}
{"original": "depending on the route of exposure, initial symptoms can include drooling, swelling, choking, coughing, and difficulty breathing. parents who suspect their child has come into contact with the liquid inside these packets should seek medical advice immediately."}
{"original": "if parents have any question that their child has been exposed to the contents of a laundry detergent packet, they should call their poison help line to ask if they should be seen and follow their advice, he said."}
{"original": "catholic bishops from across the u.s. are gathering wednesday for a weeklong retreat on the clergy sex abuse crisis at a seminary near chicago. organizers said the retreat, which was requested by pope francis, will focus on prayer and spiritual reflection and not policy-making."}

{"original": "when trish cahill was 15 years old she said she confided in sister eileen shaw at a convent in new jersey. cahill said she told shaw things she'd never revealed to anyone about her now-deceased uncle – a priest – whom she claims sexually abused her, starting at age five."}
{"original": "i would have done anything for her. i would have died for her, cahill said. she gave me everything that was lacking that i didn't even know i was lacking. i was so broken. she filled in all those pieces."}
{"original": "she now describes that process as grooming, saying shaw plied her with drugs and alcohol while teaching her how to have sex with a woman."}
{"original": "i'm with my friends during the day. and i'm with this pedophile nun on the evenings and on the weekends, and in the summer, cahill said."}
{"original": "the catholic church has been plagued with high-profile abuse scandals but pedophile nun is a phrase many people have probably never heard before."}

{"original": "the demands of chastity and celibacy are unrealistic demands for many of us, dispenza said."}
{"original": "dispenza, a former nun from another congregation, remembers what happened when a superior summoned her to her room."}
{"original": "i knelt down right next to her and she kissed me all over softly, my face … and i want to say, 'oh but it wasn't bad,' but it was. and i've carried it with me until today, dispenza said."}
{"original": "through her work with snap she said she would occasionally hear about abuse or cover-ups by nuns but since the publication of a grand jury report identified hundreds of pedophile priests in pennsylvania, at least 18 people have contacted her to share stories of abuse by religious sisters."}
{"original": "asked why we haven't heard much about abuse by nuns until recently, dispenza said, a lot has to do with the culture of nuns which are, they are very, very private by nature."}
{"original": "cahill reported her abuse to the sisters of charity of st. elizabeth in 1994. the congregation paid her a $70,000 out-of-court settlement."}
{"original": "they had canon lawyers on retainer just for people like me. shut her up, pacify her, tell her you love her and you'll pray for her, and send her on her way, cahill said."}
{"original": "in a statement, the congregation told cbs news, the case was investigated immediately when it was reported in 1994 and a settlement was reached that was mutually agreed on by all parties. we believe that the sisters of charity acted in a responsible manner."}
{"original": "we reached out to sister eileen shaw who cahill said she continued to see for years as an adult. she hung up on battiste."}
{"original": "the sisters of charity removed her from her role as a grade school principal but reports she remains a nun. they're providing her with food and housing while restricting her from outside ministry. in the meantime, cahill said the settlement she signed wasn't enough to help her deal with a lifetime of trauma. but she hopes that her voice can help prevent this from happening again."}
{"original": "that this is the beginning of many, many times more that i get to speak and i get to educate, and i get to, possibly, prevent this from happening to anyone ever again, cahill said."}
{"original": "cahill said she believes other nuns had to have known what was going on with her. she's struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder, along with alcohol and drug addiction that she said began with her abuse. the sisters of charity said they're willing to meet with her to address her continuing concerns."}

{"original": "many commentators argue that monetary policy is ill-suited to address the impact of the virus on the economy, and that it is really public health policy (and fiscal policy more broadly) that needs to act, goldman analysts noted. we agree with this point but think that central bankers will still want to do their part to support the economy."}

{"original": "new york -- new york yankees closer aroldis chapman agreed to accept a 30-game suspension under major league baseball's domestic violence policy, a penalty stemming from an incident with his girlfriend last october."}
{"original": "under the discipline announced tuesday, the four-time all-star will serve the penalty from the start of the yankees' season on april 4. he will lose 30 days of pay -- $1,856,557 of his $11,325,000 salary. the agreement specifies he will be eligible for free agency after this season barring any additional suspension for off-the-field conduct that would cost him the necessary service time."}
{"original": "i found mr. chapman's acknowledged conduct on that day to be inappropriate ... particularly his use of a firearm and the impact of that behavior on his partner, baseball commissioner rob manfred said in a statement. i am gratified that mr. chapman has taken responsibility for his conduct."}
{"original": "chapman became the first player penalized a finite number of games under the policy, which mlb and the players' association agreed to in august following several high-profile incidents among nfl players. colorado shortstop jose reyes was given an indefinite paid suspension last week, pending a trial scheduled for april 4, following an alleged altercation with him wife in october."}
{"original": "baseball's investigation of chapman stemmed from oct. 30. chapman's girlfriend, 22-year-old cristina barnea, told police he pushed and choked her. chapman said there was an argument but that he was pushed down by barnea's brother, eventually getting a handgun and firing eight shots into a wall and window while locked in his garage."}
{"original": "the davie police department and broward assistant state attorney stefanie newman declined to file charges, saying conflicting accounts and insufficient evidence made a conviction unlikely. under mlb's domestic violence policy, discipline does not have to be predicated on a conviction."}

{"original": "i want to be clear, i did not in any way harm my girlfriend that evening, chapman said in a statement. however, i should have exercised better judgment with respect to certain actions, and for that i am sorry. the decision to accept a suspension, as opposed to appealing one, was made after careful consideration. i made this decision in an effort to minimize the distractions that an appeal would cause the yankees, my new teammates and most importantly, my family."}
{"original": "chapman's representatives and mlb had been discussing the discipline for about 10 days. a suspension of 46 days or longer would have delayed his eligible for free agency until after the 2017 season."}

{"original": "joe biden has landed a high-profile endorsement for his presidential bid as rep. abby finkenauer becomes the first member of the iowa congressional delegation to take sides in the democratic nominating contest."}
{"original": "finkenauer, a first-term house member from a district donald trump won in 2016 and the second-youngest member of congress, will campaign with biden this weekend, with less than four weeks to go before the feb. 3 iowa caucuses that lead off democrats' 2020 voting."}
{"original": "biden has received more than two dozen congressional endorsements, the most of the democratic presidential field. finkenauer and congresswoman dina titus, a democrat from nevada who also endorsed biden, are the only two members of congress from the four early primary states to publicly back a democratic presidential candidate."}
{"original": "finkenauer said in an interview with the associated press ahead of thursday's announcement that the former vice president's experience, his proposals on infrastructure and other economic matters and his appeal to a wide range of voters make him the ideal democrat to take on trump."}
{"original": "we need somebody at the top who can lead from the white house, someone who's willing to unite not just democrats but the country, finkenauer said. there are days where i swear democrats and republicans are speaking different languages, and there's no translator. ... (biden) is the translator."}
{"original": "at 31, finkenauer also gives the 77-year-old biden a potential bridge to younger democrats, a group that has proved to be more skeptical of his candidacy than older voters."}
{"original": "the congresswoman is scheduled to appear alongside biden in at least eight cities and towns as part of a 10-county, five-day iowa tour that begins thursday. it won't be their first pairing; finkenauer was among the dozens of democratic house candidates biden campaigned for ahead of the 2018 midterms."}
{"original": "her potential influence, even as a freshman, was on display in november, when nine presidential candidates visited her northeastern iowa district for a forum she co-sponsored with labor groups. that slate included the four candidates — biden, former mayor pete buttigieg of south bend, indiana, sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts and sen. bernie sanders of vermont — who polls suggest are the top contenders in iowa."}
{"original": "finkenauer did not frame her support for biden as a rejection of his rivals, saying she's not going to speak to what's going to win votes and what's not. yet her explanation aligns with biden's argument that a center-left approach, coupled with his record as a senator and vice president, makes him democrats' best option in a general election."}
{"original": "finkenauer specifically cited biden's proposals for new infrastructure spending and his role in the 2010 health care overhaul becoming law, saying biden connects the big picture to what it means around kitchen tables across the country."}
{"original": "biden and finkenauer share similar electoral strategies, as well."}
{"original": "a small-town iowa native, finkenauer defeated a republican incumbent in 2018 emphasizing her family's deep ties to the district and establishing cultural connections with voters who've grown increasingly skeptical of democrats. at the same time, she carved out a policy profile that, like biden's, reflects democrats' leftward evolution but with a more cautious agenda than the progressive left fueling warren and sanders. finkenauer and biden are staunch allies of organized labor. finkenauer campaigned heavily on paid family leave and infrastructure improvements. like biden, she supports expanding the 2010 health care law but stops short of single-payer, all-government insurance like what sanders and warren support. she also campaigns aggressively in her district's rural areas and small towns, venues like those that have dominated biden's itinerary in his recent rips to iowa."}
{"original": "it goes back to the uniting factor, finkenauer said of her endorsement. you can't divide rural america and our cities. they do require different attention and different plans, but if rural america is forgotten, then our cities are also hurt, and vice versa. he's understood that from the beginning."}

{"original": "the extra stimulus and measures to ease strains in the financial system announced by central banks over the weekend have failed to prevent stock markets from tumbling again today, as concerns mount about the economic consequences of a global 'lockdown' to combat coronavirus, john higgins, chief market economist at capital economics, told investors in a report."}
{"original": "the fed's surprise rate cut on sunday is designed to shore up the economy by making it cheaper to borrow and to keep lending flowing to businesses and consumers. even so, wall street is growing increasingly pessimistic because consumer spending — the bedrock of the u.s. economy — appears to be grinding to a halt as americans hunker down to avoid the coronavirus."}
{"original": "trading was halted briefly on monday after stocks plunged sharply minutes into the session — the third trading halt this month as investors weigh the economic impact of the pandemic. trading is halted when stocks decline by 7%, 13% or 20% in a single session. the measures were first adopted after the 1987 crash, and until this week hadn't been tripped since 1997."}

{"original": "the only certainty at this point is more volatility, chris zaccarelli, chief investment officer for independent advisor alliance, said in an email. i would expect the market to price in a recession and if that turns out not to be the case — or if credible and specific fiscal and public health policies are put in place to contain the economic and public health risks — that is when you will begin to see a bottom in the stock market."}
{"original": "he added, unfortunately, the fed will be unable to put much of a floor under the market, only congress and the executive branch will be able to do that."}
{"original": "more than 3,700 people have tested positive for the new covid-19 disease in the u.s., and at least 69 have died. globally, the death toll was just over 6,500 on monday, with the weekend seeing an alarming spike in fatalities in three european nations grappling with aggressive outbreaks."}
{"original": "the fed said in a sunday statement that the effects of the outbreak will weigh on economic activity in the near term and pose risks to the outlook. policy makers said they will keep rates at nearly zero until they are confident the economy has weathered the storm, which a number of economists say could push the u.s. into recession."}
{"original": "these are strong measures, fed chairman jerome powell said in a rare sunday news conference, warning that growth in the second quarter would be slow. the virus will run its course and economic activity will resume. in the meantime, we will act to support the flow of credit to companies and individuals."}

{"original": "president trump has been in office for more than a week and has taken advantage of his executive powers by beginning to craft and impose his administration's policies."}
{"original": "seven days into his first term, mr. trump issued more than a dozen executive actions, which include a government-wide freeze on new and pending regulations, the reinstatement of a policy that bars u.s. funding to health providers abroad that discuss abortion as an option and a call for the construction of a physical wall along the u.s.-mexico border."}
{"original": "the one that has provoked the loudest uproar was the travel and refugee ban, which blocks people from entering the u.s. from seven predominantly muslim countries and halts admission for syrian refugees."}
{"original": "most of the actions taken so far are technically presidential memoranda, while some are executive orders, which have the force of law and must be published in the federal register. historically, presidents have embraced the executive order as a tool to use when there's a lack of action from congress. some have been infamously contentious -- president franklin roosevelt signed one in 1942 that established internment camps during world war ii."}
{"original": "mr. trump issued an executive order friday that temporarily bans immigration to the u.s. from seven predominantly muslim countries and indefinitely suspends the syrian refugee program. the president said in his order that their entry would be detrimental to the interests of the united states."}
{"original": "julian zelizer, history and public affairs professor at princeton university, said of the order, the power of the president on national security is vast, especially post-9/11. but he went on to say, i'm sure that will be challenged."}
{"original": "here are some of the major actions that mr. trump has taken so far:"}
{"original": "within hours of being sworn in a week ago, mr. trump signed his first executive order, which seeks to minimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens of the affordable care act (aca)."}
{"original": "the order directs the head of health and human services and other departments to use their authority to waive, defer, grant exemptions from or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the act that would impose a fiscal burden on any state or cost, fee, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance or makers of medical devices, products and medications."}
{"original": "mark peterson, chairman of the public policy department at ucla, said that the order is more of a planted flag and that there are significant constraints on what the president can do with an executive or domestic issue like this one."}
{"original": "the trump administration could change rules related to obamacare, peterson said, that were developed as part of the regulatory process. he pointed out, however, that any new, proposed regulations would have to comply with existing law and would be subject to a lengthy and complex process that would take months to implement them."}
{"original": "what the executive order does do is simply add further uncertainty to the process, which itself is something president trump may wish to accomplish, he said. uncertainty unnerves insurance companies, and that may lead to eventual market withdrawals and more destabilization of the market. that could lead to market collapse. then the administration and republicans will strive to claim that obamacare collapsed under its own weight."}
{"original": "robert j. blendon, professor of health policy and political analysis at harvard's school of public health, agrees that the order itself is not going to affect many people, but it does have enormous significance politically."}
{"original": "if i am a governor, a president of an insurance company, i'm somebody enrolling, i'm saying i don't know what this thing does, but this is a signal that this new president places as job number one, getting rid of this law, he said."}
{"original": "the talking points given to congress by the white house said that one goal of this executive order was to help get the mandates and penalties off the backs of the poorest and sickest americans. the aca's individual mandate requires that americans purchase health care insurance or pay a penalty. but this provision was already somewhat weakened by the fact that the law gave the irs no real ability to enforce the payment of the penalty. the only recourse the tax collecting agency has is to subtract the penalty from the taxpayer's refund. and if the taxpayer isn't entitled to a refund, the irs can carry the penalty over to the following year."}
{"original": "travel and refugee ban, extreme vetting"}
{"original": "mr. trump signed an executive order friday that has blocked people from entering the u.s. from seven predominantly muslim countries: iraq, iran, syria, libya, yemen, somalia and sudan. the order also suspends the syrian refugee program to accept new refugees into the u.s. for 120 days. the order for called the extreme vetting of new arrivals to the united states."}
{"original": "i'm establishing new vetting measures to keep radical islamic terrorists out of the united states, he told an audience at the pentagon, where the action was signed."}
{"original": "his order directs the state department to stop issuing visas to syrian nationals and halts the processing of syrian refugees for 120 days. the president, during his signing of the order at the department of homeland security, also called on the pentagon and the state department to create a plan for safe zones in and around syria to offer protection for syrians fleeing the war there."}
{"original": "but the signed order itself makes no mention of a plan for safe zones in syria. a draft of the order had directed the pentagon and the state department to produce a plan for safe zones in the war-torn mideast nation."}
{"original": "several other points included in the action:"}
{"original": "mr. trump ordered a 120-day suspension of the u.s. refugee admissions program, which is america's broader refugee program. the suspension is intended to provide time to review how refugees are vetted before they are allowed to resettle in the united states."}
{"original": "the executive action appears to be capping the number of refugees from other countries at 50,000 people in fiscal year 2017, saying more than that would be detrimental to the interests of the united states. the obama administration had set a goal of admitting 110,000 refugees into the u.s. in the current fiscal year, which began last october."}
{"original": "the action says that when u.s. refugee admissions program admissions resume, the secretary of state, in consultation with the secretary of homeland security, is directed to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, to prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality."}
{"original": "during a visit to the department of homeland security wednesday, mr. trump signed an executive order that calls on the department's secretary to take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border."}
{"original": "but it won't be that simple. philip schrag, a georgetown law professor whose expertise includes immigration policy, said the u.s. doesn't own all of the land adjacent to the border."}
{"original": "in texas, apparently there are a great many of the lands adjacent to the border in private hands, so the government would first have to seize the land by eminent domain or purchase it from the owners and then deal with the construction problems, he said."}
{"original": "the order also calls on the dhs secretary to identify and allocate funding for the wall's construction and prepare long-term budget requests to submit to congress. house speaker paul ryan is already on board and ready to work with the president to fund the wall. mr. trump also called for the hiring of 5,000 more border patrol agents and the construction of detention facilities near the u.s. border with mexico, although that is dependent on congress allocating money for the hires."}
{"original": "schrag added that the migration of animals along the border will also pose an obstacle to building the wall and the u.s. will have to spend years funding this project."}
{"original": "the challenges of building a physical wall in that terrain are going to mean that this is an extremely expensive project, requiring billions of dollars of appropriations over a period of years, he said."}
{"original": "mr. trump signed another executive order wednesday that intends to allow the attorney general and homeland security secretary to make a determination whether certain cities, known as sanctuary cities, are not eligible for federal grants. schrag, however, said that the order doesn't make sense because it says states and cities can't receive federal grants if they willfully refuse to comply with the law, u.s. code 1373."}
{"original": "that's a little bit puzzling because that subsection of the u.s. code doesn't actually require the cities to maintain any information about the immigration status of people they apprehend or people living in the cities, he said. it only prohibits the officials of states and governments from refusing to send such information to the department of homeland security. it doesn't require anybody to maintain that information. so if the city of new york apprehends somebody for a misdemeanor, this section does not require it to inquire into that person's immigration status."}
{"original": "the order also says the dhs must prioritize deportations for people in the u.s. illegally who have been convicted of a criminal offense, have been charged with one, have engaged in fraud and abused any program related to public benefits, among other criteria. it also calls for the hiring of 10,000 more immigration officers, which congress would have to agree to allocate funding for."}
{"original": "many mayors are resisting the threat posed by the executive order, though not all. fearing a loss of millions of dollars from the federal government, miami-dade mayor carlos gimenez ordered county jails to begin complying with federal immigration detention demands. the move effectively unravels miami-dade's status as a sanctuary for the undocumented."}
{"original": "hiring freeze on civilian government employees"}
{"original": "a memorandum mr. trump issued monday imposed a freeze on all federal civilian employees across the board in the executive branch."}
{"original": "beginning last sunday, no vacant positions were allowed to be filled and no new positions could be created except in limited circumstances. the memorandum does not apply to military personnel, and it instructed the director of the office of management and budget to develop a long-term plan to reduce the size of the federal government's workforce through attrition."}
{"original": "on monday, mr. trump issued a memorandum that reinstates the mexico city policy, introduced in 1984 by president ronald reagan, which bans the granting of u.s. funding to health providers internationally that discuss abortion as a family planning option. since the reagan administration, democrats have rescinded the policy and republicans have reinstated it."}
{"original": "the latest president's memorandum directs the secretary of state to ensure that u.s. taxpayer dollars do not fund organizations or programs that support or participate in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. democrats have called the policy a global gag rule and have blasted the president for taking this action."}
{"original": "president trump's reinstatement of the global gag rule ignores decades of research, instead favoring ideological politics over women and families. we know that when family planning services and contraceptives are easily accessible, there are fewer unplanned pregnancies, maternal deaths, and abortions, said sen. jeanne shaheen, d-new hampshire, in a statement."}
{"original": "mr. trump issued a memorandum monday that called on the u.s. trade representative to pull out of the trans-pacific partnership (tpp) and negotiations that began under president obama. it was largely a symbolic move since congress had no plans to approve the trade deal."}
{"original": "i hereby direct you to withdraw the united states as a signatory to the trans-pacific partnership (tpp), to permanently withdraw the united states from tpp negotiations, and to begin pursuing, wherever possible, bilateral trade negotiations to promote american industry, protect american workers, and raise american wages, the memorandum says."}
{"original": "on tuesday, the president signed memoranda that attempt to renew the process for the construction of the keystone xl pipeline, which was halted by mr. obama, and the construction of the dakota access pipeline."}
{"original": "for the keystone pipeline, the action invites transcanada to re-submit an application for a presidential permit for the construction and operation of the pipeline that would carry petroleum from canada into the u.s."}
{"original": "the memorandum on the dakota access pipeline called it a substantial, multi-billion-dollar private investment in our nation's energy infrastructure and would carry about 500,000 barrels of crude oil from different areas in north dakota to oil markets in the u.s. the army corps of engineers announced in december that it would explore an alternate route for the pipeline after the standing rock sioux tribe said the pipeline interfered with their drinking water, which led to massive protests."}
{"original": "white house chief of staff reince priebus said in a memo last friday that he was communicating a request from the president to the heads of all government agencies that no new regulations could be submitted to the federal register until the head of a department or agency, selected by mr. trump, can review and approve the regulation."}
{"original": "any regulations that were already sent to the federal register must be immediately withdrawn for review and approval. for regulations that have been published in it, but haven't taken effect, their effective date must be postponed for 60 days to review them."}
{"original": "mr. trump signed an executive order on friday that he said would result in a great rebuilding of the armed services of the united states."}
{"original": "as we prepare our budget request for congress, he said, ... our military strength will be questioned by no one, but neither will the nation's commitment to peace."}
{"original": "we will always have your back, he vowed to an audience at the pentagon. according to mr. trump, the new action will provide new planes and ships for the military, along with resources and tools for the nation's men and women in uniform."}
{"original": "mr. trump signed an executive order saturday that bans administration officials from ever lobbying the u.s. on behalf of a foreign government again and imposes a five-year ban on people lobbying the agency they previously worked for. another part of the order said that for two years, appointees must avoid working on issues involving their former clients or employees."}
{"original": "a second week into his presidency, mr. trump signed an executive order that requires that two regulations be removed for every new regulation added. the white house argues that this will reduce the burden the private sector has in complying with federal standards."}

{"original": "towson, md. -- a towson university fraternity has been temporarily suspended after an alleged hazing incident has left one student hospitalized, cbs baltimore reported."}
{"original": "the alleged hazing happened on march 31 off campus. towson university, campus police and baltimore county police are now investigating the troubling claims."}
{"original": "this investigation is going to be thorough. if we uncover any illegal activity whatsoever, those people will be held responsible, said cpl. john wachter."}
{"original": "cbs baltimore has learned from a family member that the victim was forced to eat cat food and drink a substance which he was told was only vinegar and pickle juice."}

{"original": "the incident is also disturbing students across campus."}
{"original": "it's scary. it's scary that someone would ever do that, one student said."}
{"original": "kind of scary to know we go to school with people that might hurt other people intentionally, another student said."}
{"original": "the incident is also sparking outrage in posts on the the greek rant blog. one person said: cool, bros. let's poison someone and destroy their esophagus and stomach lining!"}
{"original": "another said: [these] guys are pure scum. they flat out poisoned a kid and should be charged for attempted murder."}
{"original": "tau kappa epsilon's national chapter is taking the accusations very seriously, suspending the local chapter during the investigation."}
{"original": "at this time, we are investigating this alleged incident at towson university. tau kappa epsilon does not condone hazing in any form. these alleged actions do not align with our values of love, charity, and esteem. we have temporarily suspended the pi-upsilon chapter of tau kappa epsilon. we are fully cooperating with the university and police investigations. if these allegations are found to be true, we will address the allegation swiftly and with appropriate action."}
{"original": "towson university also has a strict hazing policy, and plans to take action if needed."}
{"original": "and when we get an allegation of hazing, we respond immediately, we take it very seriously. if it's confirmed, we take action swiftly, said ray feldman, senior director of communications, towson university."}
{"original": "investigators are now working to determine what exactly happened to the student, where the ritual took place, and above all -- why."}
{"original": "the university is not releasing the victim's name at this time."}

{"original": "mission viejo, calif. -- a southern california swim coach said he had reported rumors of former team usa assistant swim coach sean hutchison being in a forbidden relationship with a u.s. champion swimmer at an olympic training center years ago, cbs los angeles reports. the revelation about hutchison comes after the swimmer, ariana kukors, said this week that he sexually abused her when she was 16."}
{"original": "kukors, now 28, also told authorities that hutchison took thousands of sexually explicit photographs of her when she was a minor, according to a search warrant document by a federal agent."}
{"original": "kukors told officers that he kissed and touched her when she was 16 and engaged in sexual activity with her when she was 17 at the pan pacific swimming championships in victoria, british columbia, the document said."}
{"original": "hutchison, 46, denies abusing kukors and has not been charged with a crime. u.s. authorities and police executed a search warrant at his seattle apartment this week, seizing electronic devices."}
{"original": "marc schubert, who is now the head coach for a mission viejo swim club, told cbs los angeles that he had heard rumors of a relationship between kukors, who was then 21, and hutchison, who was 39, and told his boss to look into it."}
{"original": "a fellow coach from back east called me and said that there were rumors going around the swim meet about sean, and i was shocked, schubert said."}
{"original": "that call came eight years ago, when schubert was coaching olympic hopefuls at the olympic training center in fullerton. he worked there with hutchison."}
{"original": "i felt like i needed to tell somebody, schubert said. so i told his boss."}
{"original": "schubert said the head coach hired a private investigator to follow hutchison."}
{"original": "all they could come up with was ariana and sean's cars parked together at 5 a.m. in the morning in front of his condo, schubert said."}
{"original": "hutchison and kukors both denied they were having a sexual relationship, which is against policy for usa swimming, the u.s. governing body of swimming. without proof, schubert said, the head coach did what he thought was best and asked hutchison to leave."}
{"original": "i think they came to an agreement that they wouldn't divulge the problem if he resigned, schubert said."}
{"original": "hutchison left coaching afterward but remained a member of usa swimming as the owner of member club king aquatic near seattle, the organization said."}
{"original": "hutchison's bio has been removed from the website. michael brooks, the club's head coach, said thursday that hutchison has stepped down as an executive with the club and has had no direct interaction with the club's swimmers for a very long time. he said the club supports past and current king aquatic swimmers."}
{"original": "it's another scandal for usa swimming and for the sports world, which was rocked by a litany of sexual misconduct by former usa gymnastics sports doctor larry nassar. the organization revealed in 2010 that sex abuse allegations were mostly to blame for lifetime bans of 46 members and then said it set up training and enhanced screening for all coaches, officials and volunteers."}
{"original": "usa swimming said thursday that it learned of the underage abuse allegations against hutchison this week."}
{"original": "kukors, the 2009 world champion in the 200-meter individual medley who placed fifth in that event in the 2012 olympics, on wednesday publicly accused hutchison of grooming her for sexual abuse when she was 13 and he was her coach at a seattle-area swim club."}
{"original": "i never thought i would share my story because i was able to leave a horrible monster and build a life i could have never imagined for myself, she said in a statement wednesday. but in time, i've realized that stories like my own are too important to go unwritten."}
{"original": "hutchison, who was an assistant coach on the 2008 u.s. olympic team, said the two were in a relationship after the 2012 olympics and that she lived in his seattle home for more than a year."}
{"original": "at no time did i ever abuse ariana kukors or do anything with her that was not consensual, he said in a statement. i absolutely deny having any sexual or romantic relationship with her before she was old enough to legally make those decisions for herself. prior to that time, i did nothing to 'groom' her."}
{"original": "the investigation comes amid scrutiny over the supervision of people who work with young athletes. nassar was recently sentenced to decades in prison in a case that led to a reckoning for the gymnastics governing body, with top executives resigning and the entire board of directors planning to step down as requested by the u.s. olympic committee."}
{"original": "kukors' attorney in california, robert allard, compared his client's case to the one against nassar."}
{"original": "much like the usoc knew about larry nassar years before his arrest and did nothing, usa swimming had notice in 2010 that sean hutchison was involved in an inappropriate coach-athlete relationship with ariana and took no actions to protect her or other swimmers, he said in a statement."}
{"original": "mike saltzstein, former vice president of usa swimming who previously complained about the organization's handling of sexual abuse cases, questioned the thoroughness of the organization's 2010 investigation."}
{"original": "in retrospect, it was absolutely flawed, he said, adding that a more thorough investigation may have uncovered other problems, including allegations of underage abuse, he said."}
{"original": "now with the benefit of hindsight and time, one would have to question whether there was any integrity to the first time they did this investigation, he said, adding that i sincerely hope that if they're investigating at 21, did they ask what happened before 18?"}
{"original": "this week, ri chun-hee put the bomb in bombastic when she broke the news in her signature style that north korea had successfully tested a hydrogen bomb. whether there's any truth to that claim remains a matter of debate, but the announcement alone has had an impact on both sides of the korean border."}
{"original": "today it was south korea's turn to crank up the pressure -- by pumping up the jam; blasting propaganda and pop music across the border into the north."}
{"original": "but in ri chun-hee, pyongyang deployed its own weapon; rolling her out before the public and the world once again to breathlessly convey the purported h-bomb breakthrough."}
{"original": "we will not disrupt or dismantle the program, she said, until the u.s. reverses its vicious hostile policy toward north korea."}
{"original": "the 70-something grandmother is the go-to news anchor when the regime wants to impress the world, and those under its control."}
{"original": "often outfitted in the chima jeogori, a traditional korean ensemble, her unbridled exuberance and passion plays well in an isolated country that prides itself on the projection of power -- real or imagined -- under supreme leader kim jong un."}
{"original": "otherwise she'd be out of a job, obviously -- or worse."}
{"original": "she barely made it through the theatrically dramatic announcement on the death of kim's father, kim jong il, in 2011."}
{"original": "we make this announcement with great sorrow, she said."}
{"original": "in an interview with chinese television, chun-hee recommended that a good anchor shouldn't shout, but speak gently to viewers."}
{"original": "while that advice that may have fallen on deaf ears to some of north korea's up-and-coming talent -- one of whom recently bellowed through televisions at the country's citizens -- her style is clearly one that we in the west find amusing."}
{"original": "but all the bombast and drama hits home, back home, says david kang, director of the usc korean studies institute."}
{"original": "this is classic propaganda, says kang. the regime is telling a story to the people and she symbolizes that story, which is: 'we're the real koreans.' she wears a traditional korean dress, she's a woman, which is also typically more considered to be the hearth and the home. and yet she's powerful and defiant."}
{"original": "a pack of wild canines found frolicking near the beaches of the texas gulf coast carries a substantial amount of red wolf genes, researchers said, a surprising discovery because the animal was declared extinct in the wild nearly 40 years ago. the finding has led wildlife biologists and others to develop a new understanding that the red wolf dna is remarkably resilient after decades of human hunting, loss of habitat and other factors had led the animal to near decimation."}
{"original": "overall, it's incredibly rare to rediscover animals in a region where they were thought to be extinct and it's even more exciting to show that a piece of an endangered genome has been preserved in the wild, said elizabeth heppenheimer, a princeton university biologist involved in the research on the pack found on galveston island in texas. the work of the princeton team was published in the scientific journal genes."}
{"original": "i think we were all genuinely surprised that there was any indication of red wolf genes in either of these samples, heppenheimer said in a statement. i think of myself as an expert on these animals, but in reality most of the time i'm just looking at my computer. it's the people on the ground, who watch these animals regularly, who have made the major discovery."}
{"original": "the genetic analysis found that the galveston canines appear to be a hybrid of red wolf and coyote, but heppenheimer cautions that without additional testing, it's difficult to label the animal."}
{"original": "a pair of 7-week old red wolf pups explore their habitat at the museum of life and science in durham, n.c., tuesday, june 13, 2017. gerry broome / ap"}
{"original": "ron sutherland, a north carolina-based conservation scientist with the wildlands network, said it's exciting to have found this unique and fascinating medium-sized wolf. the survival of the red wolf genes without much help from us for the last 40 years is wonderful news, said sutherland, who was not involved in the princeton study."}
{"original": "the discovery coincides with similar dna findings in wild canines in southwestern louisiana and bolsters the hopes of conservationists dismayed by the dwindling number of red wolves in north carolina that comprised the only known pack in the wild."}
{"original": "the red wolf, which tops out at about 80 pounds, was once common across a vast region extending from texas to the south, into the southeast and up into the northeast. it was federally classified as endangered in 1967 and declared extinct in the wild in 1980. the u.s. fish and wildlife service in the 1970s captured a remnant population in texas and louisiana that eventually led to a successful captive breeding program. those canines in 1986 became part of the experimental wild population in north carolina. that group has been declining since peaking at an estimated 120 to 130 wolves in 2006. a federal report in april said only about 40 remained."}
{"original": "an additional 200 red wolves live in zoos and wildlife facilities as part of captive breeding programs."}
{"original": "a federal judge in november sided with environmental groups that argued in a lawsuit that efforts by federal authorities to shrink the territory of the wild group in north carolina were a violation of law. the judge ruled u.s. fish and wildlife also violated the endangered species act by authorizing private landowners to kill the canine predators even if they weren't threatening humans, livestock or pets."}
{"original": "a lawsuit by the red wolf coalition, defenders of wildlife and animal welfare institute argued that the federal government's neglect allowed the red wolf population to decline."}
{"original": "the debate over red wolf protections could take on new dimensions with the discovery on galveston."}
{"original": "sutherland said the galveston canines have effectively quashed a decades-old impression that red wolves were a feckless predator overwhelmed by the numerical superiority of coyotes. he adds that the galveston group has dna that can't be found in the animal's captive population."}

{"original": "with voters in 14 states preparing to head to the polls for super tuesday, joe biden's campaign has steadily rolled out a slew of high-profile endorsements in key states, consolidating support from the moderate and establishment wings of the democratic party after his decisive victory in the south carolina primary. cbsnews.com writer melissa quinn reports the floodgates seemingly opened saturday in the wake of biden's win in the palmetto state, which propelled him to second in the national delegate race, trailing bernie sanders by just two delegates. as the former vice president was projected to win the state just after polls closed, former virginia governor terry mcauliffe announced on cnn his support for biden, saying he has the best chance of winning the state in november. joining mcauliffe were fellow virginians senator tim kaine, congressman bobby scott and congresswoman jennifer wexton, who unseated a gop incumbent in 2018. also closing ranks around biden were congresswoman veronica escobar of texas, congressman gil cisneros of california and senator tammy duckworth of illinois — the seventh u.s. senator to back the former vice president. california, texas and virginia all hold their primaries super tuesday, when a total of 1,357 delegates are up for grabs. california and texas will award the most, 415 and 228 respectively."}
{"original": "among those announcing their support for biden on monday was former senate majority leader harry reid, who called him the candidate who can assemble the largest, most diverse coalition possible to defeat trump and lead our country following the trauma of trump's presidency. in a statement reid said, biden will be a much-needed stabilizing force following trump's disastrous term, offering a positive and progressive alternative to trump's dark vision of racism, xenophobia and policies built on cruelty and exclusion. reid, who represented nevada in the senate for 30 years, added, i believe biden is best able to defeat donald trump and enact the policies we all care about. the former vice president is also expected to snag support from his former competitors in the race for the democratic presidential nomination. amy klobuchar, who suspended her presidential campaign on monday, is expected to appear alongside biden at a rally in dallas on monday night. pete buttigieg, who dropped out of the presidential race sunday, endorsed biden in dallas on monday night."}
{"original": "among the field of democratic presidential candidates, biden has always had a high number of endorsements in competitive states like iowa and new hampshire, but they didn't translate into wins in either of the two states. in iowa, biden came in fourth and in new hampshire, he placed fifth, and he came in second, far behind sanders, in the nevada caucuses. but that changed in south carolina, where he received the coveted endorsement of congressman jim clyburn, a democratic kingmaker in the palmetto state. among democratic primary voters, 47% said clyburn's endorsement was an important factor in their vote. biden thanked the south carolina congressman for helping drive him to victory in the state, saying he brought me back. the field of democrats seeking the presidential nomination has thinned in the wake of the south carolina primary. tom steyer ended his campaign on saturday, followed by buttigieg on sunday and klobuchar on monday. this leaves five candidates in the race: sanders, biden, mike bloomberg, tulsi gabbard, and elizabeth warren."}
{"original": "biden warned about the ramifications of sanders winning the nomination in an interview on monday with cbs news political reporter caitlin huey-burns, saying a ticket led by sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, could jeopardize democrats running for the house and senate. there's an awful lot of people who are running for office who don't want to run with bernie at the top of the ticket as a self-proclaimed socialist, biden said. imagine here in texas or in north carolina or in georgia, the idea, if i said to you, 'this is an open test. you're running for office. do you want a very popular, self-proclaimed socialist or a popular mainstream democrat running at the top of the ticket?' my guess is in most states, they'd say no. the former vice president suggested his flurry of endorsements, including from democrats in battleground states, stems from the realization that the success of other candidates could hinge on the eventual democratic presidential nominee. it's not going to be enough just to beat donald trump. we have to win back the senate, we have to keep the house, he said. whether they're right or not, those people who are running for those offices think that bernie was not likely to help them, but hurt them in their pursuit of their senate or their house seat or their governor's seat."}

{"original": "as opposing candidates are dropping from the race, cbs news campaign reporter zak hudak says warren is focusing on telling voters what she'd do in office. ahead of a los angeles speech monday night, the massachusetts senator released a pair of plans, one that includes a $400 billion stimulus package to head off the potential economic impact of coronavirus and another to improve conditions for farm and food chain industry employees. at the start of january, warren had released a plan on preventing, containing and treating infectious disease in light of the spread of coronavirus. this new plan echoes her speech in houston saturday, where she argued she is better suited to take on coronavirus then sanders, biden and bloomberg. it says she would make certain uninsured americans can get free care and evaluation for the virus, and that she would create an emergency paid leave program so that anyone with the cdc's outlined symptoms can be paid for time in quarantine. warren's farmworkers rights plan specifies that she would include farmworkers in her push for a $15 minimum wage as well as replace the h2-a agricultural guest worker visa program with an immigrant worker visa that has full labor protections built in. like her coronavirus economic plan, this one repeatedly references previous proposals and how they will work off of her new ones."}
{"original": "klobuchar is suspending her presidential campaign and plans to endorse biden at a rally in dallas on monday night, a campaign spokesman told cbs news campaign reporter nicole sganga, just hours before voters in 14 states go to the polls on super tuesday. while the minnesota democrat often boasted about kicking off her campaign in the middle of a blizzard, the end of her run was marked by a storm of frustrations and stalled momentum. aides and allies told cbs news they took solace that her campaign performed better and lasted longer than many had initially expected. over the course of the campaign, klobuchar was quick to admit she did not have the name recognition or financial resources enjoyed by some of her rivals. besides hitting the trail, her prospects hinged on her performance in the primary debates, which were crucial for introducing herself to a national audience and raising money. klobuchar positioned herself as a moderate midwesterner who could unite the party, casting doubt on the feasibility of progressive policy proposals like free college tuition and medicare for all put forward by sanders. she also largely steered clear of criticizing biden, given the similarity in their views. armed with her neighborly appeal, klobuchar bet that a strong finish in the iowa caucuses would catapult her candidacy into the top tier. she set out to visit all of the state's 99 counties, a feat she accomplished just before the weeks-long senate impeachment trial trapped her on capitol hill."}
{"original": "she came in fifth place in iowa, signaling that voters in that state did not agree with her proposition that a midwest moderate was best suited to win back the heartland. in what would prove to be the high water mark of her bid, klobuchar managed to bounce back with a strong showing at debate in new hampshire just days before the granite state's primary. she came in third, ahead of warren, a surprising finish that allowed her to continue on to nevada and south carolina."}

{"original": "at the launch of tax season, a coalition of consumer groups is issuing a sobering warning to taxpayers: hot dog vendors and hair stylists are regulated more strictly than paid tax preparers in many states. that can allow preparers to charge exorbitant fees for inaccurate -- even fraudulent -- returns that can ultimately cost consumers thousands of dollars."}
{"original": "errors on tax forms put consumers at risk of fines and lost refunds, yet few states have taken action to ensure that paid tax preparers are licensed, trained and disclose what are often high and unpredictable fees, said tom feltner, director of financial services at the consumer federation of america, in a statement."}

{"original": "but for this tax season, at least, consumers are on their own. how can you protect yourself from an incompetent or dishonest preparer?"}
{"original": "first, know that while few states require licensing, any preparer that has the title of enrolled agent, certified public accountant or that is also a tax attorney must conform with standards set up by their professional organizations, which already demand licensing, testing and continuing education. ask if your preparer has one of these professional designations and inquire about his or her fees -- both how they're calculated and for an estimate of what your return will cost."}
{"original": "can't afford a highly trained professional? anyone earning less than $62,000 in 2015 can have their federal return prepared for free online via the internal revenue service's free file alliance. state returns can also often be completed online for free at your state taxing authority's website. volunteer income tax assistance programs and tax counseling for the elderly programs will also provide free in-person preparation for poor and elderly individuals. you can find vita and tce programs on the irs website by plugging in your zip code."}
{"original": "in absence of state regulation, don't assume that anyone who hangs out a shingle offering tax preparation can be trusted, the consumer groups warn. consumers, not their paid preparers, are on the hook for the accuracy of their tax returns. and the penalty for mistakes can be severe. if you claim the earned income tax credit when you're not eligible, for instance, you can lose the right to claim that credit for up to 10 years."}

{"original": "beyond helping people deal with vermin, shelters put cats to work to generate revenue, which helps ease the burden of caring for the 6 million to 8 million unwanted pets that wind up in their care every year. according to dorminy, working cats take up space that could go to cats who have a better chance of being adopted."}

{"original": "new orleans -- a former new orleans saints cheerleader has filed a discrimination complaint against the nfl team with the u.s. equal employment opportunity commission. bailey davis' case was detailed in a new york times article on sunday. it says she was fired after posting a photo of herself to her private instagram account. it showed her in an outfit that the saints said violated team rules against its cheerleaders appearing nude, seminude or in lingerie."}
{"original": "the times also says the team was looking into whether she attended a party attended by saints players -- a rule violation davis denies."}
{"original": "davis' eeoc complaint states the team has two sets of rules: one for the cheerleaders, who are all women; another, for the players."}
{"original": "the new york times report said the saints anti-fraternization policy requires cheerleaders to avoid contact with players, in person or online, even though players are not penalized for pursuing such engagement with cheerleaders. the cheerleaders must block players from following them on social media and cannot post photos of themselves in saints gear. the same rules don't apply to players, the report said."}
{"original": "if the cheerleaders can't contact the players, then the players shouldn't be able to contact the cheerleaders, said sara blackwell, davis's lawyer. the antiquated stereotype of women needing to hide for their own protection is not permitted in america and certainly not in the workplace."}

{"original": "a campaign that started more than two years ago and featured more than 2,200 candidate events is down to its final weekend in iowa. on monday night, iowa will officially kick off the presidential nominating process with its first-in-the-nation caucuses."}
{"original": "there has been a clear top tier of democratic hopefuls in iowa since the early fall: former vice president joe biden, former south bend mayor pete buttigieg, vermont senator bernie sanders and massachusetts senator elizabeth warren. two of those candidates, sanders and warren, have been stuck in washington for the impeachment trial the past two weeks, while biden and buttigieg have been able to camp out in the state. senator amy klobuchar, who has also been in washington for impeachment, has been working to break into that top tier for several months."}
{"original": "all the major candidates are blanketing the state this weekend and making their closing arguments to fire up supporters and try to win over some of the voters still trying to make up their minds."}
{"original": "the democratic candidates' closing iowa arguments"}
{"original": "bernie sanders has seen a boost in support in the weeks leading up to the caucuses and sat atop many of the polls that have come out in january. while he has been one of the candidates stuck in washington, his campaign has flooded the state with high level surrogates like representative alexandria ocasio-cortez, filmmaker michael moore, and sanders' wife, dr. jane sanders. the vermont senator has spent some of his final days in iowa stressing that his political revolution can begin here."}
{"original": "the entire world will be watching...to see if people of this state are prepared to fight back, sanders said in storm lake on sunday, according to cbs news campaign reporter cara korte. he has also emphasized that the democratic establishment is worried about the strength of his movement. we are their worst nightmare! this is their 'nightmare on elm street,' sanders said in sioux city on sunday, korte reports."}
{"original": "if sanders is successful on monday night it will show that caucus-goers back his message of changing the system and believe he will fight for issues that matter to working class americans. the campaign also has an aggressive ground game in iowa, one that includes hundreds of staffers and volunteers spread across the state looking to turn out his fervent supporters and first-time caucus-goers. although it is a comparatively small demographic in the state, the campaign's outreach with latino voters in the state could also prove to be essential come caucus night."}
{"original": "joe biden has spent months making the case to iowans, in person and in advertisements, that he's best suited to take on president trump in a general election and restore the soul of the nation. in the days leading up to the caucuses, advertisements have emphasized biden's poll numbers against trump and stressed that this is no time to take a risk. we need our strongest candidate."}
{"original": "biden has repeatedly said the values that uphold american democracy are on the line and he's in the strongest position to restore them."}
{"original": "character is on the ballot, biden said in waukee on thursday in a speech aimed at president trump, according to cbs news campaign reporter bo erickson. does it matter if a president lies? does it matter if a president has no moral compass? does it matter if a president believes they're above the law? does it matter if a president is petty? mean? cruel? spiteful? does the character of a president matter? i believe the answer to each and every one of those questions is yes."}
{"original": "biden has also highlighted his ability to withstand a barrage of attacks from republicans, especially after some have questioned whether it was appropriate for his son hunter to sit on the board of a ukrainian energy company. they have thrown everything but the kitchen sink so far, biden said in iowa city on monday. and i'm just gonna say it...i'm still standing and just getting stronger. biden also ramped up his visits to iowa in december and january while focusing more time on smaller and mid-sized communities."}
{"original": "if biden is successful on monday night, his campaign will argue that voters believe he has the best chance of beating mr. trump. while many important issues come up in conversations with iowans, polls suggest caucus-goers are more concerned about finding an electable candidate. the biden campaign hopes those iowans will turn out for the former vice president."}
{"original": "pete buttigieg's argument is that he has the ability to unite the country and appeal to moderate voters, including future former republicans. buttgieg, the other top candidate who has been free to roam iowa during impeachment, has made final trips to some of the counties that voted twice for president obama before switching to mr. trump, and the campaign has emphasized their organizing strength in iowa's pivot counties."}
{"original": "the midwestern former mayor has argued that it will take nominating someone from outside washington for democrats to win in november. he also has pushed back against criticism that he lacks the experience to be president. and in the final days before the iowa caucuses, buttigieg began to draw finer distinctions between himself and some of his top rivals."}
{"original": "i hear vice president biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new, buttigieg said in decorah on thursday, according to cbs news reporter jack turman. but history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up, is to look to the same washington playbook and recycle the same arguments and expect that to work against a president like donald trump, who is new in kind."}
{"original": "at another stop, turman reports, buttigieg again went after biden and sanders. he framed sanders' vision as a revolution where nothing counts unless you go all the way. buttigieg took on two of sanders' signature policy proposals: medicare for all, the ambitious and expensive plan for the government to provide health care to all americans, and free public college."}
{"original": "if buttigieg prevails on monday, it will show there's a desire among some voters for a more moderate message carried by a new voice. the campaign's focus on rural areas and swing counties, combined with aggressive campaign schedule in the final few days, will give many iowans one more chance to hear from him before making up their minds. he also built an extensive field operation, with 34 offices placed around the state."}
{"original": "elizabeth warren, who has also been tied up with the impeachment trial, has sent a flood of surrogates to the state, including former democratic rival julian castro. she built up an early operation in iowa, but has seen poll numbers dip since the fall. at events in iowa last weekend, warren addressed the electability argument head on and stressed that she believes democrats need to nominate a woman to beat mr. trump."}
{"original": "we now know that women candidates have been outperforming men candidates since donald trump was elected, warren said in davenport on sunday, according to cbs news campaign reporter zak hudak. warren also reintroduced her argument, which she frequently made over the summer, that she's a fighter who can defeat mr. trump and deliver progressive victories in washington."}
{"original": "we have to decide whether to give into the fear or whether to fight back, warren said on saturday in muscatine. me, i'm fighting back. that's why i'm in this."}
{"original": "if warren is successful on caucus night, it will be partly due to her organizing strength in the state. her team built a large operation early in the process and deployed organizers around the state before many campaigns built out their iowa infrastructure. her broad range of policy proposals has resonated with voters around the state, even if they don't agree with all of her views."}
{"original": "amy klobuchar has pitched herself as a candidate with a strong electoral record and midwestern roots. at nearly every event she has told people that she has won every race, every place, every time and talks about the surge she sees in iowa in polls and her endorsements."}
{"original": "she has emphasized that she believes the election is a decency check on mr. trump and in order to send a strong message, democrats need to win big. last thing that i will say is just that we want to win, klobuchar said in waterloo on sunday. and my profound advice to you is we'd better not screw this up. and we better put someone at the top of the ticket, and this is my piece for me, someone at the top of the ticket that has the record of bringing people with her and winning big."}
{"original": "while she's been in washington for the impeachment trial, her family members and local legislative endorsers have held events on her behalf. klobuchar has also urged supporters to help push her into the top tier while she's busy with the impeachment trial by volunteering for her campaign. and she's told undecided iowans to call friends and family in minnesota for a performance review."}
{"original": "if klobuchar is successful on monday, it will likely be because her decision to tour every corner of the state, her focus on pursuing more moderate policies, and her message of uniting the country at a time of deep partisan division. she has campaigned relentlessly, holding more events than any other candidate in the top tier, and her campaign believes they'll see an advantage in rural areas because they visited every one of iowa's 99 counties."}
{"original": "andrew yang is approaching the end of a of a 17-day swing across iowa. yang has been campaigning on a message that a changing economy requires a different perspective in washington to ensure americans aren't left behind. he's promised that a win in iowa will also mean a victory in new hampshire."}
{"original": "tom steyer has presented himself as the unconventional politician who can go head-to-head with president trump on the economy. steyer also points to his work building grassroots coalitions and reminds iowans at nearly every town hall that he's the only candidate who will make tackling climate change his number one priority."}

{"original": "to make the debate stage in las vegas on february 19, cbs news political unit associate producer sarah ewall-wice says candidates need to meet either a new polling threshold or received pledged delegates. presidential hopefuls must receive either 10% in four state or national polls or 12% in two state polls out of either nevada or south carolina from a list released by the dnc. those polls must be released between february 15 and 11:59 p.m. et on february 18."}
{"original": "alternatively, candidates can qualify based on pledged delegates. those delegates will be awarded based on the results of the iowa caucuses on february 3 as calculated and reported by the iowa democratic party or the new hampshire primary on february 11 as calculated and reported by the associated press."}
{"original": "based on a cbs news analysis, only three candidates are currently qualified to participate: joe biden, bernie sanders and elizabeth warren. all candidates have until february 18 to qualify."}
{"original": "for the first time, there is no unique donor threshold to help candidates qualify for the debate. this could benefit billionaire mike bloomberg who has said he would not seek donations for his presidential bid. the requirement has kept him off the debate stage in the past. he has not yet reached the polling threshold but has ticked up in support in polls released in recent weeks."}
{"original": "we are thrilled that voters could soon have the chance to see mike bloomberg on the debate stage, hear his vision for the country, and see why he is the strongest candidate to defeat donald trump and bring our country together, bloomberg's campaign manager kevin sheekey said in a statement. mike has run for office three times and never taken a dime from special interests, allowing him to act independently, on the merits, without having to do what donors expect. he is proud to be doing the same with this campaign."}

{"original": "former national security adviser john bolton's book manuscript has piqued the interest of joe biden, who mentioned it today at a campaign stop in fort madison, iowa, cbs news campaign reporter bo erickson noted. it's the timing that caught his attention. according to a new york times report, in early may last year, president trump told bolton to call the ukrainian president, a political neophyte who had just won the presidency, in order to ensure that he'd meet with the president's personal attorney, rudy giuliani."}
{"original": "just about an hour and twenty minutes before the senate voted not to call witnesses, including bolton, biden told the crowd that he was in the race in may, and according to the transcript, the president instructed bolton to go to the ukrainians and try to dig up dirt on joe biden. (h/t cbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarro). the former vice president was likely referring to the fact that it's giuliani who has been alleging and investigating, on mr. trump's behalf, corruption allegations of joe and hunter biden related to ukraine. no evidence of criminal wrongdoing on the part of either biden has surfaced."}
{"original": "earlier this week, the times reported that bolton had written in his book draft that the president had told him in august that he wanted to continue the pause in military aid to ukraine until officials helped with investigations into democrats including biden."}

{"original": "former new york mayor mike bloomberg filed his fourth-quarter fec report. although he was late entering the democratic field, launching at the end of november, his campaign spent nearly $188 million, including over $140 million dollars on television and digital advertising says cbs news campaign reporter tim perry."}
{"original": "our first month's filing represents a down payment and commitment in all 50 states to defeat donald trump, and it shows we have the resources and plan necessary to take him on, bloomberg 2020 campaign manager kevin sheekey said in a statement released by the campaign."}
{"original": "other expenses include $14 million in payments to his private company bloomberg lp. a campaign aide tells cbs news that these expenses include air travel, as mayor bloomberg travels on a plane owned by bloomberg lp and it also includes personnel costs, for employees who switched over to bloomberg's presidential campaign. hawkfish llc, a tech start-up launched by bloomberg also received $12 million for its advertising work for the campaign. the campaign also disclosed $679,000 in spending for some campaign staffers living in new york city, the location of the campaign headquarters. housing and furniture were offered to some staffers who relocated to the city, regardless of seniority. the campaign listed the merchandise it sold as other receipts, saying that the products were union-made in the usa, and priced at cost."}
{"original": "in 2007, u.s. commandos watched as a convoy carrying a powerful iranian military leader made its way to northern iraq. it was a prime opportunity to take out gen. qassem soleimani, who had been accused of aiding shiite forces that killed thousands of american troops in iraq."}
{"original": "but ultimately, military leaders passed on a strike, deferring to deep concerns about the potential fallout of such a provocative attack."}
{"original": "to avoid a firefight, and the contentious politics that would follow, i decided that we should monitor the caravan, not strike immediately, retired gen. stanley mcchrystal wrote last year in foreign policy."}

{"original": "previous presidents have had the opportunity to take measures like what we saw last night but have held back because of the risks entailed and the questions that were there about where this would all lead, said derek chollet, an assistant secretary of defense during the obama administration. unfortunately, those questions are not any clearer today."}
{"original": "indeed, mr. trump's strike against soleimani, the head of iran's elite quds force, thrusts washington and tehran into uncharted territory after months of rising tensions. it's unclear how or when iran will respond, or whether that response will pull the u.s. deeper into a military conflict abroad."}
{"original": "joint chiefs chairman gen. mark milley said officials were well aware of the prospect of retaliation, but believed the risk of inaction exceeded the risk of action."}
{"original": "previous administrations weighed concerns about iranian retaliation as they monitored soleimani, who kept a low profile and traveled only to countries like iraq where the quds force already had strong security. rep. elissa slotkin, a democrat from michigan and former cia analyst who tracked soleimani's activities, said there was a simple question that prevented both the bush and obama administrations from targeting the iranian leader."}
{"original": "was the strike worth the likely retaliation and the potential to pull us into a protracted conflict? slotkin said. the two administrations i worked for both determined that the ultimate ends didn't justify the means."}
{"original": "former obama administration officials told the associated press discussions about taking out soleimani never reached an operational phase. beyond the risk of escalation with iran, officials said they were uncertain that taking the quds leader off the battlefield would have any impact on tehran's regional aggression or support for terror groups."}
{"original": "the obama administration also worried that killing soleimani would undercut diplomatic efforts to forge a nuclear deal with iran, according to one official, the ap reports. the u.s. and five other nations signed a nuclear accord with tehran in 2015, but mr. trump withdrew from the pact after taking office. the officials insisted on anonymity in order to discuss internal national security deliberations."}
{"original": "the operation that killed soleimani early friday was set in motion after an american defense contractor was killed in late december in kirkuk in a rocket attack on an iraqi military base, cbs news national security correspondent david martin reported."}
{"original": "the attack on the base which killed an american was carried out by an iranian-backed militia which is directly controlled, according to u.s. intelligence, by soleimani, martin reported. so that is what got this going."}
{"original": "the u.s. military was simultaneously picking up intelligence in which soleimani was talking about a big action, according to martin. he was traveling around the middle east in what u.s. intelligence believed were a final series of briefings with local militias before this so-called 'big action' was put into play."}
{"original": "he was in syria then went to lebanon and flew to iraq. when he landed at baghdad airport there were two reaper drones circling overhead, martin said. soleimani got into one vehicle while others in his party got into another vehicle. they then took off down the airport road, which is when the drones fired two missiles at each vehicle and scored direct hits, martin said."}

{"original": "she said her experience illustrates systematic problems in the church with sexual abuse claims."}
{"original": "eric hawkins, a spokesman for the church of jesus of christ of latter-day saints, said the institution has faith in the judicial system. the church has previously said it's investigating denson's allegations and last week updated guidelines for how local leaders should deal with sexual abuse claims."}

{"original": "denson said she's not fazed by a dossier prepared by church officials, which was distributed to media by gregory bishop of her criminal record. it includes a shoplifting conviction in 2010 in utah and a police investigation of a death threat she made against bishop that same year. she wasn't charged after police determined she wasn't serious, a police report shows."}
{"original": "maybe five years ago, 10 years ago, discrediting and victim shaming would have worked, denson said. it doesn't work now. there's been at tectonic shift really that has caused a ripple then a wave and then a tidal wave."}
{"original": "the allegations have exposed how the church handles sexual abuse while it also deals with questions about closed door one-on-one interviews between local lay leaders and youth, and the sexual questions that sometimes are asked."}
{"original": "about 1,000 people marched to the church's headquarters last week to demand an end to the so-called worthiness interviews that they argue can lead to unhealthy shaming of youth."}
{"original": "the church last week changed policy to now allow a child to bring a parent or adult with them to the interviews. parents previously were allowed only in a hallway or adjacent room."}
{"original": "the mormon church faced more criticism monday after a top leader during a conference last weekend praised the #metoo movement but referred to sexual misconduct as non-consensual immorality, a remark that some said could be interpreted as victim blaming."}
{"original": "dallas -- united airlines wants to see more paperwork before passengers fly with emotional-support animals -- and don't even try to bring a peacock on board. the airline announced thursday it will tighten rules starting march 1. the changes are similar to those coming at delta air lines."}
{"original": "united said owners will have to confirm that their animal is trained to behave in public, and they will need a vaccination form signed by a veterinarian. the vet will have to vouch that the animal isn't a health or safety threat to other people."}
{"original": "united has seen a 75 percent year-over-year increase in customers bringing emotional support animals onboard and has experienced a significant increase in onboard incidents involving these animals, the airline said in a statement. we understand that other carriers have seen similar trends. the department of transportation's rules regarding emotional support animals are not working as they were intended, and we need to change our approach in order to ensure a safe and pleasant travel experience for all of our customers."}
{"original": "the airline bounced a passenger on sunday who showed up at the airport with a peacock for emotional support. new york city-based photographer and performance artist ventiko said she bought a ticket for her peacock, dexter, so he would have his own seat on sunday's flight from new jersey's newark liberty international airport to los angeles."}
{"original": "united already bans exotic animals and non-household birds. still, the fact that a passenger tried to bring a peacock on board helped illustrate why we needed to revise our policy, united spokesman charles hobart said."}
{"original": "guide dogs have been occasional flyers for years, but recently there has been a surge of emotional-support animals. federal regulations allow them -- if they're not too big or exotic -- but airlines can ask for a doctor's note verifying that the passenger needs the animal."}
{"original": "airlines are convinced that scofflaws abuse the rules. passengers often have to pay $125 or more each way to bring a small pet on board, but comfort animals fly free."}
{"original": "the crackdown by delta raised objections from service-dog owners. jenine stanley of the guide dog foundation for the blind is upset that delta will require service-dog owners to file a health form at least 48 hours before a flight. that could make emergency trips impossible."}
{"original": "i don't think i've ever filled out a form for assistance. now my animal is going to have to be verified every time, she said."}
{"original": "united said it will not require forms for trained service animals. it's unclear, however, what would stop someone from claiming their comfort animal is a trained service animal."}
{"original": "the association of flight attendants-cwa (afa) -- a union -- has praised united's announcement, saying the airline has taken a very thoughtful, responsible approach to this issue, cbs news' kris van cleave reports."}
{"original": "the airline's increased requirements for emotional support animals will reduce fraud and protect the legitimate need of animal assistance for passengers with disabilities and veterans, sara nelson, international president of afa, said thursday in a statement. this is about maintaining safety, health and security for passengers and crew, while ensuring accessibility for those who need it."}
{"original": "bethlehem, pa. -- a pennsylvania university has kicked a sorority off campus due to what officials are calling a reprehensible scavenger hunt that involved drugs, alcohol and sexual activity. alpha chi omega's theta chi chapter lost its recognition by lehigh university for two years and will be banned from campus through may 2020."}
{"original": "the lehigh greek community blog published by the university says the sorority hosted a december scavenger hunt in which participants were given a list of tasks that involved the use of drugs and alcohol, sexual activity and other activities that violate the bethlehem school's policy."}
{"original": "the sorority was suspended pending an investigation by a disciplinary committee that called the activity reprehensible."}
{"original": "alpha chi omega can appeal. the national organization conducted an investigation resulting in probation and individual punishments."}
{"original": "the blog says, this incident was a significant, reprehensible event that the entire chapter was aware of and leadership endorsed. this event did not only take place this year, but there is credible information that this event has been going on for years. the panel is deeply concerned about the escalated nature of the content of this year's list and we are unconvinced that this escalation wouldn't continue."}
{"original": " … the current conduct history of axo does not lead the panel to have confidence in the chapter's ability to act and demonstrate care and concern for its members, particularly related to health and safety concerns. this type of behavior is simply unacceptable considering the current climate on college campuses."}

{"original": "speaking with cbs this morning co-host gayle king, apple ceo tim cook and vice president lisa jackson are revealing new details about the racial equality initiative, launched last summer after the killing of george floyd at the hands of minneapolis police."}
{"original": "it's about giving people opportunity, cook said. i can't wait to see students that are able to enjoy the innovation hub at the propel center."}
{"original": "the company said it would team up with historically black colleges and universities around the country to open special learning hubs — propel centers at 100 or so of these educational institutions across the country."}
{"original": "think of it as an innovation hub and we'll work on things from coding, to machine learning, to creativity, to entertainment arts, cook said."}
{"original": "on top of those skills, the centers will also help students sharpen their entrepreneurship — a lot of the things that we do here will be in the curriculum there, cook summarized."}
{"original": "asked if he was a good student himself, cook answered: i tried to be."}
{"original": "as for vice president lisa jackson, she first served as president obama's epa administrator before coming to apple in 2013."}
{"original": "jackson, who runs all of apple's environmental and social policy efforts, said hbcus have a history of turning out the leaders in our community."}
{"original": "she described apple's propel centers as both a place for all hbcu students and the surrounding community, and a talent pool for apple and other companies to find ready recruits."}
{"original": "we know that the talent is already there. we know these students are trying to do what every student does — propel themselves to a better future and a better life, jackson said."}
{"original": "even the name of the program itself — propel center — aims to motivate."}
{"original": "this is meant to be a little bit of wind under their sails, jackson explained."}
{"original": "in detroit, a city with at least 50,000 small businesses owned by people of color, apple is revolutionizing job training."}
{"original": "the first ever, in the united states, app developer academy, jackson revealed, aimed at giving some extra lift to black and brown developers."}
{"original": "she said, there is a concentration of strivers in detroit who are trying to build their city back."}
{"original": "tim cook called the city a fantastic footprint."}
{"original": "we want to provide people a mechanism to learn to code, to learn how to write world class apps, he said."}
{"original": "aspiring applicants should demonstrate desire, creativity, a level of interest, cook said, adding that you want to feel that desire of someone who really wants to make a go at this."}
{"original": "one of the programs at their detroit academy is aimed at people who have never studied coding at all."}
{"original": "cook said he believed anyone could learn to code."}
{"original": "you know, i did it in school, he said. once you start, you recognize that it's just another language."}
{"original": "but while building the next generation of minority tech entrepreneurs, apple is also supporting the current one through a $10 million dollar investment in harlem capital, a fund whose goal is to back a thousand companies founded by people of color in the next 20 years."}
{"original": "asked when and how he first identified systemic racism, cook said he firsthand witnessed it while growing up in the 1960s and 1970s."}
{"original": "when i was five years old, john lewis was beaten on the edmund pettus bridge. when i was eight years old, the riots at stonewall happened, cook recounted. both of these changed the course of time and changed the course of my life as well."}
{"original": "he continued, when you either experience those sort of things or read about those things, and then apply them to what you're seeing today, there was systemic racism, there is systemic racism, and it's not gonna go away unless we do something about it."}
{"original": "cook is speaking out about the current political situation as well — saying he was shocked by the violence that occurred at the u.s. capitol as congress met to count state-certified electoral college votes."}
{"original": "it was a very, very sad and shameful day. i could — probably like you — i couldn't believe what i was seeing either. i felt like i was in some other form of reality or something, cook said. i think it's key that people be held accountable for it. this is not something that should skate."}
{"original": "the tech ceo is holding social media app parler accountable, claiming it failed to remove language inciting violence from its platform. popular with the far-right, apple took it off the app store over the weekend — effectively preventing anyone with an iphone from using it."}
{"original": "parler has some issues with moderation. there are some incitement to violence examples on there, and they need to step it up on the moderation. and i'm — our hope is that they do that and get back on the store, cook said."}
{"original": "he pointed out parler's removal was just a suspension, rather than a full ban."}
{"original": "parler ceo john matze has publicly criticized his app's removal from apple and other hosts, claiming he was being censored and his first amendment rights were being violated."}
{"original": "all we're asking, gayle, is that he meet the terms of service, cook said. we have terms of service for our app store, and some of those terms of service he's in violation of."}
{"original": "looking ahead to 2021, cook said his goal remains the same as years' past — to do as much as i can to help other people and enrich their lives."}
{"original": "that's apple's goal, he said. for the country, i hope that we enter a stage in our country where we're back to bipartisanship."}
{"original": "the stock market has trended upward since election day, stoked by optimism that president donald trump's agenda will translate into stronger corporate earnings. while wall street may be having some second thoughts lately, the trump bump seems to be taking hold on main street in the form of stronger hiring by bullish small and midsize employers."}
{"original": "the pace of hiring by large companies hasn't changed much since the election, but smaller firms have shown a notable uptick in hiring, according to a morgan stanley (ms) study. it examined net monthly changes in employment among firms of different sizes (on a three-month rolling-average basis) relative to historical averages."}
{"original": "morgan stanley based its analysis on data from the adp research institute, a division of payroll-processing giant adp. this week, adp reported that private sector employers added a stronger-than-expected 263,000 jobs in march, on a seasonally adjusted basis. small and midsize companies led the way in job creation, generating more than 80 percent of all new private sector jobs last month."}
{"original": "small-business hiring may have lagged -- unusually so -- in this labor market recovery, but its animal spirts are certainly awake now, said the morgan stanley report, which noted that small-business owners are feeling more upbeat lately, while the number of startup companies has also surged."}
{"original": "since the presidential election, optimism among small-business owners has risen to levels not seen since 1983, a year that marked the start of a prolonged economic expansion, said william dunkelberg, chief economist for the national federation of independent business (nfib). the trade group publishes a monthly small-business optimism index based on a survey of a random sample of its member firms."}
{"original": "higher levels of optimism are starting to translate into stronger hiring and capital spending, said dunkelberg. manufacturers and construction companies are particularly upbeat, he said."}
{"original": "why has hiring by small businesses lagged during the recovery? consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of u.s. economic activity, was slow to bounce back, and that took a toll on many small businesses, explained dunkelberg."}
{"original": "the recovery was awful for small businesses in terms of sales growth, he said."}
{"original": "mr. trump's unexpected win in november has many feeling decidedly more upbeat, added dunkelberg. that's because they're hopeful the administration will deliver on its promises to reform the tax code, roll back regulations and upgrade america's infrastructure."}
{"original": "his vow to repeal and replace the affordable care act is another cause for optimism. the cost of health insurance and complying with regulations have been among the biggest problems small businesses have faced in recent years, said dunkelberg."}
{"original": "existing tax policy is another pain point for many small businesses, he added. many want tax cuts and a simpler code, among other policy changes."}
{"original": "a win by hillary [clinton] wouldn't have been viewed as a change in the status quo, just more of the past eight years, said dunkelberg."}
{"original": "of course, what goes up must come down. the trump euphoria on main street may eventually fade if the administration fails to deliver on its pro-business agenda. last month's collapse of the republican-backed health insurance bill has undoubtedly given some supporters in the small-business community pause."}
{"original": "not according to dunkelberg. many, he said, see it as just a temporary setback."}
{"original": "navarro -- a north texas college known for its incredible cheer program is being sued by a former cheerleader, cbs dfw reports. the now 20-year-old says he was drugged and sexually assaulted by an assistant coach."}
{"original": "living in fear is … probably the hardest part, he said. just the images, the memories, you can never shake them."}
{"original": "he enrolled at navarro college in 2015 hoping to win a national cheerleading championship. he and his family met andre mcgee the very first day."}
{"original": "everybody said, 'oh you're one of the new cheerleaders. andre takes great care of you boys,' said the cheerleader's mother. all campus police, the man who was in charge of the dorms, they all knew andre."}
{"original": "online, the 40-year-old mcgee called himself the assistant cheer coach and #1 recruiter at navarro college. his twitter profile proudly proclaimed he was best friends with and right hand to head cheer coach monica aldama. in several social media posts, mcgee refers to himself as a tough big who is proud of his littles."}
{"original": "the alleged victim said the pictures don't tell the whole story. in his civil lawsuit against mcgee and navarro college, he said mcgee would slap and hit male cheerleaders and make them drop their pants at his command. he claimed mcgee had hundreds of nude photographs of the cheerleaders and would force the rookies to drink and/or consume drugs, calling it big girl games."}
{"original": "according to the suit, in october 2015 mcgee forced the alleged victim to take xanax. he said he later awoke to mcgee sodomizing him. he said he stayed quiet about the alleged assault because he still dreamed of winning a championship. but three months later he called police."}
{"original": "cbs dfw obtained the police report, which shows a second cheerleader making similar claims. that cheerleader did not want to talk on the record for this story, but attorneys for the first cheerleader believe others will come forward."}
{"original": "we have spoken to other victims in this case, said lacey turley most. and we've heard from other cheerleaders that there were other victims."}
{"original": "the cheerleader said he also reported the assault to navarro college and monica aldama. that's when he learned mcgee did not work for the school."}
{"original": "we were totally under the impression that he was the assistant coach, said the cheerleader's mother. a navarro college spokesperson later told cbs dfw mcgee was allowed to volunteer with the navarro cheer program, adding that once the school learned of the allegation, the college notified him that he could no longer volunteer. you can read navarro's full statements below."}
{"original": "the alleged victim and his family said there was no indication that mcgee was only a volunteer."}
{"original": "the boys had to answer to him 24/7, said the cheerleader's mother. he had to have their schedule, so he knew exactly what classes they were in, when."}
{"original": "navarro county indicted mcgee on a charge of sexual assault in march 2017, but for the next ten months the case stalled. that's why the mom says she reached out to the i-team. it's taken way too long, she said, saying her son feels like he's less important because he's a boy."}
{"original": "we contacted the district attorney's office to ask why all of mcgee's court hearings had been cancelled. the da, lowell thompson, said they were waiting for mcgee to be released from the freestone county jail on another charge. but when the i-team called the jail, we were told there was no other charge, and mcgee had never been behind bars."}
{"original": "we found mcgee substitute teaching at fairfield isd. two days after we relayed that information to thompson, police arrested mcgee. thompson later told the i-team he had been given bad information about mcgee's whereabouts."}
{"original": "mcgee made his first court appearance in december. he, his mother and his pastor all took the stand. his mother told the judge mcgee had been around kids his whole life, while his pastor said he worked with the choir … and sunday school classes. all of them denied the allegations."}
{"original": "while the criminal case is moving forward, the cheerleader's family is also pursuing a civil lawsuit against mcgee and navarro college. head coach monica aldama is not a defendant, but she is repeatedly named as part of the suit. she declined to be interviewed for this story but sent cbs dfw a statement."}
{"original": "i have never and would never tolerate sexual harassment or sexual abuse in the navarro college cheer program, the statement reads in part. i would not remain silent if i were aware that any sexual misconduct were occurring in the cheer program. in addition, i do not accept or condone unlawful drug and alcohol use by navarro cheer team members. andre mcgee volunteered as a helper for the cheer team. he was never an assistant coach and never had authority over the team or cheer team members. the cheerleader who has accused mr. mcgee … never made any complaint to me. once i learned of the allegations against mr. mcgee, i ensured that he had no further contact with the navarro college cheer team."}
{"original": "the i-team also reached out to more than 30 current and former navarro college cheerleaders. seven supported mcgee and said they had never witnessed any inappropriate behavior. two back up the cheerleader's claims of hazing and sexually inappropriate behavior. the rest did not respond to the i-team's questions."}
{"original": "cindy said her son is still dealing with the fallout of the alleged assault."}
{"original": "the fear of that man … and what has happened to him has just crushed him on an emotional level that none of us can understand."}
{"original": "the cheerleader said the lawsuit is about helping others. i just don't want it to happen to anyone else."}
{"original": "andre mcgee attended navarro college as a student from 1995 until 2000 and participated in the college's cheerleading program. from november 2003 through june 2004, navarro college employed mr. mcgee as a resident advisor (ra). this was the only time navarro college employed mr. mcgee. navarro college never employed mr. mcgee in its cheerleading program and never employed mr. mcgee as an assistant coach. mr. mcgee was not affiliated with navarro college in any way at the time of the arrest referenced in your email. the safety and welfare of students is of utmost priority to navarro college. the college prohibits sexual misconduct, including any acts of a sexual nature against an individual without consent. navarro college has strong policies and procedures for reporting, investigating, and responding to all allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault. navarro college remains committed to the prevention and detection of sexual harassment and abuse. upon receipt of a report regarding sexual misconduct, navarro college investigates the matter and acts swiftly to provide an appropriate response."}
{"original": "as previously stated, andre mcgee was not a navarro college employee. it is the college's understanding that mr. mcgee was allowed to volunteer with the navarro cheer program. the college did not compensate mr. mcgee for any time he volunteered. once navarro college was made aware of any allegation of misconduct by mr. mcgee, the college notified him that he could no longer volunteer for navarro cheer. this matter is the subject of a currently pending lawsuit. navarro college does not comment on pending litigation. navarro college denies any and all wrongdoing with respect to the allegations against mr. mcgee. any further statement by the college will be made by the college's attorneys in the lawsuit."}
{"original": "the following is a transcript of the interview with vice president mike pence that aired sunday, jan. 20, 2019, on face the nation."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: good morning and welcome to face the nation. we begin today with vice president mike pence. welcome and so good to have you here."}
{"original": "vice president mike pence: yeah, morning margaret."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: you arrived here today with secret service agents who are with you 24 hours a day. are they getting paid during this shutdown?"}
{"original": "vice president pence: they're not at this point and 800,000 federal workers are also going without pay and if we don't have a resolution then those paychecks won't go out at the end of this week. but we also have a crisis at our southern border, margaret. humanitarian and a security crisis. and as the president laid out yesterday we're absolutely determined to secure the border to end the shutdown. and what the president articulated yesterday was a good faith, common sense compromise where the president laid out his priorities: building a physical barrier on the southern border - a steel barrier - new resources for border patrol, humanitarian assistance technology. but the president also announced that- that he'd be willing to support legislation that provides temporary relief, three years of temporary legal status for those in the daca program and also those who have temporary protective status. it really is an effort to- to compromise and- and we really look forward to the senate taking this bill up tuesday and beginning to work in earnest not just to end this government shutdown, which is a burden on the families of 800,000 federal workers but even more importantly in that to address the crisis that we face in our southern border."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: if this is a genuine attempt why weren't any democrats included in the consultations for this?"}
{"original": "vice president pence: well, margaret we've been talking to democrats--"}
{"original": "vice president pence: --over the last four weeks. well, first the president's met repeatedly with democrat leadership all the way through a week ago last wednesday--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: but democratic leaders have said this is a nonstarter."}
{"original": "vice president pence: well look, that- that meeting in the situation room a week ago wednesday the president looked at speaker pelosi and said, ok if i gave you everything you wanted, if i signed legislation for most- funding most of the government and- and had a 30 day extension on homeland security. he said to her - i was sitting there - he said, would you give me funding to secure the border and a wall? and she said, no. so what the president directed us to do, our negotiation team, was to reach out with rank and file democrats in the house and in the senate. and what the president presented yesterday really is an effort to bring together ideas from both political parties. i- i think it is an act of statesmanship on the president's part to say, here is what i'm for. it includes my priorities, it includes priorities that democrats had- have advanced for some period of time. and we believe it provides a framework--"}
{"original": "vice president pence: --a framework for ending this impasse, securing our- our border and reopening government."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: i- i didn't hear you say which democrats are supporting it though."}
{"original": "vice president pence: --well the- the president met this week, we all did, with the problem solvers caucus. i think we all know who was there and we- we were grateful for their presence. but we've had- we've had good conversations with democrat members of the senate but look, their- their- their leadership has discouraged them in the house and the senate from engaging the administration so i want to respect those conversations. but, i think what the american people saw the president do yesterday was say, i- i- you know i- i want to set the table for us resolving this issue in a way that achieves his objectives to secure the border, end the humanitarian security crisis, end the government shutdown, but also to- to bring together- bring together the democrats' priorities to accomplish that. that's what the american people expect us to do. and- and honestly you know- you know the hearts and minds of the american people today are thinking a lot about it being the weekend where we remember the life and work of the reverend dr. martin luther king jr. but one of my favorite quotes from dr. king was, now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. you think of how he changed america. he inspired us to change through the legislative process to become a more perfect union. that's exactly what president trump is calling on the congress to do. come to the table in a spirit of good faith."}
{"original": "we'll secure our border, we'll reopen the government and we'll move our nation forward as the president said yesterday to even a broader discussion about immigration reform in the months ahead."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: you've said that this is not- this offer on the table is not amnesty. the president this morning tweeted something that i'd like you to clarify though. he said, amnesty will- will be used on a much bigger deal whether on immigration or something else. was that an offer for a path to citizenship?"}
{"original": "vice president pence: well i'll- i'll let the president's words stand. but at the end--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: do you know what he meant?"}
{"original": "vice president pence: -- at the end. yes i do."}
{"original": "vice president pence: at the end of his remarks yesterday he made it very clear that while this proposal is just it's- look- it's- it's funding to secure our border, to build a steel barrier on the southern border, to give additional resources that the department of homeland security has requested in terms of personnel and facilities and detection technologies as well as humanitarian assistance. but the president's also said he's more than willing in this legislation that comes to the floor of the senate on tuesday, to extend temporary relief to people that are in the tps program as well as--"}
{"original": "vice president pence: --the daca program. but at the end of that speech i hope the american people heard him. so once we move past this impasse, once we begin to build more trust between the parties. this is a president who is absolutely determined to fix our broken immigration system in this country. but he has always said it all begins with border security."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: will he come down from that five point seven billion dollar ask? is that also up for negotiation?"}
{"original": "vice president pence: well look, that's the president's request and the senate leadership has agreed to bring the bill to the floor with our request for funding for the wall and all the other resources. but look we recognize the legislative process is a process of give and take. the democrats want to bring amendments or recommendations forward. i know the president will give them due consideration, but the president is absolutely determined to build a steel barrier on the southern border in the 10 priority areas that the department of homeland security said that we need a physical barrier. it's roughly two hundred and thirty four miles. it's not from sea to sea. it's two hundred thirty four miles of additional steel barrier. and- and- and frankly you look back at prior administrations- you know virtually the last four presidents have all built similar barriers on the southern border including president obama. and we just want to respond to the needs that we have to secure our border. but once the legislative process goes forward i know president trump will be listening to recommendations from the other party."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: there is an inspector general report this week that said that the trump administration actually separated far more children from their parents than initially reported, more than the twenty seven hundred. in fact they couldn't put a figure on it. do you regret that policy?"}
{"original": "vice president pence: well the president reversed that policy. and now we have in place--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan : but do you regret what happened to the more than twenty seven hundred children?"}
{"original": "vice president pence: i think- i think we, we regret not only that circumstance but what's driving that circumstance. it's one of the reasons why the president had secretary nielson negotiate with mexico that going forward we'll be able to allow families to remain in mexico while they apply for asylum and it would obviate the need to bring them into our system that is ill-equipped to handle the extraordinary influx of families and unaccompanied minors that's coming across our border today. a majority of the sixty thousand people that are- that are detained attempting to come into our country illegally every single month more than two thousand a day are now families and unaccompanied children. we now have an arrangement with mexico where those families can remain in mexico. the president in his proposal also recommended that we allow children to apply for asylum--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: in the countries of origin."}
{"original": "vice president pence: --in the central american countries. look, the human traffickers and the cartels take american cash to- to entice families to send either their family or their children on the long and dangerous journey north. we want that to end. these reforms will advance that from ending. but look it's time for congress to come to the table and take this important step."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: i do want to- i'm sorry to interrupt you, but i do want to ask you two- two quick things since it's so rare we get time with you. do you care to comment on this buzzfeed report that the special counsel seemed to have found some issue with, but wasn't specific. what part of this report was inaccurate?"}
{"original": "vice president pence: well, we- i- the- the special counsel said that the report of buzzfeed was inaccurate and- and frankly the response by many in the national media to take it at face value and engage--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: well, what part of it was wrong?"}
{"original": "vice president mike pence: --and i- in- in hyperventilating about accusations against the president was really a disgrace. look, look--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: but you don't know which part of it was inaccurate."}
{"original": "vice president mike pence: there is a- there is an obsession in this town. look, we- we've fully cooperated with the special counsel, over a million documents, we'll continue to fully cooperate. i'll let the special counsel address that issue. the president's maintained that he did nothing wrong. but look, what the american people saw this week was the obsession of many in the national media, and frankly some democrats on capitol hill, to assume the worst about this president."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: well that's why i wanted you to--"}
{"original": "vice president mike pence: and- and frankly we appreciate"}
{"original": "vice president pence: --the special counsel--"}

{"original": "vice president pence: well frank- we- we--"}
{"original": "margaret brennan: --but can i ask you--"}
{"original": "vice president pence: --appreciate the special counsel making it clear that that report was inaccurate."}
{"original": "vice president: --and- and look, the- the special counsel is going to complete his work. and we're- we're going to continue to focus on the issues that are most important to the american people."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: very quickly, four americans were killed in a suicide attack in syria this week. that same day you gave a speech and said the isis caliphate was defeated. do you regret in hindsight saying that?"}

{"original": "scientists are reporting progress on a blood test to detect many types of cancer at an early stage, including some of the most deadly ones that lack screening tools now."}
{"original": "many groups are working on liquid biopsy tests, which look for dna and other things that tumors shed into blood, to try to find cancer before it spreads, when chances of a cure are best."}
{"original": "in a study published thursday in the journal science, johns hopkins university scientists looked to see how well their experimental test detected cancer in people already known to have the disease. the blood tests found about 70 percent of eight common types of cancer in the 1,005 patients. the rates varied depending on the type -- lower for breast tumors but high for ovarian, liver and pancreatic ones."}
{"original": "in many cases, the test narrowed the possible origin of the cancer to one or two places, such as colon or lung, important for limiting how much follow-up testing a patient might need. it gave only seven false alarms when tried on 812 others without cancer."}
{"original": "the test is nowhere near ready for use yet; it needs to be validated in a larger study already underway in a general population, rather than cancer patients, to see if it truly works and helps save lives -- the best measure of a screening test's value."}
{"original": "we're very, very excited and see this as a first step, said nickolas papadopoulos, one of the hopkins study leaders. but we don't want people calling up and asking for the test now, because it's not available, he said."}
{"original": "some independent experts saw great promise."}
{"original": "it's such a good first set of results that it gives hope this approach will pan out, said dr. peter bach, a health policy expert at memorial sloan kettering cancer center who consults for a gene testing company. anything close to 50 percent or 40 percent detection is pretty exciting stuff, and this one did better than that, he said."}
{"original": "dr. len lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the american cancer society, was encouraged that the test did well on cancers that lack screening tests now. if a blood test could find 98 percent of ovarian cancers at an early stage, as these early results suggest, that would be a significant advance, he said."}
{"original": "but he cautioned: we have a long way to go to demonstrate its effectiveness as a screening test."}
{"original": "the test detects mutations in 16 genes tied to cancer and measures eight proteins that often are elevated when cancer is present."}
{"original": "it covers breast, colon and lung and five kinds that don't have screening tests for people at average risk: ovarian, liver, stomach, pancreatic and esophageal. prostate cancer is not included. a blood test already is widely used for prostate cancer -- the psa test -- but its value for screening is controversial."}
{"original": "researchers tried the new test on people whose cancers were still confined to where it started or had spread a little but not widely throughout the body. it detected 33 percent of breast cancers, about 60 percent of colon or lung cancers and nearly all of the ovarian and liver ones. it did better when tumors were larger or had spread. it did less well at the very earliest stage."}
{"original": "the test probably will not work as well when tested in a general population rather than those already known to have cancer, researchers say. hopkins and geisinger health system in pennsylvania have started a study of it in 10,000 geisinger patients who will be tracked for at least five years."}
{"original": "the work was financed by many foundations, the mayo clinic, the national institutes of health and howard hughes medical institute, which provides the associated press with funding for health and science coverage. many study leaders have financial ties to gene testing companies, and some get royalties for patents on cancer detection methods."}
{"original": "researchers say the test could cost around $500 based on current materials and methods, but the ultimate goal is to commercialize it, so what a company would charge is unknown."}
{"original": "also this week, taiwan-based cellmax life gave results on its liquid biopsy test, which looks for whole tumor cells shed into blood, at an american society of clinical oncology conference."}
{"original": "researchers tested 620 people getting colonoscopies or with confirmed colon cancer at a hospital in taiwan. the company said its test had an overall accuracy of 84 to 88 percent for detecting cancer or precancerous growths and a false alarm rate around 3 percent."}
{"original": "the company's chief executive, atul sharan, said u.s. studies should start this year. the test is sold now in taiwan for $500, but should cost around $150 in the u.s., he said."}
{"original": "dr. richard schilsky, chief medical officer of the oncology society, said results are encouraging, but the test needs more study, especially to see if it gives too many false alarms."}
{"original": "the last thing you'd want is a test that tells you you might have cancer if you don't, he said."}
{"original": "washington — president joe biden signed 10 executive orders at the white house on thursday as part of his national strategy to combat covid-19, warning americans that the pandemic which has already claimed more than 408,000 american lives is certain to get worse."}
{"original": "above all our plan is to restore public trust, mr. biden said at the white house, appearing alongside vice president kamala harris and dr. anthony fauci, who will now play a more public role as the new administration embarks on its pandemic response effort."}
{"original": "let me be very clear, things are going to continue to get worse before they get better. the memorial we held two nights ago will not be our last one unfortunately, the president said, referring to a pre-inauguration memorial service he attended at the lincoln memorial."}
{"original": "experts expect the united states' covid-19 death toll to reach half a million people next month. mr. biden promised that his administration's approach, laid out in a 198-page plan, matches the gravity of the moment, calling it a war-time undertaking."}
{"original": "the cases will continue to mount, we didn't get into this mess overnight, and it's going to take months for us to turn things around, mr. biden said. but let me be equally clear, we will get through this, we will defeat this pandemic, and to a nation waiting for action, let me be the clearest on this point: help is on the way."}
{"original": "under the national strategy for the covid-19 response and pandemic preparedness, the administration aims to vastly expand testing, reopen the majority of k-8 schools in the next 100 days, and administer 100 million vaccine doses by the end of april. this will be one of the greatest operational challenges our nation has ever undertaken, mr. biden said of the vaccine distribution effort."}
{"original": "the national strategy says the biden administration aims to stand up a coordinated response while restoring trust, accountability and a sense of common purpose in our response to the pandemic, an unmistakable dig at the trump administration's handling of the pandemic. jeffrey zients, the coordinator of the white house's covid-19 response, told reporters on wednesday that the situation the biden team is inheriting is so much worse than we could have imagined."}
{"original": "white house officials couldn't say when the vaccine will be available for the general population — those without underlying health conditions who are under age 65 and not essential workers."}
{"original": "the brutal truth is, it's going to take months before we can get the majority of americans vaccinated, mr. biden reiterated thursday. the u.s. was administering nearly 1 million doses a day when mr. biden took office, so the country is already roughly on pace for 100 million doses by the end of april. but even hitting that goal means only 50 million people will be vaccinated, since both authorized vaccines require two injections to be effective."}
{"original": "officials also acknowledge that much of their plan will be impossible if congress doesn't pass the administration's nearly $2 trillion coronavirus proposal."}
{"original": "mr. biden said he would use the defense production act (dpa) to speed vaccine and ppe production and reduce supply-chain log jams. the national strategy calls for prioritizing supplies that could cause bottlenecks and potentially using the dpa to produce glass vials, stoppers, syringes [and] needles to ensure that drug manufacturers have all the supplies they need to keep packaging vaccine doses as they're produced. officials said their goal was to shore up stockpiles for the immediate need and any future pandemics."}
{"original": "our national plan launches a full scale war time effort to address the supply shortages by ramping up production and protective equipment, syringes, needles, you name it, mr. biden said."}
{"original": "the administration is directing the federal emergency management agency (fema) to create a liaison or point person for each state, something intended to hasten the vaccination process. the administration will also establish a coronavirus testing board."}
{"original": "to increase vaccine availability, the administration plans to erect vaccine centers at stadiums and community centers and mobilize federal personnel to help administer shots. this is a departure from the trump administration's approach, which sent vaccine doses to states and localities and largely left it to them to figure out distribution."}
{"original": "under the biden administration, vaccine doses will no longer be held back by the government, except for a small strategic reserve. the trump administration, too, eventually adopted this very policy after the biden transition team announced it would release all but a few doses."}
{"original": "the biden administration is also putting a spotlight on racial and geographic disparities in healthcare. one of the president's executive orders establishes a health equity task force, led by dr. marcella nunez-smith, to compile data on the coronavirus' disproportionate impact on minority communities."}
{"original": "former president trump's surgeon general, jerome adams, has been asked to stay on to advise mr. biden's covid-19 response. zients said the administration will hold regular press briefings with government doctors including anthony fauci."}
{"original": "directing agencies to address vaccine and ppe supply shortfalls using all authorities including dpa; directing osha to publish worker safety guidelines; establishing a coronavirus testing board; directing government scientists to identify new treatments for covid-19; directing hhs and cdc to provide clear guidance on safe school reopening; directing agencies to expand data collection and reporting capacity; establishing a health equity taskforce that focuses on racial/geographic health disparities; dr. marcella nunez-smith will be chair; enhancing the collection, sharing and analysis of covid data including metrics by race and ethnicity; require mask wearing on planes, trains and other forms of public transportation; bolster clinical care facilities and long term care facilities."}
{"original": "seoul, south korea -- north korea's acting ambassador to italy, jo song gil, went into hiding with his wife in november, south korea's spy agency told lawmakers in seoul on thursday. a high-profile defection by one of north korea's elite would be a huge embarrassment for leader kim jong un as he pursues diplomacy with seoul and washington and seeks to portray himself as a player in international geopolitics."}
{"original": "south korean lawmaker kim min-ki said an official from seoul's national intelligence service shared the information during a closed-door briefing. kim did not say whether the spy agency revealed any information about jo's current whereabouts or whether the diplomat had plans to defect to south korea. kim said the nis said it has not been contacted by jo."}

{"original": "kim said the nis official said that jo and his wife left the official residence in early november, weeks before his term was to end in late november. kim said he couldn't confirm whether the nis official revealed whether jo and his wife were accompanied by any children. the nis earlier said it couldn't confirm a south korean media report that jo was under the protection of the italian government as he seeks asylum in a western nation."}
{"original": "north korea has not yet commented on jo's status."}
{"original": "an official with the italian foreign ministry said the north korean hadn't requested asylum from italy. the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with standard practice, said jo no longer held diplomatic status in italy. that presumably refers to his government's ending his diplomatic assignment to italy and his being recalled."}
{"original": "north korea, which touts itself in its propaganda as a socialist paradise, is extremely sensitive about defections, especially among its elite diplomatic corps, and has previously insisted that they are south korean or u.s. plots to undermine its government."}
{"original": "north korea may publicly ignore jo's possible defection or hold back harsh criticism to avoid highlighting the vulnerability of its government as it pursues diplomacy with washington and seoul, said koh yu-hwan, a north korea expert at seoul's dongguk university."}
{"original": "the last senior north korean diplomat known to have defected is thae yong ho, a former minister at the north korean embassy in london, who fled to south korea in 2016."}
{"original": "while not identifying him by name, the north's state media then described thae as human scum and claimed he was trying to escape punishment for serious crimes."}
{"original": "thae, who has been an outspoken critic of kim jong un while living in south korea, denied the accusations and said he defected because he didn't want his children to live miserable lives in the north."}
{"original": "it's possible that jo is trying to defect because of similar reasons, said koh, who is a policy adviser for south korean president moon jae-in. it could be difficult for some diplomats to accept being called back to the north after enjoying years living in the free west. they could want their children to live in a different system and receive better education."}
{"original": "the highest-level north korean to seek asylum in south korea is hwang jang-yop, a senior ruling workers' party official who once tutored kim jong un's late father, dictator kim jong il."}
{"original": "hwang's 1997 defection was hailed by many south koreans as an intelligence bonanza. hwang died in 2010."}
{"original": "in 1997, the north korean ambassador to egypt fled and resettled in the united states."}
{"original": "not much is publicly known about jo, who had been north korea's acting ambassador to rome after italy expelled then-ambassador mun jong nam in october 2017 to protest a north korean nuclear test."}
{"original": "kim, the lawmaker who listened to the spy agency's briefing, said the nis official said the agency has yet to figure out many details about jo."}
{"original": "about 30,000 north koreans have defected to south korea since the end of the 1950-53 korean war, according to south korean government figures. many defectors have said they wanted to leave north korea's harsh political system and poverty. north korea often accuses the south of deceiving or paying people to defect, or claims that they have been kidnapped."}
{"original": "a decade ago this very month, in cairo's tahrir square, social media was being praised. its role as an organizing tool during the pro-democracy rallies had many calling the arab spring the facebook revolution instead."}
{"original": "but for all its glowing promise, we quickly learned social media is only as good as how it's used."}
{"original": "the major difference between now and then is, more than ever before, our experiences on social media are determined by hidden decisions made by the social media companies themselves, said ramesh srinivasan, who was in tahrir square back then researching how twitter and facebook were giving voice to the voiceless."}
{"original": "it used to be something more of an open pipe, he said."}
{"original": "srinivasan is now an author, and a professor at ucla's department of information studies. what we are seeing when we go online is likely to be that which is most sensational or inflammatory. they're predicting whatever is most likely to grab people's attention."}
{"original": "keeping us engaged on social media is how big tech makes money, and the past four years have proven lies and conspiracy theories are unfortunately more engaging that the truth."}
{"original": "and the danger in that is, what? asked correspondent lee cowan."}
{"original": "the danger is it's gonna present us with an extremely distorted view of reality, srinivasan replied. the fringe becomes the new normal."}
{"original": "that is a study in the trump presidency. his reality tv roots taught him controversy gets ratings. and he used his social media feeds in much the same way. no one has a bigger bully pulpit than the president of the united states, and no one before mr. trump used it with such abandon online."}
{"original": "the attack on the capitol changed all that."}
{"original": "after years of defending his presence on their platforms, facebook, twitter, youtube and other social media giants booted mr. trump, claiming he'd incited a riot."}
{"original": "amazon removed an entire site from its servers: parler, which had become the place favored by many conservatives."}
{"original": "de-platformed was a word we learned a lot about this past week."}
{"original": "i think big tech has made a terrible mistake, and very, very bad for our country, president trump said tuesday. they shouldn't be doing it. but, uhh, there's always a counter-move when they do that."}
{"original": "while many applauded the move, the precedent of shutting out the leader of the free world made many people uncomfortable, too. it's a huge power to wield, one that is currently held in the hands of a very few."}
{"original": "it's not a new argument; the ceos of the major tech companies have been called on the carpet before."}
{"original": "who the hell elected you, and put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report and what the american people are allowed to hear? sen. ted cruz asked tech executives during an october 2020 hearing on the communications decency act."}
{"original": "in 2019 rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez asked facebook ceo mark zuckerberg, so, you won't take down lies or you will take down lies? i think it's just a pretty simple yes or no."}
{"original": "but claiming big tech is running afoul of the first amendment by de-platforming those it deems harmful may be missing the larger point."}
{"original": "cowan asked, is kicking someone off any of these social media sites an infringement of their free speech rights?"}
{"original": "no, it isn't, replied daphne keller, who directs the program on platform regulation at stanford university's cyber policy center. they are not subject to the first amendment. they are not the government."}
{"original": "when it comes to digital speech and the first amendment, she said, it gets messy pretty fast."}
{"original": "cowan said, this isn't just a free speech argument on the part of users; it's also a free speech argument on the part of the providers as well, right?"}
{"original": "people who want to sue platforms, and force them to carry speech they don't want to, have a double first amendment problem, keller said. first of all, those people don't have a first amendment claim against the platforms, and second of all, the platforms do have a first amendment argument against being forced to carry speech they disagree with."}
{"original": "but what if the argument over regulation was reframed – less about speech, and more about changing how big tech exposes us to that speech?"}
{"original": "yaël eisenstat used to work for facebook as one of the heads of election integrity, where she saw firsthand just what these companies do with all that content."}
{"original": "this idea that it's just this free flow of information is false. it's a curated flow of information, she said. it's a business model that is predicated on gathering as much of our human behavioral data as possible, to create these little boxes of who we are, to then target us with ads."}
{"original": "that's all fine if we're shopping for sneakers, she said. but those same algorithms apply to our politics, too. we'll willingly follow ideas that pop up down the rabbit hole, and those who want their messages to spread know the more controversial, the better."}
{"original": "i don't think that mark zuckerberg set out with the idea that, 'i wanna create a platform where the most outrageous, salacious, hate-filled speech wins.' i don't think that was his goal, eisenstat said. but instead of holding the platform responsible for what somebody posts, it's the tools that i want them held responsible for, not the actual speech on the platform, except for, of course, if the speech breaks the law."}
{"original": "but it sounds like what you're saying, though, is that'd be changing the business model, pretty much, said cowan."}
{"original": "big tech has promised more transparency, and better enforcement of their own rules when it comes to spreading dis- and mis-information."}
{"original": "facebook removed more hate speech this year than ever before; twitter, the same. even tik-tok is being more proactive."}
{"original": "but that will likely not be enough going forward."}
{"original": "cowan asked ramesh srinivasan, can we trust them to do this kind of regulation on their own, though?"}
{"original": "no. we should not be trusting twitter or any private company to magically serve the public interest. i think, if anything, the last four years have taught us that we can't do that."}
{"original": "a year before the end of his second term, president bill clinton talked about the challenges of regulating the internet: that's sorta like trying to nail jell-o to the wall."}
{"original": "that was more than two decades ago. times change, but the value of good stewardship doesn't."}
{"original": "this discussion is about how we wanna live, how we wanna be, as a country and as a people, said srinivasan. it's a discussion about our humanity, at the end of the day. i do believe that you can force people to tie their actions to beliefs that might be a little more virtuous than their mere bottom lines."}

{"original": "the new generation of wireless technology known as 5g is exciting industry leaders who believe the rapid advancements toward faster internet speeds will spur innovation in every sector of the u.s economy."}
{"original": "on monday night, verizon ceo hans vestberg spoke for nearly an hour about 5g during his keynote address at the annual consumer electronics show, or ces, which is being held virtually this year. 5g was also featured in more than a dozen breakout sessions throughout the week as industry leaders discussed its impact on businesses, government, and consumers."}
{"original": "but researchers caution that the promises of life-changing applications will take years and that lawmakers in washington might not be ready to lead the way."}

{"original": "installing new cell towers or upgrading existing ones with hundreds of thousands of pizza-box-size antennas on every block, and making available more radio frequencies for those towers to connect to, are critical for the technology's growth, experts say."}
{"original": "5g frequencies are available in the low-band, mid-band, and high-band spectrums. in the past few years, the federal communications commission has opened up 5 gigahertz of spectrum for 5g use. there's an ongoing auction to open up an additional 280 megahertz of space in the mid-band spectrum, which has so far raised a record $80 billion, a senior fcc official told cbs news."}
{"original": "the official said opening up new spectrum space has been challenging because much of the space is already in use."}
{"original": "industry leaders agree that the full benefits of 5g will be unlocked with more high-band, millimeter wavelength frequencies becoming available. the high-band category provides the most bandwidth and fastest speeds, but the signal doesn't travel far and can't penetrate walls."}
{"original": "that means having a tower on every corner of every block and maybe on every floor of every building, according to adams. as a result, companies deploying the infrastructure often get locked into regulatory battles with cities and towns."}
{"original": "the issue from the industry side is the new towers they're rolling out for 5g are not the 300 foot tall metal structures, adams said, adding, they're not the same kind of thing that most of the permitting and review rules had in mind when they were developed."}
{"original": "local governments want to preserve their ability to review and collect fees on new deployments in their towns, while the companies want to roll out 5g in a timely fashion and cost effective way, adams explained."}
{"original": "the fcc said it has adopted reforms to help speed up the deployment of 5g."}
{"original": "in 2018, the commission prevented localities from charging more than it costs them to process and manage applications. more recently, the fcc said state or local officials must approve any request for modification of existing towers that doesn't substantially change the dimensions of existing structures within 60 days."}
{"original": "dr. nicol turner lee, a senior fellow in governance studies at the brookings institution and director of the center for technology innovation, told cbs news that a centralized committee to help with policy while engaging all the stakeholders will reduce regulatory battles and improve rollout efficiency."}

{"original": "but some, like technology consultant and ceo of the palmer group shelly palmer, say lawmakers in washington aren't tech savvy enough to usher in a new era of advancement."}
{"original": "we've got lawmakers and legislation that are years behind the technology, palmer said. while it's always been that way, we've never had technology accelerating at a pace like this."}
{"original": "the coronavirus pandemic has increased the need for connectivity as americans work and study from home. beyond a fast internet connection, experts say 5g will support advances in telemedicine, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, and much more."}
{"original": "palmer said the really cool stuff like mixed reality, which is the combination of physical and digital objects co-existing and interacting in real time and other applications that will rely on the fast speed and low latency of 5g, is going to take a few years."}
{"original": "in 2010, when 4g wireless technology hit the market, it took two to three years before life-changing applications like ride-sharing and video conferencing became commonplace ."}
{"original": "adams said 5g will also bring about the ability to deploy literally millions of tiny little sensors on all kinds of infrastructure and goods that will lead to a lot more data collection across networks. additionally, cell towers on every block means more precise geolocation of individual cell phones."}

{"original": "tehran, iran - iran on wednesday snubbed a proposal agreed to by four influential oil producers to cap their crude output if others do the same. a senior iranian oil ministry official said tehran has no intention of freezing oil output levels."}
{"original": "mahdi asali, iran's opec envoy, said his country will in fact keep increasing its crude exports until it reaches levels attained before international sanctions were imposed on tehran over its nuclear program."}
{"original": "asali's comments came as iran's oil minister was expected to hold three-way, closed-door talks in tehran with his counterparts from iraq and venezuela."}
{"original": "on wednesday, venezuela joined russia, saudi arabia and qatar in conditionally agreeing to cap their output at last month's levels in order to halt a slide that has pushed oil prices to their lowest point in more than a decade. oil prices recently plummeted below $30 a barrel, the lowest in 13 years."}
{"original": "the four countries made their announcement following an unexpected meeting on tuesday in the qatari capital of doha that pointedly did not include iran. they agreed to act only if other producers made similar freezes."}
{"original": "asali said the fall in oil prices should be blamed on oversupply and that it was up to saudi arabia and others to cut down production to boost oil prices. he said the four nations that participated at the doha gathering could stabilize oil prices on their own -- if they cut their production by 2 million barrels a day."}
{"original": "these countries increased their production by 4 million barrels when iran was under sanctions, asali was quoted as saying by the shargh daily. now it's primarily their responsibility to help restore balance on the market. there is no reason for iran to do so."}
{"original": "iran is eager to ramp up its exports now that sanctions related to its nuclear program have been lifted, saying recently it aims to put another 500,000 barrels a day on the market. figures from the international energy agency show it pumped 2.9 million barrels daily in december, before sanctions were lifted."}
{"original": "iran used to export 2.3 million barrels per day, but its crude exports fell to 1 million in 2012."}
{"original": "on tuesday, iran's petroleum minister, bijar namdar zangeneh, signaled the islamic republic has no intention of giving up its share of the market. he acknowledged that global markets are oversupplied, but he said iran will not overlook its quota, according to comments carried by his ministry's shana news service."}
{"original": "even with iran's cooperation, it was unclear if the doha plan would be enough to put a floor under prices."}
{"original": "the united arab emirates' energy minister, suhail mohamed al-mazrouei's, refused on wednesday to discuss the doha proposal after giving a keynote address at a dubai conference in which he mentioned low oil prices only in passing."}

{"original": "employers added about 273,000 jobs last month, the labor department said friday, surpassing forecasts. the gains were spread widely among sectors. health care, food services, construction, professional services and government all saw job gains. the unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5%."}
{"original": "average hourly pay for workers increased 3% from the year before, an indication that wage growth remains muted despite the nation's low unemployment rate."}
{"original": "the unemployment rate has been at or below 4% for two years, and wage growth is, if anything, decelerating, heidi shierholz, senior economist at the economic policy institute, said on twitter."}
{"original": "businesses and economists are viewing the latest job numbers with caution, wary of any slowdown from the spread of the coronavirus. the surveys that form the basis of the government's monthly employment report were taken in the second week of february, before the outbreak had begun to spread widely across the u.s."}

{"original": "another strong jobs report underscores the resilience of the u.s. services sector — which accounts for the lion's share of employment — at least until february, said brian coulton, chief economist at fitch ratings. the fallout from china's sharp downturn and the changes in u.s. firms and households behavior in response to the covid-19 outbreak, including reduced travel, will doubtless take a toll on service sector and broader u.s. economic activity from march."}

{"original": "during his first day in office, president joe biden swiftly moved to dismantle major parts of the trump administration's immigration legacy by halting border wall construction, pausing most deportations from the interior of the u.s., rescinding travel and immigration restrictions on several muslim-majority countries and safeguarding protections for so-called dreamers."}
{"original": "mr. biden signed 17 executive orders — including six immigration-related directives — shortly after being sworn in on wednesday as the country's 46th president. the department of homeland security also announced it would implement a 100-day moratorium on deportations for immigrants in the u.s. facing removal, and suspended the trump administration's policy of requiring non-mexican asylum-seekers to wait in mexico for their u.s. court hearings."}
{"original": "through the flurry of early actions, mr. biden signaled his willingness to roll back former president donald trump's restrictive immigration measures using the same executive authority that his predecessor invoked to enact more than 400 unilateral changes."}
{"original": "one memo signed by mr. biden ordered the departments of homeland security to safeguard the obama-era deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program that offers works permits and deportation relief to more than 640,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the u.s. as children."}

{"original": "another directive issued by mr. biden revoked mr. trump's travel and immigration restrictions on a group of 13 countries, most of which are predominantly muslim or african. the order instructed the state department to begin processing visa applications from the 13 countries."}
{"original": "those actions are a stain on our national conscience and are inconsistent with our long history of welcoming people of all faiths and no faith at all, mr. biden wrote, referring to mr. trump's restrictions, which he accused of being discriminatory."}
{"original": "mr. biden, through another directive, rescinded an order signed by mr. trump in january 2017 that broadened who immigration agents could arrest and deport. mr. biden said his administration would reset policies governing who immigration officials should prioritize for deportation."}
{"original": "the policy of my administration is to protect national and border security, address the humanitarian challenges at the southern border, and ensure public health and safety, mr. biden wrote. we must also adhere to due process of law as we safeguard the dignity and well-being of all families and communities."}

{"original": "a fourth presidential directive formally halted mr. trump's bid to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census figures used to award states seats in congress."}
{"original": "through a proclamation, mr. biden also ordered officials to pause barrier construction along the u.s.-mexico border within seven days and ended the national emergency declaration mr. trump used to divert billions of dollars in military funding to finance his long-promised wall. during his last week in office, mr. trump had extended the proclamation through february 2022."}
{"original": "an additional memo extended work permits and deportation protections for certain liberian immigrants in the u.s. it also required u.s. citizenship and immigration services (uscis) to expedite adjudication of green card applications from liberians who are eligible for a legalization program passed by congress in 2019."}
{"original": "among other changes, mr. biden and his advisers have also vowed to use executive authority to terminate the public charge rules that make it tougher for low-income immigrants to obtain green cards and end several asylum policies mr. trump instituted along the u.s.-mexico border."}

{"original": "faced with at least two lawsuits accusing it of selling defective merchandise, apparel seller lularoe is making it easier for consumers to get refunds."}
{"original": "under what lularoe describes as its make good program consumers who bought an item between jan. 1, 2016, and april 24, 2017, and are displeased with the quality of their garments can get a full refund, credit or exchange. starting april 25, under its happiness policy, customers can get a refund, credit or exchange for up to 30 days after their purchase and may get a credit or exchange within 90 days. certain restrictions apply, and receipts are required."}
{"original": "some people continue to have questions specifically about the quality of lularoe leggings. we are sorry if we haven't adequately addressed their concerns. we hope these policies will, lularoe ceo mark stidham said in a statement announcing the new refund and exchange policy. we want everyone to be happy and believe they received a fair value from their lularoe clothing purchase."}
{"original": "the policy marks a change in tactics for the corona, california-based multilevel marketing firm, known for colorful leggings. lularoe has repeatedly said its defective merchandise rate was below average for the apparel industry and insisted that its products get multiple quality assurance checks before going on sale."}
{"original": "despite those assurances, many customers have complained on social media and elsewhere that its leggings are prone to rips and tears after only minimal use."}
{"original": "a private facebook group with more than 26,000 members is chock full of posts from irate lularoe customers. the two customers who started the group, julie dean of boston and suzanne jones of lafayette, california, are the lead plaintiffs in a march 23 federal lawsuit in california that accuses lularoe of knowingly selling defective merchandise. a similar case was filed april 17 in state court in oregon that accuses the company of unfair trade practices. both cases are seeking class-action status."}
{"original": "stidham, who co-founded lularoe with his wife deanne in 2013, sounded less contrite in an interview with business insider, insisting that while he sympathized with customers who have experienced problems, he didn't think a blanket apology was necessary."}
{"original": "christina hinks, a former lularoe consultant who's a fierce critic of the marketer, argued on her blog that stidham appeared to be waffling about whether the company owed anyone an apology."}
{"original": "generally speaking as a businessperson, it's commonplace to issue an apology to a customer or group of customers that have felt betrayed and improperly served by a company, hicks said. no, not lularoe."}
{"original": "lularoe sales have reached $1.8 billion over the past year, making it one of the world's largest multilevel marketers, an industry that includes companies such as amway, herbalife (hlf) and pampered chef."}

{"original": "besides the product defect cases, lularoe also faces a lawsuit alleging that it charged customers sales tax in states that don't collect the fees on sales of clothing. lularoe also has been accused of infringing on a lion design created by a hungarian artist. the company has denied wrongdoing in both cases."}
{"original": "another suit, by a utah payments processor complete merchant services (cms), accuses lularoe of violating a contract that made cms the exclusive supplier of credit and debit payments to lularoe. cms provided the point-of-sale system that lularoe had blamed for wrongly collecting sales taxes in states that didn't charge it on clothing purchases."}
{"original": "current and former consultants have also accused lularoe of understating the risks and overstating the potential rewards available to consultants. to join lularoe, representatives are required to order a minimum of $5,000 worth of product, which is high for the direct-sales industry."}

{"original": "why are some people more successful in their careers than others?"}
{"original": "as it turns out, our fates may be sealed long before we enter the workforce. a new study finds that birth order plays a big role in determining who makes it to the corner office."}
{"original": "the study by sandra black, an economist and visiting fellow at the brookings institution, contends that firstborn children are more likely than their siblings to eventually rise to become ceos, government officials and others in high-ranking positions. black collaborated on the study with erik gronqvist and bjorn ockert of sweden's institute for evaluation of labour market and education policy."}
{"original": "the trio analyzed swedish government data on a half-million men born between 1952 and 1982. among other things, they examined the results of psychological and intellectual tests administered by the government before the men began their mandatory military service around the age of 18. (sweden ended compulsory military service for men in 2010, although the country soon plans to reintroduce it in response to global security challenges.)"}
{"original": "black and her colleagues discovered that firstborn kids (in this case strictly men) were more likely than those with older siblings to have certain personality traits that breed career success, at least by traditional measures. firstborn kids tend to grow up to be emotionally stable, persistent, outgoing and willing to take responsibility and initiative, according to the study."}
{"original": "black has studied the effects of birth order in the past and come up with similar findings. in previous research, she analyzed data from norway and discovered that, even within the same family, firstborn children tend to outshine their younger siblings when it comes to educational attainment, earnings, intellectual prowess (as measured by iq) and health outcomes."}
{"original": "her latest study, which also analyzed occupational data, found that the personality differences between firstborns and their siblings have an influence over their career paths. firstborn children are much more likely than their siblings to become managers. meanwhile, later-born kids are more likely to be self-employed as adults."}
{"original": "what's more, firstborns are more likely to hold jobs that require strong social and leadership skills as well as conscientiousness, agreeableness, emotional stability and extraversion. such jobs include chief executive officers, legislators and senior government officials."}
{"original": "while the study focused on men, black and colleagues found similar patterns for women when they analyzed occupational data."}
{"original": "interestingly, the effects of birth order are influenced by gender differences among siblings. for instance, a boy with an older brother is even less likely to possess certain career-enhancing personality traits than a boy with older sisters. and boys with older brothers are more likely to enter creative fields, such as writing and music, than boys with older sisters, according to the study."}
{"original": "why does birth order seem to make such a big difference? in the age-old debate over nature versus nurture, nurture rules the day here. in other words, first-born kids tend to have certain traits because of their experiences growing up, rather than because of physiological differences tied to birth order, according to black."}
{"original": "to test to role of biology on personality differences by birth order, black and her colleagues studied a subsample of families in which biological birth order is different than social birth order, owing to the death of a child or an adoption. in the end, they concluded that the birth order effect is driven entirely by environmental factors, or experiential differences among siblings."}
{"original": "as teenagers, firstborn kids are more likely to spend time reading books and doing homework than their siblings are as teens. firstborns also spend less time watching tv or playing video games."}
{"original": "while most parents try not to favor one child over another, the reality is that many fall short of that goal. according to the study, parents tend to spend less time discussing school work with their youngest children than they do with their older kids -- which suggests that, despite their best intentions, many parents invest more of their time in their firstborns."}
{"original": "black said her study is intended to shed light on factors that influence outcomes for children. we are chipping away at understanding what determines children's outcomes and how it relates to family and environment, said black."}
{"original": "she added: there's something about birth order that really matters on a whole bunch of different dimensions."}
{"original": "everywhere president trump looks, he sees a wall."}
{"original": "as he lobbies for money for his long-promised border wall, mr. trump keeps talking up other barricades. he's pointing to walls in israel, at the vatican, even at former president barack obama's house — though fact checkers have pushed back on the accuracy of some of his claims."}
{"original": "with bricks and mortar on his mind, mr. trump declared at a cabinet meeting on wednesday, walls work."}
{"original": "he added: there's a reason why politicians and wealthy people build walls around their houses and their compounds. president obama recently built a wall around his compound."}
{"original": "mr. trump also tweeted that obama's wall was 10 feet high. but while fencing has been added around the obamas' spacious house in washington's tony kalorama neighborhood, there is no 10-foot wall."}
{"original": "it's all part of the president's effort to prevail in an increasingly difficult standoff with congressional democrats over border funding that has produced a partial shutdown of the federal government."}
{"original": "but david bier, an immigration policy analyst for the cato institute, a libertarian think tank, said there is little comparison between the demands for private security and border security."}
{"original": "it doesn't make sense to compare the two, said bier, pointing to the difference between a home break-in and migrants trying to seek asylum."}
{"original": "another favorite structure for mr. trump is the fortifications at the vatican, which he has cited in the past as an argument for the wall and brought up again at the cabinet meeting, this time making a moral argument."}
{"original": "when they say the wall is immoral, well then you better — got to do something about the vatican, because the vatican has the biggest wall of them all, mr. trump said."}
{"original": "much of vatican city is off-limits to the general public but walls there do not block all access. st. peter's square is not behind any walls. the vatican museums are walled but the public may enter with a ticket and security screening."}
{"original": "the president's immigration policies have drawn criticism from pope francis, who has said in the past that anyone who wants to build walls to keep out migrants is not christian."}
{"original": "former trump aide sam nunberg said that in some of these examples, trump was trying to argue that his opponents are saying do as i say, not as i do."}
{"original": "trump and allies have repeatedly cited barriers in israel as proof that walls are effective. the president said this week he had recently spoken with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu, adding in israel, as you know, they built a wall. he said 99.9 percent it works. and it would with us too."}
{"original": "bier said a direct comparison with israel's border security is challenging because the u.s. border is much longer and has different terrain, including mountains, raising questions about whether building a physical wall is the best approach."}
{"original": "i think it's fair to say that border barriers make it easier to catch people who are coming into the country, bier said. the question is whether it is as effective in areas where the president wants to build."}
{"original": "with no end to the border fight in sight, mr. trump is likely to keep up his wall commentary — although at times his rhetoric sends mixed messages."}
{"original": "his message thursday: you can call it a wall. you can call it a barrier. you can call it whatever you want."}
{"original": "president donald trump signed another executive order at the white house monday morning, this one aimed at reducing the number of regulations."}
{"original": "the order requires two regulations to be removed for every new regulation added, making good on a promise he made during the campaign."}
{"original": "if you have a regulation you want, number one, we're not gonna approve it because it's already been approved probably in 17 different forms, mr. trump said as he signed the order monday morning. but if we do, the only you have a chance is we have to knock out two regulations for every new regulation."}
{"original": "the text of the order released monday afternoon by the white house states this is being done to reduce the burden the private sector has in complying with federal standards."}
{"original": "in addition to the management of the direct expenditure of taxpayer dollars through the budgeting process, it is essential to manage the costs associated with the governmental imposition of private expenditures required to comply with federal regulations, the order reads. toward that end, it is important that for every one new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations be identified for elimination, and that the cost of planned regulations be prudently managed and controlled through a budgeting process."}
{"original": "the order requires that federal agencies self-identify which regulations to cut based on their estimates of the cost. the white house will then make the ultimate decision on the cuts, which do not apply to the military or national security. according to the text of the order, each agency will be given a total amount of incremental costs for new and existing regulations each fiscal year, which they are unable to exceed without express approval."}
{"original": "mr. trump signed the order surrounded by small business owners, vice president mike pence, chief of staff reince priebus and policy advisor stephen miller. the white house released the full text of the order several hours later."}
{"original": "monday's order is mr. trump's sixth executive order since taking office on jan. 20. during his first 10 days in office, he signed orders pertaining to the affordable care act, the construction of a u.s.-mexico border wall, and a temporary ban on travel to the u.s. from seven muslim-majority countries, which has"}
{"original": "mr. trump spent monday morning meeting with small business leaders, and is expected to spend the rest of the day having lunch with vice president mike pence and meeting with various aides and advisers."}
{"original": "there's a trade war raging between the top two democratic presidential contenders. since super tuesday left two main candidates standing last week, bernie sanders has made it a point at campaign stops to list the areas where he and opponent joe biden disagree. trade has taken center stage this week, as the two men fight for delegates in the industrial midwest."}
{"original": "though neither candidate has released a detailed trade policy, a decisive primary win in michigan on tuesday or next week in ohio could signal how the democratic party will approach trade and the nation's economic agenda."}
{"original": "across one of the nation's most iconic manufacturing states, sanders has been taking swipes at biden's positions on trade. he slammed then-senator biden's support of the 1993 north american free trade agreement (nafta), which eliminated most tariffs between the u.s., mexico and canada, and the 2000 china trade bill, which reinstated permanent and normal trade relations (pntr) with china. sanders voted against both measures as a house member and continues to rail against the policies today, a point highlighted by a sanders ad, decimated, that's up in every march 10th and march 17th primary state."}
{"original": "if we are going to defeat trump in michigan, in pennsylvania, and in wisconsin, it will be very hard for a candidate who voted for these disastrous trade agreements, sanders told a detroit crowd friday."}
{"original": "this playbook may seem familiar to democrats, since sanders waged a similar campaign against hillary clinton in the 2016 democratic primaries in michigan. he skewered her at a democratic debate held in flint, michigan, two days before the primary."}
{"original": "secretary clinton supported virtually every one of the disastrous trade agreements written by corporate america. nafta, supported by the secretary, cost us 800,000 jobs nationwide; tens of thousands of jobs in the midwest. permanent normal trade relations with china cost us millions of jobs, he said at the time."}
{"original": "the argument helped sanders eke out a win over clinton in the great lakes state, in a 1.5-point upset. later, donald trump, too, consistently criticized clinton over nafta and the trans-pacific partnership."}
{"original": "sanders portrays his congressional votes opposing the trade deals as a matter of character."}
{"original": "i worked with the unions as a member of the house of representative to defeat nafta and to defeat pntr with china. i can remember like it was yesterday being on a picket line in montpellier, vermont in opposition to nafta. i knew what it was gonna do. i knew that you cannot ask american workers who are earning living wages to compete against the starvation wages being paid in mexico, sanders said friday in detroit."}
{"original": "the senator hit the same note during campaign stops in michigan over weekend."}
{"original": "he said in flint saturday, i heard, during that period in the '90s, i heard all of corporate america say, 'you gotta vote for these trade agreements.' and all of the media said, 'you gotta vote for these trade agreements.' i stood with the unions, the working families of this country; i voted against those agreements! joe biden voted for those agreements."}
{"original": "the reviews of nafta are somewhat mixed, and a new version of the deal, the u.s.-mexico-canada trade agreement, is expected to be implemented soon, after canada ratifies it. in 2013, the liberal think tank economic policy institute projected that nafta caused, 20 years of stagnant wages and the upward redistribution of income, wealth and political power. at the same time, foreign affairs estimates that 14 millions american jobs still depend on nafta. and a 2016 report from the u.s. international trade commission concluded the policy, had essentially no effect on real wages in the united states of either skilled or unskilled workers."}
{"original": "biden has rarely brought up north american trade policy on the stump since the iowa caucuses, where he would emphasize the impacts of the agricultural trade war with china. instead, he casts himself as an ally to workers and union members, even though its some workers have fallen victim to the shift of u.s. production to cheaper alternatives in mexico, as general motors did in march 2019, eliminating 1,700 hourly jobs in ohio alone."}
{"original": "he stands by his nafta vote, arguing that no, it wasn't a mistake to vote in favor of the deal, he said last may in iowa. he has labeled himself a fair trader, rather than a free trader."}
{"original": "we should treat other countries in a way they treat us, biden said, just deciding it's all about trade deficit balancing...we need to do more."}
{"original": "the most recent ripple in the trade debate has been the usmca agreement, an idea barack obama pitched in the 2008 primary. biden said in principle he supported the agreement due to the increased labor and environmental protections, issues that he told cbs news last summer he believed should have been more thoroughly addressed from the beginning of the nafta negotiation in the '90s."}
{"original": "sanders unapologetically voted against usmca, stating that protections did not go far enough."}
{"original": "on this matter sanders stood alone. his one-time democratic adversaries criticized him for being too purist in his pursuit. elizabeth warren, sanders' fellow progressive in the race, promised to support the usmca and bargain for a better deal if elected."}
{"original": "the distinction was noted by some in the rust belt."}
{"original": "frank hammer, a retired 32-year general motors employee, participated in a panel discussion on trade with sanders friday in detroit."}
{"original": "you were the singular, sole [candidate] that said — consistent with your past positions — that you were opposed to [usmca] and i think that speaks volumes for the stance that you have taken on behalf of working class people and especially auto workers, hammer said. and i'm so grateful. thank you."}
{"original": "on the trail biden has dismissed china's status as an economic powerhouse, pointing out basic challenges chinese leaders face, like providing enough potable water for their people, and boasting about the u.s. dominance in the future. the idea that china is going to eat our lunch, it's bizarre, he said in iowa in late january, suggesting that rather than viewing china as an existential threat, the u.s. could help china with some of its problems. the u.s. can compete with china and insist that they follow the rules, he proposed."}
{"original": "unlike the social security ads the biden campaign is running in michigan, two biden advisers tell cbs news after reviewing their internal polling they decided to not engage sanders on the intra-party trade war."}
{"original": "at this point i'm not sure voters are looking for a vote-by-vote analysis, one biden adviser told cbs news, they're looking for a nominee."}
{"original": "others agree that focusing on trade—even in michigan—may not be as beneficial as sanders hopes."}
{"original": "i think it's a miscalculation from sanders, justin wolfers, professor of economics and public policy at the university of michigan, told cbs news, citing a gallup poll that shows 67% of self-described democrats say that nafta has been beneficial for the united states."}
{"original": "wolfers said that with the election of president trump everything is a little upside down in terms of trade politics because the gop incumbent has made a stronger pitch for protectionist voters than any democratic nominee is likely to make."}
{"original": "relatively speaking, democrats are now the pro-trade party, wolfers added."}
{"original": "biden has a strong argument to make in michigan on manufacturing, though, since he had a leading role in helping to negotiate the obama administration's 2009 auto bailout of two of the big u.s. automakers, general motors and chrysler."}
{"original": "just like the automobile industry came back, detroit is going to come back, biden said in 2014. it's not only an important city but it's an iconic city. it symbolizes the manufacturing might of the united states of america."}
{"original": "according to an invitation obtained by cbs news, biden is expected to attend a high-dollar fundraiser in michigan this week, co-hosted by cynthia and edsel ford, the great-grandson of henry ford."}

{"original": "president trump will not resign. nor will he turn power over to vice president pence and ask him for a pardon, according to top white house advisers who have spoken with the highest ranking members of mr. trump's cabinet, including treasury secretary mnuchin, pence and chief of staff mark meadows."}
{"original": "the president continues to ask senior advisers about his ability to pardon himself before he leaves office. it's a power that is untested and by no means settled. a justice department office of legal counsel memo from 1976 says that the president cannot pardon himself or herself, so it would be a gamble. the president worries about his legal exposure post-presidency, but not necessarily related to the assault on the capitol."}
{"original": "gop sources close to the white house and congressional leadership say the threat of a second impeachment is real and could find some support among house republicans, who are facing pressure from lobbying firms and corporations that help fund their campaigns. they have made it clear they will cut ties with republicans who back mr. trump in any impeachment vote."}
{"original": "but on the other side is the trump-inspired gop base that threatens to launch primary challenges against house republicans who vote for impeachment."}
{"original": "republicans wish house speaker nancy pelosi wouldn't force the question, but the speaker, protecting the institution of congress and maximizing political advantage, will force republicans to choose. privately, top republican sources concede if the mob that attacked the capitol had been egged on by a democratic president, a gop house speaker would do the same thing."}
{"original": "mr. trump continues to believe any impeachment talk is strictly partisan; top outside advisers keep telling him it not partisan, but institutional. congress was under attack this week, and some republicans feel it's necessary to push back with impeachment vote — for now and for history."}
{"original": "the idea of invoking the 25th amendment remains remote and is mostly intended to keep the president in line in the remaining few days of his presidency. but top cabinet officials still holding positions, chief among them mnuchin and pompeo, have not refuted the suggestion internally or externally in order to send a signal to mr. trump that it's an action they'd be willing to take if he cannot control himself."}
{"original": "top advisers to the white house now know mr. trump was generally and initially pleased with the protest at the capitol, seeing it as a reflection of his supporters' love for him, and not as an assault on the legislative branch and the foundations of a democratic republic. this misunderstanding has fed cabinet and white house resignations and denunciations."}
{"original": "there is likely not enough time to impeach and remove mr. trump from office. bringing the senate back would require unanimous consent of all senators, since it is in recess until january 19, based on another unanimous consent agreement."}
{"original": "however, the sense from many gop sources is that senate majority leader mitch mcconnell would be equivocal about how he'd address an article of impeachment — for the sole purpose of warning mr. trump that the power to remove him from office is no longer in the president's control."}
{"original": "on friday it became clear to president trump and those within the trump organization — donald trump jr., and eric and ivanka trump — that substantial reputational damage had been done to the trump brand. this week, the online-store platform shopify removed all of mr. trump's campaign merchandise from its platform, saying those web pages violated the canadian company's policy against sellers promoting violence."}
{"original": "the closure by some firms of trump-branded online stores forced a rapid search for other online venues and brought about an awareness that mr. trump's post presidency may be damaged by the events of this week."}
{"original": "members of the trump family actively looked for other online safe harbor. the sense among those close to the trump family was that the president had begun to realize that in a post-white house world, the viability of the trump brand was now vulnerable. those close to the family and still somewhat sympathetic to the president consider the protection of the brand possibly the best pressure point available to ensure mr. trump leaves the white house and government comparatively quietly and allows a peaceful — if not personally endorsed — transition to take place."}

{"original": "republican rep. john barker, who chairs the committee, has called the old regulations some of the loosest in the country. he led a charge to change the law after republican rep. scott schwab's son, caleb, was killed last year on a water slide in kansas city."}
{"original": "barker said the department of labor asked for some minor changes and to delay the new law's implementation. he said some local carnival operators were concerned they wouldn't be ready to comply by july 1 and wouldn't be able to run their rides."}
{"original": "the department of labor regulates amusement parks and will have to develop rules, regulations and permit processes in accord with the new law."}
{"original": "deputy general counsel j.l. mcfarland also said in a statement that the department asked lawmakers to delay implementation over concerns that some parks wouldn't be able to come into compliance in time."}
{"original": "we look forward to developing the necessary permitting and registrations systems so that kansans are afforded the safety protections of the original bill, mcfarland said in the statement."}
{"original": "brownback said he had heard that people were hoping to adjust the law and its impact on rural, county-fair groups."}
{"original": "lawmakers nearly unanimously supported the stricter inspection requirements for amusement parks when the bill passed both chambers last month."}
{"original": "the new law requires that rides be inspected by a qualified inspector who is either an inspector certified by one of several national boards; a certified engineer with two years of experience in the amusement park field, at least one of those in inspections; or someone with five years of experience in the amusement park field, two of those in inspections. the new law also requires parks to report injuries."}
{"original": "kansas' previous law allowed parks to do their own inspections. that policy came under scrutiny after caleb, who was 10, died last year on schlitterbahn water park's verruckt water slide, a 17-story tower that was dubbed the world's tallest."}
{"original": "schwab declined to comment on the implementation delay. he stayed quiet on the bill until he gave an emotional endorsement on the house floor last month."}
{"original": "the schwab family has settled for nearly $20 million with the park's owners, the manufacturer of the raft that carried riders down the slide, a general contractor and a company that consulted on the slide."}
{"original": "the verruckt water slide remains closed and will be torn down at the completion of an ongoing investigation by the kansas attorney general's office."}
{"original": "when it initially opened, the park advertised the ride for only people 14 years and older but was later removed from its website. the combined weight of the passengers in the raft must fall between 400 and 550 pounds."}
{"original": "two other women, unrelated to schwab, were in the raft when the boy died. they suffered injuries to their faces, according to authorities."}
{"original": "the apparent shift away from the age restriction could be one of the questions in determining liability, according to cbs news legal analyst rikki klieman, who said the park owner and ride designer face potential legal troubles over schwab's death."}
{"original": "there's also anecdotal evidence of problems with the ride's safety equipment. parkgoer paul oberhauser told cbs news his belt came off while riding with a friend and his 9-year-old son."}
{"original": "as soon as i hit the bottom of the first curve the shoulder strap just kind of busted loose, oberhauser said."}
{"original": "he said he had to grip handles by his legs to hold on and told park staff what happened."}

{"original": "t-mobile engineers arrived in dallas wednesday morning, vowing to stay until the problem is fixed. rawlings, however, was unable to explain why the sense of urgency didn't come sooner."}
{"original": "i don't know, he said. i'm very disappointed with that. it should have been taken care of, in my mind, some weeks ago, definitely last week."}
{"original": "dallas resident david taffet confronted mayor rawlings on wednesday to say it took 20 minutes to get through to 911 after his husband stopped breathing last week."}
{"original": "at one point, taffet was disconnected. he was placed on hold when he called back. paramedics promptly arrived after he finally got through but his husband later died at a hospital."}
{"original": "ghost calls happen when a person on a t-mobile cell phone makes a single call to dallas 911, but that call somehow gets caught in a loop. this means the emergency call center begins receiving hand-up calls from that same number and the loop can continue to happen over and over."}
{"original": "emergency policy dictates that 911 operators respond to every hang up call. in the case of ghost calls, this wastes the time of operators while leaving other callers on hold."}
{"original": "dallas city manager t.c. broadnax said the ghost calls began in october."}
{"original": "in november, the city notified t-mobile of the large number of calls it was receiving. in january, both dallas city leaders and the wireless carrier say they believed the problem was fixed, only to see it re-appear in the last few weeks in even larger numbers."}

{"original": "a state report released in 2014 by the commission on state emergency communications notes 911 service will erode as new digital technology is introduced. the report says that's because existing 911 systems in texas and other states are based on wireline technologies established decades ago."}

{"original": "the fbi is also seeking the public's help identifying those who stormed the building wednesday after mr. trump gave a speech nearby. the agency has received over 4,000 tips on its website."}
{"original": "the justice department has said a policy introduced last year to press sedition charges against those who damage federal buildings may be invoked in some cases stemming from wednesday's chaos."}
{"original": "the metropolitan police department arrested 68 people wednesday and early thursday morning, primarily for violating a curfew imposed by the city's mayor. all but one of those arrested lives outside washington. the u.s. capitol police also arrested 14 people during the rioting."}
{"original": "michael sherwin, the acting u.s. attorney for d.c., told reporters his office has charged 40 people in d.c. superior court, mostly including crimes related to unlawful entry of the u.s. capitol grounds, along with a handful of assault cases and eight firearms cases. sherwin said the 40 cases included crimes over the past 36 hours, with some occurring prior to the capitol breach."}
{"original": "sherwin's office presented an additional 15 federal criminal cases thursday afternoon to a federal magistrate judge directly in relation to the attack at the capitol. the office was expecting to release criminal affidavits with more detailed information later thursday night."}
{"original": "the federal charges included unauthorized entry into the capitol, theft of materials from inside the complex and several weapons charges. sherwin said one man had a military-style semi-automatic rifle and 11 molotov cocktails ready to go."}
{"original": "this was obviously a very dangerous situation, and we are aggressively trying to address these cases as soon as possible, sherwin said."}
{"original": "sherwin said all options were on the table when it comes to considering more serious riot or sedition-related charges for those arrested and anyone else who may have been involved with planning the attack. when asked whether he would be examining the role of trump's comments to his supporters prior to the assault, sherwin repeated: we're looking at all actors here and anyone that had a role, and if the evidence fits the elements of a crime, they're going to be charged."}
{"original": "he said federal investigators were scouring social media and video footage in order to identify more suspects. he said he believes the 15 federal cases are just the beginning."}

{"original": "cia director gina haspel has named cynthia didi rapp to the agency's senior-most position atop the directorate of analysis. rapp, a career intelligence official with an analytic background, is not the first woman to hold the role, but she is the third female official and the fifth career intelligence official haspel has named to a leadership post at the agency in recent months."}
{"original": "didi rapp brings broad, deep expertise from across the agency and the intelligence community to her new role as the head of our directorate of analysis, said cia director of public affairs brittany bramell. with her engaging leadership style and reputation for objectivity, didi will excel in leading our talented analytic cadre."}
{"original": "rapp previously served as deputy chief operating officer at cia and headed up intelligence integration at the office of the director of national intelligence, where she helped oversee the production of the president's daily brief (pdb). the third woman to hold the post since 2002, rapp succeeds longtime incumbent richard hoch, who will serve as chief strategy officer for the agency."}
{"original": "as head of the directorate of analysis – which was once known as the directorate of intelligence – rapp will oversee the agency's efforts to synthesize intelligence from the cia's operations arm and other elements of the intelligence community, including open source data and satellite imagery. agency analysts take raw intelligence from abroad, offer regional expertise and put it into context. they interact directly with policymakers throughout government and play a lead role in informing the pdb."}
{"original": "the deputy director for analysis is one of the most important positions at cia, said michael morell, a former cia deputy and acting director who also served as the agency's head of analysis from 2008 to 2010. didi has extensive experience as an analyst, she has deep integrity, and she has the confidence of the director — all things necessary for someone to effectively lead the da. morell is also a cbs news senior national security contributor."}
{"original": "rapp will be the first to newly assume the role since former cia director john brennan's modernization push, which shifted some oversight away from larger directorates and funneled them into discrete mission centers focused on some of the thorniest issue areas in national security. under that structure, analysts and operations officers work side by side."}
{"original": "analytic issues facing the agency range from the threat posed by near-peer competitors like russia and china, to persistent proliferation concerns from north korea and iran, to the national security implications of climate change, to incorporating big data and other analytic inputs into its assessments, said david priess, a former analyst and daily intelligence briefer during the clinton and george w. bush administrations. the new dda will have to see how well analysis is being incorporated into ops, and vice versa."}
{"original": "rapp's appointment, announced internally last month, underscores haspel's apparent commitment to guiding the agency down a trajectory rooted in stability and deep institutional knowledge. a former clandestine operations officer who in may became the first female director of the cia, haspel has surrounded herself by officials with whom she has worked for decades. seldom in history have the agency's most senior ranks been filled with as many cia veterans and insiders."}
{"original": "thirty-four-year agency veteran beth kimber became the first woman to lead the agency's directorate of operations earlier in december. sonya holt, who likewise spent over three decades at cia, assumed the role of chief diversity and inclusion officer in august, when similarly long-serving cia officials vaughn bishop, now deputy director, and andy makridis, now chief operating officer (coo), were also named."}
{"original": "you've got a director, deputy director and coo who are all career intelligence officers, and two-thirds of whom are analysts – you'd have to go back decades for that to be true, priess said. this is also leadership at cia at a time of unprecedented institutional tension with the president – it's meaningful that it's not being run by the president's own people, but by career officers. this could have gone in a very different direction."}
{"original": "haspel's immediate predecessor, mike pompeo, who is now secretary of state, named haspel as his deputy, but brought in his longtime business partner, brian bulatao, to serve as coo. brennan chose associates from within the treasury department and national security council to be his deputies."}
{"original": "though some former intelligence officials have raised concerns about excessive insularity and the risks of creating an echo chamber at the agency, others praised the relative conservatism of haspel's choices at a time when the churn of personnel at a number of other government institutions have plunged them into turmoil."}
{"original": "the leadership positions that she has filled give tremendous credibility to the idea that she is trying to keep the agency down a professional, honest path, said ned price, a former cia analyst who resigned in protest and with some controversy at the start of the trump administration. they help ensure the agency remains a bastion of unvarnished analysis and operational proposals that are in our best interest."}
{"original": "now is not the time to radically remake the agency, price, who is now a fellow at the new america foundation, said. there's enough going on outside its walls."}
{"original": "although the cia and haspel herself have been occasionally thrust into fundamentally political controversies – including those surrounding president trump's decision to revoke brennan's security clearance last august; the ongoing, highly-charged fallout from the murder of journalist jamal khashoggi; and, especially during her confirmation hearings, haspel's own involvement in the cia's post-9/11 enhanced interrogation and rendition programs – she has consistently avoided public exposure. in doing so she has arguably bucked a trend set in motion by her more press-friendly predecessors."}
{"original": "pompeo, during his year-long tenure as cia director, made both public appearances and unusually personal statements with some regularity. he sent a letter to the harvard kennedy school announcing his withdrawal from a speaking engagement and denouncing the school's decision to name chelsea manning, a former soldier convicted of leaking classified documents to wikileaks, a visiting fellow."}
{"original": "pompeo also personally wrote and sent a condescending missive to benjamin wittes, the editor-in-chief of lawfare, after wittes publicly questioned the contents of a holiday card pompeo distributed to cia's workforce."}
{"original": "for her part, in the nearly eight months since she became director, haspel has issued only a handful of brief statements and made public remarks essentially once – at her alma mater, the university of louisville, in september."}
{"original": "i think director haspel's decision to largely stay in the shadows is the right one, morell said. in this political environment, where most public statements are labeled as pro-trump or anti-trump, it is wise to stay silent, particularly when running an agency whose credibility depends as being seen as an independent voice at the policy table."}
{"original": "former senior cia official carmen medina, who spent over three decades at the agency and served as deputy director of intelligence, agreed."}
{"original": "with this administration maybe the best thing she can do is make sure all the 'i's are dotted and 't's are crossed – it's a difficult time, medina said. you need a really firm foundation and to make sure everything is being done well before you have the space to innovate."}
{"original": "medina also applauded haspel's decision to name both more experienced analysts and more women to senior leadership roles. overall, about half of the agency's analysts are women, as are about half of the directorate's senior managers, according to those familiar with the agency's make-up."}
{"original": "it's unfortunate we still have to talk about gender, because it's not really relevant to the quality of the work – it's relevant to the diversity of the work. but i think she's very brave for appointing so many women, medina said of haspel's leadership choices."}
{"original": "she doesn't have to do that, and the fact that she is doing it is kind of awesome."}
{"original": "michael ellis, the recently installed general counsel at the national security agency, was placed on administrative leave wednesday because his appointment is now the subject of an investigation by the defense department inspector general, according to two sources familiar with the matter. there is also a separate allegation that he mishandled classified information."}
{"original": "last week, acting secretary of defense chris miller directed that the position be filled by ellis, a last-minute move that quickly sparked criticism from democrats."}
{"original": "i think it's very clear this is part of the administration's effort to embed people in the civil service who are political and partisan actors who don't belong there, said representative adam schiff, chair of the house intelligence committee, on face the nation on sunday."}
{"original": "house speaker nancy pelosi on sunday denounced the hire in a letter to christopher miller, the acting defense secretary under former president trump. pelosi cited reports that ellis was involved in an effort to launder intelligence information and also shield information about mr. trump's call with the president of ukraine that ultimately led to his impeachment."}
{"original": "the efforts to install him or 'burrow' him into a highly sensitive intelligence position 72 hours prior to the beginning of a new administration manifest a disturbing disregard for our national security, pelosi wrote."}
{"original": "ellis declined to comment. a spokesperson for the nsa said, it's not our policy to comment on personnel issues."}

{"original": "support for clean energy in the u.s. has risen to record highs in recent surveys, but adoption of those clean energy sources is lagging far behind."}
{"original": "while a record number of coal-fired power plants were retired last year, their energy production was mostly replaced by natural gas instead of renewable energy like wind or solar, according to a report by independent research provider rhodium group. the report estimates that in 2018 the u.s. posted the largest increase in heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions since 2010, up 3.4 percent."}
{"original": "before 2018, the u.s. had three straight years of emissions declines despite economic growth. but last year the economy grew faster, illustrating the difficulty of kicking our addiction to fossil fuels when our economic engine revs up. rhodium group explains, some of this was due to unusually cold weather at the start of the year. but it also highlights the limited progress made in developing decarbonization strategies."}
{"original": "many americans support making that transition. a march 2018 study, politics and global warming, by researchers at yale and george mason universities, finds majority support across party lines for developing cleaner energy."}
{"original": "in that survey, 87 percent of registered voters (94 percent of democrats and 79 percent of republicans) favor funding more research into renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power."}
{"original": "these views are echoed in a recent pew research center study which found large majorities of americans favor expanding at least two types of renewable sources to provide energy: solar panel (89%) and wind turbine (85%) facilities."}
{"original": "at a time when political polarization divides americans on so many issues, these points of agreement may seem surprising. but agreement is not enough. for an energy transition to happen, policy and incentives are needed."}
{"original": "for people, corporations, and governments to take action they're going to have to have incentives, william nordhaus, winner of the nobel prize in economics for his work on putting a price on carbon, wrote in a recent yale alumni magazine article."}
{"original": "incentives require specific government policy action. we can find clues to why this is tough to come by deeper in the pew study. while democrats are generally supportive of policies to combat climate change, most republicans are skeptical. nearly three-quarters of republicans or republican-leaning voters say these policies either make no difference or do more harm than good, and 57 percent think such policies harm the economy."}
{"original": "but there are signs of growing support for market-driven solutions among younger conservatives. according to the pew study, republican millennials are less inclined than their elders in the gop to support increased use of fossil fuel energy sources through such methods as offshore drilling, hydraulic fracturing and coal mining. for example, 75% of republicans in the baby boomer and older generations support the increased use of offshore drilling, compared with 44% of millennial republicans."}
{"original": "former congressman ryan costello (r-pennsylvania) just left the u.s. house of representatives and is now the new managing director of americans for carbon dividends, an advocacy affiliate of the climate leadership council. in a wall street journal op-ed this week he laid out the case for a republican plan to tackle climate change, citing, in part, the need to keep younger republicans on board."}
{"original": "in his new work, costello is aiming to advance a plan by former gop secretaries of state james baker and george shultz, fine-tuning the details of a bill which would put a fee on carbon dioxide emissions and return the proceeds to individuals and families on a quarterly basis."}
{"original": "the plan claims, over two-thirds of american households would be financial winners under a carbon dividends program, including the most vulnerable. the aim is to increase the cost and disincentivize use of products that generate carbon pollution, encouraging industries and consumers to opt for greener alternatives instead."}
{"original": "even though the group says its carbon fee plan would return money to americans' pockets, it may still be seen as a tax. in reply, costello says, i learned in congress that no major policy solution comes without simplified rebuttals, which often aren't accurate. if families are receiving a check every three months and carbon emitters are transitioning to the cleaner energy, everyone comes out ahead."}
{"original": "ed maibach is a professor at george mason university's center for climate change communication and co-author of the politics and global warming study. commenting in general on policy, not specifically on the climate leadership council plan, he says his public opinion research finds strong support for a range of climate solutions policies, even when we mention the costs explicitly. sometimes, policy support actually increases when we mention the estimated cost per household, for example, about 50 cents per day, probably because the projected costs strike people as a good deal."}

{"original": "as the coronavirus pandemic spreads across the u.s., president donald trump last friday said he had a plan to help the 43 million americans with federal student loans to repay: a waiver on their interest payments. but experts say the plan may not offer much immediate relief because monthly payments could remain unchanged."}
{"original": "our understanding is that this will mean monthly payments won't go down meaningfully (if at all) for borrowers, but payments will go entirely toward paying down the principal of the loan, michele streeter, a policy analyst for the institute for college access & success, a think tank for higher education, said in an email."}
{"original": "there's much that is unknown about the president's call for an interest waiver on student loans, such as when the waiver will end or if a loan's mix of principal and interest owed will be recalculated (or re-amortized) at the end of the waiver period. but the bottom line is that the interest waiver is unlikely to provide immediate relief to graduates if they lose their jobs or their income is reduced as the coronavirus tramples the u.s. economy. instead, bigger measures are needed, such as a pause payment on all federal student loans for at least six months, streeter said."}
{"original": "to be sure, the interest waiver will help some college grads, but it's most likely to benefit those who continue to hold their jobs and can continue to manage their monthly payments through an economic downturn. borrowers will also pay down their loans faster by putting more toward principal."}
{"original": "but it doesn't help low-income workers who are already struggling to pay back their loans, noted charlie javice, the founder and ceo of frank, a company that helps students fill out the free application for federal student aid."}
{"original": "this helps upper and middle-income families, she said. it will be the higher segment that says, 'this is the best opportunity ever because i don't have interest to pay.' a lot of mba students and med school students should be helped."}
{"original": "the department of education said it's still working out the details of the plan, and didn't provide information about how the waiver would or wouldn't change monthly payments. the interest rate on all federally held student loans will be set to zero, a spokesman added. it won't include commercial loans or loans held by other parties, he added."}

{"original": "the waiver is effective immediately, according to the education department, which said it plans to release more details as soon as it is able to do so."}
{"original": "even if it doesn't lower monthly payments, the interest waiver will impact many of the roughly 43 million borrowers who owe the federal government about $1.4 trillion. student loan debt in the u.s. now stands at more than $1.6 trillion, with the remainder held by private lenders. state loans and loans from lenders such as sallie mae won't be covered by the waiver, according to the new york times."}
{"original": "borrowers who can't pay because of financial hardship may need to go into forbearance. the good news: the interest that normally accrues during forbearance will be waived, which means the borrower's balance won't grow as they put their loan repayment on pause."}

{"original": "it's no secret that millions of americans are approaching their retirement years with meager savings and high anxiety about their financil security. and a recent study from merrill lynch and age wave reveals steps that americans are willing to take to get their retirement back on track."}
{"original": "the overwhelming majority (88 percent) of people surveyed said their primary objective is peace of mind, while just 12 percent say they want to accumulate as much wealth as possible. but peace of mind means different things to different people:"}
{"original": "57 percent report they want to live comfortably within their means."}
{"original": "39 percent say they want to have the financial resources to live the life they choose."}
{"original": "34 percent want to feel they could handle a major unexpected expense."}
{"original": "28 percent don't want to feel overwhelmed by debt."}
{"original": "25 percent want to feel confident they won't outlive their money."}
{"original": "17 percent want to provide for their family if something happens to them."}
{"original": "actually, this is a good planning list -- it would be best to address all of these goals."}
{"original": "one challenge is that talking about your finances is generally taboo in america: only 8 percent of survey respondents feel personal finances can be discussed openly, while the remainder consider the topic a private matter or one that can be discussed with a spouse or partner or only very close family and friends. in fact, many people would rather talk about their preferences for end of life than their financial status."}
{"original": "it would certainly help if older workers and retirees would share their ideas and insights with their family and friends. after all, they're all in the same financial boat."}
{"original": "what changes are people willing to make to enhance their financial security in retirement? here are 11 steps the survey found americans are willing to take:"}
{"original": "90 percent would be willing to cut back on their expenses. perhaps they can focus on spending just enough to meet their basic living needs and what truly makes them happy."}
{"original": "79 percent would seek financial advice. in this case, they'll want to make sure their advisers are qualified and act in their best interests."}
{"original": "77 percent would increase the use of tax-protected retirement accounts."}
{"original": "75 percent would seek expert advice on how to pay lower taxes. note that this may not be a good use of time for americans with meager savings, since they could already be in a very low tax bracket when they retire."}
{"original": "70 percent would buy a financial product that provides guaranteed income for life. these people would be wise to seek low-cost income annuities that maximize their lifetime income."}
{"original": "66 percent would sell real estate or other personal belongings. finding the best way to deploy home equity is a good use of time for older workers and retirees who own a home but have modest retirement savings."}
{"original": "64 percent would postpone taking social security. this is a smart move for virtually all retirees."}
{"original": "60 percent would take social security as early as they could. this strategy works only if you're sufficiently disciplined to save your social security benefits, don't spend them, and are skilled or lucky enough to out-earn the stock market. oh, it also helps if you die fairly quickly after you retire. if you live to average life expectancies or longer, you'll receive more income over your lifetime by delaying the start of your benefits, and that doesn't even count the extra benefits to a surviving spouse that results from delaying the start of your benefits."}
{"original": "43 percent would withdraw the cash value from a life insurance policy. such people would want to explore their options: many policies allow the holder to convert the policy's cash value into a lifetime annuity."}
{"original": "39 percent would ask social services or charities for support."}
{"original": "in addition to taking these steps, older workers would be wise to develop a strategy for generating lifetime retirement income, explore their options for continuing to work and make sure they have adequate medical insurance that supplements medicare."}
{"original": "as you can see, your financial security in retirement has many moving parts. it's well worth spending hours and days planning for peace of mind in your retirement years, so you can go enjoy the rest of your life."}
{"original": "on wall street, when it's the federal reserve vs. apple, looks like the fed holds sway. despite the positive vibes from apple's (aapl) strong earnings report earlier in the week, stocks slid on wednesday after the fed's latest policy announcement."}
{"original": "as expected, the central bank left its benchmark interest rated unchanged in a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent -- but it added language acknowledging the recent rise in inflation, which lays the groundwork for another rate hike (this year's second) in june. the fed's preferred core inflation measure, known as pce, which filters out volatile food and fuel prices, was within spitting distance of the fed's 2 percent target in march."}
{"original": "the fed added that it would treat its inflation target as symmetrical, in that the monetary policymakers would allow an overshoot for a time, winking at a status quo pace of rate hikes despite growing inflationary pressure. however, the market interpreted the statement as carrying a hawkish bias. that pushed the dollar higher and stocks lower."}
{"original": "currently, the futures market assigns 45 percent odds of three more quarter-point rate hikes before the end of the year, and that's something that hasn't been fully priced into stocks and bonds. compare that to 30 percent odds of this happening just one month ago."}
{"original": "this aligns with the expectations of the team at capital economics, who note that the fed was always unlikely to signal a major shift at its may meeting, but that it doesn't change their forecast for a total of four rate hikes in 2018."}
{"original": "another reason for the market's wariness was the fed's acknowledgment of some recent softening of the economic data -- with consumer spending slowing notably in the first quarter -- but it remained steadfast in its outlook for gradual interest rate increases."}
{"original": "no doubt this is because over the near term, inflation is accelerating to the upside: on a three-month annualized basis, core pce inflation is rising at a 2.6 percent rate. that's near a decade high as prices at the producer level are surging, increasing the chances inflation continues to heat up into the summer months."}
{"original": "another factor is the ongoing tightening in the job market, as employment costs rose in the first quarter at the fastest pace in 10 years. we'll learn more on friday when the federal government's april jobs report is released. analysts are looking for a payroll gain of 190,000 with a slight reduction in the unemployment rate to 4 percent. however, wall street is likely to give the closest scrutiny to the figures on wage gains."}

{"original": "with many u.s. cities in varying stages of shutdown for parts of 2020, travel was reduced — and so were greenhouse gas emissions. according to a report by the rhodium group, an economics and policy research provider, the drop in annual emissions was the nation's largest since the world war ii era."}
{"original": "the group tracked the real-time energy and emissions impact of the covid-19 pandemic throughout 2020. it estimates that the historic shock to economic activity led to a 10.3% drop in u.s. greenhouse gas emissions in 2020. this finding is based on preliminary economic and energy data."}
{"original": "the reduction means the u.s. is now expected to exceed the target set in a 2009 u.n. agreement known as the copenhagen accord of cutting emissions 17% below 2005 levels, with 2020 instead hitting 21.5% below 2005 levels."}
{"original": "however, it still falls short of the goal the u.s. set in the 2015 paris agreement of a 26% to 28% drop below 2005 emissions levels. while president trump pulled the u.s. out of the paris agreement in 2019, president-elect joe biden has vowed to rejoin it. still, even with 2020's reduced emissions levels, the u.s. does not appear to be on track to meet the agreement's 2025 goal as economic activity picks back up, according to rhodium group."}
{"original": "the report also notes that the decline in emissions came with an enormous toll of significant economic damage and human suffering."}
{"original": "we expect economic activity to pick up again in 2021, but without meaningful structural changes in the carbon intensity of the us economy, emissions will likely rise again as well, the report says."}
{"original": "rhodium group reported that three of the leading sectors for greenhouse gas emissions — transportation, electric power, and industry — were also among the sectors hardest-hit by pandemic-related shutdowns. for example, with travel far less in demand during the pandemic, emissions from the transportation sector declined 14.7% between 2019 and 2020."}
{"original": "while the emissions decline was welcomed, the trend is not expected to last. unfortunately, 2020 tells us little about what we can expect to see in 2021 and beyond, the report says."}
{"original": "if the pandemic and economic recession had never happened, the report estimates u.s. emissions would have dropped only about 3%, driven mainly by the decline of coal-fired power plants as well as lower heating demand due to a warmer winter."}
{"original": "emissions also shrunk globally during 2020, with the world expected to see the largest yearly global decline ever — as much as 17%, according to an estimate by the world meteorological organization (wmo)."}

{"original": "but the fbi and a private firm she hired to help with the negotiations warned her that the captors might keep upping the price. they told her she needed to demand proof that warren was alive and carefully orchestrate the ransom exchange. her negotiations with the captors dragged on for months, and they eventually agreed to accept $243,000 for his release. yet when she gave them the money, they didn't return him."}
{"original": "the u.s. government has a policy of not negotiating with terrorists, which has left many families of hostages feeling abandoned. elaine met with top u.s. officials including secretary of state john kerry and deputy national security advisor lisa monaco. she says she told monaco about another concern: the fbi suspected warren was being held in north waziristan, a prime target for u.s. drone strikes, and she worried he could be killed."}
{"original": "the following year, those fears were realized. warren and an italian aid worker were accidentally killed in a u.s. drone strike targeting terrorists in january 2015. it was like, 'i told you so,' elaine tells stahl. i was worried about it from the first day."}

{"original": "conspiracy theories are very dangerous ... because they exacerbate splits that already exist, said andre perry, who studies race and urban policy for the brookings institution. this isn't about one city council member. this is about how susceptible we are to tribalism that is created by a lack of trust in one another."}
{"original": "a year after it emerged, covid-19 has now claimed more than 2 million lives worldwide. experts have said for much of the last year that the only way to escape the coronavirus' grasp is through widespread vaccination. weapons to win that war have been and continue to be approved by individual countries' drug regulators in record time."}
{"original": "but the pace — and a host of other unique factors — have left many around the globe with concerns about the vaccines' safety and efficacy."}
{"original": "national regulatory bodies insist corners haven't been cut. they've reviewed and accepted data provided by pharmaceutical companies showing the major vaccines already approved, and those expecting a greenlight within weeks, are between 70% and 95% effective at preventing symptomatic covid-19 infection."}
{"original": "more importantly, none of the trials carried out on the three vaccines to emerge first, by pfizer/biontech, moderna and oxford/astrazeneca, have shown any significant side effects."}
{"original": "millions of people have now had doses of all three of those vaccines, and apart from a small number of severe allergic reactions – mostly among those with a history of severe allergies – and the minor, short-term aches and pains associated with many long-established vaccines, the new drugs appear to be well tolerated."}
{"original": "a survey published by the pew research center in early december showed an increase in overall american confidence in the vaccines, with 60% saying they would get vaccinated."}
{"original": "there are divergent views among experts on the best near-term goals for vaccination programs, including the emphasis that should be put on achieving herd immunity, versus simply giving health care systems room to breathe."}
{"original": "but most experts agree with dr. anthony fauci, who told cbs news in november that the bottom line is simple: we need to get as many people as possible vaccinated."}
{"original": "below is a snapshot of sentiments on vaccination in nine countries from cbs news journalists:"}
{"original": "u.k.: the roll of race and income"}
{"original": "by haley ott - a december poll by the royal society for public health showed that overall, 76% of adults in the u.k. would get a coronavirus vaccine if their doctor recommended it, but that willingness varied significantly based on a person's socio-economic status and ethnicity."}
{"original": "the vast majority of people in office jobs, 84%, said they would get a vaccine, but only 70% of people in unskilled/semi-skilled manual occupations or who were unemployed said they would."}
{"original": "79% of white people said they would get a vaccine, compared to 57% of black, asian and other non-white people, according to the survey. this is reflects opinions in the u.s., too."}
{"original": "misinformation about the vaccine online was thought to be fueling some of the mistrust in the south asian community and among certain religious groups, bbc news has reported. messages falsely claiming the vaccines contain alcohol or animal products could deter muslims and hindus from wanting a shot."}
{"original": "mosques across the u.k. have joined a campaign organized by the mosques and imams national advisory board to counter the false narratives, saying they'd use their friday sermons in january to urge people to get vaccinated."}
{"original": "more than 3 million people have had a first dose of either the oxford or pfizer vaccines in the u.k."}
{"original": "by elaine cobbe - the number of french people who say they're happy to be vaccinated has been on the rise. at the end of december, a poll found that just 40% were willing to have a covid-19 vaccine. that reflected a drop from polling in november and over the summer."}
{"original": "but as the vaccine program in france actually got underway — slowly and fraught with bureaucratic problems — surveys showed growing confidence. a poll on january 7 found that 56% of french adults were in favor of getting vaccinated: 26% said they would definitely get the vaccine when it was their turn and 30% said they would probably get it."}
{"original": "the young appear to be the most reluctant, with more than half of those aged 25-35 consistently saying they don't want a vaccine."}
{"original": "more worrisome for health authorities is the number of health care workers voicing reluctance to being vaccinated has also been high. a poll conducted in the first week of december among nursing home workers found that just 19% were keen to be vaccinated, while 76% said they did not want a vaccine."}
{"original": "for many, however, it's looked more like a wait and see approach than a blanket no. in the december poll, 86% of those against the vaccines said they were worried about potential side effects, especially of the vaccines like pfizer's and moderna's which have been developed using new technology."}
{"original": "seeing the first wave of vaccinations — of nursing home residents and medical staff — go off without any serious side effects may have contributed to the rise in confidence in january."}
{"original": "by anna noryskiewicz - many german health care workers have also been skeptical of the coronavirus vaccines, but one doctor tells cbs news that's likely to change."}
{"original": "a nationwide survey of medical staff, including many intensive care workers, carried out in early december found that 73% of physicians said they wanted to be vaccinated, but among nursing staff, the figure was only around 50%."}
{"original": "dr. petra creutz, a pulmonologist in berlin, told cbs news she believed it was more a matter of uncertainty than rejection."}

{"original": "russia: trust in putin, trust in sputnik"}
{"original": "by alexandra odynova - the majority of russians, 58%, are not ready to get the country's first domestically-made coronavirus vaccine — the only one available in russia to date — according to the most recent independent survey. despite the government's insistence that it's safe, many in the country remain wary of the sputnik v vaccine, which was certified for use in august before phase-3 human trials even began."}
{"original": "despite the lack of final data, the government lab that developed sputnik v says it's 95% effective and causes no major side effects."}
{"original": "the independent lavada center's poll, published just after christmas, found that most of those willing to get the vaccine were supporters of president vladimir putin. one of putin's daughters was said to have received the sputnik v vaccine before it was even approved, but the 68-year-old president hasn't received a shot yet himself."}
{"original": "the overwhelming majority of the president's opponents are not ready to get vaccinated, noted the lavada center."}
{"original": "only 38% of the overall respondents to the survey said they were willing to get the shot. about 30% said they wanted to wait at least until trials on the vaccine were completed. only 10% said they opposed vaccines in general, while 12% of the respondents said they saw no reason to get vaccinated against covid-19."}
{"original": "last month, kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov dismissed suggestions of a link between putin not getting vaccinated and the low public confidence in sputnik v."}

{"original": "japan: history of rumors and mistrust"}
{"original": "by lucy craft - compared to the rush elsewhere to get shots into arms, japan's tortoise-like approach to vaccination might seem incomprehensible. japan's first round of vaccinations, using the pfizer vaccine, is still more than a month away."}
{"original": "public health officials here are under unusual pressure to reassure the public that covid-19 vaccines are safe. japan, according to a recent study in the lancet medical journal, is among the world's most vaccine-wary nations in general, and consequently has some of the highest rates of vaccine-preventable disease in the world."}
{"original": "there was a marked swerve toward vaccine hesitancy in the early 1990s, when reports linked the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (mmr) — without any definitive data — to cases of aseptic meningitis."}
{"original": "history repeated itself in 2013, when anecdotal reports claimed the hpv vaccine was causing serious side effects, including one young woman who said she was left in a wheelchair by it. researchers in japan and europe confirmed the vaccine's safety, but the damage was done."}
{"original": "hpv vaccination rates dropped from 70% to less than 1%. that drop is now blamed for 5,700 needless cervical cancer deaths."}
{"original": "sensationalized coverage of purported side effects, and what the lancet describes as a passive government vaccination policy, have nurtured public suspicions."}
{"original": "a recent poll by national broadcaster nhk showed 36% of japanese wouldn't take a covid-19 vaccine. that's not remarkably low trust, but public health officials will be incredibly alert to any unvetted reports of side effects sparking another media-fueled panic."}
{"original": "by arshad r. zargar - india's mass-vaccination drive kicks off on saturday. it's using a domestically produced stock of the oxford/astrazeneca vaccine, and another indian-developed drug."}
{"original": "both the vaccines have been authorized for emergency use and there should be no doubt about their safety. they have been tested on thousands of people and side-effects are negligible, said dr. v.k. paul, of the indian government's coronavirus and vaccines taskforce."}
{"original": "a survey by public engagement social media platform local circles earlier this month found 69% of indians said they wouldn't take a coronavirus vaccine, or would at least wait for months before deciding to get one. only 26% of respondents said they would get a vaccine shot as soon as it becomes available."}

{"original": "i would prefer to buy the vaccine on the market when it's available, he said, explaining that he lost trust in the government's health care system when he caught the coronavirus last year, but had six tests with different results. it was like a joke, he said."}

{"original": "the south asian nation is one of seven countries testing the chinese vaccine, but a recent poll conducted by gallup pakistan showed 37% of pakistanis wouldn't get a covid-19 vaccine when it's available."}
{"original": "pakistan suffers from extreme poverty, rampant corruption, and has a tiny health budget. it's struggled to contain the virus largely because hospital space is limited and many areas only have rudimentary health care facilities."}
{"original": "but it's the nation's deep mistrust of vaccines causing the most concern. for years, pakistan's efforts to wipe out polio have been thwarted largely due to public fear of foreign vaccines."}
{"original": "these anti-vaxx sentiments have been inflamed by tribal leaders and religious clerics claiming the polio drops are part of a western plot to sterilize muslims."}
{"original": "today, pakistan and neighboring afghanistan remain the only two countries where polio hasn't been eradicated."}
{"original": "the deep-rooted mistrust has, for years, seen dozens of people killed in attacks on polio vaccination teams, including an attack this week."}
{"original": "the vaccine conspiracy theories only got worse after a pakistani doctor was accused of running a fake vaccination campaign to help the c.i.a. track down osama bin laden."}
{"original": "while the dangers of polio have been well known for decades, covid-19 is a new disease, and the government's weak messaging around the virus have likely made things worse."}
{"original": "prime minister imran khan ordered a national lockdown early in the pandemic, but quickly abandoned it as the virus spread widely in the country."}

{"original": "the lists compiled by individual airlines — different from the federal no-fly list, which aims to block suspected terrorists from the skies — has swelled to more than 3,000 people, cbs news has confirmed. the flight bans grew out of mask requirements put in place due to the coronavirus. most flight bans will last until those mask policies are suspended at the end of the pandemic."}

{"original": "still, haley said republicans should not shy away from our accomplishments during the trump administration. she highlighted work on foreign policy such as withdrawing from the iran nuclear deal, moving the u.s. embassy to jerusalem and israel signing diplomatic pacts with arab nations. on the domestic front, she spoke about economic progress, cutting regulations and judicial appointments."}
{"original": "one of the key goals for republicans moving into 2022 and 2024 will be trying to win back suburban voters who revolted against president trump in 2018 and 2020."}

{"original": "white house spokesman sean spicer said thursday president trump is proposing a 20 percent tax on imports, particularly on products and services from mexico, so that revenues could be used to pay for the construction of mr. trump's proposed wall along the u.s. southern border."}
{"original": "spicer told reporters thursday that the administration is considering using comprehensive tax reform as a means to tax imports from countries that we have a trade deficit from, like mexico. the proposal is meant to raise the billions of dollars from mexico needed to cover the cost of the border wall, a promise mr. trump has made since his days on the campaign trail."}
{"original": "right now our country's policy is to tax exports and let imports flow freely in, which is ridiculous, spicer said. but if you tax that $50 billion at 20 percent of imports -- which is by the way a practice that 160 other countries do...by doing that, we can do $10 billion a year and easily pay for the wall just through that mechanism alone. that's really going to provide the funding."}
{"original": "later in the afternoon, however, spicer and white house chief of staff reince priebus told reporters that the proposal was in fact just one of several options the white house was considering, including a border tax in the range of 5 - 20 percent. it is part of a buffet of options, white house chief of staff reince priebus told reporters, according to cbs news' margaret brennan. he said this is one of the many ways that the border wall could be funded."}
{"original": "while mr. trump has publicly said he had already figured out how to pay for the wall, spicer said he's now willing to work with congress to find a way to do it. that includes making it a part of comprehensive tax reform like that being proposed by house speaker paul ryan. white house officials said the proposed border tax would essentially be a way to derive payment from mexico."}
{"original": "when pressed as to whether this now meant that the mexican government would not have to write a check to the u.s. to repay it for construction of the wall, spicer stipulated that the president had never said that was going to happen. he made the point that there were multiple ways for mexico – either via its corporations or other entities – to help fund the construction."}
{"original": "the border adjustment act that ryan has proposed would include a tax on goods produced outside the country for sale inside the u.s. in short it would incentivize corporations to produce their goods in the u.s. and sell them here instead of seeking a cheaper labor source outside the country. ryan's argument is that the corporate tax rate would be lowered to offset that increase in cost of doing business. he also argues that it would strengthen the dollar."}

{"original": "melbourne, australia -- the most senior catholic church leader to be charged with sexual abuse came close to confronting his accusers on monday in a video-linked australian court hearing to test the strength of the prosecution's case. cardinal george pell's alleged victims began testifying in the melbourne magistrates court against pope francis' former finance minister in testimony that cannot be made public."}
{"original": "the complainants, who cannot be identified, are avoiding the intense media scrutiny focused on the cramped courtroom and the company of their alleged abuser by giving their evidence via a video connection from an undisclosed location. the number of alleged victims has not been made public, and their testimony is scheduled to continue for up to two weeks."}
{"original": "the 76-year-old australian cardinal has denied any wrongdoing and has foreshadowed pleas of not guilty if the committal hearing that is scheduled to run as long as a month finds there is sufficient evidence to warrant a jury trial."}
{"original": "pell was charged last june with sexually abusing multiple people in his australian home state of victoria. the details of the allegations have yet to be released to the public, though police have described the charges as historical sexual assault offenses - meaning the alleged crimes occurred decades ago."}
{"original": "one of the charges was withdrawn last week because the accuser had recently died."}
{"original": "pell's lawyer robert richter did not object to the complainants appearing in court on a television screen monday rather than in person. but he did question why one would be allowed to appear with what prosecutor mark gibson described as a support dog while testifying."}
{"original": "i always thought that dogs were for children and very old people, richter told the court."}
{"original": "magistrate belinda wallington replied, no, they're also there for vulnerable and traumatized people."}
{"original": "when pell last lived in melbourne, he was archbishop of australia's second-largest city. he progressed to archbishop of australia's biggest city, sydney, before moving to the vatican as a prefect of the church's economy ministry in 2014. he intends to return to that job once the criminal charges are resolved."}
{"original": "in 2016, it was pell who was testifying by video to an official inquiry into sexual abuse."}
{"original": "he was in rome and had health reasons for not making a long flight to testify in person to australia's longest-running royal commission, the country's highest form of inquiry. it had been investigating since 2012 how the catholic church and other institutions responded to sexual abuse of children in australia over 90 years."}
{"original": "the inquiry issued its final report in december. pell was questioned about his knowledge of and response to allegations of child abuse when he was a priest and bishop, but no allegation was made that he was a perpetrator."}
{"original": "pell's lawyers told the court last month that the current criminal charges stemmed from publicity surrounding the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse."}
{"original": "the lawyers said the first complainant approached police in 2015, 40 years after the alleged crimes, in response to media reports about that inquiry."}
{"original": "on monday, richter cited pell's age and medical condition as reasons why the cleric should be allowed to be accompanied in court by a supporter."}
{"original": "he told wallington, the magistrate, that he understood the prosecution has an objection to that support person being a priest, although i can't understand that."}
{"original": "gibson, the prosecutor, replied, that's not quite right."}
{"original": "pell was silent as he entered and left the court to a crush of media cameras and police, as well as throughout the initial 25 minutes of the hearing that was open to the public."}
{"original": "richter said police had 21 witness statements provided by the defense that were favorable to the cardinal, but were not party of the case."}
{"original": "these documents are certainly relevant to the alleged offenses, richter said. i know it doesn't suit the prosecution because they are exculpatory of the cardinal."}
{"original": "the case places both the cardinal and the pope in potentially perilous territory. for pell, the charges are a threat to his freedom, his reputation and his career. for francis, they are a threat to his credibility, given that he famously promised a zero tolerance policy for sex abuse in the church. advocates for abuse victims have long railed against francis' decision to appoint pell to the high-ranking position in the first place."}
{"original": "when pell was promoted in 2014, he was already facing allegations that he had mishandled cases of clergy abuse during his time as archbishop."}
{"original": "after years of alleged cover-ups and silence from the church over its pedophilia scandal, abuse survivors and their advocates have hailed the prosecution of pell as a monumental shift in the way society is responding to the crisis."}
{"original": "so far, francis has withheld judgment of pell, saying he wants to wait for australian justice to run its course. and he did not force the cardinal to resign. pell said he intends to continue his work as a prefect of the church's economy ministry once the case is resolved."}

{"original": "this moment in time might call for this dynamic, but over the long term it will be destructive to the noble purpose and ideals of the open internet, dorsey said. a company making a business decision to moderate itself is different from a government removing access, yet can feel much the same."}

{"original": "but that all changed on the night of dec. 10, 2003, when kevin and his family were gunned down in their home."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: that night, when we'd just gotten home from church, and got the call of a quadruple shooting. that just doesn't happen out here in sugar land."}
{"original": "marshall slot was the lead detective assigned to the case."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: it looks as if it's a burglary gone wrong. the family is coming home from dinner. it's plausible that they could have surprised a burglar."}
{"original": "but as detective slot combed through the whitaker home, he realized things weren't adding up."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: in the master bedroom, the dressers, an armoire, all had drawers open on them, but they were all open equal distance. it was very neat and orderly."}
{"original": "peter van sant: normally a burglar would throw everything out of the drawers to see if there's any valuables in there."}
{"original": "detective slot began to suspect the burglary had been staged."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: none of the items of value inside the house had been moved around. the electronics, laptops, jewelry, none of those items that are typically taken in burglaries."}
{"original": "and then there was the murder weapon: it was the whitakers' own gun."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: the gun safe had been pried open and it was in a very isolated portion of the household. this is looking more and more like this person knew this gun was here and obtained it for a specific reason."}
{"original": "detective slot turned his attention to the whitaker family's history, hoping it might provide some answers. he started with kent whitaker's relationship to his wife trisha."}
{"original": "kent whitaker: we met on a blind date. walked in her house and i didn't know what i was expecting, but she came down and i thought i've never had a blind date like this before. and we hit it off very well right from the start."}
{"original": "peter van sant: how long after you first met trisha did you realize to yourself, i'm in love with this woman?"}
{"original": "kent whitaker: couple of months, maybe."}
{"original": "peter van sant: and did she feel the same way about you?"}
{"original": "kent whitaker: yeah. yes, she did."}
{"original": "kevin, left, and bart whitaker kent whitaker"}
{"original": "and then came their two boys, bart and kevin."}
{"original": "the whitakers were doing well. kent was a successful accountant. trisha, an elementary school teacher."}
{"original": "barbie harrington: trisha had a great rapport with children. parents adored her. the staff adored her. she was just fun."}
{"original": "barbie harrington and peggy mclane, trisha's close friends and coworkers, knew her true love was being a mom."}
{"original": "peggy mclane: they were everything. that's all she talked about. she loved those boys."}
{"original": "bart, the eldest, did well in school and had a quirky sense of humor."}
{"original": "peggy mclane: he was fun. he was witty. he was respectful."}
{"original": "peter van sant: a good son?"}
{"original": "a son who shared a passion for biking with his dad."}
{"original": "kent whitaker: he and i would spend hours and hours on training rides and on organized rides."}
{"original": "peter van sant: what would you talk about on those trips?"}
{"original": "kent whitaker: kevin was man at a young age. he would not back down from injustice. but he would be so quick to forgive."}
{"original": "peter van sant: this was as healthy and vibrant and loving a family as you'd find, wasn't it?"}
{"original": "kent whitaker: thought so. i was very happy with my family. i loved them."}
{"original": "peter van sant: how did that day begin?"}
{"original": "kent whitaker: bart was supposed to be graduating from college. he called and said he was through with his finals and he wanted to go out to eat and celebrate."}
{"original": "peggy mclane: trisha was so proud. she was telling bart she was going to jump up and down and scream, thank you, jesus."}
{"original": "kent whitaker: we all celebrated. we laughed. we told some jokes. we -- we teased each other and took some pictures and gave bart his graduation gift, which was an expensive watch."}
{"original": "peter van sant: what kind of watch was it?"}
{"original": "kent whitaker: it was a rolex. it was what he'd always wanted. it was just a happy night."}
{"original": "after dinner the whitakers headed home. then, unimaginable horror -- four shots fired."}
{"original": "kent whitaker: i start praying and i say, father, you know, if it's my time to die, i'm ready. it's ok. but protect my family. and it just was awful."}
{"original": "cliff stanley: i saw kent lying down. i went up to him and he was shot. he says, i'm bleeding very badly."}
{"original": "neighbor cliff stanley, the first person on the scene then went to check on trisha."}
{"original": "cliff stanley: she was still alive, was kind of moaning. i said, what happened? and trisha said, he shot us."}
{"original": "peter van sant: did she say who he was?"}
{"original": "bart was lying in the living room, wounded. as for kevin --"}
{"original": "cliff stanley: i could see kevin clearly and kevin was finished."}
{"original": "cliff stanley: kent, trisha, and bart were rushed to the hospital, but trisha didn't survive."}
{"original": "peggy mclane [crying]: i lost a friend that taught me how to be a better teacher and a better mother. she was just a really good person and i miss her so much."}
{"original": "john flores: and i remember i walked over to my friend's mom, and i just said, was it kevin? and i felt her -- i felt her nod on my-- on my head. i just kind of shook my head and said ok."}
{"original": "news report: detectives spent the day searching for anything that would lead them to a killer ..."}
{"original": "by the next day, grief turned to anger."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: kent, in no unclear terms, told me he wanted us to catch whoever did this. he was upset, he was hurt."}
{"original": "and bart seemed to share that anger."}
{"original": "john flores: he didn't say much. but he pulled my friend matt and i to him and he said, we're going find who did it."}
{"original": "detective slot continued his routine questioning of the survivors. bart told slot he was about to graduate from sam houston state university. but the next day came stunning news."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: the information had come into the sugar land police department from sam houston state university that bart was not enrolled as a student."}
{"original": "peter van sant: wait a second. he was not a student?"}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: he was a freshman on academic probation."}
{"original": "peter van sant: wasn't even a senior."}
{"original": "peter van sant: so, what do you do with this information?"}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: bells and whistles start going off that why is this kid lying to us? … what's he got to hide?"}
{"original": "kent whitaker: what were you thinking? you lied to us about being in school? you weren't even near graduating. how could you have done that?"}
{"original": "peter van sant: did you ask bart why he had lied to you? why he had said he was a student at sam houston state?"}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: yes, sir. he just didn't want to disappoint his family. he had needed a break; the stress of school had gotten on him."}
{"original": "then, just five days after the shooting, another bombshell."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: it was about 11, 11:30 at night. …the sergeant on duty paged me and said, hey there's somebody here who wants to talk to you."}
{"original": "slot met the stranger in the darkened parking lot behind the police station."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: he explained to me that he felt he had information that was crucial to the investigation."}
{"original": "the man said that bart whitaker wanted him to help kill his family."}
{"original": "six days after trisha and kevin whitaker were gunned down at their home more than 1,000 friends and family gathered to celebrate their lives."}
{"original": "brittany barnhill: so many people, it was incredible."}
{"original": "it was a time to share fond memories."}
{"original": "friend of trisha [at funeral]: almost every conversation with trisha included something about kent, bart, and kevin."}
{"original": "john flores [in tears at funeral]: kevin was a faithful loyal friend. he never compromised anything."}
{"original": "brittany barnhill [in tears at funeral]: i loved kevin so much. i cried with him. i went to senior prom with him."}
{"original": "brittany barnhill [at funeral]: bart, i cannot tell you how much kevin looked up to you. you were his hero."}
{"original": "amid the sadness there was also anger."}
{"original": "man at funeral: this murderer is still out there. the police needs our help. for your own families for everybody's sake, let's catch him."}
{"original": "but what no one here knew, among the mourners was a man police were closely watching."}
{"original": "peter van sant: your suspicions are focusing on which person?"}
{"original": "that stranger marshall slot had met in the police parking lot turned out to be an old friend of bart's named adam hipp. and he told the detective an extraordinary story: that bart had approached him several years earlier with a detailed plan to kill his family."}
{"original": "the diagram that adam hipp drew for det. slot called for hipp being the shooter, shooting the whitaker family members as they came in the residence. cbs news"}
{"original": "det. marshall slot [at computer]: this is a diagram that adam hipp drew for me during our three-hour long conversation. it called for adam hipp being the shooter, shooting the family members as they came in the residence."}
{"original": "according to adam hipp, the plan even included a twist to fool police: bart wanted hipp to shoot him in the shoulder, so he'd look like a victim, not a suspect."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: it was unbelievable."}
{"original": "peter van sant: so what adam hipp was telling you was essentially the blueprint for what happened in 2003, the real shooting?"}
{"original": "but bart appeared to have nothing to hide. he agreed to help detectives by reenacting what happened the night of the shootings:"}
{"original": "bart whitaker [police video]: that's when i heard a bang. and i don't remember if, i probably would have run up this way."}
{"original": "but bart's behavior only heightens slot's suspicions."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: everything is very vague. it could have been this, but it could have been this."}
{"original": "marshall slot [police video]: so that's about the distance you were from him when you got shot? bart whitaker [police video]: yeah. i guess. it might have been closer, i don't really remember."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: the fact that he wasn't able to give me a lot of detail about it … it was just unusual to me."}
{"original": "peter van sant: police had indicated to you that he was a suspect in this case."}
{"original": "peter van sant: were you wondering at all in the back of your mind, maybe he had something to do with this?"}
{"original": "kent whitaker: i considered it but -- but didn't consider it seriously. he promised me that there was nothing to it, that he did not have anything to do with it, that he loved trisha and kevin and me. …it was inconceivable."}
{"original": "but after adam hipp's story, detective slot felt otherwise. he decided to check out two of bart whitaker's closest friends -- chris brashear and steven champagne."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: let's see if he approached any of his current friends to do this."}
{"original": "chris brashear and steven champagne worked with bart at a country club just months before the murders. slot asked them to provide what police call scent samples. using bloodhounds, he compared those samples to evidence collected at the crime scene. slot's hunch paid off when he got a match."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: the dogs indicated that chris brashear's scent … was on the drawers that had been moved that night."}
{"original": "more importantly, brashear's scent was found on the gun used in the homicides."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: bingo. we've got our next prime suspect."}
{"original": "when detective slot grilled brashear, he denied any involvement in the shootings."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: we told him we had a definitive link between him and the murder weapon on the night of the shooting."}
{"original": "peter van sant: what are you seeing on brashear's face?"}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: horror. panic. we struck a nerve with this kid."}
{"original": "slot was now closing in on bart whitaker. then one night, seven months after the shootings, bart told his dad he was heading out to a club."}
{"original": "kent whitaker: bart told me he would see me the next day. …well, that was the last i saw him. …he disappeared."}
{"original": "peter van sant: just fell off the face of the earth?"}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: i was angry. we'd kind of let him get away. that's what i felt like."}
{"original": "bart's disappearance was a setback. but detective slot pressed on, focusing on the suspects still in sugar land -- especially steven champagne."}
{"original": "marshall slot: we stayed on him and stayed on him and stayed on him."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: he informed me that he participated in the crime … and that chris brashear had killed the family."}
{"original": "champagne confessed that he was the getaway driver, chris brashear was the shooter, and that bart whitaker was the mastermind behind the plan."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: this was the floodgates opening."}
{"original": "champagne led slot to a treasure trove of physical evidence."}
{"original": "ammunition from the gun used in the whitaker shootings sugar land police dept."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: he led me to the place on the bridge over lake conroe where he and chris brashear had thrown items of evidence."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: -- that chris brashear had used to break into the gun safe."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: -- which happened to be the ammunition that was in the gun."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: bart whitaker had provided those to them to use during the course of carrying out the plot."}
{"original": "steven champagne, left, and chris brashear, were arrested for the murders of trisha and kevin whitaker in september 2005. sugar land police dept."}
{"original": "in september 2005, sugar land police arrested both steven champagne and chris brashear for the murders of trisha and kevin whitaker. but they still didn't know where to find bart whitaker."}
{"original": "when bart whitaker fled sugar land, texas seven months after the shootings, he left behind a community and a father in disbelief."}
{"original": "peter van sant: as a general rule, people don't run if they're innocent."}
{"original": "kent whitaker: no, they don't. oh, it was horrible. it was awful. …i just sat down and i just cried."}
{"original": "like many a desperado before him, bart headed south into mexico. he ended up in a tiny village called cerralvo, located about forty miles from the texas border."}
{"original": "bart started his new life in cerralvo with about $7,000 in cash, money he had stolen from his father's house. he could speak a little spanish and soon he had a small apartment in town and a job at a local furniture store. he also had something else: a new identity."}
{"original": "peter van sant: who is this man?"}
{"original": "gabriella gutierrez [through translator]: well, i know him as rudy."}
{"original": "gabriella gutierrez remembers her american friend named rudy rios."}
{"original": "peter van sant: how would you describe him?"}
{"original": "gabriella gutierrez [through translator]: well, he was a friendly person. he liked to drink. he liked the beer. he liked to go with girls. he was very charming. he had a way with the ladies."}
{"original": "cindy lou salinas [through translator]: i saw him, and i said, wow, he's gorgeous."}
{"original": "cindy lou salinas first saw bart in church of all places."}
{"original": "cindy lou salinas [through translator]: i don't know, i found him very interesting. the guys that i've known -- i don't know, he just had something nobody had."}
{"original": "after bart and cindy lou began dating, her father, omero, gave bart a job at the family's furniture store."}
{"original": "peter van sant: what kind of a worker was he?"}
{"original": "omero salinas [through translator]: very good, very obedient. …i really liked him and held him in high esteem."}
{"original": "cindy lou's brother, ubaldo, befriended bart and was impressed with his stories of adventure -- like the one explaining his bullet wound."}
{"original": "ubaldo salinas [through translator]: he said he got the scar in the afghanistan war. …he said there was a surprise attack on his group by the afghanis. most of those in his group were killed. he shot at one with his rifle, but there was another one who got him in the shoulder."}
{"original": "the entire salinas family took bart in as one of their own, and bart told them they were the family he never had."}
{"original": "cindy lou salinas [through translator]: he used to tell me that he was an only child. that he never loved his mother because his mother never loved him either. and that his mother was a prostitute, he used to say that. …his family never gave him the love he wanted. they only gave him money. they ignored him."}
{"original": "for 14 months, bart lived a carefree new life as rudy rios – but it was all about to come to an end."}
{"original": "rudy rios [phone call]: to me he seems like a cool guy, but if he did that then he needs to pay of it, you know, what i mean."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot [phone call] i agree."}
{"original": "back in sugar land, detective slot got a phone call from the real rudy rios."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: he called me, anonymously one day at my office and said, i know where bart whitaker is. i helped him get there."}
{"original": "rudy rios and bart had worked together at a houston restaurant."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: bart explained to him that there was pressure on him from law enforcement. rudy said, well if you ever need any help, let me know. i've got family in mexico that can help you out."}
{"original": "according to rudy rios, bart paid him $3,000 to escort him to cerralvo. but when word spread of a reward for bart's capture, the real rudy looked to get paid again."}
{"original": "rudy rios [on the phone]: if there's a reward, you know, i don't care. i'll turn his ass in."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: ten thousand dollars."}
{"original": "peter van sant: ten thousand bucks."}
{"original": "peter van sant: so, rudy had dollar signs in his eyes when he came forward?"}
{"original": "marshall slot was there waiting when mexican authorities dumped bart back across the border."}
{"original": "det. marshall slot: he glanced at me and then just down to the floor. i don't know if it was a you got me look, but it was very satisfying to walk in that jail."}
{"original": "kent whitaker: the first time i saw him when they took him back from mexico. i walk in and we're separated by the bulletproof glass. i said, well, you look like you're ok. and he says, yes, i am. and he says, dad, i'm just so sorry. i'm so sorry for all of it. it's all my fault."}
{"original": "peter van sant: and what was the it in that sentence that he was referring to?"}
{"original": "kent whitaker: the murders. he's responsible for the murders."}
{"original": "bart whitaker sugar land police dept."}
{"original": "also waiting for bart were fort bend county prosecutors jeff strange and fred felcman with an indictment for the murders of his mother and brother."}
{"original": "prosecutor jeff strange: it is just the ultimate act of betrayal. …it doesn't get any worse than this."}
{"original": "peter van sant: why did he have to kill them?"}
{"original": "prosecutor jeff strange: one, because that was the way he was going to inherit $1.5 million."}
{"original": "prosecutor jeff strange: i think also to some extent deep down, bart thinks he's smarter than everybody else. and he just wanted to see if he could get away with the perfect crime."}
{"original": "in fred felcman, bart had an adversary who is one of the toughest, no-nonsense prosecutors in texas."}
{"original": "how would you describe bart whitaker?"}
{"original": "prosecutor fred felcman: there is a term they use in psycho lingo, psychobabble, of sociopath. in other words, a person who knows he's doing something wrong but really doesn't care. the old time texas thing was that he's just a mean sold on of a bitch, ok?"}
{"original": "because this was a multiple murder, prosecutors will seek the death penalty for bart whitaker."}
{"original": "fred felcman [in court]: four shots fired. four hits."}
{"original": "prosecutor fred felcman: it's a good strong case."}
{"original": "in fact, it's an overwhelming case. so much so that bart's defense attorney decides on a unique strategy. he will all but concede that bart is guilty and use the trial to try and convince jurors that bart's life should be spared. and he has a man of unshakeable religious faith in his corner."}
{"original": "kent whitaker: even knowing that he'd been guilty and responsible for this, i just can't understand why it's so necessary to put him to death."}
{"original": "fred felcman: do you have any inkling whatsoever mr. whitaker that your son had been lying to you? kent whitaker: no, i didn't."}
{"original": "incredibly, kent whitaker has forgiven bart."}
{"original": "kent whitaker: the first night in the hospital … i forgave everyone who was involved in this. …it is a gift of god that allows me to do this. …i think he gave me that gift so that when i found out that it was my son, that it would be a legitimate forgiveness."}
{"original": "the question now is: will a jury be as forgiving?"}
{"original": "sugar land, texas has never seen a trial like this."}
{"original": "prosecutor fred felcman: this crime affected all of sugar land."}
{"original": "a case of multiple murder where the accused is being passionately defended by one of the people he tried to kill."}
{"original": "kent whitaker: if the state pursues the death penalty and receives it, then they will kill the last surviving member of my family."}
{"original": "kent whitaker enters court as his son, bart, goes on trial for his role in the dec. 10, 2003 murders of his wife, tricia, and son, kevin. kent was injured in the attack. khou"}
{"original": "kent whitaker believes his son's eternal soul is at stake."}
{"original": "kent whitaker: i believe, as a christian, that god can and does forgive and change people's hearts. if they are sorry, if they repent, if they ask his forgiveness for real, he will forgive them."}
{"original": "but jeff strange and fred felcman say their duty is to uphold texas law, not god's law."}
{"original": "prosecutor jeff strange: kent whitaker's religious faith is genuine. forgiveness is a big tenet of what he believes. and i respect that and i -- i totally understand that. that's not my job though."}
{"original": "peter van sant: does bart whitaker deserve the death penalty?"}
{"original": "prosecutor fred felcman: yes. he meets the criteria we have in the state of texas. he is a continuing threat. he intentionally caused these people's death. and there is nothing mitigating about him. he wasn't abused. he wasn't surrounded by crime. i find it hard to believe anybody wouldn't think he deserved it."}
{"original": "three years after trisha and kevin's murders, bart whitaker's trial gets underway. prosecutors present crime scene analysis, forensic evidence, and eyewitness accounts."}
{"original": "steven champagne testifies that two months before the shootings, bart whitaker offered both him and chris brashear a cut of a $1 million insurance policy to help kill the whitaker family. on the night of the attack, champagne was waiting in the getaway car."}
{"original": "but it's the testimony of steven champagne, one of bart's alleged accomplices, that everyone in the courtroom is waiting to hear:"}

{"original": "champagne says two months before the shootings, bart offered both him and chris brashear a cut of a million-dollar insurance policy to help kill the whitaker family:"}
{"original": "steven champagne: the conversation was about … when the family got back from eating dinner, that chris would be in the house and shoot them."}
{"original": "on the night of the attack, champagne was waiting in the getaway car when chris brashear quickly got inside:"}
{"original": "steven champagne: i asked him what happened. …he told me that he had shot all of them."}
{"original": "defense attorney randy mcdonald can do little except attack champagne for agreeing to kill for money:"}

{"original": "as prosecutors build their case, more shocking details emerge. investigators learn the 2003 attack wasn't the first time bart had tried to kill his family. he had made at least three other attempts using other friends as recruits."}
{"original": "jeff strange: was it just a general conversation, i want to kill my family. i want you to help me? will anthony: yes, sir."}
{"original": "in december 2000, bart approached his college roommates will anthony and justin peters:"}
{"original": "will anthony: i was supposed to, as they enter the home, shoot the family, sir. jeff strange: will who was supposed to actually go into the house, was he going to be given anything to hide his identity? justin peters: yes. …he was given … black pants and black shirt and a ski mask. jeff strange: by who? justin peters: bart."}
{"original": "peters and anthony actually made it to the whitaker home. as planned, will anthony went to open a back window:"}
{"original": "will anthony: as soon as i touch it, sir, i tried to open it, an alarm went off."}
{"original": "the two men fled. but bart whitaker wasn't scared off. two months later he approached another friend with another plan. remember adam hipp, bart's old friend-turned police informant? under oath, hipp publicly admits that he too once agreed to help kill the whitaker family:"}
{"original": "jeff strange: why did you say yes? adam hipp: you know, i don't know. i'm not proud of it, but for the simple fact i was kind of interested to see how far he would take it."}
{"original": "prosecutor fred felcman: we're going, huh? these were kind of people you would think, this is what you want your son to be, goes to college, gets a banking job, stuff like this."}
{"original": "like bart, all three young men came from well-to-do families."}
{"original": "prosecutor jeff strange: clean cut, kind of all-american kids. justin peters had been a national merit scholar. …i just could not see how this could happen."}
{"original": "besides money, prosecutor felcman believes bart whitaker is a gifted liar and manipulator."}
{"original": "prosecutor fred felcman: he would actually seek out people, ok? …he would seek out the ones that were maybe a little weaker, that he got to know a little bit better, that had some investment in him."}
{"original": "bart's second plan to murder his family with the aid of adam hipp never went beyond talk. but by april 2001, bart had hatched yet a third plot."}
{"original": "peter van sant: so, bart whitaker was a determined young man?"}
{"original": "this time, the plan unraveled after jennifer japhet, a college acquaintance of bart's, found out about it:"}
{"original": "jennifer japhet: i asked bart if he was seriously going to let this happen. jeff strange: and how did he react to that? jennifer japhet: he came up to me and he gave me a hug and whispered in my ear that everything was going to be ok. jeff strange: did you called the police? jennifer japhet: i did call the police."}
{"original": "police, in turn, notified kent and trisha."}
{"original": "kent whitaker: it was just the far-outest thing that you can conceive of and we immediately said, there's no way."}
{"original": "bart told his parents it was all a misunderstanding. his parents believed him."}
{"original": "kent whitaker: in retrospect, you say, what an idiot. how could you possibly have not seen this? but the truth is we didn't know they were lies."}
{"original": "even after his wife and youngest son were murdered two years later, kent still refused to believe that bart was capable of such evil."}
{"original": "peter van sant: aren't you putting two and two together here and saying maybe bart's responsible for this?"}
{"original": "kent whitaker: perhaps i should have, but i didn't."}
{"original": "peter van sant: do you believe this crime could have been prevented if people had paid attention to the warning signs?"}
{"original": "prosecutor fred felcman: no…. look at the actions of bart whitaker. you're already caught, alright? but you still proceed to it. and you still go through it. now, you tell me where along this line would bart whitaker, do you think, is going to stop?"}
{"original": "bart whitaker's trial lasted six days. the jury deliberates just two hours, returning with a verdict everyone was expecting:"}

{"original": "confusion over u.s. plans in syria"}
{"original": "confirmation of the first withdrawals comes amid confusion over plans to implement president donald trump's pullout order and threats from turkey to attack the kurds, who have been america's partners on the ground in the war against isis in syria."}
{"original": "there are 2,000 american troops in syria. mr. trump's abrupt decision in december to pull them, declaring in a tweet the defeat of isis, sent shockwaves across the region and led to the resignation of u.s. defense minister james mattis and the top u.s. envoy to the anti-isis coalition. it also led to major criticism that the u.s. was abandoning its local kurdish allies amid turkish threats of an imminent attack."}
{"original": "on sunday, u.s. national security adviser john bolton said american troops would not leave northeastern syria until isis is defeated and the american-allied kurdish fighters are protected. secretary of state mike pompeo, who is on a tour of the region, has also sought to reassure the kurds that they will be safe after u.s. troops withdraw from the country."}
{"original": "these have been folks that have fought with us and it's important that we do everything we can to ensure that those folks that fought with us are protected, pompeo said of the kurds while visiting erbil, the capital of iraq's semi-autonomous kurdistan region, after talks in baghdad."}
{"original": "giving a subsequent speech about broader u.s. policy in the middle east at the american university in cairo, pompeo said now is the time to bring america's forces out of syria. he stressed that the fight against isis would continue, but he did no repeat the need for the kurds to be protected, or mention bolton's previous vow to curb iran's presence in syria."}
{"original": "russia's foreign ministry said friday that it suspected the u.s. government was really intent on maintaining a military force inside syria indefinitely, in spite of the pullout officially being announced by the americans. russia, the syrian government's most vital ally, would be happy to see the u.s. pull out entirely of the war-torn country, where it has military bases and a significant troop presence."}
{"original": "turkey's threat to kurds could slow pullout"}
{"original": "while the u.s. military pullout is now officially underway it is making a slow start."}
{"original": "the white house has not yet publicly altered it's most recent criteria, those announced by bolton a week ago: that isis must be defeated and the kurdish forces' security guaranteed before the american troops all come out. the first of those criteria is unmet, but feasible, as the terror group now holds only a small patch of land in syria. the latter will no doubt prove the more difficult objective to meet."}
{"original": "turkey considers america's kurdish allies of the ypg militia -- who were vital in the ground war against isis -- a terrorist group. on thursday, turkey's foreign minister said president recep tayyip erdogan had already made the decision to launch an offensive against the kurds in northern syria, and that it would go ahead regardless of the presence of american forces."}
{"original": "foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu went so far on wednesday as to say that if the u.s. withdrawal from syria was delayed, then we will put this decision into practice, suggesting turkey could go after the kurds in short order."}
{"original": "the u.s. announcement that mr. trump's ordered withdrawal is underway might be enough to convince turkey to hold fire against america's kurdish battleground allies, for a while, but erdogan still wants to go after them, and he could make good on his threats -- even on a small scale -- at any time."}
{"original": "the challenge for the united states will be to strike a deal with turkey's government that ensures the ypg militia, that was so invaluable to washington over the past handful of years, is protected when the withdrawal is complete. if not, the trump administration would be accused of abandoning an ally to a grim fate."}
{"original": "frontier airlines has changed its in-flight tipping policies to allow flight attendants to pocket gratuities from serving food and beverages to passengers. the jan. 1 shift in rules ended a three-year policy of pooling flier tips among crew members."}
{"original": "the program has resulted in millions of dollars in tips since its inception more than three years ago, showing how much our customers appreciate the great work of our flight attendants, frontier spokesperson jonathan freed told cbs moneywatch."}
{"original": "but the shift comes amid strained contract negotiations with frontier's unionized employees, who are fighting for higher wages and other concessions, including better healthcare benefits and more flexible work schedules. flight attendants made a median salary of $50,500 in 2017, according to the u.s. bureau of labor statistics, and frontier lags other airlines in terms of wages, in some cases earning 20 percent to 30 percent less than their peers at rival airlines, like spirit, according to sara nelson, president of the association of flight attendants."}
{"original": "frontier gives passengers the option to tip flight crew for exceptional service in the air -- a practice union leaders and others say reduces flight attendants from safety professionals to flying waiters and waitresses, according to industry analyst and atmosphere research group founder henry harteveldt."}
{"original": "nelson argued the tipping policy was designed to pass the cost [of labor] onto passengers. the jan. 1 change represents only a small victory, she said, in that it will create better transparency to ensure flight attendants are receiving the tips passengers intended to give."}
{"original": "the afa in 2011 negotiated its first contract with the airline after it filed for bankruptcy reorganization in 2008. the contract is currently amendable, and frontier flight attendants voted in november to strike unless their demands are met."}
{"original": "it's a significant pay increase we are looking for, nelson said. frontier has gotten away all this time paying less than the market rate and they are really dragging at the bottom of the industry."}
{"original": "some analysts say the change in the tipping policy disadvantages both flight attendants and customers -- and only benefits the airline, the eighth-largest carrier in the u.s. with a reported $1.8 billion in revenue in 2017."}
{"original": "i think it's a bad idea. i think it's also clearly a way for the company to reduce the amount of money it pays flight attendants. they're now at a point where they believe they should be able to pay the flight attendant less because they are making it up in tips, harteveldt said."}
{"original": "he also worries about the competition the new model could create among colleagues. it could pit the flight attendants against one another in terms of serving customers, and i am concerned about this policy creating tensions between flight crew members -- tensions that could boil over to frontier's customers, he said."}
{"original": "some airlines ban tipping altogether, including allegiant, whose policy states that flight attendants should decline tips if offered."}
{"original": "nelson doesn't worry that the policy will catch on at other airlines."}
{"original": "most airlines understand that they don't want to set a tone in the cabin that flight attendants are there for service. they need to keep control -- they are in a safety environment, not a restaurant. first and foremost you need to get there safely and flight attendants need to be able to fill that role of authority in the cabin, she said."}

{"original": "washington — the trump administration on friday unveiled a new set of immigration restrictions on six african and asian countries, expanding the so-called travel ban that has been denounced as discriminatory by critics to effectively halt the admission of immigrants from africa's most populous nation, nigeria."}
{"original": "the move adds nigeria, eritrea, sudan, tanzania, myanmar and kyrgyzstan to the third version of president trump's travel ban, a policy that elicited confusion and massive uproar during his first days in office when he banned most travelers and immigrants from seven predominantly muslim nations. the proclamation signed by the president on friday also maintains the restrictions currently in place for iran, libya, somalia, syria, yemen, venezuela and north korea."}
{"original": "under the new proclamation, people from nigeria, myanmar, kyrgyzstan and eritrea will be ineligible for immigrant visas to move to the u.s., while citizens of sudan and tanzania will be prohibited from enrolling in the diversity visa lottery — a program that mr. trump and immigration hawks have long railed against. residents of the six countries will still be eligible for short-term business and tourist visas."}
{"original": "immigrant visas petitioners from the new group of countries could be eligible for waivers and exemptions under the order, which is slated to take effect february 22, according to senior officials from the state department and the department of homeland security, which oversees the restrictions. about 12,000 people could be affected by the new stringent measures, the officials said on a call with reporters."}
{"original": "friday's expansion, the officials said, was the culmination of a comprehensive assessment by the department and is designed to ensure the designated countries improve information-sharing about criminal and terrorist activity, travel vetting procedures and other security safeguards. the six nations could have their restrictions lifted if they address these concerns, the officials added."}
{"original": "it is logical and essential to thoroughly screen and vet everyone seeking to travel or immigrate to the united states, acting homeland security secretary chad wolf said in a statement. however, there are some countries from whom the u.s. does not receive the necessary information about its travelers and, as a result, pose a national security or public safety risk that warrants tailored travel restrictions."}
{"original": "despite assurances by officials that the restrictions were solely grounded in national security concerns, democrats said there was still a discriminatory intent underpinning the expansion. texas congresswoman sheila jackson lee said the administration could've included other countries that pose national security concerns in the ban, but that it chose to only add countries with populations of color."}
{"original": "there are bad actors in russia. there are bad actors in china. none of those places have been put on any ban, jackson lee said during a call with reporters earlier friday. it is pure discrimination and racism."}
{"original": "on the same call, fellow democratic congressman joe neguse of colorado portrayed the new list of countries as a move by the administration to continue its efforts to severely restrict immigration without the consent of congress."}
{"original": "the data speaks for itself. it is clear that this administration, and they have been unabashed about it, they are doing everything they can to restrict immigration, of all kinds, neguse said, pointing to nigeria, one of the countries on the new list."}
{"original": "with more than 210 million inhabitants, nigeria is africa's most populous country and the largest source of african immigration to the u.s. according to a 2016 estimate by the u.s. census bureau, nearly 400,000 people in the u.s. reported having nigerian ancestry. in fiscal year 2019, about 6,700 nigerians were granted immigrant visas to move to the u.s., according to state department data compiled by the non-partisan migration policy institute."}
{"original": "according to the new york times, mr. trump in 2017 criticized nigerian immigration, reportedly saying immigrants from there would not go back to their huts once in the u.s. the president has also reportedly referred to african nations as sh*thole countries. like sudan and kyrgyzstan, nigeria is also a muslim-majority country."}
{"original": "although administration officials said friday's measures will not affect refugee admissions, advocates denounced the inclusion of myanmar, also known as burma, to the list. rohingya muslims in the predominantly buddhist country were targeted in a bloody government crackdown in 2017 that led to thousands of deaths and that united nations officials considered a campaign of genocide. in a recent ruling ordering the government in myanmar to protect its minority rohingya population, the international court of justice said the group remained extremely vulnerable."}
{"original": "issued days after mr. trump's inauguration in january 2017, the first travel ban restricted entry by most residents of iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen. the white house's executive order targeting seven majority muslim countries and temporarily shuttering the nation's refugee program led to widespread protests, with critics branding it the muslim ban. as a presidential candidate, mr. trump advocated for a a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states."}
{"original": "after the first order was held up in court, a second iteration of the ban, which removed iraq from the list and added travel restrictions on chad, venezuela and north korea, was unveiled in march 2017. that order was also struck down in court, with a federal judge saying it discriminated against muslims."}
{"original": "the third and current version of the ban was issued in the fall of 2017 and ultimately upheld by the supreme court in the summer of 2018, with the conservative justices citing the president's broad authority to restrict the entry of foreigners on national security grounds. in her dissent, justice sonia sotomayor said the court's majority failed to consider the president's rhetoric towards muslims."}
{"original": "by blindly accepting the government's misguided invitation to sanction a discriminatory policy motivated by animosity toward a disfavored group, all in the name of a superficial claim of national security, the court redeploys the same dangerous logic underlying korematsu and merely replaces one 'gravely wrong' decision with another, sotomayor wrote, referring to the court's ruling in 1944 which effectively allowed president roosevelt to continue interning japanese americans."}
{"original": "the american civil liberties union (aclu), which has mounted legal challenges against the different versions of the travel ban, was quick to condemn friday's expansion."}
{"original": "the ban should be ended, not expanded. president trump is doubling down on his signature anti-muslim policy — and using the ban as a way to put even more of his prejudices into practice by excluding more communities of color, omar jadwat, director of the aclu's immigrants' rights project, said in a statement. families, universities, and businesses in the united states are paying an ever-higher price for president trump's ignorance and racism."}
{"original": "the booming business of legalized marijuana may be seeing a favorable shift from the trump administration. attorney general nominee william barr's testimony this week signaled potential relief for business owners in states that have enacted various laws legalizing cannabis products."}
{"original": "marijuana remains illegal under federal law, and there's no consensus in congress on a recent proposal to change that."}
{"original": "in front of the senate judiciary committee on tuesday, barr said he doesn't plan on using federal resources to go after companies if they are complying with state law. that would be a reversal from the approach taken by his predecessor, former attorney general jeff sessions, who vowed to pursue federal violations more aggressively."}
{"original": "according to erik altieri, executive director of the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws (norml), barr's stance is a good sign for advocates but it remains to be seen if his actions will follow through on his pledge."}
{"original": "it's encouraging but we do need to remain vigilant to keep him to hold his word to the american people, altieri told cbsn's reena ninan. his organization is a non-profit that supports responsible pro-marijuana policy."}
{"original": "while 10 states and washington, d.c. have legalized recreational adult use of marijuana, and more than 20 other states allow some medical uses, u.s. attorneys can still prosecute its possession and sale under federal law. last year, sessions reversed an obama-era policy that encouraged federal prosecutors to take a hands-off approach in states where marijuana is legal. this put business owners back at higher risk of coming under federal scrutiny."}
{"original": "while barr's stance may seem like a departure from his previous get-tough approach to drug policy, he made it clear during his testimony that he doesn't support federal legalization."}
{"original": "i think it's a mistake to back off on marijuana, said barr. however, if we want a federal approach, if we want states to have their own laws, then let's get there and let's get there the right way. he said department of justice policy should align with congressional legislation."}
{"original": "altieri agrees that the federal government's official acknowledgment of state legislation should be in the hands of congress, and he urged lawmakers to embrace what he sees as popular support for legal pot among americans."}
{"original": "there's no putting the toothpaste back in the tube on this one. the american people want to end our failed prohibition and any attempts to really slow that down or stop it will be incredibly unpopular across all party lines and demographics, altieri said."}
{"original": "altieri also argues that federal marijuana legalization would help address many of the issues that concern people about marijuana's potential risks."}
{"original": "a recent book by by alex berenson, tell your children: the truth about marijuana, mental illness, and violence, highlights some of those risks, including marijuana's links to mental illness, harder drug use, and violence. berenson argues that legislation and public perception in the u.s. have sped ahead of the science, and that the growth has happened in the face of powerful new evidence that marijuana can be deeply harmful to mental health."}

{"original": "in an automated response, the ftc said it was unable to comment, citing its closure due to the u.s. government shutdown. facebook declined to comment."}
{"original": "the potential fine stems from an ftc investigation opened after revelations that data mining firm cambridge analytica had vacuumed up details about as many as 87 million facebook users without their permission. while facebook sells ads based on the information consumers share with it, many consumers were unaware their data had been provided to cambridge analytica through a policy that allowed app developers to gain access to their friends' data."}

{"original": "in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic — which is believed to have first spread to humans at a wet market in wuhan, china, where live animals were sold for food — china has created new guidelines on which animals can be bred for eating. in one significant change, the rules reclassify dogs as pets rather than livestock."}
{"original": "the move signals an official turn against dog meat consumption, and animal welfare activists hope it will lead to an outright ban of the practice."}
{"original": "the chinese ministry of agriculture and rural affairs said wednesday that dogs would no longer be considered livestock, meaning they cannot be bred for food, milk, fur, fiber, medicine, or for military or sports purposes."}
{"original": "in a memo explaining its choices, the ministry listed the progress of human civilization and the public's concern for animal welfare as reasons for reclassifying dogs as companion animals from traditional domestic animals. it also said that dogs are not considered livestock elsewhere around the world, and china now aims to follow those global standards."}
{"original": "the draft, which details which animals are allowed to be bred for meat, medical and other uses, lists 18 traditional livestock species, such as cattle, sheep, horses and chickens and 13 special species such as reindeer, alpacas, ostriches and foxes. the ministry is now seeking public comments on the guidelines by may 8, before they are finalized."}
{"original": "researchers believe the novel coronavirus originated in bats and then passed through another species to humans at a wet market in wuhan, where the outbreak was first detected in december. since then, covid-19 has infected more than 1.6 million people worldwide and caused over 100,000 deaths."}
{"original": "in january, china temporarily banned the breeding and trading of wild animals during the pandemic, but it will soon resume the practice under the revised guidelines."}
{"original": "while dog meat remains a delicacy in some regions, it has become increasingly less popular. last month, the city of shenzhen became the first in the country to ban its consumption."}

{"original": "humane society international (hsi) called the new guidelines a potential game-changer moment for other cities in china to follow shenzhen's lead and outright ban the consumption of cats and dogs."}
{"original": "this is the first time we've ever seen china's national government explain that dogs are companion animals, dr. peter li, china policy specialist at hsi, said in a press release. recognizing that dogs hold a special bond with humans is an essential first step towards eliminating the consumption and trade in dog meat. this could be a pivotal moment that provides encouragement for other cities across the country to follow shenzhen's lead to ban the eating of dogs and cats."}
{"original": "according to hsi, around 30 million dogs are killed each year for meat in asia, despite warnings from the world health organization that their trade spreads rabies and other health risks."}
{"original": "tens of millions of dogs and cats every year, mostly stolen pets, suffer for the meat trade which is almost entirely fueled by crime and, perhaps most significantly right now, poses an undeniable human health threat with the risk of diseases such as rabies and cholera, li said."}
{"original": "while hsi applauded the move, it remains concerned about the other animals on the list, both in terms of welfare and disease prevention."}
{"original": "rebranding wildlife as livestock doesn't alter the fact that there are insurmountable challenges to keeping these species in commercial captive breeding environments, and that their welfare needs simply can't be met, said dr. teresa telecky, vice president of wildlife at hsi. in addition, there's clear evidence that some of these species can act as intermediate hosts of viruses, such as covid-19, which is why we're urging governments around the world to stop trading in wildlife."}
{"original": "for many, the new year is a time to get back on track with health goals, making it a period ripe for marketers to tout unfounded claims about the benefits of detox diets."}
{"original": "methods that promise to rid your body of toxins can include anything from an all juice or liquid diet to pumping your body with multiple herbal supplements and even taking laxatives."}
{"original": "but in a new paper published online in the journal bmj case reports, doctors warn that not only do such detox diets not have scientific evidence behind them, they can also be life threatening."}
{"original": "the report describes the case of a previously fit 47-year-old woman who was hospitalized after following a new year's detox last year that involved drinking lots of fluids and taking various herbal remedies. she was admitted after a brief period of confusion and repetitive behavior such as grinding her teeth. she then collapsed and suffered a seizure."}
{"original": "according to the woman's family, she had been drinking more water and tea in the previous few days, but they did not think it was excessive. however, she had also been taking herbal remedies, including milk thistle, molkosan, l-theanine, glutamine, vitamin b compound, vervain, sage tea, green tea and valerian root."}
{"original": "the doctors concluded that her initial confusion and seizures were caused by a condition called hyponatraemia, which occurs when the level of sodium in the body is abnormally low, typically brought on by drinking too much fluids. however, they were unsure what exactly caused the condition in this patient's case."}
{"original": "after researching the herbal remedies that the woman used, the doctors came across another case of a man who had suffered from seizures due to severe hyponatraemia after consuming large amounts of herbal remedies that contained valerian root, along with lemon balm, passion flower, hops and chamomile."}
{"original": "in the report, they explain that both patients didn't seem to drink enough excess fluid to bring on hyponatraemia (typically more than 10 liters per day for someone with healthy kidneys). but they hypothesize that the valerian root may have played a role, potentially altering the body's threshold and allowing for hyponatraemia to occur at an earlier stage."}
{"original": "however, they caution that more scientific evidence is needed in order to draw definitive conclusions that valerian root was to blame."}
{"original": "still, they say the two cases highlight the fact that despite marketing suggesting otherwise, all-natural products are not without side effects."}
{"original": "dr. nieca goldberg, cardiologist and director of the joan h. tisch center for women's health at nyu langone medical center, notes that while detoxing can be a necessary process for people addicted to drugs and alcohol, the average person does not need to take extreme steps to cleanse so-called toxins out of their system. in fact, the body detoxes naturally."}
{"original": "that's the function of your kidneys, goldberg told cbs news."}
{"original": "the author of the case report, dr. oliver toovey of the milton keynes hospital nhs foundation trust in the u.k., also said that he would not recommend such a detox regimen to patients."}
{"original": "the liver plays an important role in breaking down toxins in the body and getting rid of them, he told cbs news. there is no way to artificially enhance this, nor should anyone need to."}
{"original": "toovey also points out that the notion of drinking excess water as a way to purify and cleanse the body can be dangerous."}
{"original": "the best policy is to rely on your body's own senses, he said. if you're thirsty, drink, and if you're not, don't. and bear in mind though that some of your fluid requirement will be in your food so you don't need to drink all of that amount in glasses of water."}
{"original": "goldberg recommends that if you're interested in achieving better health, stick to old-fashioned methods like a diet rich in fruits and vegetables."}
{"original": "the best way you can keep your body toxin free is living a healthy lifestyle and getting your nutrients from food, she said."}

{"original": "attorney general jeff sessions issued a marijuana enforcement memo thursday rescinding the obama administration's guidance, which enabled states to legalize marijuana without federal intervention. his one-page memo makes it clear that marijuana possession and distribution is against federal law, and it will direct u.s. attorneys to approach these cases as they do all other cases when enforcing them."}
{"original": "the move now injects uncertainty into the growing industry in the regions of the country that have legalized the drug, cbs news' jeff pegues points out. many are likely to be confused about whether it's okay to grow, buy or use marijuana in states where it's legal, since long-standing federal law prohibits it."}
{"original": "so far eight states and the district of columbia have legalized the drug for recreational use, and it is now helping to fund schools and even law enforcement. california just began selling recreational marijuana in recent days. the new guidance threatens to upend sales by giving federal prosecutors more discretion in how they enforce federal law. according to a senior doj official, this is the return of the rule of law, pegues reports."}
{"original": "sessions told reporters thursday that the obama guidance in the cole memo -- written by then-deputy attorney general james cole -- wasn't consistent with federal law."}
{"original": "it was interpreted as a safe harbor for individuals, sessions said. this memo does not have safe harbors in it."}
{"original": "he said that u.s. attorneys should understand that the attorney general believes marijuana is against federal law, and should there be prosecutions that need to be brought in order to enforce that law, then they should bring those cases."}

{"original": "but any private assurances sessions may have given gardner before his confirmation hearing were not necessarily evident in that testimony. he told senators who asked him about this very issue that one obvious concern is that the united states congress has made the possession of marijuana in every state and distribution of it, an illegal act."}
{"original": "he went on to suggest that it fell to congress to change the classification of marijuana as an illegal drug if it didn't want doj to enforce the law against it."}
{"original": "it's not so much the attorney general's job to decide what laws to enforce, sessions said. we should do our job and enforce laws effectively as we're able."}
{"original": "sessions' action is a departure from the obama administration's policy, which issued guidance in 2013 that it would not interfere in state and local initiatives to legalize marijuana, as long as they didn't interfere with federal law enforcement priorities."}
{"original": "in an interview with rolling stone just after he left office, obama explained the dilemma for the justice department in prosecuting the federal ban on pot, which is considered a schedule 1 drug, one which the fda says has no medical use and has a high potential for abuse."}
{"original": "[i]t is untenable over the long term for the justice department or the dea to be enforcing a patchwork of laws, where something that's legal in one state could get you a 20-year prison sentence in another, obama told rolling stone. there's something to this whole states-being-laboratories-of-democracy and an evolutionary approach. you now have about a fifth of the country where this is legal."}

{"original": "mr. biden's team said the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program — which mr. trump unsuccessfully tried to end — would be extended for four years, safeguarding the work permits and protections from deportation of more than 640,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the u.s. as children."}
{"original": "in a memo on saturday, incoming white house chief of staff ron klain said mr. biden will also issue executive orders during his first days in office to help advocacy groups locate and reunite migrant families separated during the zero tolerance border crackdown and to rescind mr. trump's travel and immigration restrictions on 13 countries, most of which are majority muslim or african."}
{"original": "according to garcia and cavazos, mr. biden and his team did not discuss any border security and immigration enforcement components to the legalization plan, items that have been historically seen as essential to garnering republican support for an immigration reform bill. the text of the bill has yet to be disclosed and mr. biden's transition team did not respond to requests for comment."}
{"original": "mr. biden distanced himself from the obama administration's high rate of deportations in the closing weeks of the 2020 presidential campaign. in his final debate with mr. trump, he conceded that not prioritizing immigration reform during the obama years was a mistake."}
{"original": "it took too long to get it right, mr. biden said at the october 23 debate."}
{"original": "during a rally in july 2019, immigration activists reminded the campaign of then presidential hopeful joe biden of the more than 3 million deportations that were carried out during the obama administration. nurphoto"}
{"original": "that night, the former vice president also made his pledge to work with congress on immigration reform in his first 100 days. how that might happen is still up for debate."}
{"original": "california democratic congressman raul ruiz said he and his team have been in touch with mr. biden's legislative team to sort out how immigration bills could be passed in a closely divided congress. one option, he said, is to try to pass smaller bills on specific immigration issues that were passed by the democratic-led house in 2019. these include plans that would legalize hundreds of thousands of farm workers, place daca recipients on a pathway to u.s. citizenship and grant temporary protected status to some venezuelans in the united states."}
{"original": "they are low-hanging fruit in the sense that they already passed, so we know that they have broad support in the democratic caucus. and they provide the basis and the building blocks of a larger, comprehensive immigration bill on day one, ruiz, recently elected as chair of the congressional hispanic caucus, told cbs news."}
{"original": "another potential standalone bill being crafted by texas democratic congressman joaquin castro would allow a broad group of immigrant workers deemed essential during the pandemic — from health care personnel, to food service and hotel staff — to apply for green cards and obtain deportation relief while their cases are adjudicated, according to an outline reviewed by cbs news."}
{"original": "representative lou correa, a moderate from california, said he worries immigration reform may not be prioritized due to the pandemic and other issues. he agreed that mr. biden should prioritize the response to the coronavirus crisis, but said immigration should take precedence over other issues like changes to the health care system."}
{"original": "otherwise, correa said, the chance to pass immigration reform could fade away like it did during mr. obama's first term, when he dealt with the great recession and prioritized the passage of the affordable care act. like in mr. obama's honeymoon period, democrats will now control the senate and the house, but with slimmer majorities."}
{"original": "president obama made some promises that he didn't keep, correa told cbs news, referring to mr. obama's pledge to introduce an immigration reform bill during his first year in office."}
{"original": "and we can all look at the excuses of why obama wasn't able to deliver — and they're all good, correa added. but politically the reality is this: you as a president have only so much political capital and you can only do so much heavy lifting before you can't anymore."}
{"original": "sanchez, whose group registered and mobilized thousands of latino voters in swing states including arizona and georgia — voters that helped democrats narrowly win the white house and other key senate races — said his group intends to continue pressuring mr. biden and congressional democrats to act quickly, especially with so many latino workers reeling from the health risks of the pandemic or struggling to stay employed."}
{"original": "we'll keep putting on pressure, sanchez told cbs news. there will always be in their eyes another priority and not immigration. but no excuses this time."}
{"original": "social media companies may have been dreading the fireworks marking the start of the new year. on jan. 1, germany began enforcing strict rules that could fine companies such as facebook, twitter and youtube up to 50 million euros ($60 million) if they don't remove posts containing hate speech within 24 hours of receiving a complaint."}
{"original": "the new hate speech rules, passed last june, require companies to maintain an effective and transparent procedure for dealing with complaints that users can access readily at anytime. upon receiving a complaint, social media companies have to remove or block obviously illegal content within 24 hours, although they have up to a week when dealing with complex cases."}
{"original": "social media companies haven't been viewed too favorably in many countries due to the massive volume of hate content on their platforms. to fight that, facebook in june said it removes 66,000 posts every week, saying it wants to do better but admitting the task is not easy. last month, twitter escalated its fight against hate, enforcing an updated policy that bans users from promoting violence and hate in their usernames and bios, and threatening to remove accounts if users tweeted hate speech, symbols and images."}
{"original": "german isn't the only country that wants social media companies to do more about hate speech. while the european union acknowledged facebook, twitter, youtube and microsoft for being better at the job, it said it managed to block twice the volume of hate content at a faster rate than those companies did in the beginning of the year."}
{"original": "we're committed to being part of the solution to illegal hate speech and extremist content online -- around the world, and in germany, working within its new legal framework, a youtube spokesperson told cnet in an emailed statement. we'll continue to invest heavily in teams and technology to allow us to go further and faster in removing content that breaks our rules or german law, and by working with government, law enforcement, civil society groups and other companies."}

{"original": "the commission had been studying the issue for several months. the policy change came several days after pro-trump supporters attacked the united states capitol. john trustcott, vice-chair of the michigan capitol commission, said commissioners were going to address the issue later this month, but moved it up because of what happened in washington last week. truscott added that senate majority leader mike shirkey throwing his support behind an open carry ban last week helped the commission decide to take up the issue."}
{"original": "the majority leader respects the decision by the capitol commission and supports the ban on open carry inside the capitol, said amber mccann, a spokeswoman for shirkey."}
{"original": "michigan's rules about guns in the capitol drew national attention in april when armed protesters were in the senate gallery while the legislature was considering whether to extend michigan's covid-19 restrictions."}

{"original": "despite the open carry ban, some michigan democrats said the ruling does not go far enough and called for prohibiting all firearms in the capitol. gov. gretchen whitmer said the open carry ban is a good start, but more action is needed."}
{"original": "on a normal day, hundreds of people walk through the capitol, including groups of fourth graders, teachers, and parents on school field trips to learn about state government. that's why we must take action to ban all weapons at the capitol to keep michiganders safe, whitmer said in a statement."}
{"original": "michigan's democratic attorney general dana nessel wrote a legal opinion in may 2020 saying he commission could ban guns at the state capitol. in a statement on monday, nessel urged commissioners or the michigan legislature to take further action."}
{"original": "firearms – whether explicitly visible or concealed by clothing — possess the same capability to inflict injury and harm on others and only banning open carry does little to meaningfully improve the safety and security of our capitol, nessel said."}
{"original": "while shirkey supports the open carry ban, michigan's incoming house speaker, jason wentworth, said in a statement that the capitol commission does not have the authority to set policy in the capitol and will look to address that moving forward. wentworth acknowledged that the michigan state police will be enforcing the rule and urged people to respect the michigan state police and the rules they enforce."}
{"original": "several incidents over the past year, including armed protests over the covid-19 restrictions and the 2020 election, have raised questions about security among some michigan lawmakers. cbs news has confirmed that the fbi sent out an alert to law enforcement across the country warning that groups are calling for the storming of government buildings in all 50 states if president trump is removed from office prior to inauguration day."}

{"original": "an outraged mother gained widespread attention with a video she posted to facebook showing her 13-year-old son getting a thorough pat-down by a transportation security administration officer at the dallas/fort worth international airport. jennifer williamson accused the tsa of treating her family like dogs, and noted that her son has sensory processing disorder (spd)."}
{"original": "the video shows a tsa officer methodically patting down her son from head to toe for about two minutes."}
{"original": "we were treated with utter disrespect as if we were criminals, williamson said in an interview with cbs this morning."}
{"original": "jennifer williamson posted a video to facebook on sunday showing a tsa agent patting down her 13-year-old son. jennifer williamson"}
{"original": "she called the pat-down her son was given excessive. they went over his sensitive areas, a little more than necessary, especially given that he wasn't wearing bulky clothing or anything like that, williamson said."}
{"original": "her son's condition made the ordeal even more upsetting. my son has sensory processing disorder so the touch can be very difficult for him to handle, williamson said."}
{"original": "spd is a neurological condition in which the brain has trouble receiving information from the senses. symptoms can range in severity from mild to incapacitating, and they differ from person to person, but often involve hypersensitivity to sound, sight, and touch."}
{"original": "elysa marco, m.d., a pediatric cognitive and behavioral neurologist and director of the sensory, neurodevelopment & autism program (snap) at the university of california san francisco, said some of her patients liken the feeling of a light touch to that of a profoundly itchy sweater times 100."}
{"original": "everybody's going to feel uncomfortable when you scrape your nails down a chalkboard or when you wear that itchy wool sweater, marco told cbs news. everyone can understand that, but it's important to realize that some people have a better ability to modulate their response to stimuli and for our patients the threshold is very low."}
{"original": "conversely, some people with spd may under-respond to sensations and show little to no reactions even to extreme pain, heat, or cold."}
{"original": "a study done in 2004 estimates that at least 1 in 20 children are affected by spd. while the condition is more commonly reported in kids, marco says adults can have it, too."}
{"original": "spd is not an official medical diagnosis in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (dsm-iv), an authoritative guidebook for doctors, but is part of the criteria for autism and is currently under study to be considered for inclusion in the next update."}
{"original": "marco says the condition is more common in children who were born prematurely, those with fetal alcohol syndrome, and kids with certain genetic conditions."}
{"original": "treatments include occupational therapy that can help patients tolerate different sensations. certain medications may also help."}
{"original": "in williamson's case, the tsa said it was complying with new policy procedures, which took effect on march 2. the facebook video shows the officer explaining the process first, then conducting the pat-down in which the officer used the backs of his hands when touching sensitive areas of the body, as the agency requires."}
{"original": "williamson said the whole ordeal began when agents found a laptop in her son's book bag as it went through the scanning machine."}
{"original": "she says she worries that her son will now have anxiety around traveling, something she says the family does quite often. she said she and her son have had open conversations about the event since it took place, but that if it continues to pose problems, she will seek professional help to help him cope."}
{"original": "while the experience was troubling for the family, perhaps there may be a silver lining in that the video she posted is bringing some awareness to spd."}
{"original": "we need to make sure that there is a growing public awareness that there are people — adults and kids — who are particularly sensitive to different types of information from the environment and that giving these individuals the help that they need is important and appropriate, marco said."}
{"original": "the divergence between rich and poor is growing in some regions, creating affordability problems and straining fiscal budgets."}
{"original": "america is increasingly the land of haves and have-nots, but the problem isn't shared equally across the country. some cities are struggling with greater income inequality than others, leading to crises concerning wages and affordability, according to a new study from the brookings institution, which examined income data from the country's biggest 100 cities."}
{"original": "inequality is typically viewed as a national problem, yet the issue is also local, given that some cities are struggling with how to cope with a widening gap between rich and poor. that can affect everything from housing affordability to public safety, especially in tech-heavy cities where wealth divisions are exacerbating social and financial problems."}
{"original": "cities that sprawl and those with strong middle-class employment tend to have lower levels of income inequality, while older cities that lack stable middle-class neighborhoods are more likely to suffer from a widening gulf between rich and poor, the researchers said."}
{"original": "some cities posted stunning increases in top incomes from 2014 to 2016, alan berube, senior fellow and deputy director of the metropolitan policy program at brookings wrote in the report. the most astonishing changes in the mid-2010s occurred among high-income households in a few cities characterized by booming technology economies."}
{"original": "that has implications for the city that amazon (amzn) picks as home to its hq2, or its second headquarters. the online retail giant has narrowed down its list to 20 contenders, ranging from boston to los angeles."}
{"original": "many cities' aggressive bids for amazon's second headquarters are heightening anxieties that the company's expansion could further accelerate inequality wherever it eventually lands, berube noted."}
{"original": "nevertheless, it's not only the rich who are better off. poor residents in some cities have also enjoyed income gains, which paints a complicated picture of income inequality. the past decade of economic growth has created separate ebbs and flows for households at different extremes of the distribution, he noted."}
{"original": "the problem, however, occurs when poor or middle-class families don't see that flow at the same time as the city's richest residents. in that case, they could get priced out of the region before they have a chance to catch up."}

{"original": "the federal reserve is getting set to announce wednesday how it will unload its massive holdings of long-term bonds. unwinding the $4.5 trillion portfolio would tend to put upward pressure on long-term rates, especially mortgage ones."}
{"original": "the fed is hiking interest rates two ways. for short-term borrowings, it is boosting rates in increments of a quarter percentage point, and is expected to do that again on wednesday. then there are the long rates: fed chair janet yellen is widely anticipated to detail a plan to gradually lighten the fed's bond trove, which consists of treasuries and mortgage-backed securities."}
{"original": "this will be measured and deliberate, said greg mcbride, chief financial analyst for bankrate.com. the impact will be on the long end of the curve, mainly affecting corporate bond and mortgage rates, whose yields often are correlated to 10-year treasury notes."}
{"original": "the central bank's long-term securities stash amounted to $900 billion before the financial crisis. but as an economic stimulus move, the fed launched its program to buy bonds, which was aimed at keeping long-term rates low, and thus aid borrowing."}
{"original": "now, with the economy on fairly firm ground -- gross domestic product growth is lackadaisical, but unemployment is low -- yellen wants to reverse the process, perhaps trimming the bond portfolio to about $2 trillion. the fed halted its program to add bonds in 2014, and has maintained its hoard at the $4.5 trillion level by reinvesting the principal in new bonds when the older ones mature."}
{"original": "under the new policy, the fed wouldn't reinvest the principal but instead remit it to the u.s. treasury department. that way, bond buyers would no longer have to compete for a smaller supply of publicly available bonds by paying less in interest. more publicly available bonds would tend to lower their prices -- and lift their yields, which move in the opposite direction from prices."}
{"original": "this will unleash government bonds into the public market, said paul eitelman, multi-asset investment strategist with russell investments, rather than leaving a big batch of them quarantined at the fed."}
{"original": "the trick is to avoid a reprise of the 2013 taper tantrum, triggered when yellen's predecessor, ben bernanke, said the fed would begin scaling back its bond purchases. this sparked a selloff in the stock market, which had benefited from lower rates because, among other things, they drove investors in search of better returns to riskier alternatives such as equities. interest rates also jumped on the news."}
{"original": "the fed may allow $10 billion in bonds per month to mature and run off its balance sheet, predicted russell's eitelman. he said he believed the program would start in december and last perhaps five years. the size of the holdings not recycled likely would increase with time."}
{"original": "of course, there is a debate on whether the bond-buying program did much good. david levy, chairman of the jerome levy forecasting center, pointed out that high demand for u.s. bonds in recent years occurred for reasons other than fed actions."}
{"original": "the woes of southern europe, emerging market troubles, a chinese growth slowdown and other perceived calamities drove investors -- particularly foreign ones -- to the safety of treasury bonds. that bid up the bonds' prices and pushed down yields, exactly what the fed sought to do. the fed's buying is not the issue most people think it is, he said."}
{"original": "why is the fed eager to reduce its bond holdings? the bloated balance sheet is a political liability on capitol hill, where republicans continue to eye imposing more oversight on the independent fed. plus, during the next recession, the fed will have more room to expand its holdings again to try goosing the economy."}
{"original": "by proceeding at a gradual pace, the fed would minimize any market disruption. anthony karydakis, an adjunct economic professor at new york university, predicted in a barron's article that this policy should keep the 10-year treasury yield at 3 percent through early 2018."}

{"original": "on thursday, we learned president trump's former lawyer and fixer michael cohen, who is headed for prison, will testify in a televised hearing before the house oversight and reform committee. it marked the beginning of season three of what's been called the donald trump reality show with a fresh plot, and new characters ushered in by voters in the midterm election who gave democrats control of the house of representatives. among the recently empowered is congressman elijah cummings, the new chairman of the house oversight committee. it has the constitutional authority to investigate anything it wants, creating serious problems for the trump administration and making cummings one of the most powerful people in washington."}
{"original": "elijah cummings has been a familiar face on capitol hill for a long time, a respected 13-term maryland congressman who has served on the oversight and reform committee under four different presidents. and he was handpicked by the democratic leaders for this job."}
{"original": "rep. elijah cummings: we are in a fight for the soul of our democracy. and you've got to understand that. this is serious business."}
{"original": "you can dismiss the congressman's statement as partisan hyperbole, but part of the government is shuttered, four of president trump's former associates are now convicted felons, ten of his original cabinet secretaries have left, four under a cloud of scandal. and there are 17 other investigations underway. not counting the ones that are about to begin in the new democratic house of representatives empowered with the legal authority to compel testimony and demand documents."}
{"original": "steve kroft: so how are you gonna run this committee?"}
{"original": "rep. elijah cummings: what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna try to work with the republicans as i have in the past. you know why? because that's our job. and when it comes to subpoena, i know the power of a subpoena, having practiced laws. in order to do oversight, you gotta have documents. you gotta have emails. you gotta have information."}
{"original": "for the first two years of the trump administration that kind of information was beyond the reach of house democrats. the power of subpoena belonged exclusively to the republican majority. as ranking democrat on the house oversight committee, cummings made 64 requests for subpoenas on things like white house security clearances, hurricane relief efforts in puerto rico, and the justice department's refusal to defend the affordable care act. all of them were blocked by the republican chairman."}

{"original": "steve kroft: but you're sitting here telling me you think somehow, miraculously, he's going to change."}
{"original": "rep. elijah cummings: it's not about miraculous. it's about-- adherence to the constitution. and the american people and the congress is insisting that he allows us to do our job. basically what the president has done and the republicans have done, they've joined hands. and the republicans have been basically not only blocking but become the defense counsel for the president. okay. but no documents? i mean, come on."}

{"original": "rep. elijah cummings: less than that. actually, less than that. the congress doesn't meet but so many days in a year. and all i'm saying is that we've gotta hit the ground, not running, but flying."}
{"original": "some democrats believe cummings should go for the jugular and push for impeachment. he says it's premature, and he also wants to pursue other issues especially the high cost of prescription drugs. his staff has already sent out 51 letters to government officials, the white house, and the trump organization asking for documents related to investigations that the committee may launch. the issues range from the private use of government owned aircraft by cabinet members to the flow of foreign money into various trump enterprises like his hotel in washington."}

{"original": "hong kong - china's manufacturing sector continues to gear down, highlighting the country's slowing economic growth."}
{"original": "china's manufacturing outlook deteriorated in february, according to two surveys of factory activity released tuesday, a day after beijing loosened credit to counter sluggish conditions in the world's second biggest economy."}
{"original": "an index based on an official survey of factory purchasing managers declined to 49.0 in february from 49.4 in january in the seventh straight month of contraction. the index has not been at a lower level in seven years; it fell to 45.3 in jan. 2009 as the global financial crisis was unfolding."}
{"original": "the economy's road to stability remains bumpy, said he fan, caijing magazine's chief economist, said of the manufacturing report tuesday. the government needs to press ahead with reforms, while adopting moderate stimulus policies and strengthening support of the economy in other ways to prevent it from falling off a cliff."}
{"original": "the reading by the china federation of logistics and purchasing is based on a 100-point scale with the 50 mark dividing expansion from contraction."}
{"original": "separately, a private survey also showed further weakening in manufacturing."}
{"original": "the caixin/markit purchasing managers' index slipped to a five-month low of 48.0 last month from 48.4 the previous month."}
{"original": "the index readings for all key categories including output, new orders and employment signaled that conditions worsened, in line with signs that the economy's road to stability remains bumpy, said he fan, chief economist at caixin insight group. he said the government faces more pressure to continue rolling out moderate stimulus policies to prevent growth from slowing too sharply."}
{"original": "the latest such move came monday night when the central bank freed up more money for lending by cutting the amount banks need to hold in reserve."}
{"original": "caixin's survey mostly covers smaller, private enterprises while the federation report focuses on larger, state-owned companies."}
{"original": "economists cautioned the numbers were distorted by the lunar new year holiday, which falls at different times in the first two months of the year. factories typically stock up on raw materials and scramble to fill orders before shutting for an extended break that began this year in early february."}
{"original": "attempting to iron out the distortions, anz bank economists raymond yeung and louis lam noted that the official index's average for january and february together was 49.2, which still indicates contraction."}
{"original": "there was some better news for china's services sector, with an official survey of non-manufacturing business activity slipping but continuing to grow last month, coming in at 52.7 from 53.5 in january. services have helped offset manufacturing weakness in china's economy, which last year posted its slowest expansion in a quarter century as growth ebbed to 6.9 percent."}
{"original": "china's economic slowdown comes as policymakers in beijing try to wean the economy off a tired model based on manufacturing and investment and refocus it on self-sustaining services and domestic consumption. to spur lending, the government on monday moved to cut how much capital china's lenders must keep on deposit at the country's central bank."}
{"original": "the change reduced required reserves by 0.5 percent points effective tuesday, which will release several hundred billion yuan (tens of billions of dollars) into the market. chinese trading is heavily influenced by the availability of credit, so an easing can lead to higher prices."}
{"original": "with respect to the manufacturing side of the chinese economy, the government is getting serious about slashing excess capacity in a variety of industries, said peter boockvar, chief market analyst with the lindsey group, in a note."}
{"original": "some forecasters expect china's efforts to loosen monetary conditions to succeed in shoring up growth."}
{"original": "given the usual impact of such easing on investment, we don't think growth is set to weaken much further this year as many expect, said julian evans-pritchard, china economist with capital economics, in a report. if anything, we still think a small policy driven uptick in growth is the most likely scenario."}
{"original": "but questions remain about whether china can avoid a hard landing given the massive overcapacity in its industrial base, with many state-run factories around the country sitting idle. without sufficient domestic demand to fill the vacuum, the government is reportedly planning to lay off 1.8 million coal and steel workers, and perhaps millions more over the next few years."}

{"original": "new hampshire is celebrating 100 years of holding the first in the nation primary this year, but it's not entirely clear how long the state will be able to hold on to that designation. in recent years, some in the democratic party have begun to complain that the state's lack of racial diversity makes it ill-suited to be the first vetter of the presidential candidates."}
{"original": "the state has already taken some measures to protect its first in the nation status, passing legislation before the 1976 election that would prevent other states from preempting the state's primary election. the presidential primary election shall be held on the second tuesday in march or on a date selected by the secretary of state which is seven days or more immediately preceding the date on which any other state shall hold a similar election, the law reads."}
{"original": "candidates from next door have historically over-performed in the new hampshire primary compared with national outcomes, a point joe biden brought up on friday as he tried to downplay expectations for a better performance here after the gut punch he acknowledged getting from his fourth-place finish in iowa."}
{"original": "with former massachusetts governor deval patrick's late entry into the race, there are three candidates from neighboring states campaigning in new hampshire for the democratic nomination. the others are front-runner vermont senator bernie sanders and massachusetts senator elizabeth warren."}
{"original": "this year, they may have a slight advantage, with neighboring volunteer reinforcements, new england commonalities and a familiar media market. but that hasn't stopped pete buttigieg, of indiana, and amy klobuchar, of minnesota from surging in polls over the past few days."}
{"original": "since 1952, when new hampshire's modern primary began, there have been 17 democratic races. seven of those included candidates from the granite state's three neighbors — massachusetts, maine or vermont. in those races, new hampshire's neighbors have won six times. additionally, two other times candidates from neighboring states finished in second place."}
{"original": "new hampshire's longtime secretary of state, bill gardner, has set his quadrennial 2020 primary turnout prediction at 420,000 voters (292,000 democratic ballots and 128,000 republican ballots.) if realized, that would be the most votes cast in a presidential primary featuring an incumbent president."}
{"original": "however, on a phone call with reporters monday, new hampshire democratic chair ray buckley said, i don't think anyone is predicting anywhere near the 2008 turnout. i think we will have a terrific turnout. it will certainly be higher than any other state in the entire nominating process. but there's no indication we'll match or be near 2008."}
{"original": "in new hampshire, undeclared or independent voters, who make up 42% of the current electorate, may pick up either a democratic or republican ballot on primary day. there are more independents this cycle compared to 2016 (38%), the majority coming from the republican party."}
{"original": "in 2016, senator bernie sanders won the new hampshire primary by over 22 points (56,838 votes). hillary clinton went on to win new hampshire against donald trump by just 0.3% (less than 2,700 votes.) in new hampshire alone, over 4,400 wrote in senator bernie sanders' name during the general election."}

{"original": "steyer, whose south carolina campaign has continued to grow now totals 102. the hedge fund manager was introduced by south carolina representative annie mcdaniel who was a former cory booker supporter but has decided to support steyer in part because of the time he's spent in rural communities throughout the state."}
{"original": "in a gaggle with press after the event, steyer answered questions about this decision to bring up race during the democratic presidential debate friday. look, i was frustrated because we had gone through—i don't know how much of the debate but a lot of it, without anyone ever mentioning the word race, said steyer."}
{"original": "i felt like several times in that debate, we were having policy discussions that are relevant once we've won but we're not dealing with the facts…not talking about race in the united states of america is overlooking a hugely important topic and sweeping it under the rug means you're not dealing with the facts on the ground, he said."}

{"original": "one week after caucus day, iowa democratic party (idp) chair troy price updated reporters on recanvassing requests the party received today. senator bernie sanders' and former south bend mayor pete buttigieg's campaigns both submitted recanvassing requests covering 143 precincts. the sanders campaign requested recanvassing at 28 precincts and the buttigieg campaign requested 66 precincts along with all of the in-state satellite caucus sites. the party now has 48 hours to respond with any updates. the recanvassing process will involve comparing math worksheets showing how many delegates each candidate won, compared to the numbers reported on the public website."}
{"original": "the state party says it cannot fix errors on the math sheets during recanvassing. after the recanvassing response, campaigns will have 24 hours to respond with any requests for a recount from precincts that were recanvassed. that will involve opening presidential preference cards that people filled out to show which candidates they supported."}
{"original": "price today said that the idp believes it cannot alter math sheets, even if there are clear errors, because they are the official record of what happened. that means only errors showing differences between the math sheets and what's on the party's site publicly can be adjusted during recanvassing."}
{"original": "these sheets are signed not only by the precinct chair and the precinct secretary, they're also signed by campaign representatives, price said. and so, for us they are the official record of what took place in the room. and we do not believe that we should be altering what is the official record of what happened in the room."}
{"original": "gary dickey, an attorney who served as former iowa governor tom vilsack's general counsel, said the party's view that it can't correct obvious errors is legally indefensible. dickey told cbs news campaign reporter adam brewster, the sections of the iowa code to which the party cites do not prevent it from making corrections…the first amendment right to freedom of association allows political parties to make their own rules for choosing their presidential nominees. no court is going to block the party's decision to correct mathematical and transposition errors."}

{"original": "everyone working at nv dems now has the same job: executing the most transparent, accessible, and expansive caucus yet, added forgey. in the wake of the delayed and now-questioned results from iowa, democrats in nevada have raced to shore up their own contest with an ipad-based caucus tool previewed over the weekend at volunteer summits ahead of early voting this week. though the party has refused to disclose the developer behind its new tool or publicly outline details of its process for caucus chairs to report results, multiple democrats in the state tell cbs news they believe the party will rely in part on google's forms and sheets apps to relay early vote information."}

{"original": "tulsi gabbard with ed privé in northfield, nh nicole sganga"}
{"original": "gabbard's long-shot campaign for the presidency is betting big on a strong performance in new hampshire, where the primary historically rewards outsiders and underdogs, on occasion. over 42% of the state's voters here are registered as undeclared, which allows them to vote in either party's primary in february. and while other candidates focus on next week's iowa caucuses, gabbard has all but moved to new hampshire, spending more days in state (a sum total of 34) than any other democratic candidate across december and january."}
{"original": "gabbard, a 38-year-old iraqi war veteran who backed bernie sanders in the last democratic primary, fuses progressive policy stances with the kind of patriotic displays sometimes more associated with republican campaigns. before she makes her hour-long pitch to voters at rallies throughout new hampshire, her audiences are often instructed to stand for the pledge of allegiance or bow their heads for a moment of silence."}

{"original": "that is the double-bind of gabbard's candidacy. she appeals to some independent voters democrats are anxious to win in the general election, but not many party stalwarts. in a boston globe/suffolk university poll released earlier this month, gabbard earned 5% support among likely new hampshire democratic primary voters. but among independents, gabbard is the first choice for a whopping 21%."}
{"original": "roughly half of the new hampshire towns gabbard has visited backed mr. trump in 2016. her populist, anti-war message attracts fans from both ends of the political spectrum, including former trump strategist steve bannon and former democratic ohio congressman dennis kucinich. but she has struggled to attract much of any support from mainstream democratic voters who pick their party's nominee."}
{"original": "while her chances of winning the primary are extraordinarily slim, national democrats are worried that gabbard could still find a way of spoiling their chances of beating mr. trump. some have even gone so far as to insinuate the combat veteran, who infamously met with syrian dictator bashir al-assad in 2017, might be the agent of a foreign power."}

{"original": "for her part, gabbard, who is not running for re-election to the house, has repeatedly insisted that she will not run as an independent or third-party candidate in the general election. but if gabbard were to change her mind, steve bannon told cbs news, her appeal to republicans and republican-leaning voters is so intense it might actually help democrats reclaim the white house."}

{"original": "clinton doesn't get it — she thinks she's a russian asset or something of a spoiler for the democrats. as usual, clinton misses the point. it shows you how out of touch she is. these are trump voters going to see her. they're not democratic voters. or they're democrats who voted for trump. or independents who voted for trump."}
{"original": "bannon, who calls gabbard beyond a rock star and a real populist-nationalist, invited the congresswoman to meet with trump officials after the 2016 election. she's one of the first people we got up there. i was just blown away by her level of sophistication on national security and her understanding of 'america first,' bannon said."}
{"original": "dennis kucinich, who ran for the presidency twice as a stalwart progressive, is one of gabbard's left-leaning supporters. tulsi is one of the few individuals who provides a categorical challenge to u.s. foreign policy...she can appeal to both libertarians and republicans. that's a winning approach, he told cbs news."}
{"original": "first, however, gabbard needs to find a way to win over democrats. the hawaii lawmaker has not qualified for the debate stage in months, and while other candidates' boast hundreds of staffers and dozens of offices in key early states, gabbard employs a team of just over a dozen paid employees nationwide, according to fec filings. the campaign opened up their very first field office earlier this month in downtown manchester, operated by a round of 50 full-time volunteers in new hampshire."}

{"original": "as part of an 11th hour blitz of regulations, the outgoing trump administration has finalized several asylum restrictions that are set to take effect shortly before or after president-elect joe biden takes the oath of office in nine days."}
{"original": "the rules represent president trump's last major effort to reshape the u.s. asylum system, which his administration has argued is abused by economic migrants. one set of rules, which was slated to take effect monday until a federal court blocked it last week, would erect restrictions throughout the asylum process and generally disqualify victims of gender-based persecution, domestic abuse and gang violence from u.s. refuge."}
{"original": "another rule set to take effect a day before inauguration day would revive a policy struck down in court last summer that bars non-mexican migrants, including unaccompanied children, from applying for u.s. asylum at the southern border."}
{"original": "a third regulation, set to take effect two days after mr. biden is sworn in, would allow officials to render asylum-seekers ineligible for u.s. protection if they are determined to exhibit symptoms of a contagious disease, like covid-19, or if they have hailed from or traveled through countries where a disease is prevalent or epidemic."}
{"original": "these rules, if they are actually implemented, will have a devastating effect on asylum-seekers and lead the united states to turn away people seeking refuge back to the very countries that they have fled, eleanor acer, the director of the refugee protection program for the group human rights first, told cbs news."}

{"original": "u.s. asylum law, largely based on international refugee treaties brokered after world war ii, is designed to offer protection to immigrants on american soil who have been persecuted, or fear being persecuted, in their home countries because of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a social group."}
{"original": "last month, u.s. asylum officers were informed of the rules' implementation dates and told they would receive training and guidance, according to three internal emails reviewed by cbs news. but two u.s. citizenship and immigration services (uscis) asylum officers said no training or guidance has been forthcoming."}
{"original": "the officers did receive a notice from andrew davidson, the chief of the asylum division at uscis, on saturday informing them that the rules set to take effect monday had been blocked by a federal judge and that training for them would be postponed until further notice. uscis spokesperson joe sowers said asylum officers will be trained before they address any cases impacted by the new regulations."}
{"original": "the rules finalized at the tail end of mr. trump's presidency would add additional layers of restrictions to a network of policies that have severely narrowed asylum eligibility and allowed u.s. border officials to rapidly expel people who ask for humanitarian refuge at the southern border."}
{"original": "mr. biden's advisers have said they plan to gradually undo many of the trump administration's border policies, including a program that led to the return of 70,000 non-mexican asylum-seekers to mexico. but the president-elect and his aides have cautioned that the policy reversals will take time amid the pandemic. he has also yet to say whether he will rescind the asylum limits unveiled towards the end of mr. trump's tenure."}
{"original": "the asylum ban on public health grounds set to take effect january 22 could be suspended by a memo that mr. biden's advisers said will be issued on inauguration day to halt or delay trump-era rules that have yet to take effect. the other rules, however, would have to be reversed through the regulatory process, settlements in federal court or by congress voting, with mr. biden's consent, to invoke the little-known congressional review act."}
{"original": "there's also the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) order that the trump administration has been using to expel migrants without an asylum interview or court hearing. mr. trump's aides have said the policy has helped contain the coronavirus, but some cdc experts opposed the white house's efforts to implement it last spring, as they believed there was no public health basis for such a broad measure."}
{"original": "lee gelernt, an american civil liberties union lawyer who has filed lawsuits against many of mr. trump's immigration policies, including the cdc order, urged mr. biden to take swift action once in office."}

{"original": "a spokesperson for mr. biden's transition, which has not committed to ending the border expulsions policy, did not respond to requests for comment."}
{"original": "last month, mr. biden's immigration advisers vowed to create a fair and humane system at the u.s.-mexico border by accepting asylum requests at ports of entry, dispatching funds to migrant shelters, working with nonprofits to identify the most vulnerable migrants, whose cases would be prioritized, and testing asylum-seekers for the coronavirus before allowing them to enter the u.s."}
{"original": "overcoming the challenges at the border is going to take time but the president-elect is committed to moving forward as quickly as possible, a biden transition official said."}
{"original": "the transition officials also said the incoming administration would assign asylum officers to review the cases of migrants who ask for protection along the u.s.-mexico border in order to ease some of the burden on the backlog-ridden immigration courts."}
{"original": "a u.s. asylum officer who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press said the biden administration would need to hire more asylum officers to accomplish this objective. he said migrants should have access to lawyers and not be required to wait inside jail-like detention centers while their cases are reviewed, suggesting that complexes where they have freedom of movement may be a more humane alternative."}
{"original": "boosting the morale among the asylum corps should also be a priority for the incoming administration, the officer said, echoing concerns raised by other uscis employees who believe mr. trump's asylum restrictions run contrary to international refugee law and america's image as a safe haven for the world's persecuted."}

{"original": "in late 2016, .3 percent of (hhs) intake were noted as separated children. by summer of 2017, a year prior to the court order, that had spiked to 3.6 percent of their intakes, said ann maxwell, assistant inspector general for evaluation and inspections, on a call with members of the media thursday."}
{"original": "maxwell said it's unclear how many children were separated from their families in the year and a half before the court order, because the government was not required to track separations until the june court ruling."}
{"original": "the point was highlighted as a key takeaway in the report thursday from the inspector general's office."}
{"original": "the total number of children separated from a parent or guardian by immigration authorities is unknown. ... however, thousands of children may have been separated during an influx that began in 2017, before the accounting required by the court, and hhs has faced challenges in identifying separated children, the office said."}
{"original": "as of december 2018, nearly all of the children identified following the june court order as being separated from their parents had been reunited with parents or released to a sponsor, according to the report. but maxwell said there's no telling where previous separated children ended up."}
{"original": "we don't have any data on how those children were released, maxwell said."}
{"original": "after yordy pablo, now 16, from guatemala, and his younger brother were separated from their mother at the border last summer, the children were sent to new york city."}
{"original": "for pablo and his brother, the door, a nonprofit youth development organization that provides free legal immigration assistance to teens and young adults, stepped in and is fighting for the boys to stay safely in the u.s. pablo's attorney at the door is helping him apply for special immigrant juvenile status — a form of humanitarian relief available to young, vulnerable immigrants."}
{"original": "as his case works its way through the immigration system, yordy has become conversant in english and is thriving in his classes. he hopes to graduate from high school, attend college and become a lawyer."}
{"original": "the conclusions were made following a months-long analysis of agency data and interviews with staff that included senior hhs leadership, according to the report."}
{"original": "a spokeswoman for department of homeland security (dhs) criticized the report in an emailed statement."}
{"original": "for the hhs oig to claim it was not known that as a result of dhs actively enforced this policy in the same manner for more than a decade children were placed in hhs custody brings casts doubt on the hhs oig's credibility on this topic, said dhs spokeswoman katie waldman."}
{"original": "in a follow-up email to cbs news, she said the office failed to provide evidence for its conclusion that thousands may have been separated but not tracked, and questioned how it arrived at that figure."}
{"original": "lee gelernt, lead attorney and deputy director of the aclu's immigrants' rights project, which led a lawsuit about separated children, said in a statement, we will be back in court over this latest revelation."}
{"original": "this policy was a cruel disaster from the start. this report reaffirms that the government never had a clear picture of how many children it ripped from their parents, gelernt said."}
{"original": "in a statement to cbs news, hhs pointed to its response to the inspector general's findings which was included in the report. the response notes that processes for identifying and tracking newly separated children 'are effective and continuing to improve."}
{"original": "but christi grimm, the inspector general chief of staff, said thursday it's too soon to tell if the systems for tracking children have improved. the jury is still out on that, grimm said."}
{"original": "secretary of state mike pompeo was confident that u.s.-north korea summit is still scheduled for june 12 despite the president casting doubt on the date on tuesday. he testified before the house foreign affairs committee on strengthening u.s. diplomacy, but was questions focused primarily on the administration's work on achieving denuclearization in the korean peninsula as well as next steps for the u.s. after formally withdrawing from the iran nuclear deal."}
{"original": "in prepared remarks, pompeo cited the administration's maximum pressure campaign of diplomatic and economic sanctions as laying the groundwork for the june 12th summit. he vowed, however, that the u.s. posture towards north korea will not change until we see credible steps taken toward the complete, verifiable, and irreversible de-nuclearization of the korean peninsula."}
{"original": "we are clear-eyed about the regime's history. it's time to solve this once and for all. a bad deal is not an option. the american people are counting on us to get this right. if the right deal is not on the table, we will respectfully walk away, pompeo added."}
{"original": "his comments come as mr. trump told reporters at the white house on wednesday, we will know next week about singapore."}
{"original": "pompeo told house members that the u.s.-north korea summit is still scheduled for june 12 despite the president casting doubt on the date on tuesday. we have an opportunity. our eyes are wide open to history but we are hopeful, pompeo said. he added that the final decision on if the summit indeed takes place will be up to kim jong un. he asked for the meeting, president trump agreed, said pompeo. he aded that he was very hopeful that meeting will take place."}
{"original": "pompeo was confident that we have the timing and the leaders right for this meeting to be historically successful."}
{"original": "the secretary says so far, u.s. demand have been unambiguous and maintains that the administration has made zero concessions to kim. pompeo reiterated that in his talks with the dictator so far, kim made clear that it was important to him that when the time came, he would receive economic assistance in the form of private sector business and american know-how. pompeo added that kim wanted security assurances from the world."}
{"original": "as for details on the summit's framework and participants, pompeo was tight-lipped. he said mr. trump was in charge of the negotiations but the team would be led up by himself. the secretary told lawmakers that kim and the north korean regime has viewed the use and development of nuclear weapons as their security blanket."}
{"original": "we have this chance to stand that on its head, said pompeo, saying that the u.s. aims to communicate that nuclear weapons present the greatest risk to the regime and the people of north korea."}
{"original": "pompeo said there is a great deal more work do with regards to safeguarding the u.s. election process but said that he's greatly proud of the work the this administration has done to counter russia. he said that the trump administration has been lightyears better than the previous administration but noted the u.s. has not been able to achieve effective deterrence to prevent future attacks."}
{"original": "we will not tolerate russian interference in the 2018 elections, he told lawmakers. we will take appropriate countermeasures to continued russian efforts."}
{"original": "amid reports that the state department has urged u.s. citizens in china to report any symptoms or medical problems they notice while in the country, pompeo told lawmakers that the medical indications are very similar—and entirely consistent with—the medical indications that've taken place to americans working in cuba. multiple u.s. and canadian nationals suffered from what the u.s. government called health attacks in havana."}
{"original": "in guangzhou, employees have reportedly experienced subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure."}
{"original": "we have medical teams that are moving to be on the ground there, pompeo added."}
{"original": "during a particularly contentious exchange with rep. gregory meeks, d-new york, pompeo was adamant that diplomatic security would not be impacted by the amount of dollars spent by state. meeks reminded pompeo of a heated exchange he engaged in with previous secretary of state hillary clinton during her testimony in the aftermath of the attack on a u.s. compound in benghazi, libya, september 2012."}
{"original": "under the obama administration, over $3 billion went to diplomatic security, but once president trump came in, i see it went to down $2.1 billion...and down to $1.6 billion, rep. meeks says. so where is the concern now about diplomatic security? he asks pompeo pic.twitter.com/8u0zdwaidj — cbs news (@cbsnews) may 23, 2018"}

{"original": "i take a backseat to no one with respect to caring about protecting the people, pompeo relied. rep meeks then reorted, nor did hillary clinton take a back seat to no one."}
{"original": "in opening remarks, pompeo reiterated details of the administration's exit plan from the iran nuclear deal which he unveiled earlier this week."}
{"original": "we will apply unprecedented financial pressure, coordinate with our dod colleagues on deterrence efforts, support the iranian people, and hold out the prospect of a new deal for iran – it simply needs to change its behavior. we seek to work with as many partners, friends, and allies as possible to achieve the common objective of stopping all of iran's nuclear and non-nuclear threats, said pompeo."}
{"original": "he told lawmakers that the demands outlined in his plan were were not fantasy, and that he's just asking iran to behave like a normal country. the secretary added that state will come back to congress to seek further authority in the administration's plan."}

{"original": "london — donald trump's administration was not a conventional one in the view of many u.s. allies and some of the international reaction on inauguration day to the change in washington didn't follow diplomatic norms."}
{"original": "german president frank-walter steinmeier said he was, greatly relieved that joe biden will be inaugurated as president and move in the white house."}
{"original": "after 4 long years, europe has a friend in america, said ursula von der leyen, president of the european union's governing body."}
{"original": "iran had a different take. president hassan rouhani, whose country was hit by round after round of damaging economic sanctions under mr. trump, said: a tyrant's era came to an end today."}
{"original": "in moscow, vladimir putin's spokesman insisted that, nothing will change for russia."}
{"original": "perhaps the most candid comment came from nicola sturgeon, the leader of the government in scotland, who said she was, very happy to say 'cheerio,' to donald trump, adding: don't haste ye back."}
{"original": "there had been suggestions that mr. trump might take post-presidential refuge at one of his golf clubs in scotland. such a visit was discouraged by sturgeon herself, and not just on coronavirus grounds."}
{"original": "but, much as a change in administration has been anticipated among america's allies and adversaries, no magic switch will be thrown that changes all the problems that have existed under — and in many cases been exacerbated by — the outgoing u.s. president."}
{"original": "there is an understanding in europe and elsewhere that there won't be a complete reversal of course in u.s. foreign policy."}
{"original": "yes, president biden said the u.s. will re-join the paris climate accords, but what does that mean? paris was a declaration of intent, and the world will be waiting to see what specific cuts in greenhouse gas emissions the biden administration will actually commit to."}
{"original": "similarly, mr. biden's team has said they'll bring the u.s. back into the iran nuclear deal, if tehran comes back into compliance. but what price might tehran demand to cut back its refinement of nuclear fuel? what expansion of that deal to curtail iran's disruptive non-nuclear activities, including the state sponsoring of terrorism, might the new administration insist on?"}
{"original": "european allies certainly expect the biden administration to reengage, to take a more cooperative approach to solving the world's biggest problems. the incoming team has clearly hinted at intentions to do just that."}

{"original": "anthony blinken, mr. biden's pick for secretary of state, has confirmed, for instance, that the u.s. embassy so controversially moved by the trump administration to jerusalem in 2017, is staying put. some of america's closest european allies were quick to condemn that move."}
{"original": "overall, america's allies are approaching the new white house with optimism, but it is optimism tempered by a wariness learned over the past four years."}
{"original": "they know that trumpism, and the 74 million americans who voted for the last president, represent a real thing, and one that isn't simply going to disappear after wednesday's swearing-in ceremony at the capitol."}
{"original": "behind every comment welcoming america back into the fold on wednesday was an unspoken worry that many in the u.s. have demonstrated a happy willingness to sit outside of that fold."}
{"original": "the hope is that the biden presidency will re-establish the post-world war ii equilibrium and commonality of purpose that bound the united states to its allies. but there are no more illusions that the bond is unbreakable."}
{"original": "amid a post-holiday wave of returns of gifts and other items purchased online, retailers are telling some customers to keep the unwanted goods while still giving back their money."}
{"original": "amazon has long offered shoppers refunds on inexpensive or bulky items, like basic yoga mats and dog food, without requiring that they physically return the goods. customers report getting refunds on all manner of low-cost items, such as napkin rings, baby bottle nipples, clocks and paperback books while still being allowed to keep the goods."}
{"original": "other retailers are following suit, weighing the cost of processing customer returns against items' resale value. often, it doesn't make financial sense to ask customers to send their purchases back."}
{"original": "retailers are reluctant to disclose their exact rules or indicate precisely what share of return-less refunds they issue so these policies aren't abused."}
{"original": "but walmart, the nation's largest retailer, uses a general formula to decide whether to allow a shopper who wants to return a product to keep it while still getting a refund, a spokesperson told cbs moneywatch. it considers a customer's purchase history, the value of the items being returned and the cost of processing the return."}
{"original": "walmart doesn't disclose its exact keep it threshold, but the spokesperson said the policy is designed to reduce the costs and environmental toll associated with returns as well as to ensure customer satisfaction."}
{"original": "a spokesperson for target also said it occasionally encourages customers to keep or donate items they don't want instead of sending them back. but the policy applies only in a very small number of cases when we determine it's easier, the spokesperson told cbs moneywatch."}
{"original": "a growing number of retailers are reconsidering their returns policies and procedures amid a boom in online shopping during the pandemic. online returns are expected to reach a record $70.5 billion for the holiday season just completed, a 73% increase from the previous five-year holiday average, according to an estimate from cbre, a commercial real estate and investment firm, and optoro, a returns technology company."}
{"original": "indeed, returns are a financial strain for many retailers, costing them on average nearly 60% of the item's original sales price, according to the report."}
{"original": "three types of expenses contribute to the cost of processing a return, according to amit sharma, founder and ceo of narvar, which processes online returns for retailers. they include shipping and transportation fees, warehousing costs and customer-service hours."}
{"original": "a retailer has to get the item back, so there is a shipping fee. when it hits the warehouse someone has to inspect the item, and customer-service agents have to field calls around, 'where is my refund, when will i get my money back?' sharma said."}
{"original": "a number of amazon customers have said they were pleased when the company told them to keep items they didn't want or no longer needed because they had arrived late."}
{"original": "dana rich, a westchester, new york, mother of two, said she tried to return probiotics for her baby she ordered on the site that were so delayed that she instead purchased the supplements at another retailer's store. amazon told her she didn't have to send the product back — and still issued her a refund, she said."}
{"original": "i've had other items arrive late that weren't pricey, and therefore i assume it wasn't worth it for them to pay for return shipping, rich said."}
{"original": "amazon didn't immediately reply to cbs moneywatch's request for comment."}
{"original": "andrew schrage, founder of personal finance site moneycrashers, described a similar experience shopping at the online retail giant. amazon recently told him to keep 25 pounds of dog food he had shipped to his home in los angeles and then tried to return. it also refunded the $22.68 purchase."}
{"original": "it makes me more confident in future purchases that i can return them if needed, or if there is an issue, it will be resolved in a customer-friendly manner, schrage said."}
{"original": "the world is watching closely as china begins investing billions of dollars into a hyper-ambitious new silk road aimed at broadening the country's financial scope and enhancing global trade. the plan is called one belt, one road and is essentially a network of land and maritime routes to improve the flow of goods and access to central asia, europe and the middle east."}
{"original": "but many people living in the region fear that china is also attempting to gain overwhelmingly political power that could threaten their current way of life."}
{"original": "beijing intends to connect more than 60 countries, with a collective population of 4.4 billion people -- more than half of the world. it's expected to spend close to a trillion dollars on the initiative, primarily focused on major infrastructure development projects including thousands of miles of railroad tracks to create routes from china all the way to western europe."}
{"original": "photojournalist davide monteleone recently produced an essay for the new yorker in which he met with locals where the routes are being developed. it's very complicated to understand how does this actually affect people's lives in the region -- in china, in khazakstan, monteleone said in an interview with cbsn. regular people don't really understand what it is. they aren't very interested in what's going to happen on a global, geopolitical level. they are more concerned about how it's going to affect their everyday life."}
{"original": "but, monteleone said, geopolitics plays a huge role in why china is pushing the project. this is the thing: it looks like an economical initiative, but in fact it is probably more of a foreign policy initiative. this is leverage china will have on countries once they start economic relations."}
{"original": "chinese officials insist the initiative is purely commercial, but foreign diplomats and political analysts also see an effort by the communist beijing government to promote its ambitions to rewrite global rules on trade and security and reduce the u.s. presence in asia."}
{"original": "diplomats have expressed concern that beijing is promoting a vision of trading networks centered on great powers such as china, which would erode the rules-based system under the world trade organization in which all competitors are treated equally."}
{"original": "president donald trump's plan to focus on domestic issues and downplay foreign affairs has given beijing an opening to try to play a bigger leadership role in trade, climate and other global issues."}
{"original": "china is the biggest trading partner for all of its asian neighbors and a growing investor. but some asian governments are uneasy about beijing's strategic ambitions, especially after it built artificial islands and military bases in the south china sea to enforce its claim to most of the region."}
{"original": "mr. trump's decision to withdraw from the trans-pacific partnership, a proposed regional trade pact, has left asian governments that want to use ties with washington to offset china's growing dominance off balance."}
{"original": "they have the strongest leader in xi jinping they've had at least since mao [zedong], eurasia group president and cbs contributor ian bremmer said in an interview with cbs this morning last week. and because the united states is america first, it's transactional. it's unilateral. it's undermining a lot of alliances. you put those things together, and suddenly you actually have a china that is willing to engage in what is increasingly a geopolitical vacuum."}
{"original": "bremmer added: in other words, this is the first time we've ever seen as u.s. leadership erodes, no one else has been standing up. now the leader of china is saying we're prepared to stand up whether it's on climate or the global economy, you know, regional security, you name it -- that's a big change for the world."}
{"original": "cupertino, california -- apple ceo tim cook defended his company's opposition to the fbi's iphone-hacking plan at its annual shareholder meeting, one day after the tech giant formally challenged a court order to help the fbi unlock an encrypted iphone used by a murderous extremist in san bernardino, california."}
{"original": "we do these because these are the right things to do, cook said in a brief reference to the company's privacy stance in the case."}
{"original": "major tech companies are also rallying to apple's cause, and now plan a joint friend of the court brief on its behalf. facebook said it will join with google, twitter and microsoft on a joint court filing. a twitter spokeswoman confirmed that plan, but said that different companies and trade associations will likely file multiple briefs."}
{"original": "federal officials have said they're only asking for narrow assistance in bypassing some of the phone's security features. but apple contends the order would force it to write a software program that would make other iphones vulnerable to hacking by authorities or criminals in the future."}
{"original": "apple filed court papers on thursday that asked u.s. magistrate sheri pym to reverse her order on the grounds that it over-reached the government's legal authority by forcing the company to weaken the security of its own products. the company accused the government of seeking dangerous power through the courts and of trampling on its constitutional rights."}
{"original": "the dispute raises broad issues of legal and social policy, with at least one poll showing 51 percent of americans think apple should cooperate by helping the government unlock the iphone."}
{"original": "but it's unclear how the controversy might affect apple's business. analysts at piper jaffray said a survey they commissioned last week found the controversy wasn't hurting the way most americans think about apple or its products."}
{"original": "at least one shareholder at friday's meeting voiced support for the company's stance."}
{"original": "apple is 100 percent correct in not providing or doing research to create software to break into it, said tom rapko, an apple investor from santa barbara, california, as he waited in line to enter the auditorium at apple's headquarters. i think if you give the government an inch, they'll take a yard."}
{"original": "the company also received support from the rev. jesse jackson and a representative from the electronic frontier foundation, an internet rights groups."}
{"original": "we applaud your leadership, jackson, a longtime civil rights leader and former adviser to martin luther king jr., told cook. i recall the fbi wiretapping dr. king in the civil rights movement, he added. we cannot go down this path again. some of us do remember the days of (former fbi director j. edgar) hoover and mccarthy and nixon and enemies lists."}
{"original": "apple's share price has seen little change since the issue erupted in the news last week. overall, though, the company's stock has declined in recent months over worries that iphone sales were slowing around the world."}
{"original": "a hearing on the iphone legal dispute is scheduled for next month."}
{"original": "for weeks, president trump cried foul, repeating unverified claims that the obama administration wiretapped trump tower to spy on him, accusations that remain unsubstantiated."}
{"original": "but mr. trump, with the power of the presidency and executive branch as a whole at his fingertips, has said little of how he intends to approach the authority he now wields over the country's surveillance policies. as developing policing technologies continue to outpace laws restricting their use, and as mr. trump and top members of his administration like attorney general jeff sessions take a hard line against illegal immigration, terrorism and crime, experts in constitutional law and civil liberties fear the lack of an accompanying conversation on privacy protections could contribute to the erosion of fourth amendment rights."}
{"original": "the fourth amendment guarantees the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures."}
{"original": "i think we will see a push from the trump administration to expand surveillance powers, and that of course could directly implicate fourth amendment protections, said christopher slobogin, a professor at vanderbilt university law school who has studied and written on fourth amendment, privacy and surveillance issues for years."}
{"original": "and they're going to push i think also for greater militarization of the police, which could affect fourth amendment issues, slobogin added."}
{"original": "the american civil liberties union is currently taking the department of justice to court to determine when the government notifies people they are under surveillance."}
{"original": "in may 2015, before announcing his bid for the presidency, mr. trump said he supported legislation allowing the national security agency (nsa) to hold bulk metadata, and later in the year reiterated he would tend to err on the side of security. on the campaign trail, and after taking office, mr. trump has emphasized the importance of bulking up police forces and eradicating terrorism. sessions fought against reforms of the foreign intelligence surveillance act (fisa) in 2012, and against limits on the nsa's spying powers."}
{"original": "it's not as though this didn't exist before trump, because it's all in this terrorism -- war on terrorism stuff, said robert bloom, a professor at boston college law school who focuses on criminal procedure and civil rights law. we've loosened up on protections of individuals. but now you've really got an abusive executive. a president and attorney general who don't really give two whits about individual protection and about the fourth amendment."}
{"original": "the white house and department of justice did not respond to requests for comment for this story."}
{"original": "guaranteeing fourth amendment rights has become increasingly complicated in the digital age. one longstanding legal theory dating to the 1970s, known as the third party doctrine, asserts that once a person gives personal information to a third party, for instance, to a cell service provider, he or she loses the expectation of privacy, and the information can be given to other entities without the person's explicit permission -- without violating the fourth amendment."}
{"original": "the obama administration placed some limitations on surveillance technology, but mostly through policy. the obama administration required the department of justice and department of homeland security to obtain warrants for the use of their 400 stingrays or cell site simulators, devices that mimic cellphone towers, so all phones within a range connect to it instead of their cellphone provider's nearest tower, and the devices collect cellphone data. the irs also acquired the technology in recent years."}
{"original": "but that's the kind of thing that jeff sessions could do away with with the stroke of a pen, said alvaro bedoya, founding executive director for the center on privacy and technology at georgetown university law center."}
{"original": "law enforcement agencies say stingray technology helps them catch suspected criminals -- and it does. but privacy advocates fear the technology's ability to collect nearby cellphone owners' data without their permission or knowledge -- and often, without a warrant -- compromises fourth amendment rights."}
{"original": "federal authorities have said the devices they use are not configured to collect the content of communications, but the capabilities of the technology aren't clear. that's partly because federal authorities have shrouded cell site simulators in mystery, sometimes dropping cases against criminal suspects rather than reveal their policing methods and agreements with private cell site simulator companies that swear the government to product secrecy in contracts."}
{"original": "the ability to put the warrant requirement through the shredder at any moment is why policy is an insufficient safeguard, said matthew feeney, policy analyst at the cato institute, a libertarian think tank."}
{"original": "we're relying heavily on government policy rather than law, and that i think is a problem, feeney said."}
{"original": "many states also use automatic license plate readers, technology that can scan hundreds of plates per minute. in the 2008 election cycle, virginia state police used automatic license plate readers on attendees' cars at political rallies for barack obama and sarah palin, the aclu revealed. alone, license plates may not amount to much information, but police have the ability to check those plates against other records, and -- over time -- can observe patterns about a driver's habits, the aclu argued."}
{"original": "meanwhile, the federal government is quietly ramping up its surveillance approach at airports, using technology that was, in most cases developed for the battlefield, bedoya said."}
{"original": "u.s. customs and border protection began testing facial recognition software -- called biometric exit -- at dulles international airport outside washington, d.c., in 2015, and pilot programs are expanding to other large airports. the software -- the concept of which was first required by bill clinton-era legislation in 1996 -- is intended to check visa holders entering or leaving the country through facial matching systems. that scan can be checked against a person's passport. as mr. trump looks to toughen immigration policies, it's a timely tool."}
{"original": "but bedoya worries the technology's use won't stop there."}
{"original": "there aren't many people talking about biometric exit, when it might fundamentally change the way we travel, bedoya said."}
{"original": "it's unlikely the technology will only be used on foreign nationals, bedoya said. many airports mix international and domestic terminals, and it's more practical and realistic to use the technology at the main transportation security administration (tsa) checkpoint, bedoya said."}
{"original": "that means you have a flow of both domestic and international travelers, bedoya said."}
{"original": "once it's in place, facial recognition software -- like other kinds of policing technology -- can be used to match other federal databases and tell a story."}
{"original": "we shouldn't forget that all of these tools can be put together, feeney said."}
{"original": "drones can be used to mount a license plate reader, feeney said. body cam footage could be linked to drone footage."}
{"original": "congress has made some efforts to strengthen privacy in recent months. in february, the house passed the email privacy act, which would require a warrant for any access to stored digital communications. but the senate has yet to take any action on it, and threats of terrorism may easily quash any momentum on similar legislation, slobogin said."}
{"original": "if we have an event like manchester in the united states -- or manchester itself -- that might push congress in the other direction, slobogin said."}
{"original": "absent much guidance from congress in the way of laws, the courts are deciding the future of surveillance as it pertains to the fourth amendment, slobogin said."}
{"original": "some of the lower courts have looked at warrants and searches and things of that nature, but the supreme court really hasn't weighed in on those kinds of issues, bloom said."}
{"original": "slowly, that's changing, as cases work their way up to the highest court in the land."}
{"original": "this year, the supreme court will decide united states v. carpenter, on whether the warrantless seizure and search of historical cell phone records revealing location and movements of a person over the course of months is constitutional."}
{"original": "that is arguably going to be the most significant fourth amendment case in decades, feeney said."}
{"original": "the third party doctrine theory needs to be grappled with significantly, and could be reviewed in that case, bloom said."}
{"original": "the lack of legal protection against an expanding availability of policing technologies may not concern law-abiding citizens, but it should, feeney said."}
{"original": "at the moment, we seem to be mostly concerned about radical islamic terrorism, feeney said."}
{"original": "maybe in 15 years it's progressives, or libertarians, pro-life people or pro-choice people, he added."}
{"original": "this, feeney said, is the fundamental question people should ask themselves: would i be happy with the state of the fourth amendment if my enemy is in charge?"}
{"original": "the fda is reportedly taking unprecedented action to try and stop the teen vaping epidemic. under the direction of the trump administration, it will likely announce a ban on mint, fruit and dessert flavored e-cigarette cartridges as soon as friday."}
{"original": "the ban reportedly will not include the sale of menthol or tobacco flavors."}
{"original": "insiders told cbs news that president trump has been hesitant to ban flavored e-cigarettes based on advice that his supporters would react negatively to it. now anti-vaping activists accuse the administration of siding with e-cigarette companies and the vaping industry."}
{"original": "matt myers heads the campaign for tobacco-free kids. he says banning flavors is good, but leaving menthol and tobacco vaping products on the market is dangerous."}
{"original": "this policy is one that was dictated by the e-cigarette industry, myers said. menthol cigarettes are used by more than half of all kids as they start a product."}
{"original": "his group says one-third of all e-cigarette users in the u.s. are middle and high school students, and 97% of kids use flavored pods."}

{"original": "whole foods' workers in many states get two paid breaks during a typical eight and a half hour shift. they'll now have 10 minutes less to rest each work day."}
{"original": "the upscale grocery chain and amazon subsidiary confirmed the new rules, saying the goal is to make break policies uniform for all its employees at 487 stores in 12 regions. workers previously had differing break times. now, the same rest- and meal-break rules will apply to all, according to the company."}
{"original": "most whole food workers will benefit from the change, according to the grocery chain."}
{"original": "this updated policy will provide the vast majority of team members with more break time throughout their work day. it is part of our ongoing work to streamline regional policies and processes in order to create clear and uniform policies for team members across all regions, a whole foods spokesperson told cbs moneywatch in an email."}
{"original": "the move comes roughly eight months after whole foods cut the extra $2 an hour in hazard pay for employees coming to work during the pandemic. amazon in june announced $500 bonuses for workers, including at whole foods."}

{"original": "doctors, lawyers, asylum-seekers and former officials are urging the trump administration to release thousands of immigrants from detention to avoid a potentially deadly coronavirus outbreak in scores of facilities across the country."}
{"original": "unless immigration and customs enforcement (ice) dramatically reduces the number of immigrants in its custody, experts warn the coronavirus could spread quickly among the roughly 37,000 detainees in the system."}
{"original": "it's a vulnerable situation, john sandweg, an acting head of ice during the obama administration, told cbs news. you have the exact situation everyone is cautioning against. you have a bunch of people contained in a very small environment."}
{"original": "can you imagine if you get an outbreak in these detention facilities? it's going to spread like wildfire, sandweg added."}
{"original": "the coronavirus pandemic has upended american life, straining the country's public health institutions and killing more than 180 people in the u.s. as the crisis has grown, ice has faced intensifying pressure to release immigrants with chronic health conditions, pregnant women, detainees over the age of 60 and those seeking humanitarian protections who don't pose a threat to public safety."}
{"original": "on wednesday, the agency announced it would stop arresting most undocumented immigrants in the u.s. who don't pose a threat to the public during the pandemic. the move is a significant shift in enforcement priorities, but doesn't address the growing calls for ice to release many immigrants."}
{"original": "ice should try to shrink this down to only those individuals to whom they can credibly say pose a threat to public safety, sandweg said. the overwhelming majority of people in ice detention don't pose a threat to public safety and are not an unmanageable flight risk."}

{"original": "dr. amy cohen, a child physiatrist who specializes in detention conditions of migrant families, said officials need to bring the detention population to the lowest level possible to reduce the risk to detainees, guards and other ice personnel. an outbreak would be nearly impossible to contain, she said."}
{"original": "one has to see these detention centers are powder kegs, cohen told cbs news. they are going to be petri dishes. they are going to be places where this virus is going to thrive and spread and where some people are going to get desperately ill — and some of those people are going to die."}
{"original": "immigration lawyers have been scrambling to file requests asking ice to release their clients, many of whom have chronic health problems. in the past few days, texas attorney lorena perez mcgill has filed four parole requests on behalf of clients detained in rural for-profit jails in louisiana, including three asylum-seekers from cuba and venezuela and a 27-year-old guatemalan migrant who recently tried to kill himself after spending nearly nine months in solitary confinement."}
{"original": "of course they are sitting ducks, perez mcgill told cbs news. it's a perfect place for any illness to breathe and to thrive. just do the math. we're talking about inadequate medical conditions."}
{"original": "carlos, 33, a cuban asylum-seeker who has been in ice custody for about 10 months, is currently detained at the private catahoula correctional center in northeastern louisiana. he said he and other immigrants at the detention center have not received any instructions related to the pandemic. access to hand soap is very limited and the sanitary conditions are subpar, he added."}
{"original": "we don't have the means here to protect ourselves. anyone can get sick here, carlos, whose name has been changed to protect his identity, told cbs news during a phone call from inside the catahoula facility. we are very exposed to any disease here."}
{"original": "ice's network of more than 200 detention centers and jails across the country forms the foundation of the multi-billion-dollar u.s. immigration detention system, the largest in the world. the agency has the capacity to detain more than 50,000 immigrants on any given day."}
{"original": "the detention centers have long been criticized for the poor medical care offered to detainees, with concerns raised not just by advocates but from within the government itself. a report by the department of homeland security inspector general last year documented inadequate medical care at some ice detention centers."}
{"original": "that criticism has intensified as president trump's administration has moved to detain asylum-seekers for longer periods of time, often in remote and private jails in the deep south with little oversight."}
{"original": "ice has confirmed eight deaths in its custody in the past six months, including three who died of serious medical conditions or complications. those eight deaths match the number of detainees who died in custody in the entirety of the 2019 fiscal year, and on wednesday, buzzfeed news reported yet another death."}
{"original": "the agency's detention centers have also been susceptible to communicable diseases. last year, the agency quarantined thousands of detainees because of outbreaks of measles, mumps and the flu."}
{"original": "in addition to their extraordinarily inadequate medical services, cohen said ice detention centers could become breeding grounds for the coronavirus because immigrants can't take the kind of precautions recommended by experts to curb its spread, like frequent hand-washing and avoiding close contact with others."}
{"original": "people are being encouraged to isolate themselves more, to be much more careful in terms of the contact that they come into with other people in other environments, cohen said. the detention population has no such power."}

{"original": "dr. david cennimo, a professor at rutgers university who specializes in infectious diseases, said detention makes it challenging for immigrants to maintain the level of personal protection recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) and other experts. many detention facilities are overcrowded, and detainees gather in communal settings for meals and recreation, he added."}
{"original": "what are we telling people right now? we're saying, 'isolate, social distance yourself, stay six feet away from everybody else, don't go out,' cennimo told cbs news. how much can you do that there?"}
{"original": "lorilei williams, a senior staff attorney at the southern poverty law center, said ice facilities are susceptible to outbreaks because they are closed environments with some contact with the outside world, not because they hold immigrants."}
{"original": "it doesn't necessarily mean that migrants are bringing covid-19 from anywhere, williams told cbs news. it's probably going to be a staff member bringing in community spread."}
{"original": "in response to the pandemic, ice said it has implemented new internal procedures, including plans to screen new detainees and isolate those with symptoms related to covid-19. the agency has also temporarily suspended visits by family members and friends at detention centers."}
{"original": "ice has yet to confirm any covid-19 cases among its tens of thousands of detainees. however, an officer at a jail in northern new jersey used by ice to detain immigrants tested positive for the virus, officials announced on thursday. later in the day, officials revealed that a medical staffer at the ice detention facility in elizabeth, new jersey had also tested positive for covid-19."}
{"original": "an ice spokesperson declined to answer directly when asked about calls to release immigrants, saying only that no announcements have been made regarding the current detainee population."}
{"original": "homero lópez, a new orleans-based attorney who represents indigent immigrants detained in louisiana, said the measures ice has announced so far are insufficient to curtail the spread of the coronavirus, especially in the detention centers where his clients are being held. responding to outbreaks in these facilities, he said, will be more difficult because of how isolated they are from major metropolitan areas with large medical institutions."}
{"original": "releasing some detainees, lópez added, is the only way to reduce the risk. but he said the administration is reluctant to do so because the government doesn't see it as the humanitarian issue he believes it is."}
{"original": "it's political and policy driven, to not release folks when they could be released, lópez told cbs news."}

{"original": "sandweg, the former ice head, said he knows what's driving the reluctance to release detainees."}
{"original": "you're kind of balancing the operational needs to frankly shrink the detention population right now — which seems like a glaring, overwhelming need to me — with the political environment of this administration not wanting to be seen as soft on immigration, he said."}
{"original": "but sandweg said shrinking the population is exactly what he would do if he still led the agency, focusing first on releasing people over the age of 65 and those with compromised immune systems. according to the cdc, older adults and those with underlying medical conditions like heart, lung and liver diseases and diabetes are at increased risk of severe illness if infected by the coronavirus. earlier in the week, the american civil liberties union asked a federal court in seattle to order ice to release a group of immigrants with health conditions."}
{"original": "sandweg said he would also look to release those who do not pose a risk to a threat to public safety, including families and asylum-seekers."}
{"original": "as of saturday, ice was detaining nearly 6,000 asylum-seekers who had passed initial fear of persecution screenings. the agency was also detaining 1,542 people at two facilities designed to hold families with children."}
{"original": "according to government statistics, more than 14,000 of the people ice is detaining have committed a crime and about 5,000 have pending charges. the rest, nearly 18,000, are being held for immigration violations and don't have criminal records. since 2017, the agency has been detaining fewer and fewer immigrants with serious criminal convictions, while the number of those who committed misdemeanors, such as unlawful entry and traffic offenses, has increased, according to data compiled by syracuse university's transactional records access clearinghouse (trac)."}
{"original": "there's a good reason to detain those who have committed violent crime, but not the rest, sandweg said, especially during a pandemic."}
{"original": "because the immigration detention system is a civil and administrative matter, ice wields the authority to release virtually everyone in its custody. that power is recognized, sandweg said, even among the most hawkish immigration policy makers or officials at ice."}
{"original": "unlike the federal bureau of prisons, ice has complete control over the release of individuals. ice is not carrying out the sentence imposed by a federal judge, he added. it has 100% discretion."}
{"original": "under federal law, detention is only mandatory for immigrants who have committed certain crimes. one of the ways ice can release people is by paroling them for humanitarian reasons or if doing so is in the public interest. they would be required to check in with ice and supervised through ankle bracelets, unannounced home visits and telephonic meetings."}
{"original": "a 2009 ice directive said asylum-seekers who entered through a port of entry should generally be paroled after establishing credible fear of persecution. but under mr. trump, parole grant rates have dramatically dropped, with the government arguing it needs to detain those with no criminal history because they pose a flight risk."}
{"original": "césar cuauhtémoc garcía hernández, an immigration scholar and author, said even immigrants deemed a flight risk should be considered for release during a global pandemic, especially those with family members in the u.s., so they can continue immigration proceedings outside of detention."}
{"original": "even if they don't show up for a court date, that's to me outweighed by the very real possibility of death or serious illness, garcía hernández said. the fewer people you have in close quarters, the better."}
{"original": "for garcía hernández, ice needs to rapidly take drastic measures as the coronavirus continues to spread throughout the u.s. as of thursday, the outbreak had killed more than 9,000 people worldwide, including more than 180 in the u.s., where there are more than 9,400 confirmed covid-19 cases."}
{"original": "i think it's only a matter of time before we see the number of confirmed cases grow exponentially across the united states, garcía hernández said. and i have no reason to believe that the ice detention centers are going to be exempt."}
{"original": "cohen, the psychiatrist, said detention centers are often portrayed as islands that are disconnected from the communities around them. but she said that's not the case, and said resources in the surrounding area are going to be zapped in the event of an outbreak, making it more difficult for communities to respond."}
{"original": "there's an intimate connection between what goes inside these facilities and what goes on in the communities around them, she said. and i think that we will see this to our serious detriment if this isn't something that is taken into consideration and dealt with now."}
{"original": "the following is a transcript of an interview with former cisa director chris krebs that aired sunday, january 10, 2021, on face the nation."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: welcome back to face the nation. for more context on some of the online discourse that fueled the assault on the capital. we want to go now to the former director of the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency, chris krebs. good to have you back with us."}
{"original": "former cisa director chris krebs: hey, good morning, margaret."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: the wall street journal has reported that the fbi and homeland security never issued a threat assessment to local law enforcement here in d.c. about what happened on wednesday ahead of time. given that there were explicit online conversations about storming the capitol, how is it possible that this was not a known threat?"}
{"original": "krebs: so, you know, i'm sure that the ensuing investigation will get to the bottom of what happened. i- i think to a certain extent we may have had some negative learning from the summer's protests and riots and maybe there was an overreaction in the wrong way that led to some of the- some of the breakdowns here. but again, there's an investigation. but to be clear, you know, we- at least when i was there, we certainly anticipated physical violence as the ultimate manifestation of the president and the campaigns' and his attorneys' and his supporters' claims that the election was rigged or stolen. and, you know, those claims continue. the latest dog whistle is election irregularities. so, those that are promoting these- this narrative, these conspiracies have to stop. they have to denounce these- these claims."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: i mean, homeland security warned back in october that right wing groups may use political rallies and they actually pose a direct threat in terms of action. but then during the black lives matter protests this summer, you know, the homeland security secretary was on this program and others touting the fact that the federal government could put federal agents in cities, whether mayors or governors wanted them there or not, that they had the power to do more. so, you know, why not do more if within the agency there were the threats that you just highlighted? whose fault is that?"}
{"original": "krebs: again, the investigations will get down to it. the- and particularly in the district of columbia, the federal authorities on federal land, like the national mall, like the capitol grounds, have even greater authorities than they would in- in any american city. so clearly, there was some sort of coordination and preplanning breakdown. you know, what i would be thinking about right now is what happens on the 20th, what are the protections that are going to be in place. but there- there is an opportunity here, i think, to- to prevent further- further bloodshed. and i don't know if the president is capable of doing it, but he has to resign. he has to tell his supporters that he lied to them, that this was all his own fraud. he has to come out. we have to set an example for the rest of the free world that attempted coups, which is what this was, will not be tolerated. and there has to be an accountability. so whether it's the 25th amendment push, whether it's an impeachment, the president needs to be held accountable for- for supporting and really inciting the activity of this past week."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: and our reporting shows that he has no intention to do that, to resign. we know, though, that he does plan, and our cbs news team is reporting, he does plan to speak tomorrow, but we're told it's going to be to blast big tech for decisions like what twitter just did to ban him. we also know apple, amazon, google, they have blocked the parler app, which is also been used as a forum to plan these kind of events. what is the impact of that?"}
{"original": "krebs: well, look, i think at this point, particularly after wednesday, the president's legacy is a heap of ashes. there's- there's nothing redeemable at this point, given the fact that he incited this attempt to overturn democracy, a fair and free election. there is an opportunity, though, for a redemption story. again, he can resign. he can tell his supporters that it was all a long- a big con and that he is sorry. i don't know if he's capable of doing it, but that's the best way to prevent further violence, to prevent further erosion of confidence in democracy over the next four years. and every single republican on the hill that continues to support these erec- election irregularities has to do the same thing. they have to denounce it and they have to come back to the middle."}
{"original": "margaret brennan: and yet, on the issue of cyber and social media, which you've spent a lot of time thinking about, a lot of conservatives are speaking out not against the president and his use of it, but against the idea that twitter is censoring somehow conservative thought. secretary of state mike pompeo, who is likely to run in 2024, is out there tweeting this is un-american and a tactic of the left. is this a free speech issue?"}
{"original": "krebs: no. the first amendment doesn't apply to private sector organizations. that's not how this works. that's government in- impeding speech and the ability to hear. and that's not what's happening here. these are companies that have their- their own ability to enforce their- their standards and their policies. i think there was a legitimate public policy interest over the last four plus years in- of maintaining the president and his voice on twitter and other platforms. but- but clearly, what is- what he has done has exceeded any reasonable public policy interest. now, the- the hard part is in implementing these standards--"}
{"original": "krebs: --globally, consistently. other foreign leaders, for instance, you know, they need to be consistent. they need to probably take similar action."}

{"original": "biden's performance in the early contests of iowa and new hampshire may be hurting him some. nearly four in 10 south carolina democrats (including most white voters) think the results of those two races make it less likely he will be the nominee. among this group of voters, sanders is the top choice and the candidate they think has the best chance of defeating mr. trump."}

{"original": "what's different this time, organizers said, is that all of the women bringing charges are represented by attorneys due to the defense fund's support. more broadly, the #metoo movement that exploded last october has emboldened more women to speak out and has prompted some employers to alter their approach to harassment, said national women's law center ceo fatima goss graves."}

{"original": "nearly 700,000 individuals are currently on daca, which was created in 2012 and can be renewed every two years. to qualify, immigrants must have entered the country by 2007 and been under age 16 when they arrived."}
{"original": "the trump administration issued an order winding down the program in 2017, but federal judges in new york, california and washington, d.c., ruled against those efforts last year and have effectively kept the program running. the administration is now seeking a supreme court review."}
{"original": "past rhodes scholars and other rhodes trust supporters are volunteering their private counsel to park in the meantime, but it's a matter of american law and not anything the rhodes trust can resolve alone, said elliot gerson, the british organization's american secretary."}
{"original": "our hope is for federal action, he added."}
{"original": "the government should enforce the law as it currently stands, to allow jin to fulfil his scholarly work, said kristian ramos, a spokesman for define american, an immigrant advocacy organization that supported park in his rhodes scholarship bid."}
{"original": "park could turn down the scholarship but has decided against that route. he wants to continue to be a voice in the immigration debate and believes the benefits of going to oxford outweigh the risks."}
{"original": "i'm looking forward to having that unstructured time to think about these broader questions of who belongs in america and the value judgments we make about others, he said."}
{"original": "park has been a vocal advocate for daca recipients since he was in high school. in 2015, he founded higher dreams, a nonprofit organization that helps students without permanent immigration status navigate the college application process."}
{"original": "with the backing of harvard, park applied for the rhodes scholarship last year as part of a broader effort to underscore how daca recipients didn't qualify for the venerated award and others like it. the scholarship was created in 1902 by british businessmen and politician cecil rhodes and provides all expenses for at least two years of study at oxford."}
{"original": "park's application - like a number of others in recent years - was rejected, but the message was received. the rhodes organization changed its policy effective this year. park re-applied and was accepted."}
{"original": "gerson said the change reflects the organization's efforts to expand eligibility. legal permanent residents and residents of u.s. territories like puerto rico have also been allowed to apply in recent years."}
{"original": "at oxford, park hopes to study migration and political theory as he weighs his future."}
{"original": "the molecular and cell biology major has also applied to medical school, but he hasn't ruled out working in city government, where he believes he can make an impact on immigration policy no matter who is in the white house."}
{"original": "and regardless what happens next, park has the conviction of knowing where home is."}
{"original": "for me, i think of queens, new york, he said. whatever happens, i'm always going to know that fact. even if i have to spend the rest of my life convincing the administration, or whoever comes next."}
{"original": "hundreds of federal employees, contractors, small-business owners and others are going online to raise money to help make ends meet amid a partial government shutdown prolonged by a impasse over president trump's demand for a wall along the u.s.-mexico border."}
{"original": "more than 700 accounts have been created on fundraising site gofundme related to the shutdown, with a total of roughly $50,000 raised so far, gofundme spokeswoman katherine cichy told cbs moneywatch in an email."}
{"original": "some of the 800,000 government employees working without pay or on furlough since the shutdown started on dec. 22, along with thousands of contract workers, are also turning to twitter using the hashtag #shutdownstories. among their most pressing financial needs are making mortgage and rent payments and taking care of basic necessities like food and diapers, according to the gofundme campaigns."}
{"original": "johanna petrocelli, a nasa safety engineer based in houston, said she was at the agency during the 2013 government shutdown and saw people struggling to get by. this time around, petrocelli, 26, has some savings as well as financial support from her family. but she wanted to do something for her colleagues and co-workers who don't have that kind of support. so she set up a gofundme page."}
{"original": "they don't spend beyond their means"}
{"original": "these aren't people who are irresponsible or haven't saved for emergencies or spend beyond their means, the description for her page, feds who want to help, reads. they're highly educated people who work at nasa. people with phds in astrophysics from mit, flight controllers who keep the international space station and astronauts safe day after day. they're also janitors, administrative assistants, facility maintenance, and security guards who work long hours for very little pay."}
{"original": "shutdowns can also create bureaucratic messes that lead to unexpected consequences. for instance, some new hires haven't received their first paycheck, so they don't have proof of employment to help get an apartment, petrocelli noted."}
{"original": "there's women who are sole providers for their family. the janitorial staff is contract and on furlough and probably won't get paid beyond their contract dates. i want to do what i can, petrocelli said."}
{"original": "julie burr, a contract worker with the department of transportation in kansas city, missouri, said on her gofundme page that she is losing pay every day the shutdown continues. i've taken on extra shifts at my 2nd job but it isn't going to pay rent and all my bills. being a single mom, i'm in panic mode right now."}
{"original": "to guard against scams, gofundme set up a team to review shutdown campaigns using proprietary technical tools and multiple processes to verify organizers and beneficiaries, cichy said. before money is transferred, gofundme's payment processor also verifies an individual's information, including banking details, she said."}
{"original": "gofundme also guarantees donations. if funds are misused as determined in our sole discretion, gofundme will pay up to $1,000 per donor per campaign, according to the company's policy."}
{"original": "tyler fralia, a tax examining technician at the irs in ogden, utah, had some savings until the cost of replacing old tires on the family car drained his account. his wife was on unpaid maternity leave to take care of now six-month old luke, leaving the family without much of a financial net. he's now searching for temporary work, and has looked into part-time jobs at domino's and uber,"}
{"original": "in the meantime, fralia has set up a page on gofundme. as of tuesday night it had yielded about $250. that helps, but it's not even a car payment, he said."}
{"original": "although his wife is back at work, fralia, 28, still worries about the mortgage. and when he's called back to the irs later this month as the agency promises to begin processing taxes on jan. 28, it might still be without pay."}
{"original": "we want to go back to work, fraila said. americans entrust irs workers to do their job, he said. it's all we want."}

{"original": "washington — the attack on the capitol a week ago has left lawmakers with a heightened sense of vulnerability about their own security — and fresh questions about whether their own leaders and the u.s. capitol police are adequately equipped to handle those concerns."}
{"original": "the sense of unease has been heightened by president-elect joe biden's inauguration next week. the capitol police have erected a fence around the capitol, and the national guard is now planning to bring 20,000 troops to washington — an increase of 5,000 from earlier plans, according to a defense department official."}
{"original": "but members of congress have not been advised on how they should plan to enter the capitol security perimeter if there are large crowds gathered outside the fence."}
{"original": "one house democrat questioned the current policy for guests at the inauguration, which allows members to be accompanied by one person but does not require them to submit the name of the guest for any list or background check. guests will only need a paper ticket issued by the joint inaugural committee to enter the building."}
{"original": "there are also no rules in place about whether members or their guests will be allowed to carry guns at the inauguration, a debate that arose when another member attending monday's briefing asked whether a personal security guard could come as a guest — and whether that security guard could carry a gun."}
{"original": "one person's personal security is another person's proud boy, the member said."}
{"original": "a security briefing monday night by the u.s. capitol police left attendees gravely concerned about their safety as they learned about threats of armed militias plotting to surround the capitol and kill democrats in order to install republicans in power."}
{"original": "there is no way in god's green earth there are no threats leading up to january 6, and now it's like every organized militia creates in a period of three days a plan to descend upon the capitol, one house democrat told cbs news. the intelligence failure leading up to the sixth is absolutely undeniable."}
{"original": "adding to members' concerns is the fact that at least two members of the capitol police have been suspended in the wake of the riots — one for taking a selfie with people breaking into the capitol; another for donning a make america great again hat and providing directions. there are also 10 to 15 other investigations that are ongoing."}
{"original": "we can't have a democracy if too many members of our police force and our military are acting to overturn it and undermine it, congresswoman mikie sherrill, a new jersey democrat, told constituents in a facebook livestream tuesday night. she also accused other members of leading reconnaissance tours on the day before the rioting on january 6."}
{"original": "sherrill has not answered subsequent questions about which members she saw but vowed, i'm going to see that they're held accountable, and if necessary, ensure that they don't serve in congress."}
{"original": "lawmakers and their staff used to feel relatively safe inside the capitol, but last week changed that."}
{"original": "the idea that everyone is untouchable? no, we're all touchable now. if there's a nuclear bomb, we accept we're probably the first to go. but we never though that a mob would be able to get into the capitol, a house staff member said. people are scared that more things will happen before the 20th. people who have been up here for 20 years — even since 9/11 — have never been this scared."}
{"original": "the democratic house member added that the failures on january 6 have prompted questions about the inauguration security plan and also worried that some house leaders hold the misguided belief that those who are planning new attacks on the capitol will simply stop trying once president trump leaves office."}
{"original": "there is a level of naivete that exists within house leadership where they don't see what a threat this is, the lawmaker told cbs news."}
{"original": "house republicans, meanwhile, have already begun to chafe at some of the new additional security measures, including the installation of magnetometers outside the house chamber. in the past, lawmakers have enjoyed deference on security matters and have only been required to wear their congressional pins to get into the house chamber and bypass magnetometers at the doors of the capitol and house office buildings."}
{"original": "illinois congressman rodney davis, the top republican on the house administration committee, which oversees capitol hill housekeeping issues including the capitol police, called the move political correctness run amok at a capitol police briefing tuesday evening."}
{"original": "the threat is outside, not inside. every resource used inside is one that can't be used outside, he said."}
{"original": "several republicans reportedly refused to go through the magnetometers at house votes tuesday evening, and the number two house republican, whip steve scalise of louisiana, had a heated exchange with officers stationed outside the house chamber, asking, you're impeding the ability of members to come and vote?...this was never discussed."}
{"original": "a house democrat said the fact that members of congress are given deference on such measures makes members less safe."}
{"original": "the power dynamic with members of congress is so detrimental to our own security, the lawmaker said."}
{"original": "beyond the security failures on january 6, other lawmakers have raised concerns about the disparity in treatment between the overwhelmingly white rioters that day compared to peaceful black lives matter protesters who demonstrated last summer in response to george floyd's death."}
{"original": "i thought for sure that we would see at least the kind of presence we saw during the black lives matter administration when the building was protected from peaceful protesters, house majority whip jim clyburn, the highest-ranking african american official in congress, told reporters last week. i want to emphasize that peaceful demonstrators, people who came in peace, not bringing molotov cocktails…came to peacefully protest. and yet, the capitol building was wrong with all kinds of shows of force."}
{"original": "ohio democrat tim ryan, who oversees the house subcommittee that funds the capitol police, also said there had been a much larger police presence ahead of the protests over the summer."}
{"original": "just being candid, if there were black people out there i think there would have been a much different response in what they did and so that to me was very, very frustrating, he told reporters."}
{"original": "the congressional black caucus convened a hearing wednesday about the white supremacy that was on display in last week's attacks. black lives matter and other civil rights leaders were invited to testify."}
{"original": "at this point, the caucuses representing black, hispanic and asian-american members of congress have not had a collective discussion around disparities in treatment by the capitol police or diversity within the organization itself."}
{"original": "one congressional source didn't want to put the cart before the horse and wanted to see what the investigation bears before recommending reforms, but at the same time acknowledged some members are concerned and the issue could be addressed in the future."}
{"original": "those who were calling the shots...were certainly unprepared and underprepared and that was not acceptable, congressional black caucus chair representative joyce beatty told cbs news."}
{"original": "the capitol police is now under the command of its first black leader. yogananda pittman is serving as the acting chief after former chief steven sund resigned following the january 6 attacks. the department faces some of the same diversity challenges as other police departments nationwide. while it does not publish diversity statistics, the capitol police have faced multiple lawsuits brought by black officers alleging discrimination."}

{"original": "in this episode of intelligence matters, host michael morell speaks with dr. ken wickiser, a biochemist and associate dean of research at u.s. military academy west point, about his piece engineered pathogens and unnatural biological weapons: the future threat of synthetic biology. wickiser describes the growing influence of synthetic biology and what can happen if it gets in the wrong hands."}
{"original": "what is synthetic biology? synthetic biology is the process of engineering natural genetic systems. in terms of engineering: taking what nature has provided us and optimizing it, co-opting it, repurposing it, making it more efficient, and making it more cost effective. in large part for good purposes, to make new and novel biomaterials, to make new and novel pharmaceuticals. to make existing pharmaceuticals cheaper, more abundant, more available for the population."}

{"original": "michael morell: this discussion will be part of a series of episodes that we're doing between now and the inauguration on the key national security issues facing the united states. i'll let our listeners know this one is going to be a bit scary. you and your colleagues wrote a paper published in august that caught my attention. it was published by the combating terrorism center at west point, which is one of the best-known counterterrorism think tanks in the world. your piece was titled engineered pathogens and unnatural biological weapons: the future threat of synthetic biology which is what i really want to dig into today with you. but before we do that, i wanted to give you an opportunity to mention the other authors of the piece because there were quite a few."}
{"original": "dr. ken wickiser: absolutely. thank you for allowing me that opportunity. this was a team effort. one of the great things about west point is that we have a really great combination of both active duty military and the government civilian faculty and staff here in our effort to help develop the next generation of army leaders. my colleagues on this particular paper include colonel john burpo, who has a ph.d. from mit in bioengineering, lieutenant colonel michael washington, who has a ph.d. in microbiology from the uniformed services university of health sciences, dr. kevin o'donovan, who is a title 10 government civilian and the deputy director of the life science program here at west point, his ph.d. is in neuroscience from johns hopkins university. we also have a returning active military officer, lieutenant colonel, who is now getting his ph.d. at at boston university. we have a group of people who are not only subject matter experts, but they are people who have operational experience. they have operational experience in the military, or in both government and in the civilian academic labs across the united states. we took a holistic view of this in the context of what do our cadets really need to know about this technology? the point here was not to be scared, but to be prepared and understand from a holistic standpoint what synthetic biology is, where it could go, and what we need to be concerned about."}
{"original": "michael morell: what is synthetic biology?"}
{"original": "dr. ken wickiser: that's a great question, because it depends on who you ask. in the broadest interpretation, synthetic biology is the process of engineering natural genetic systems. in terms of engineering: taking what nature has provided us and optimizing it, co-opting it, repurposing it, making it more efficient, and making it more cost effective. in large part for good purposes, to make new and novel biomaterials, to make new and novel pharmaceuticals. to make existing pharmaceuticals cheaper, more abundant, more available for the population. synthetic biology has been around for a long time, but it's really increased in its prevalence and its significance since the genomic age. its prevalence increased since we really understood the nature of dna and have been able to catalogue the structure of dna and how genomes in particular are organized: the controlling components, the parts that make proteins, the parts that serve as stoplights or speed bumps along the way."}
{"original": "michael morell: can you explain the concept of modularity and why that's important to synthetic biology?"}
{"original": "dr. ken wickiser: i think most people understand if you take a look at an electronic circuit, there's parts that go into the electronic circuit and you have a resistor here that gets set aside, a capacitor over there. you can construct very complicated machinery with some very simplistic parts. if you take that viewpoint of how perhaps a genome is organized, you have this long strand of dna and embedded within that dna are the instructions for certain proteins. some proteins are going to be turned on all the time. some proteins are going to be turned on only some of the time. sometimes there's an age or development aspect to it. in terms of modularity, what we're focused on is being able to lift that one segment of dna out of one particular organism and place it in a completely different novel context, in a completely different organism, and yet have it work. perhaps not in the way that nature intended, but in the way that you, as the bioengineer, intends for it to function. that's really what we talk about when we use the term modularity is that drag and drop, cut and paste, lift and shift, mentality when you think about engineering dna and engineering genomes."}
{"original": "michael morell: can you talk about the good uses that synthetic biology can do for mankind? your piece was about a potentially bad use. i'd love for you to talk about that from the 50,000 foot level."}
{"original": "dr. ken wickiser: synthetic biology is a tool just like a hammer. you can use it for good or you can use it for nefarious purpose. we are typically in academia focused on the good. that's the whole point of going through a phd program, learning about how to better mankind in terms of novel materials, novel pharmaceuticals, and understanding the basic machinery of biology so that we can take care of ourselves just that much better."}
{"original": "michael morell: we can cure diseases that we've never been able to cure before."}
{"original": "dr. ken wickiser: absolutely. we're certainly on the cusp of that. if you take a look at it from the other vantage point, if you understand biology, if you understand this network of small molecules and genes and environmental influences, then you can disrupt that. not only for good, but perhaps for bad. what we're trying to do here is just to call attention to this tool and to bring this to the attention of developing leaders, saying 'look, you have to take this into account when developing plans for security and for operations.' we have to understand what might happen out there if technology falls into the into the wrong hands, the hands of someone who is trying to do harm to others. in our case, we're concerned about americans. we're concerned about the american military in particular. we in no way, shape, or form want to disparage or undermine the support that synthetic biology has in the community. we value it. we use it every day in our labs here at west point. it's used across the world, in labs, in industry, academia, government labs, all the way down even to high school labs. but i do think that we need to understand that the bar has been lowered in terms of being able to produce something that other people haven't thought of. if that something happens to be perhaps negative in nature. we need to be prepared for that."}
{"original": "michael morell: what is the risk here? what is the threat?"}
{"original": "dr. ken wickiser: what we're concerned about is the production of either small molecules or gene products that could be used in a way that is a negative influence on someone's health. whatever you can consider in your mind, is probably capable of being produced out there in the synthetic biology."}
{"original": "michael morell: so we are talking about a bioweapon here, right?"}
{"original": "dr. ken wickiser: we are talking about bioweapons. whether you talk about a material or something that happens to be infectious, that's just different levels of threat."}
{"original": "michael morell: can you talk about the concept of binary weapons and why that's important in the context of what we're talking about here?"}
{"original": "dr. ken wickiser: if you were able to take two different chemicals, each of them inert, very stable. but then when you mix them, they become robust, explosive, that would be considered a binary weapon. so you need both components in order to have that weapon. so biology could be the same thing. if i have protein x, that happens to be a poison, i could cut that in half in two different segments and have a gene product in one organism, and the gene product in another. i could produce a considerable amount of each one of those subcomponents to the poison and then mix these two together and develop that active poison for nefarious purposes. likewise, if these two gene products happen to be housed in prokaryotes and bacteria, i could mix these together. under favorable conditions, they could exchange genetic material and the product could be one single organism that is producing an intact product. so you have both of those halves that can come together and form that particular poison. when we talk about a binary weapon, most people think about it in terms of chemical or mechanical means. but the analogy holds when you talk about biological macromolecules."}
{"original": "michael morell: what i'm thinking is this is the biological equivalent of al-qaida trying to bring on chemicals to those 10 to 15 aircraft flying from heathrow. chemicals that were inert separate, but when you put them on the plane and mix them together, all of a sudden, they became an explosive."}
{"original": "dr. ken wickiser: unfortunately, science goes hand in hand with creativity and curiosity. it really comes down to someone with nefarious purpose, having creativity mixed in with some scientific capability that allows them to produce something that is going to be of significant concern."}
{"original": "michael morell: what's the range of risk here from the least dangerous bioweapon to the most dangerous bioweapon in terms of what synthetic biology could produce?"}
{"original": "dr. ken wickiser: part of this is fear. and then part of it is the physical infectivity that a substance might have. or an organism might have an entity. i use those terms very broadly because it's arguable whether one calls a virus alive. because it doesn't in and of itself have the machinery required for self replication, it requires the host to hijack and and replicate itself. but ignoring that distinction is something that is going to have that very careful balance in between lethality and infectivity across a particular population. if something was so incredibly deadly that it's going to hamstring itself in terms of being able to pass that on to the next host, then that's going to tend to die out faster than something that has that careful balance. that something is likely a virus. it could be an engineered virus. it can be microbes, living systems, small individual cells that produce toxins."}
{"original": "whether you think about something that's endemic across humankind, like e. coli, without having that one genetic switch that'll change it into something that's virulent. but you can think about something that is genetically engineered like a virus. knowing that we use this for good, it can also be used for bad. for example, in 2011 dutch scientists wanted to create a virus and see what mutations were required in order to make it more aerosolized. they did this and they were frightened that it took so few mutations in order to make something that was very dangerous into something that was incredibly deadly. there was a large public outcry. people came back and said, 'you should not even publish this.' there was a lot of ethical considerations that went into the sharing of those data and the publication of that particular work. they used natural selection in the context of the lab in order to generate those five mutations. now it's known that the information can be used by people to engineer a particular protein in the context of dna and have that produced by any dna synthesis companies. some of them are american, but many of them are outside the continental united states. it's that information that allows us and empowers someone with nefarious purpose to use synthetic biology for their ends."}
{"original": "michael morell: in the paper, you and your co-authors give some examples of where this has already been done. can you describe very briefly a couple of those? the first was work done in 2002 by scientists at the state university of new york at stony brook on the polio virus."}
{"original": "dr. ken wickiser: it's always been a goal for someone to build a genome from scratch. the question is, using state of the art chemical synthesis tools, can you construct something that is functional? that is really where that effort was born. it spawned several other efforts that eventually led up to the idea could you actually create a living cell from scratch?"}
{"original": "it goes hand in hand with what do you actually need for a living system. what can you throw away? if you take out of a car every bit that you don't need for it to run. seat warmers etc. that's what has been a major goal in synthetic biology efforts across the globe, because once you have that minimal structure, that biological scaffold, you can then add in whatever you want and and it's less of a load. for example, if you and i are going on a run. if you add a large backpack onto yourself, it's going to be much more exerting. the same thing happens when you engineer a small microbe. you increase the metabolic load and slow it down. but if you can get rid of all the non essential requirements, then when you actually load it up with that new system, then you will have a biological system that is not going to be loaded down as much of a natural one."}
{"original": "that's been the progression, going from the construct of a virus to the construct of an actual living cell. another piece that we really wanted to bring up here is, on the good part. we have these amazing contests, international genetically engineered machine contests born out of mit. you have this incredibly rich international group of young men and women. primarily it was college students. recently, they've lowered the bar of entry because so many young high school students are really interested in this work. in 2019 there was three hundred and sixty teams from across the world. about 50 percent of them came from asia. about 20 percent were from north america. there was about one quarter of the teams that were from the high school level. about 65 percent of them are from asia, predominantly they're from china. the great thing about synthetic biology is that there are no borders. then again, that applies to the context of threat, to the context of force protection amongst the american population and the dod. there might be something here of concern."}
{"original": "michael morell: then no borders become a bad thing. it's this interesting dichotomy. you just raised an issue that caught my attention. when people used to ask me about this threat, i would say, 'yes, terrorist groups have shown interest, but doing this is very, very difficult.' one of the things that really jumped out to me in your article is that this is getting easier and easier."}
{"original": "let me read a few sentences. 'the sophistication of high school and undergraduate student research projects has matched that of many highly trained personnel who are working in advanced laboratories less than a decade ago.' the second is 'these synthetic bio tools are lowering the education, training, cost, time and equipment threshold required to modify and employ pathogenic organisms as biologic weapons.'"}
{"original": "talk about the extent to which this is getting easier and obviously why that's important."}
{"original": "dr. ken wickiser: let's take a look at the igem organization. i'm a huge fan. i participated in it for many years. they have a biosafety and security committee. they're very much attuned to the potential misuse. outside of the context of a competition, going into perhaps non-state actors who have ill intent toward the united states, you say 'if high school students can do this across asia, across europe, across the united states, then take that threat scenario and apply that to something chemical or nuclear. you're not going to have high school students making the next generation nuclear weapon. but one of the amazing things about science is we're all about sharing information. we're all about publishing, we're all about planting your flag and generating bragging rights about these great advances that we make. but that also provides a great recipe for that next person."}
{"original": "that next person can certainly be a young individual that does not have decades of experience in laboratories. he or she can essentially do garage level science that in the past would have taken a lot of people a long time in sophisticated labs. going back to our polio example, how long did that take these experts in the stony brook lab? how many years was that? how many millions of dollars was spent on that? whereas when you talk about a young team of students, this is on the thousands of dollars scale."}
{"original": "if they needed ten thousand dollars worth of materials, that's highly attainable for a lot of people. these materials then really comes down to synthetic dna, dna that has been produced by chemically synthesizing them in a facility. these facilities are all across the world. they're all across the united states. they're all across europe, but they're all across asia as well. honestly, when i have a gene synthesized or when i have a plasmid, which is a small circular chunk of dna that has many different genes embedded within it, if i have that synthesized and i want to pay someone three thousand dollars to do that, it will probably be subcontract out to china. that's where the materials are coming from. when you talk about the sharing of materials, there's high levels of access for anybody throughout the world. this is not just something that is available to american students or postdocs or professors in american universities. this is available worldwide."}
{"original": "there are no boundaries when it comes to information. there are no boundaries when it comes to science, and there's certainly no boundaries when it comes to scientific expertise and interest. there is such an enormous level of interest coming out of asia, particularly china. it's something to consider when thinking about where synthetic biology could go, not only for the good, but potentially for the bad."}
{"original": "michael morell: in your article, you and your co-authors push back on those who say that making bioweapons is much too difficult for a non-professional. you use two metaphors. can you share those?"}
{"original": "dr. ken wickiser: twenty years ago, i would have said, 'yes, they're absolutely right, the bar is way too high.' 10 years ago, i would have said, 'yeah, sure, it's a little bit lower, but that's going to be a tough ask.' but today, it's just really not. if you go back to some of the examples we used in the paper, our home pc example. when i was young, i vividly remember my very first apple computer. seeing that at a college. it was almost like a museum where i was looking behind the glass, not allowed to touch it. today look where we have gone. along with moore's law. this has just exploded in terms of technology where people now have the ability to customize their entire home and have that controlled by a cell phone."}
{"original": "you have moore's law that has been allowing us via the increased computational power to do so many amazing things that we just couldn't have dreamed of 20, 30 years ago. biology and our understanding of biology has followed a similar path. there's been an absolute explosion in our understanding of what a gene is, how to control a gene, how to get these genes from one context and put them into another."}
{"original": "it comes down to being able to design this online. you can do genetic engineering right from your phone. you can purchase dna on the spot. at the end of the purchasing process, there's a little form to sign that says 'is this a poison, yes or no? can this impact human health? yes or no?' it really comes down to you as the purchaser being honest. we have this incredible capability in biology. yet the controls haven't caught up to that yet, whereas perhaps controls in electronic means have. that's because to the regular nonscientist the capabilities and limitations of electronics are a lot more understandable compared to that of biology."}
{"original": "michael morell: in terms of your concerns about this, it sounds like it's primarily non-state actors, terrorist groups rather than states. is that fair to say?"}
{"original": "dr. ken wickiser: that's absolutely fair to say. at the end of the day, both russia and china have incredibly robust scientific programs. the united states has taken steps after the fall of the soviet union to provide scientists from the former soviet union opportunities to engage in science for the benefit of mankind by setting up laboratories in countries like georgia. but our concern here is the lowering of that bar and allowing for the ability for an untrained group of people to develop something that might negatively impact human health."}
{"original": "michael morell: let me read two more sentences from your article. the first sentence is, 'as molecular engineering techniques of the synthetic biologists become more robust and widespread, the probability of encountering one or more of these threats is approaching certainty.' the second is 'the change to the threat landscape created by these techniques is rivaled only by the development of the atomic bomb.' those are two pretty significant sentences, so what do we do about this? what's the right policy response? how do we defend ourselves?"}
{"original": "dr. ken wickiser: i go back to say the igem field. they are very much interested in biosecurity and infusing the thought of biosecurity in these young budding scientists. whether they be americans or people from foreign countries. but we also have in the united states several organizations dedicated to biosecurity, including the defense threat reduction agency and their chemical biological defense division. the entire research there is a lead by dr. ronald han, and he has an amazing portfolio. they are very dedicated to addressing this field. there's barta. there's darpa. darpa has several different programs that are addressing the potential threat of synthetic biology, whether it be a normal genetic engineering or the whole crispr effort. that has really exploded the field over the past several years. so we do have organizations, whether they be private, non-profits, or governmental organizations that are addressing this. i think it's probably incumbent upon us to weave this into the educational experience of young people. whether we're talking about budding scientists or people who are interested in ethics or people who are interested in economics. we need people to understand the benefits of synthetic biology and the potential threats. that way we can develop common sense policies that will allow the science to progress, will allow us to benefit from the development of the science, but at the same time assure our safety."}
{"original": "michael morell: thank you so much for joining us. thank you for your service to our country, which continues to this very day. and in educating the young women and young men who will lead the united states army in the future."}
{"original": "the government shutdown became the longest in american history overnight, leaving 800,000 federal employees furloughed or working without pay. federal workers received $0 pay stubs on friday, their first pay day covering the shutdown period."}
{"original": "in light of the struggles federal employees may be having in trying to live without pay, the capital area food bank (cafb) says it is holding five free pop-up markets in the washington, d.c. area, which has the highest concentration of federal workers in the country. it says the markets are being held in giant stores in virginia, washington and maryland, offering fresh produce and shelf-stable food items for the first 250 federal workers who arrive between 9 a.m. and 12 p.m. saturday."}
{"original": "the cafb published a blog post describing efforts by volunteers to prepare for the pop-up food banks, describing the efforts of 80 volunteers packing 30,000 pounds of produce for the pop-up markets, including assistance from some federal workers."}
{"original": "i need the extra help right now, pamela leftrict, a policy analyst with the epa, told cafb. this is a scary time for me, especially because i have a child at home. volunteering makes me feel like i'm contributing, like i'm giving something back for what i receive. she also said that she was telling federal workers in need who may be unwilling to accept help that this is not your fault."}
{"original": "free groceries aren't all that's being provided for federal workers. sweetgreen and &pizza in washington, d.c., are offering free meals for federal workers between certain times, and all restaurants by celebrity chef jose andres in the city are providing free sandwiches for any federal employee with id, according to patch."}
{"original": "some museums and parks are also offering free admission or discounts to federal employees, including the newseum and montgomery's parks. they can also get free movie tickets from alamo drafthouse in the month of january, and free gw basketball tickets. some gyms are also offering free classes."}

{"original": "the afghan war has cost america 2,400 lives and a trillion dollars, but 16 years later, the country's capital may be at its most dangerous. the threat of roadside bombs is so high, u.s. personnel must fly the two miles from kabul's airport to their headquarters. as costly as america's longest war has been, to fail in its mission there would be even costlier says the u.s. commanding officer in afghanistan, gen. john nicholson. lara logan interviews nicholson and afghan president ashraf ghani, for a report on the war in afghanistan to be broadcast on 60 minutes, sunday, jan. 14 at 7:00 p.m., et/pt."}
{"original": "logan and crew under heavy security toured the inner city of kabul, where they encountered a maze of protective checkpoints and concrete blast walls. 21 international terrorist groups are operating in this country, says president ghani. dozens of suicide bombers are being sent. there are factories…producing suicide bombers. we are under siege. and conditions of siege require protective responses."}
{"original": "the protection is nearly all paid for by american taxpayers, who foot 90-percent -- more than 4 billion a year -- of the afghan military budget. we will not be able to support our army for six months without u.s. support, and u.s. capabilities, ghani tells logan."}
{"original": "the airport road is so vulnerable to bombings, u.s. and allied personnel are shuttled from the airport by helicopter. logan observes that this maneuver could be considered ceding territory to the enemy. not so says nicholson. i disagree. i think it's answering our moral imperative to protect the lives of our soldiers and civilians. so that's what we do."}
{"original": "the u.s. began the war in afghanistan as part of a response to the foreign terrorists who attacked the u.s. on 9/11. when logan points out that americans are now more afraid of domestic terrorists, the general says all the more important to beat islamic militant terror wherever it is. we need to defeat the ideology, says nicholson. if we were to lose here or if we were to leave here, the cost would be unacceptable. why? it would embolden jihadists globally, those living in our own countries…in my view the cost of failure here is unacceptable."}
{"original": "president trump shares nicholson's view. president obama announced a withdrawal date and began drawing down troops before he left office. mr. trump gave nicholson 3,000 more troops and a change in policy the general says will help him kill more taliban leaders. yes, this is the end game. this is a policy that can deliver a win, says nicholson."}
{"original": "it's a technological miracle of sorts -- actors seemingly performing from beyond the grave. how do they do it? call it a double take, as david pogue of yahoo tech found out:"}
{"original": "the new star wars movie, rogue one, was a big hit at the box office. exciting story, thrilling effects, and gifted actors -- including one who's been dead for over 20 years."}
{"original": "that's right: british actor peter cushing was there, reprising his role as grand moff tarkin, even though he passed away in 1994."}
{"original": "actor guy henry performed the new scenes, and then the oscar-nominated special effects engineers replaced his face with peter cushing's."}
{"original": "and how did the computer know exactly what peter cushing's face looked like, down to the tiniest detail? that's where paul debevec comes in."}
{"original": "debevec invented the light stage, which sits at his office at the institute for creative technologies, at the university of southern california."}
{"original": "surrounded by more than 10,000 leds, the subject is photographed with about 20 high-quality dslr cameras, producing a series of high-resolution photos from different angles to reconstruct a 3-d model of the subject's face."}
{"original": "more than a hundred famous actors have stood on this spot to be scanned for movies, including angelina jolie, tom cruise, brad pitt, sigourney weaver and duane johnson."}
{"original": "once an actor has been scanned into the light stage, engineers can digitally insert him or her into scenes, even if that actor is unavailable, much older or younger, or deceased. that's how actor paul walker was able to appear in fast and furious 7, even though he died partway into filming."}
{"original": "debevec said, we'll have the actor make a succession of about 50 different facial expressions. and that produces all of the different motions of their face. but we also can record a facial performance from all these different angles, and then create a digital performance of that character that does exactly what they did in the video."}
{"original": "the light stage might have cost several million dollars 10 years ago. but today, you can build a person-scanning setup with parts you pick up at the hardware store."}
{"original": "just ask ari shapiro. he runs the character animation and simulation research group at the usc. he's been developing a human scanning system that uses one hundred $20 cameras, sewn into a shower curtain purchased at home depot. the subject steps into the shower and presto!"}

{"original": "but here's the thing: it's fine to create virtual clones of people as long as everybody knows it's for entertainment purposes. but how long will it be before someone tries to pass it off as reality?"}
{"original": "pogue said, let's say i decide to make a presidential candidate do something heinous and i release that as news. is that plausible?"}
{"original": "i think it's not only plausible, i think that there are definitely people in various countries that are working on exactly that, said todd richmond, the director of the mixed reality lab at usc's institute for creative technologies -- and a man who thinks a lot about the implications of digital clones."}
{"original": "should the government be involved? should there be a new bureau of digital ethics? i think artists should have a place at the table, richmond said. technologists and practitioners need to be at the table because they're the ones who are knee-deep in the goo of this stuff. politicians have to have some understanding of this, because invariably, policy will need to be made to address this."}
{"original": "according to richmond, it's past time for us to consider the very real power of make-believe people."}

{"original": "is it safe to come out now?"}
{"original": "the stock market has found firmer footing following its breathtaking drop earlier this month, when the s&p 500 lost 10.2 percent in just nine days. stocks climbed tuesday for the third straight day, and the s&p 500 is now down 7.3 percent from its record high, set on jan. 26."}
{"original": "but investors have seen this playbook before. even in past recoveries, it has sometimes taken months or more for momentum to fully turn around."}
{"original": "here's a look at what history shows about past corrections, and what market watchers are expecting going forward."}
{"original": "q: how bad was this market drop?"}
{"original": "a: drops of 10 percent or more for stocks are regular occurrences but the speed with which this last correction struck was unusual. only 19 times since world war ii has the s&p 500 lost at least 10 percent in 10 days or fewer, according to strategists at ubs."}
{"original": "besides this month's sell-off, those rapid retreats include a drop in august 2015 sparked by worries about slowing economic growth for china and a plunge in august 2011 after the u.s. credit rating got downgraded from aaa and worries about europe's debt crisis were near their peak."}
{"original": "q: what happened after the last such corrections?"}
{"original": "in august 2015, the s&p 500 lost 11.1 percent in six days. that was followed by two straight days of big gains, each at least 2.4 percent, a sign that the worst could be over."}
{"original": "but stocks ended up bobbing higher and lower for months. the market recovered all its losses by november, only to fall back into correction territory again by the ensuing january. it took 15 months for the index to climb 5 percent above where it was when the august 2015 slide began."}
{"original": "after the 2011 correction, where the s&p 500 fell 11.2 percent in three days, it took nearly three months for the index to claw back all its losses."}
{"original": "q: before this month's drop, analysts were saying the stock market was expensive. is it cheap now?"}
{"original": "a: it's cheaper, but not necessarily cheap."}
{"original": "analysts look at several measures to gauge how expensive stocks are, and many of these measures are lower than they were a couple weeks ago but still above their long-term averages."}
{"original": "the s&p 500 trades at 16.8 times its expected earnings over the coming 12 months, for example. that's a more attractive price-earnings ratio than the 18.6 it sported when the index set its record on jan. 26. but it remains more expensive than its median of 14.8 over the last 15 years."}
{"original": "back in 2009, i knew that it couldn't go much lower because i'd never in my life seen valuations as good as they were, but we're not at that point yet, said david brown, chief market strategist at sabrient systems."}
{"original": "q: so, is this most recent correction all over?"}
{"original": "a: in truth, no one knows. but many market pros say that they're confident the stock market will recover and eventually reach new heights. they don't see this as another market catastrophe like the great recession, which caused stock funds to lose half their value."}
{"original": "i think the big one will come at some point, but typically to get a sustained drawdown you have to have a recession, said brad mcmillan, chief investment officer at commonwealth financial network. we're not looking like we'll have one of those for at least six months."}
{"original": "plus, corporate earnings are going up. that helps make the market look less expensive. a stock's price-earnings ratio can go down in two ways: either its price falls, or earnings rise. both seem to be occurring now."}
{"original": "a little more than two thirds of the companies in the s&p 500 index have reported how much they earned in the last three months of 2017, and they're on pace to show growth of 14 percent from a year earlier, according to s&p global market intelligence."}
{"original": "q: what could trip things up?"}
{"original": "a: the threat of higher inflation — and of the federal reserve jacking up interest rates quickly in response — is what triggered this most recent sell-off."}
{"original": "that's why wednesday's report on the consumer price index is circled on traders' calendars. if inflation proves to be higher than the market expects, it could trigger another sell-off in bonds that carries over into the stock market."}
{"original": "other highlighted events include feb. 28, when fed chairman jerome powell will deliver a report on monetary policy to the house of representatives, and march 21, when powell is scheduled to hold a press conference following the fed's next policy-making meeting."}
{"original": "a: no. some skeptics say they would feel more comfortable if stocks had fallen enough to clearly qualify as cheap."}
{"original": "and while most economists are confident the economy will keep growing in 2018, some investors are warning about the years following."}
{"original": "the risks of a recession in the next 18-24 months are rising, hedge fund titan ray dalio wrote in a recent post on linkedin, as the federal reserve feels more pressure to raise interest rates when wages are rising and a growing economy is getting more stimulus."}

{"original": "dutch prime minister mark rutte and his entire cabinet resigned friday to take political responsibility for a scandal involving investigations into child welfare payments that wrongly labeled thousands of parents as fraudsters. in a nationally televised speech, rutte said he had informed king willem-alexander of his decision and pledged that his government would continue work to compensate affected parents as quickly as possible and to battle the coronavirus."}

{"original": "we are of one mind that if the whole system has failed, we all must take responsibility, and that has led to the conclusion that i have just offered the king, the resignation of the entire cabinet, rutte said."}
{"original": "the move was seen as largely symbolic; rutte's government will remain in office in a caretaker mode until a new coalition is formed after a march 17 election in the netherlands."}
{"original": "the resignation brings to an end a decade in office for rutte, although his party is expected to win the election, putting him first in line to begin talks to form the next government. if he succeeds in forming a new coalition, rutte would most likely again become prime minister."}
{"original": "the netherlands is the third european country thrown into political uncertainty this week in the midst of the coronavirus crisis. in estonia, the government resigned over a corruption scandal, while italian premier giuseppe conte's governing coalition is at risk of collapse after a small partner party withdrew its support."}
{"original": "rutte said earlier this week that his government would be able to keep taking tough policy decisions in the battle against the coronavirus even if it were in caretaker mode. the netherlands is in a tough lockdown until at least feb. 9, and the government is considering imposing an overnight curfew amid fears about new, more contagious variants of the virus."}
{"original": "to the netherlands i say: our struggle against the coronavirus will continue, rutte said."}
{"original": "on thursday, the leader of the dutch opposition labor party stepped down because he was minister of social affairs in a governing coalition led by rutte when the country's tax office implemented a tough policy of tracking down fraud with child welfare."}
{"original": "lodewijk asscher's decision put further pressure on rutte ahead of friday's cabinet meeting. ministers were to decide on their reaction to a scathing report issued last month, titled unprecedented injustice, that said the tax office policies violated fundamental principles of the rule of law. the report also criticized the government for the way it provided information to parliament about the scandal."}
{"original": "many wrongfully accused parents were plunged into debt when tax officials demanded repayment of payments. the government has in the past apologized for the tax office's methods and in march earmarked 500 million euros ($607 million) to compensate more than 20,000 parents."}
{"original": "one of those parents waited near parliament as the cabinet met and said she wanted it to resign."}
{"original": "it's important for me because it is the government acknowledging, 'we have made a mistake and we are taking responsibility,' because it's quite something what happened to us, janet ramesar told the associated press."}
{"original": "rutte plans to lead his conservative people's party for freedom and democracy into the march election, and polls suggest it will win the most seats. that would put rutte, who has been in office for a decade at the head of three different coalitions, first in line to attempt to form the next ruling coalition."}
{"original": "deputy prime minister kajsa ollongren, who serves as interior minister, said as she entered friday's meeting that it is very important to be accountable and also to show responsibility in the political sense, and we are going to talk about that in the council of ministers today."}
{"original": "federal reserve officials expressed growing concerns about the u.s. economy when they met last month, grappling with volatile stock markets, trade tensions and signs of slowing global growth. these threats made the future path of interest rate hikes less clear, they said."}
{"original": "according to minutes of the fed meeting dec. 18-19, officials believed that with inflation still muted the central bank could afford to be patient about future rate hikes. a few fed officials argued against hiking rates at the meeting, the account shows, although a rate hike was eventually approved unanimously."}
{"original": "the minute, which the fed released on wednesday, show there was more turmoil behind the scenes than was evident from chairman jerome powell's even-keeled statement on dec. 19 when he announced the fourth rate hike this year."}
{"original": "while the fed expounded on the strong economy, it trimmed its projection of possible rate hikes in 2019 from three down to two. but many private economists think the central bank may end up raising rates just once this year if the economy slows significantly."}
{"original": "the central bank's interest-rate hikes are likely on pause for a while and will be highly influenced by the economic data and evolution of key risks, notably those affecting financial markets and global growth, sal guatieri, senior economist at bmo economics, wrote in a note. fed officials believe we are much closer to the end than the beginning of the tightening cycle."}
{"original": "the minutes note the contrast between the data on the u.s. economy, which show strong growth, and financial markets' fears of the future. that means fed policy this year will ultimately take its cue from the economic data, which is still holding up surprisingly well, paul ashworth, chief u.s. economist at capital economics, said in a note."}
{"original": "tonight on the cbs evening news, we spoke with the surgeon general dr. jerome adams. the nation's top doctor told us the next 15 days are a critical inflection point in slowing the spread of coronavirus in the u.s. we have a choice to make, he said. are we going to continue to see cases rise precipitously and deaths increase like italy has or are we going to try to go the way of south korea and china, where they really leaned into mitigation efforts and everyone pitched in to stop transmission?"}
{"original": "here are our top takeaways from the interview:"}
{"original": "1. children's playdates are not worth the risk"}
{"original": "we wanted to know – based on the new guidelines to limit social contact: are playdates safe? dr. adams advised against it for the time being: it's not worth the risk of our kids being spreaders and potentially taking it to someone else."}
{"original": "2. you can be a transmitter of covid-19 without showing symptoms"}
{"original": "common symptoms of the coronavirus include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, but some people don't exhibit symptoms at all. dr. adams says that even if you're asymptomatic, you could absolutely still transmit the virus to others. we know that the people who are most at risk are those with underlying medical conditions, especially seniors, people over the age of 60. we need to understand that the folks who are transmitting the virus across the planet and in our country are younger people."}
{"original": "3. the nation's top doctor says he wouldn't fault any mayor or governor for shelter-in-place policies"}
{"original": "more than seven million people in the san francisco bay area have been advised to shelter in place, and on tuesday, new york city mayor bill de blasio said the city was considering a similar policy there. dr. adams told us, as [dr. tony fauci] says, 'if it seems like an overreaction right now, then you're probably about where you need to be.' again, it's why the administration put out these guidelines for all of america — not just for certain areas, but for all of america — to look at the ways that they can prevent transmission of disease in their communities. i wouldn't fault any mayor, any governor for what they're considering in their communities. but at the very least, limit social gatherings to less than 10, stay at home if you can from work and avoid non-essential travel."}
{"original": "4. if you're experiencing symptoms, a negative test result shouldn't change the way you behave"}
{"original": "as tests for covid-19 become more widely available, dr. adams cautions that a negative test shouldn't stop someone with symptoms from self-quarantining, because you could test negative, and still have coronavirus. you could still be early and you could still transmit it; so if you have symptoms, you should still isolate."}
{"original": "5. health care professionals see a decrease in blood donations across the country"}
{"original": "dr. adams told us there has been a decrease in blood donations across the country since the outbreak began. while the cdc has cautioned against non-essential travel, they don't want to discourage people from visiting blood donation sites. we don't want people to not be able to get blood because they're scared of coronavirus."}
{"original": "republican sen. lindsey graham warned incoming sen. mitt romney wednesday that publicly opposing president trump would hurt him and utah. graham, a critic-turned-ally of the president, responded to the opinion piece by romney in the washington post saying that mr. trump has not risen to the mantle of the office."}
{"original": "if he's going to be the critic from utah, it's going to hurt him and utah, graham said in an interview with brian kilmeade on fox news radio. graham said that mr. trump is accessible and open to discussing policy. graham has met with mr. trump to try to convince the president not to withdraw troops from syria, although those attempts have so far been unsuccessful."}
{"original": "however, graham said, mr. trump would not be willing to work with romney if he believes you are out to get him. mr. trump mocked romney in a tweet on wednesday morning, comparing him to former sen. jeff flake, a frequent critic of the president."}
{"original": "here we go with mitt romney, but so fast! question will be, is he a flake? i hope not. would much prefer that mitt focus on border security and so many other things where he can be helpful. i won big, and he didn't. he should be happy for all republicans. be a team player & win! mr. trump wrote."}
{"original": "graham also said that those applauding romney's opposition to mr. trump would turn on him as soon as he began casting conservative votes."}
{"original": "what you got to learn from kavanaugh, it's really not about trump, it's about us. it's about conservatism, graham said, referring to u.s. supreme court justice brett kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual misconduct before his confirmation. graham unloaded on democrats during kavanaugh's hearings, accusing them of cooking up allegations in response to the judge's conservatism."}
{"original": "graham also urged romney to remember what they tried to do to you, possibly referring to criticism of romney after he appeared to be in contention for the secretary of state post before mr. trump took office."}

{"original": "ahead of president obama's last state of the union address, republicans are once again blasting what the white house considers a key accomplishment of the president's foreign policy legacy: the iran nuclear deal. and this time, they're warning that the international agreement could take down the u.s. oil industry."}
{"original": "as a consequence of president obama's nuclear agreement with iran, this state sponsor of terrorism will now be able to increase its oil exports at a moment when our moderate sunni allies, and their partners, feel increasingly threatened by iranian belligerents, sen. john hoeven, r-north dakota, said in a video released saturday. as a result, saudi arabia has opened the spigot to maintain its own level of exports."}
{"original": "the gop senator warned that these factors -- compounded with the threats of russia and the islamic state of iraq and syria (isis) -- are actually working to undermine our energy industry."}
{"original": "a huge part of vladimir putin's power base on the world stage is the fact that so much of europe depends on oil and gas from russia, hoeven said. and [isis] is relying on oil and gas dollars to fund its brutal terrorist activities in the middle east and beyond."}
{"original": "the chair of the senate committee on homeland security, hoeven added that energy security is a vitally important part of national security."}
{"original": "hoeven proposed taking more proactive steps to growing domestic oil production. he pointed to such legislative maneuvers like congress' recent lifting of the u.s. ban on crude oil exports, which passed after gop leaders struck a spending deal with democrats that also extended renewable energy tax breaks."}
{"original": "low-cost energy makes us more competitive in the global economy across the board in all industry sectors, he said. you do that by building the kind of legal tax and regulatory climate that attracts investment, innovation and jobs. you do that by reforming the tax code to make it simpler, flatter and fairer so that the american people have the motivation to compete and win."}
{"original": "in his own video, mr. obama championed initiatives that have helped prop up another industry tied heavily to u.s. oil production: america's auto manufacturers."}
{"original": "i placed my bet on american manufacturing, mr. obama said in the saturday video. in exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. we said the auto industry would have to truly change, not just pretend that it did. we got labor and management to settle their differences. we got the industry to retool and restructure."}
{"original": "he touted the fruits of the auto industry bailout, countering critics who called it a road to socialism and a disaster waiting to happen."}
{"original": "since our plan went into effect, our automakers have added more than 640,000 new jobs, mr. obama said. we've cut the detroit-area unemployment rate by more than half. the big three automakers are raising wages."}
{"original": "today, the president said, the american auto industry is back."}
{"original": "the president also previewed his trip to detroit later this month to visit the city's annual auto show, saying his attendance would allow him to see this progress firsthand."}
{"original": "the department of justice has acknowledged problems with several facts in a report last year that was designed to defend a ban on travel from some foreign countries. however, the doj said it would not be retracting or correcting the study."}
{"original": "in january 2018, the doj issued a report called executive order 13780: protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the united states initial section 11 report. it provided a defense for president donald trump's executive order that limited travel to the u.s. from countries deemed connected to terrorism."}
{"original": "the executive order was challenged in courts and revised several times, but the most recent version was upheld by the supreme court in june 2018 and restricts entry into the u.s. from iran, libya, north korea, somalia, syria, venezuela, and yemen."}
{"original": "the 11-page study, commissioned as part of the executive order, linked immigration and terrorism. less than a month after its publication, the report was challenged in a petition by protect democracy and several research groups, including the brookings institution and the brennan center for justice."}
{"original": "the report's primary conclusion was that 73 percent of individuals convicted in u.s. courts of international terrorism-related offenses between september 11, 2001 and december 31, 2016 were foreign-born. but it failed to note that those convictions weren't necessarily related to events that happened in the united states, said ben berwick, a department of justice alum and current counsel for protect democracy, a nonprofit watchdog group. the figure was actually in reference to the percentage of foreign-born individuals who had been brought to the u.s. to be convicted of terrorism acts internationally."}
{"original": "it immediately jumped out to me as more of a propaganda piece than a factual report, which is exactly what it turned out to be by their own admission, berwick said in a telephone interview with cbs news on friday."}
{"original": "in another instance, the agency's report claimed that in a six-year window, 70,000 immigrants in the u.s. had been convicted for gender-based violence, like sexual assault and domestic violence. in fact, there had been 70,000 gender-based offenses by immigrants in a 55-year window."}
{"original": "deputy assistant attorney general michael allen, the author of letter, dismissed the mischaracterizations, claiming they were mere editorials errors but added that the doj appreciates being made aware of such errors so that they will not be repeated."}
{"original": "in their petition, the watchdog and research groups found nine major areas of concern in the doj's report, including source transparency issues, misquoted studies and cherry-picked and unrepresentative examples."}
{"original": "the doj says that information in the report could be criticized."}
{"original": "this is representative of this administration's sometimes blasé attitude towards the truth, berwick said. it's clear that this report was issued to advance a particular policy agenda, regardless of what's actually the truth."}
{"original": "in the petition, filed in february 2018 to the federal agencies that oversee immigration, said the misleading nature and inaccuracies put it at odds with the information quality act, a 2001 measure that holds federal agencies responsible for disseminating accurate, objective information."}
{"original": "in other words, truthfulness is more than a good idea for government reports. it's required by law."}
{"original": "the petition was rejected and the groups fought back with an official administrative appeal. there's also a lawsuit pending in massachusetts against the report by the same watchdogs which had been put on pause while the department of justice reviewed the administrative appeal. now that the agency has rejected the appeal, protect democracy hasn't decided yet what its next steps will be, berwick said."}
{"original": "a call and email to the department of justice were not immediately returned. the agency's website said that media requests may not be handled until the government reopens from the partial federal shutdown."}
{"original": "it sure feels like maybe, just maybe, stocks will never go down again as wall street enjoys a rip-roaring start to 2018."}
{"original": "the dynamics are familiar: the u.s. economy is strong and about to enjoy a boost from the implementation of the gop's new tax cuts, inflation remains tepid, the federal reserve's rate hike campaign is proceeding cautiously and corporate earnings growth has been solid."}
{"original": "but a number of new dynamics loom in 2018. here are three questions investors need to ponder:"}
{"original": "are we headed for a melt-up?"}
{"original": "with the s&p 500's gain on monday, stocks have risen 2.8 percent for the new year, risng in every session so far. according to jeff hirsch at the almanac trader, this performance -- along with the solid run to end 2017 -- suggests 2018 will be great for investors. over the last 39 years, when stocks performed this well, the rest of the year showed gains 87 percent of the time, with an average rise of 14 percent."}
{"original": "even long-time market skeptics like gmo's jeremy grantham said markets could be headed for a near-term melt-up scenario. in a letter to investors, he wondered if stocks are entering the final, most ebullient phase of this long bull move."}
{"original": "jason geopfert at sentimentrader noted that the gains are part of a globally synchronized market displaying extreme momentum. the weekly relative strength index across six major worldwide stock indexes is now at the highest level in history. such extreme readings have in the past been associated with further gains -- the type of melt-up move grantham warns of."}
{"original": "why a warning? because such a move means we are probably down to the last few months of the bull market, according to grantham."}
{"original": "will the fed put finally end?"}
{"original": "in a recent note to clients, bank of america merrill lynch (bac) analysts noted that in 2017, for the first time, federal reserve policymakers stuck to their guns and tightened interest rates in three quarter-point increments -- a much more rapid pace than what bond traders expected at the start of the year."}
{"original": "previously, the fed always lowered its tightening plans to match market expectations in fear of repeating 2013's taper tantrum episode during which long-term interest rates rose rapidly. that has changed now as the fed's velvet glove treatment has resulted in financial conditions -- when measured broadly -- being easier now than when the central bank's tightening campaign started in 2015."}
{"original": "this deferral to the market is widely known as the fed put -- the idea that maintaining market calm overrides monetary policy desires. but it could be ending."}
{"original": "fed officials have penciled in another trio of quarter-point hikes for 2018. but the futures market assigns only 30 percent odds for that outcome. according to traders, the more likely outcome -- at 60 percent odds -- is that the fed is forced to back down and raises rates no more than twice."}
{"original": "however, goldman sachs (gs) is far more aggressive, warning clients that it expects four quarter-point rate hikes in 2018 as inflation heats up."}
{"original": "will the u.s. dollar continue to weaken?"}
{"original": "the good old greenback hasn't been faring so well lately. it has fallen 4 percent from its early november high and is down 12 percent from december 2016. watch for a possible decline to lows not seen since 2014 as the dollar gets battered by a combination of higher oil prices, rising inflation and a creeping sense the fed has been too slow in its policy normalization."}
{"original": "also factoring in is the excitement in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ripple, which are widely seen as private-market alternatives -- safe havens, even -- from government-backed fiat currencies."}
{"original": "the problem, however, is that a rapidly weakening dollar would undermine the goldilocks conditions that have allowed the fed to take it slow by pushing inflation higher, via everything from higher import prices to a tailwind behind commodity prices like crude oil."}
{"original": "uber technnologies has agreed to pay $10 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging the ride-hailing company discriminated against women and minorities."}
{"original": "the proposed settlement comes as a number of silicon valley companies grapple with gender, racial and other diversity issues."}
{"original": "the complaint, filed on behalf of more than 400 female and minority software engineers, claims that uber created a hostile working environment and discriminated on the basis of race, gender and nationality."}
{"original": "this settlement involves claims dating back to july 2013 and, while we are continually improving as a company, we have proactively made a lot of changes since then, an uber spokesman said in a statement."}
{"original": "over the past year, uber has implemented a new compensation policy, revamped its performance review process, issued its first diversity report and taken other steps to make the company more hospitable to employees, the spokesman added."}
{"original": "uber last year fired more than 20 people after an internal investigation into the company's culture following allegations of sexual harassment, bullying an other issues."}
{"original": "in their suit, former uber software developers roxanna del toro lopez and ana medina accused the company of paying other women and minority engineers less than their male peers for equal work. they also said uber promoted them more slowly and provided biased performance evaluations compared with white and asian male engineers. the two filed suit in san francisco superior court in in october of 2017."}
{"original": "under the settlement, uber has committed to improving its compensation and promotion practices, according to the ruling. that includes implementing a better system for assessing which workers merit promotion, as well as offering mentorship and skill development opportunities to women and people of color."}
{"original": "the tech industry has faced scrutiny for its labor practices, with a number of companies reacting by taking steps to protect women and minorities. uber rival lyft said tuesday it will implement an annual audit by an independent firm to ensure employees are fairly paid compared with their peers, according to cnet."}
{"original": "in an interview with intelligence matters host and cbs news senior national security contributor michael morell, former deputy secretary of state and deputy national security advisor to president barack obama antony blinken weighs in on the trump administration's foreign policy decisions in some of the world's top geopolitical hotspots."}
{"original": "blinken evaluates the opportunities seized, squandered and still ahead in countries including saudi arabia, iran, afghanistan, russia, north korea and china. a former national security adviser to vice president joe biden, blinken also discusses what biden's foreign policy might look like, should he run for president."}
{"original": "for much more from their conversation, read the interview transcript here and subscribe to intelligence matters here."}
{"original": "the u.s.-saudi relationship has been roiled in recent months by the murder, in turkey, of washington post columnist jamal khashoggi by a team of saudi citizens. after leveling sanctions on 17 saudis allegedly involved in khashoggi's killing, president trump and members of his administration largely stood by saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman -- despite u.s. intelligence indicating the prince had ordered the assassination. in december, a bipartisan majority of senators voted to condemn the crown prince for his actions and to end u.s. support for the saudi-led war in yemen."}
{"original": "i think the administration has missed a tremendous opportunity to use a horrific, terrible event – the murder of this journalist, khashoggi – to use that as a way to influence saudi behavior and saudi policies in a way that better reflects our interests and our values, blinken said."}
{"original": "he told morell that the president and his team may have squandered a moment to issue a check on one of the kingdom's most powerful, but still young and impulsive, leaders. the leverage the administration might have had in bringing an end to the yemen conflict and to a diplomatic impasse with qatar also appears to have dissipated, blinken said."}
{"original": "saudi arabia seems to have a blank check, he told morell. this is not about ending the alliance or the partnership with saudi arabia. it is making sure the alliance actually reflects our interests and our values – not just saudi arabia's."}
{"original": "in late 2018, mr. trump issued an order to pull more than 7,000 troops out of afghanistan, where the u.s. has maintained a military for more than 17 years. mr. trump had long campaigned on bringing american soldiers home from what has become the longest war in american history, but his military advisors urged a more gradual timeline – especially as the taliban are known to have regained strength and territory, and as airstrikes and suicide bombings made 2018 the deadliest recorded year for afghan civilians."}
{"original": "i actually think president trump's instincts are probably right on this, blinken said. it's time. it's time to cut the cord."}
{"original": "he told morell that, while he had concerns about wholesale u.s. withdrawal, the international community had, over the years, made material improvements in the lives of afghans. the bottom line, hard reality is, blinken said, that we were there because of 9/11 and because of al qaeda."}
{"original": "[t]hat threat has been, if not eliminated, significantly reduced to the point where i think it can be contained without having 15,000 americans in afghanistan, he told morell."}
{"original": "perhaps one of the administration's most visibly bifurcated diplomatic approaches has been toward russia. the trump administration has implemented some of the strongest and most sweeping sanctions yet against russian president vladimir putin's government, his acolytes and their businesses, but mr. trump has repeatedly praised putin, downplayed his efforts to undermine u.s. elections, and denied links between trump's campaign and russian nationals – though dozens of contacts are known to have occurred."}
{"original": "putin is playing a losing hand brilliantly, blinken said. russia, by virtually every metric, is actually in decline. and yet, he succeeded in reasserting russia on the world stage to some extent to distract from problems at home."}
{"original": "among the most effective deterrents to russian aggression, he argued, has been continued support for nato and pressure on russia for its incursions in non-nato member ukraine. i think sustaining that is important. and we've sustained it. and the trump administration, despite what the president says, the administration itself has sustained it."}
{"original": "more measures, including an effective deterrence policy, are necessary, blinken said, especially since the influence campaign conducted by russia in 2016 failed to become a unifying issue for much of the country."}
{"original": "this should have brought people together because the attack is not on democrats or on republicans or anyone else; it's on our democracy, he said. that's the one thing that should unite us. and, unfortunately, that's what we're losing right now."}
{"original": "last year began with the president deriding the size of north korean leader kim jong un's nuclear button and ended with a lookahead to a second, in-person summit between the two. mr. trump is known to have maintained a cordial, if not warm, personal correspondence with kim, all while the north korean leader has offered little evidence of his intention to take steps toward denuclearization. the administration is reportedly scouting potential sites for a new summit between the two leaders in 2019."}
{"original": "i think that there was some merit in president trump throwing the deck of cards up in the air and seeing what came from it, blinken said, because the fact of the matter is the policy that successive administrations have pursued over the last decades has not worked."}
{"original": "still, blinken said, the lack of progress evident in north korea's stated intention to eliminate some or all of its nuclear arsenal over the more than 6 months since the leaders' historic first summit may mean the new approach isn't quite working."}
{"original": "[i]n elevating kim jong un, in declaring success and even saying, at one point, that the nuclear problem was resolved, the president gave a green light to over countries – starting with china – to go back to something approaching business as usual, blinken said. he noted that the maximum pressure campaign, which had been paying dividends, has now been effectively eroded by other countries' non-compliance with sanctions on north korea."}
{"original": "the hard reality is it's, if not impossible, highly unlikely that we will achieve, in any near term, the complete denuclearization of north korea. i just don't see that as realistic in the near term, blinken said. what i think we can get is an arms control and, over time, disarmament process put in place. but that requires enough pressure, sustained and comprehensive to get north korea to the table."}
{"original": "i give [mr. trump] some points for trying a different playbook, but the way he's played it, i think, is making things worse, not better, blinken told morell."}
{"original": "an overwhelming number of intelligence, defense and law enforcement officials have said in recent months that china poses the thorniest and most significant long-term strategic challenge to the united states. as the intelligence community and justice department have issued warnings about – and, in some cases, indictments of – chinese efforts to engage in economic espionage and intellectual property theft, the trump administration has ratcheted up tariffs on chinese goods in a protracted trade war whose economic effects have been felt in both countries."}
{"original": "the president was right to confront the issue of unfair trade practices, blinken said, the lack of reciprocity in the commercial relationship was totally unsustainable."}
{"original": "but mr. trump was profoundly wrong in the way he has gone about changing chinese behavior, blinken added, starting with the huge strategic mistake of leaving the multi-nation, trans-pacific partnership crafted during the obama administration."}
{"original": "[n]ow, we're stuck in a different dynamic, blinken said, and that is a veering wildly between confrontation on the one hand, and abdication on the other hand."}
{"original": "as the u.s. has pulled back from other multilateral engagements, blinken said, it has created a leadership vacuum that, in some instances, chinese president xi jinping has sought to fill himself – something blinken called a profound irony."}
{"original": "in the absence of american leadership, in the absence of an american model, he said, a chinese model could win by default – not because it's better."}
{"original": "grand rapids, mich. -- it was a simple letter, with a simple request."}
{"original": "is it possible that in 10 years that you could meet us on this bridge?"}
{"original": "the request to meet came from two chinese parents who had abandoned their second-born child in a chinese market. they had violated china's one-child policy, and their child -- kati -- was adopted by ken and ruth pohler."}
{"original": "it was so heartfelt. and we thought, 'oh my, these birth parents went through a difficult time, ken remembered."}
{"original": "ken and ruth pohler cbs news"}
{"original": "the pohlers never forgot that note with kati's chinese name. when she turned 10 in 2005, they sent a messenger to the bridge. kati's birth father was there, and by chance, a chinese tv crew captured him on tape."}
{"original": "holding a sign. the name on the sign was the name in the note, said changfu chang, a filmmaker."}
{"original": "as a child, kati pohler said she wanted to know where she came from cbs news"}
{"original": "he was so compelled by the story, he made a documentary about it. the story became famous in china, but back in the u.s., the pohlers remained silent."}
{"original": "when i was little, i would ask my mom like, whose tummy did i come from, said kati pohler. i realized that i didn't come from her tummy."}
{"original": "but the pohlers didn't tell kati until she was 20."}
{"original": "they told my brothers about it. so i was the only one left in the dark, she said."}
{"original": "kati pohler got to meet her birth parents in china at 22 cbs news"}
{"original": "she admits that made her upset, but this summer, kati finally got a chance to meet her birth parents a week after her 22nd birthday when she traveled to china. it was a reunion made all the more overwhelming by the barriers of both language and culture."}
{"original": "they are very real to me now, said kati."}
{"original": "madison, wis. -- a federal investigation into troubling evidence of unexplained injuries to newborn babies in a wisconsin hospital could lead to termination of its medicare payments contract. five newborns unitypoint health-meriter hospital in madison were found to have injuries ranging from bruising on their arms and legs to a broken arm and even a skull fracture, according to investigators from the center for medicare and medicaid services (cms). the hospital didn't do enough to protect patients and prevent suspected abuse in its newborn intensive care unit, investigators said."}
{"original": "a document obtained by cbs madison affiliate wisc-tv shows that investigators from the center for medicare and medicaid services (cms) concluded patients were in immediate jeopardy last year."}
{"original": "the immediate jeopardy began on april 12, 2017 when the facility failed to protect and thoroughly investigate the first report of an injury of unknown origin for patient #4, placing all patients in the newborn intensive care unit at risk for serious harm or injury, cms said in the document."}
{"original": "interviews with physicians and nurses in the facility show a timeline that began with concerns on feb. 2 of unexplained bruising to a baby. those concerns continued throughout the week with questions about injuries to additional babies. the documents show a child abuse expert wasn't called until feb. 8, six days after that first report."}
{"original": "madison police said they were notified of the unexplained injuries on feb. 9 and began an investigation."}
{"original": "cms documents show its interviews with nurses and physicians and review of patient files found additional documented concerns about injuries to babies in the nicu going back to april of 2017, with at least one mother taking pictures of unexplained bruises to her child."}
{"original": "interview with director of performance b on february 16, 2018 at 2:12 p.m. stated there was no policy or process that guided the staff or physicians how to report abuse or neglect, cms said in a statement."}
{"original": "the hospital suspended one employee feb. 8 of this year and implemented increased security after sharing the concerns with police. a plan of correction submitted by unitypoint-meriter shows a security officer is assigned to the nicu entrance and cameras are now in place in all nicu rooms."}
{"original": "the wisconsin state journal reports the suspended employee is the nurse who cared for the infants involved."}
{"original": "during the course of the investigation, cms determined meriter was out of compliance with a condition that requires it to protect and promote each patient's rights, wisc reports. cms told the station it had accepted an initial plan of correction from meriter, but issued the contract termination notice after additional issues surfaced."}
{"original": "during the course of the recent survey other levels of non-compliance were discovered, said cms spokesperson elizabeth schinderle. as a result, cms finalized the full survey report and issued it to the facility yesterday, march 7. they now have the opportunity to submit another plan of correction (poc) which cms will then review. if that poc is found to be acceptable, the next step in the process would be an unannounced, on-site survey."}
{"original": "because of this immediate threat to patient health and safety, the medicare program will not make payment for patient services on or after may 24."}
{"original": "a spokesperson for meriter said the hospital was working with authorities in the review of the nicu."}
{"original": "we have successfully worked with the centers for medicare and medicaid services to address their most immediate concerns and we continue to work on a longer term corrective action plan for their review, said jessika kasten, with unitypoint health-meriter. we have implemented enhanced safety measures, and our commitment to provide safe care to our patients and families has never been stronger."}
{"original": "albany, n.y.- parents can legally eavesdrop on young children if they reasonably believe it would be in the child's best interest, the state's highest court ruled tuesday, establishing an exception to new york law against wiretaps without the consent of at least one person on a call."}
{"original": "the 4-3 ruling by the court of appeals involved a cellphone recording of a man threatening to beat the 5-year-old son of his live-in girlfriend. the boy's father recorded the conversation."}
{"original": "the father had a good faith, objectively reasonable basis to believe that it was necessary for the welfare of his son to record the violent conversation he found himself listening to, judge eugene fahey wrote for the majority. he cautioned that the ruling shouldn't be interpreted as a way to avoid criminal liability for wiretaps when a parent acts in bad faith."}
{"original": "the live-in boyfriend, anthony badalamenti, was later convicted of child endangerment, assault and weapon possession. his attorney challenged the tape as inadmissible evidence from illegal eavesdropping."}
{"original": "fahey cautioned that courts must consider the age and maturity of the child in considering parental eavesdropping. he didn't specify an age. a key question is whether the child is capable of formulating well-reasoned judgments of his or her own, he wrote."}
{"original": "chief judge janet difiore and judges eugene pigott jr. and michael garcia agreed with fahey."}
{"original": "in a dissent, judge leslie stein wrote that the issue raises many policy concerns that should be left to the legislature, with implications for divorce and custody disputes, criminal proceedings against the minor or others, juvenile delinquency and any other dispute within families."}
{"original": "even in this case, the father didn't notify authorities or share the tape until after badalamenti and the boy's mother were arrested months later when neighbors heard screaming and crying and called police, stein wrote. the majority's ruling fails to answer whether a parent can eavesdrop over the explicit refusal of an older child who's talking to his or her other parent, she wrote."}
{"original": "judges jenny rivera and sheila abdus-salaam joined stein's dissent."}
{"original": "calls to nassau county prosecutors and badalamenti's attorney were not immediately returned."}
{"original": "the new york court said this vicarious consent doctrine was adopted by a federal court in utah in 1993 and the federal appeals court in cincinnati in 2008."}
{"original": "the trump administration introduced this week a sweeping relaxation of environmental laws and fines during the coronavirus pandemic. according to new guidelines from the environmental protection agency (epa), companies will largely be exempt from consequences for polluting the air or water during the outbreak."}
{"original": "in a letter to all government and private sector partners on thursday, the epa's assistant administrator for enforcement and compliance assurance susan parker bodine said that the agency does not expect power plants, factories or other companies to meet environmental standards and reporting of pollution during this time — and it won't pursue penalties if companies break the rules."}
{"original": "under normal circumstances, companies are required to report when they release certain levels of pollution into the air or water. now, the epa has effectively ceded its federal authority to state offices and said companies will be responsible for monitoring their own air and water pollution during this time."}
{"original": "in general, the epa does not expect to seek penalties for violations of routine compliance monitoring, integrity testing, sampling, laboratory analysis, training, and reporting or certification obligations in situations where the epa agrees that covid-19 was the cause of the noncompliance and the entity provides supporting documentation to the epa upon request, bodine wrote."}
{"original": "polluters will be able to avoid penalties for breaking environmental laws if they claim that the violations were in some way related to the pandemic. the agency asked companies to minimize the effects and duration of any noncompliance and act responsibly during this period."}
{"original": "epa is committed to protecting human health and the environment, but recognizes the challenges resulting from efforts to protect workers and the public from covid-19 may directly impact the ability of regulated facilities to meet all federal regulatory requirements, said epa administrator andrew wheeler in a press release."}
{"original": "the guidance applies retroactively beginning march 13 and extends indefinitely."}
{"original": "an epa spokesperson said the policy applies to compliance monitoring and reporting and is not a nationwide waiver of environmental rules. the spokesperson added that in other situations, the agency would take the pandemic into account on a case by case basis."}
{"original": "but critics of the new guidelines argue the relaxed laws will result in more pollution and make it difficult to assess the resulting environmental damage. more air pollution not only leads to a warmer climate, but it can also cause major respiratory issues, among other health problems — potentially putting the communities who live near these facilities at an increased risk for contracting covid-19."}
{"original": "this is an open license to pollute. plain and simple, gina mccarthy, president and ceo of the natural resources defense council and former epa administrator, said in a press release. the administration should be giving its all toward making our country healthier right now. instead, it is taking advantage of an unprecedented public health crisis to do favors for polluters that threaten public health. we can all appreciate the need for additional caution and flexibility in a time of crisis, but this brazen directive is an abdication of the epa's responsibility to protect our health."}
{"original": "several environmental organizations put out statements opposing the new guidelines."}
{"original": "at a time when communities across the country are desperately trying to clean up polluted waters and one-third of wildlife species are at a heightened risk of extinction, this misguided rule places our drinking water, our wildlife and our nation's way of life further at risk, said collin o'mara, president and ceo of the national wildlife federation, in a statement."}
{"original": "as the country focuses on protecting public health and safety from covid-19, donald trump and andrew wheeler are exploiting this pandemic to make toxic pollution legal, said michael brune, executive director of environmental organization the sierra club, in a statement. this illegal and reckless action will not go unchecked."}
{"original": "wheeler defended the move on twitter friday, saying the epa is working to protect public health and the environment while providing a small degree of flexibility during these extraordinary times."}
{"original": "as the u.s. government's partial shutdown stretched into its 21st day friday, federal workers who've been furloughed or forced to work without pay are scrambling to avoid getting dinged by lenders and credit-reporting agencies for skipping loan payments that could damage their credit scores. missing just one payment on a credit card can knock up to 100 points off a consumer's credit score, and it can take several years to recover, according to experts."}
{"original": "some lenders, including banks and auto-leasing companies, say they are working to accommodate government employees who are not receiving paychecks, but their concessions vary, and some government workers tell cbs moneywatch they are struggling to negotiate deals with their creditors."}
