Smartphones are capturing all of life's moments, and doctor visits are no exception.\n\nAt least 1 in 10 U.S. patients now records discussions at medical appointments, researchers said.\n\nBut do they have the right to do so?\n\nThe legality of these taped visits depends on where you live, said investigators from the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice.\n\nIn the U.S., the situation is complex, said professor and senior scientist Dr. Glyn Elwyn.\n\nWiretapping or eavesdropping statutes provide the primary legal framework guiding recording practices and protecting privacy, so a patient who would like to record a doctor's visit should familiarize themselves with laws in their state, Elwyn said.\n\nThere are two main differences between state wiretapping laws, Elwyn and his colleagues said in a new report.\n\nIn all-party states, recordings made by doctors or patients are illegal unless everyone involved is aware and provides consent.\n\nIn one-party states, just one person involved in a conversation needs to be aware and consent to the recording. Only in these states can patients legally record an office visit without their doctor's consent and vice versa.\n\nThe authors said 39 states and Washington, D.C., follow the one-party consent rule; all others adhere to the all-party requirement.\n\nHow are patients using these increasingly common recordings?\n\nAfter reviewing 33 studies involving audio-recorded clinical visits, the researchers found that about 7 out of 10 patients listened to their own recordings. A similar number shared them with a caregiver.\n\nIn many cases, patients used the tapes to remember important details about their office visits.\n\nMost people are sharing their recordings with a family member or caregiver, or they are listening to recording themselves, so they can better recall the information they received during the encounter, Elwyn said in an institute news release.\n\nPatients said the recordings left them feeling more satisfied with their care.\n\nHealth care overall is moving toward greater transparency and patient recordings are going to become more common, Elwyn said.\n\nThat means there would be tremendous benefit to patient advocacy groups, health care organizations, providers and policymakers working together to develop clear guidelines and policies around the responsible, positive use of open recordings, he added.\n\nWhile some doctors and hospitals worry that taped appointments and procedures will be used against them, others take a more positive view. The Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, for example, encourages patient-doctor recordings and rewards doctors who comply, the researchers said.\n\nThe report was published July 10 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
Climate change a key issue as voters head to polls on Super Tuesday Environmental policy is set to be a key issue as voters head to the polls on Super Tuesday. CBS News meteorologist and climate specialist Jeff Berardelli joins CBSN to discuss why climate change matters more this year than ever before.
Democratic Congressman Jerry Nadler of New York, the incoming chairman of the powerful House Judiciary Committee, pledged to conduct strong oversight of the White House when his party takes control of the House on Thursday, but said Democrats should wait and see before discussing impeachment proceedings against President Trump.\n\nFor the last two years, the president has had no oversight, no accountability from Congress. The Republican Congress was completely derelict in its responsibility to provide oversight, Nadler said on CBS This Morning Wednesday. We're going to provide that oversight. We're going to use the subpoena power if we have to.\n\nNadler said that the Judiciary Committee will also hold hearings on the December deaths of two migrant children in Border Patrol custody. This is inhuman and it's not precedented, he said, referring to the White House's hardline immigration agenda. It's a deliberate creation of the Trump administration, which is trying to make things as miserable as possible. And if kids die, they're apparently willing to have that.\n\nThe veteran New York lawmaker said House Democrats will use their investigative committee powers over the administration to probe the White House's controversial migrant family separation policy — which it was forced to rescind after a massive public uproar — as well as the appointment of Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who has previously denounced special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in U.S. elections and alleged coordination between the Trump campaign and Moscow.\n\nStill, Nadler stressed that his committee, which has the authority to initiate impeachment proceedings against federal officials, will only hold impeachment hearings against the president if certain criteria are met.\n\nImpeachment is designed as a defense of the republic against a president who would aggrandize power, destroy liberty, destroy Democratic institutions, destroy the separations of power, he said. If that happens, if you get real evidence of that, then you have to consider impeachment hearings.\n\nThere's certainly a lot of allegations, but we'll have to wait and see what the Mueller investigation comes up with and other investigations looking into it, Nadler added.\n\nAsked about the partial government shutdown and impasse in budget negotiations between lawmakers and the White House over Mr. Trump's unwavering demand for $5 billion in funding to construct a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, Nadler said his fellow House Democrats intend to pass six appropriations bills to fund most of the government and a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) until Feb. 8.\n\nBecause his party's proposals do not include any additional funding for a border wall, it is unlikely that they will be backed by the president and a Republican-controlled Senate. Mr. Trump is scheduled to meet with top congressional Republicans and Democrats on Wednesday to discuss the stalemate in negotiations.\n\nNadler said the partial shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, is Mr. Trump's attempt to blackmail the American public because he feels beleaguered by criticism from his own party, high-profile resignations in his administration and looming Democratic control of the House.\n\nIt is an extremist policy designed to appeal to an extremist base and hold the whole country hostage, he said.
WASHINGTON -- Iran could comply with last summer's nuclear deal as early as Friday or this weekend, officials said, requiring the United States and other nations to immediately suspend billions of dollars' worth of economic sanctions on the Islamic Republic.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry predicted Wednesday the achievement could happen within the next coming days.\n\nKerry also said Iran was in the process of disabling the central vessel, or calandria, for its heavy water reactor at Arak that would have been able to produce plutonium, a pathway to nuclear weapons.\n\nJust yesterday, the foreign minister (of Iran) reported to me that the calandria of the plutonium nuclear reactor is now out and in the next hours it will be filled with concrete and destroyed, Kerry said Wednesday.\n\nJust hours after welcoming Iran's release of 10 U.S. sailors it detained when their boats wandered on to an Iranian island in the Persian Gulf, Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University that implementation of the nuclear agreement will take place soon, without specifying an exact date.\n\nOthers in Washington and elsewhere told The Associated Press the announcement could come within two days. In Vienna, a senior diplomat from one of the six countries that cut the deal with Iran said it would be formally declared implemented most probably Friday. Those officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nIn Tehran, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi echoed that sentiment.\n\nHe said the International Atomic Energy Agency is expected to verify Iran's compliance on Friday and that Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini would then announce implementation day, according to Iran's official IRNA news agency.\n\nI believe the parties will perform their undertakings by Friday and Saturday and Sunday and the implementation day would be announced on that time, Araghchi said.\n\nHe said the foreign ministers who negotiated the July accord - including Kerry, Zarif and their counterparts from Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia - may meet to deliver a joint statement. Kerry is expected to be in Europe this weekend on other business.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, once Iran meets its obligations to curb its nuclear program, it is to receive wide-ranging sanctions relief. For the U.S. that means suspension of nuclear-related sanctions on Iranian oil, banking and commerce.\n\nIran was required to ship out most of its stockpile of enriched uranium, a material that can be used for making bombs, and take apart thousands of the centrifuges that enrich the material. Most of the nuclear restrictions last 10 or 15 years.\n\nWhile Iran accomplished most of the biggest tasks in recent weeks, several technical hiccups remained. Officials had spoken of lingering questions related to Iran's uranium and plutonium programs, including over the properties of certain centrifuges Iran would be permitted to maintain for research purposes.\n\nIt's not clear how quickly Iran would reap the benefits of the deal.\n\nTehran expects to quickly recoup some $100 billion worth of its assets that have been frozen in overseas banks, a tremendous windfall for an economy with a GDP of little more than $400 billion in 2014.\n\nWhile the Iranians have aggressively courted foreign companies and investors in recent months, it is unclear how quickly contracts can be finalized. Also unknown is how determined major Western firms, in particular, will be given the risk of snapback sanctions if Iran violates the deal and the history of U.S. penalties against European banks that have previously conducted business with Iran.
American Airlines will no longer allow emotional support animals to travel on its planes other than as carry-on pets or in the cargo. The carrier is adopting a Department of Transportation rule that takes effect next week. It defines a service animal as a dog trained to do work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability, a narrower definition than in the past.\n\nWhen the rule goes into effect January 11, American will no longer authorize new travel for animals that do not meet that definition, such as emotional support animals, the airline announced Tuesday in a news release.\n\nThe airline said existing bookings involving emotional support animals will be honored through February 1, when the company's new policies go into effect.\n\nAnimals that had previously traveled as emotional support animals and no longer qualify as service animals can travel as carry-on pets or in the cargo provided they meet the airline's requirements, American added. The airline will collect a pet fee ranging from $125 to several hundred dollars for transporting pets, according to the Associated Press.\n\nWe're confident this approach will enable us to better serve our customers, particularly those with disabilities who travel with service animals, and better protect our team members at the airport and on the aircraft, Jessica Tyler, president of cargo and vice president of airport excellence for American, said in a statement.\n\nAlaska Airlines a week ago also said it would no longer accept emotional support animals. Other airlines are also expected to adopt the new policy.\n\nThe Transportation Department early last month said it was reversing its long-held position that required airlines to allow passengers to travel with emotional support animals as long they had note from a doctor.\n\nThe agency's switch follows an increase in service animal complaints from passengers with disabilities, misbehavior by emotional support animals, a lack of clarity around the definition of service animal and disruptions caused by requests to transport unusual species of animals onboard aircraft, according to the DOT.\n\nAirlines for years have struggled to contend with travelers who brought a menagerie of animals on board, including cats, turtles, pigs and other creatures.\n\nHigh-profile incidents involving animals on flights include police being called to remove a woman with an emotional support squirrel from a 2018 Frontier Airlines flight and United Airlines bouncing a passenger who wanted to bring a peacock on board.
Investors seem unimpressed with the Federal Reserve's largest interest rate cut since 2008, pushing down stocks amid mounting concerns over the coronavirus.\n\nThe Dow fell 786 points, or almost 3%, to 25,917 on Tuesday, while the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq indexes both slid about 3%. The decline followed a surprise move by the central bank to lower rates by 0.5% in a bid to bolster the U.S. economy as the coronavirus spreads to more states. The rate cut comes after seven major economies pledged early Tuesday to use all appropriate tools to deal with the outbreak.\n\nThe subdued reaction of the equity market suggests a typical buy the rumor and sell the fact, and we continue to anticipate two weeks of high volatility in the markets, Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management, said in an email after the Fed's decisions.\n\nIn another sign investors are seeking refuge from market volatility, the price of 10-year Treasury notes surged, pushing the yield to below 1% — the first time that has ever happened, according to Bloomberg. The Fed said in a statement that while the U.S. economy remains strong, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity.\n\nWall Street is weighing the impact of the coronavirus as more companies warn the outbreak will crimp profitability, while others cut back on employee travel and ask employees to work from home. The market decline on Tuesday follows yesterday's surge of 5.1%, when investors were buoyed by the prospect of a Fed rate cut. The Dow last plunged more than 12%, marking the fastest recorded slide into market correction territory — defined as a decline of at least 10% from a previous high.\n\nPresident Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not easing interest rates, pressed policy makers to do more even after the rate cut. More easing and cutting!, Mr. Trump said in a tweet.\n\nG-7 announcement\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the G-7 countries said they are ready to take actions, including fiscal measures where appropriate, to aid in the response to the virus and support the economy.\n\nThe joint statement from the U.S., Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada was issued after a conference call among the finance ministers and central bank presidents, led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. But investors were looking for concrete actions, analysts noted.\n\nGlobal equities were disappointed with the 175-word statement of G7 finance ministers and central bank governors, said Edward Moya, senior market strategist at OANDA, in a research note issued before the Fed cut rates. Wall Street's patience will be tested as downward pressures grow for signs of a fiscal response.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases continues to climb in the U.S. The new disease has killed six people in the U.S., four from one nursing home near Seattle and two others in the same county. The cluster of deaths at the nursing facility in Washington state's King County highlights the serious threat the disease poses to older people and those with underlying health conditions.\n\nThere were just over 100 cases in 15 states as of Tuesday morning, with New Hampshire and Georgia being the most recent to join the battle against the virus.
If you're reading this from the comfort of your home office, you may want to thank IBM for helping to make that possible.\n\nThe technology giant that gave us the floppy disk, automated teller machine and Watson supercomputer has also been a trailblazer in terms of allowing employees to work remotely. IBM began allowing some of its employees to work at home during the Reagan era, and by 2009 40 percent of its 386,000 staffers worldwide were no longer tethered to a traditional office. Tens of thousands more worked remotely at least occasionally, according to a company report.\n\nNow, Big Blue -- which helped launch the work-from-home movement to slash its real estate costs and retain talent -- has become the latest corporate behemoth to call some of its troops back to the office. Honeywell, Yahoo, Best Buy, Hewlett-Packard and Bank of America have made similar moves over the last several years. Like IBM, they cited the need to improve teamwork, idea-sharing, speed and agility.\n\nNeedless to say, not all their employees are thrilled. Some IBMers have reportedly polished up their resumes and begun looking for new jobs.\n\nAs more and more companies in the U.S. have adopted work-from-home policies, employees have grown to expect a measure of control over when and where they work -- and they appear to be getting it. Last year, 43 percent of employees worked remotely in some capacity, meaning they spent at least some of their time working in a different location than their co-workers, according to a Gallup report. That was up from 39 percent in 2012.\n\nIBM, however, is among a handful of big employers that are reversing course. Last month, the company informed its U.S. marketing team of about 2,600 people that working remotely on a full-time basis would no longer be an option, according to media accounts.\n\nIan Colley, an IBM spokesman, confirmed that marketing employees have been asked to work out of six new digital marketing facilities located in Austin, Texas; San Francisco; New York City; Cambridge, Massachusetts; Atlanta; and Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nAs a result, employees who worked remotely -- whether from home or an office other than the one to which they are now assigned -- will need to commute, move, change offices within the same city or find another job. Colley declined to say how many staffers are impacted by the policy change or when it takes effect.\n\nIBM is helping to pay moving expenses for workers who opt to relocate. For employees who need to move because of the new policy but can't for some reason, IBM will help them find other jobs internally, according to Colley.\n\nMost IBM marketing employees already work out of an office (rather than from home) and live within commuting distance of one of the six new facilities, he said.\n\nIBM remains committed to work-life balance and still allows members of co-located teams to sometimes work at home, Colley said. Those teams include not only marketing but also chief information officers, the Watson division and certain software development groups.\n\nAs marketing shifts to digital marketing, the need to work in an agile way becomes more apparent, said Colley, explaining the reason for the new marketing-department policy.\n\nMarketing is no longer a 'waterfall' type work process, where work is handed from one person to another. Modern marketing requires that people on a team be able to iterate programs in real-time based on live feedback. This requires them to collaborate much more closely, he added.\n\nIBM appears to be bucking a trend. On the whole, companies are offering workers greater flexibility in terms of when and where they work, and not just because it helps with their recruiting efforts. Studies have shown that employee engagement and productivity often improve as a result.\n\nIn 2016, 40 percent of large companies allowed employees to work at home at least some of the time on a regular basis, up from 33 percent in 2012, according to a study by the Society for Human Resource Management and the Families and Work Institute.\n\nMany companies allow working from home because it holds down their office-rental costs and the low- or no-value-added time workers spend commuting, particularly in cities with heavy rush-hour traffic, explained Brad Harrington, executive director of the Boston College Center for Work & Family, whose corporate sponsors include IBM.\n\nA lot of times people think of [working from home] as an accommodation for working parents, but that's not necessarily the case, he explained. There are organizational benefits to it, added Harrington.\n\nThere may also be organizational costs in terms of teamwork, innovation and corporate culture, experts said.\n\nYou start to get an erosion of corporate culture when you have workers spread far and wide, said Tom Gimbel, chief executive officer of staff and recruiting firm LaSalle Network in Chicago.\n\nThe same can be said for the culture of colleges that specialize in online programs, Gimbel added. You don't see many people wearing a college sweatshirt for the University of Phoenix, he noted.\n\nFor employees, there may be some drawbacks to working from home from a career-growth perspective, Gimbel said. Less face-time with higher ups could be a liability.\n\nYour opportunities for promotion are less if you're not in the office interacting with senior management, he said.
Thanks to a post-earnings lift from Boeing (BA), the Dow Jones industrials ended a five-day losing streak on Wednesday. The Nasdaq Composite wasn't as lucky, however, posting its fifth straight loss.\n\nTreasury yields and corporate earnings remain the focus, with the 10-year Treasury pushing further above the 3 percent level on Wednesday, closing at 3.03 percent -- a high not seen since 2014. The 2-year Treasury hit 2.49 percent -- its highest close in nearly a decade.\n\nA combination of factors are behind these upward moves, including expectations of another Federal Reserve interest rate hike in June, rising inflation expectations and growing evidence that wage inflation is just around the corner.\n\nHistorical data comparing the relationship of job availability vs. wage gains shows -- if history is any guide -- that pay raises are coming. Which will provide the raw fuel needed to push up prices throughout the economy.\n\nWatch for Fed policymakers to explore this point in their statement due next week. Currently, the futures market has essentially priced in another quarter-point hike at the Fed's June meeting. But the odds of an accelerating pace of rate increases is rising, with a 38 percent chance of three more this year (for a total of four), up from a 28 percent chance a month again.\n\nThis policy and inflation outlook is overshadowing what has been an extremely strong first-quarter earnings season so far. According to FactSet, S&P 500 earnings growth so far is tracking at 18.3 percent vs. last year's first quarter, with record high net profit margins.\n\nJust look at Facebook (FB), which jumped 6.8 percent in after-hours trading following its report of earnings of $1.69 per share vs. $1.36 estimated on $12 billion in ad revenue. Daily active users increased 13 percent over last year, laying to rest the #DeleteFacebook fears.\n\nBut echoing the cautiousness of Caterpillar (CAT) management on Tuesday, who warned that the company's first-quarter results could be a high water mark for 2018 profitability, investors seem to be increasingly aware that the rest of this year may not be a walk in the park for stocks. Worries are growing that higher interest rates will jeopardize many of the tailwinds the bulls have enjoyed for years: debt-funded share buybacks, cheap consumer credit, affordable mortgages, low auto loan payments and higher bond prices.
Washington — Seven major economies, including the U.S., pledged Tuesday to use all appropriate tools to deal with the spreading coronavirus, while stopping short of immediate actions. The group of major industrial countries, referred to as the G-7, said it was ready to take actions, including fiscal measures where appropriate, to aid in the response to the virus and support the economy.\n\nThe joint statement from the U.S., Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada was issued after a conference call among the finance ministers and central bank presidents, led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.\n\nGiven the potential impacts of COVID-19 on global growth, we reaffirm our commitment to use all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth and safeguard against downside risks, the G-7 said.\n\nThe G-7 has issued similar statements during periods of market turmoil, such as the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.\n\nMarkets soared Monday amid a growing conviction by investors that the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world would cut interest rates in a move to shore up economic growth. Wall Street analysts expect Fed officials to lower rates at their next meeting on March 17-18 and possibly again in April.\n\nDespite the G-7's commitment to work together, the group's response appeared to disappoint some on Wall Street.\n\nThis is a disappointment compared to previous hopes of an immediate and coordinated fiscal package and interest rate cuts, although such hopes had already been dampened by information leaked from 'G7 officials' early this morning, Jennifer McKeown, head of global economics service at Capital Economics, said in a note.\n\nThe research firm has said it expects the number of coronavirus cases in the U.S. to climb exponentially in the coming weeks and for economic growth to slow. Capital Economics expects the Fed to cut rates by a total of 0.5% by mid-year due to the virus.\n\nCarl Weinberg of High Frequency Economics said in a report that investors were hoping for a lot more from the G-7 announcement.\n\nStock futures in the U.S. were flat Tuesday ahead of the start of trade.
One of Sydney Chaffee's students describes her as blunt, calm and nice at the same time. Others in her classroom in Dorchester, Massachusetts, say she's a good listener – simply the best.\n\nSydney Chaffee CBS News\n\nChaffee, who's among the 3.1 million teachers who educate the 50.4 million public school students across the country, was honored Thursday as the 2017 National Teacher of the Year. The 9th grade humanities teacher has spent 10 years at Codman Academy, a charter public school where 98 percent of the students are minorities and 75 percent of them qualify for free or reduced lunch. One hundred percent of Codman Academy's graduates are accepted into college.\n\nThe magic behind her effectiveness and popularity is a deep desire to make change and to build relationships with kids.\n\nI want my students to understand that they are powerful and that they can make change in the world. That whatever the future is that they want to see, they have the power and they have the agency to make that happen, and so that's at the core of everything that we're doing, Chaffee said on CBS This Morning.\n\nAt Codman Academy, it's school policy for the students call teachers by their first names.\n\nWe want to just sort of show that we're on the same level, and it's a community and we have relationships, Chaffee said.\n\nShe also stresses social justice in her classroom.\n\nWe learn a lot about history, and the history of people who have been oppressed and the history of people who have been marginalized and how those people have fought for justice, Chaffee explained. So we learn about resistance movements and then we sort of relate that to today and say, 'OK, so what can we learn from this, and how will you be a powerful person in the world?'\n\nAs a teacher, she recognizes that she herself can always learn more.\n\nSo this award is so humbling because I always am thinking about how I can be better at this job, and I know that all of my colleagues are always thinking that too. And so that's another part of the magic ... that teachers understand that we're learners. We're always learners and we model that for our kids, Chaffee said.
Ciudad Hidalgo, Mexico — A new caravan of around 1,800 Central Americans is making its way toward the U.S. The group started crossing into Mexico last weekend, and the long line to enter stretches back to a bridge on the border.\n\nThousands of migrants left Honduras a week ago after word about a new caravan spread on Facebook. The orderly lines are a stark contrast to October's caravan, when an influx of migrants overwhelmed the Mexican government and created a bottleneck on the same bridge. Some jumped to swim to Mexico instead, and other migrants tore down a fence to gain entry.\n\nWhere there was once a fence, there's now a gate that is wide open. But migrants have to wait on a long line. It's the result of Mexico's new open-door migration policy that is just a week old.\n\nEvery migrant that enters legally first gets a bracelet. With their wristband, they can get a humanitarian visa, which takes about five days. Once inside, migrants are photographed, interviewed, fingerprinted and get iris recognition scans to keep track of who is entering.\n\nMarcos Alonzo, who earned $4 a day back home, left Honduras a week ago with a group. Though he could stay in Mexico for under the new policy, he's bound for the U.S. He said he has heard about President Trump's border wall, but doesn't think it will go up by the time he arrives at the border.\n\nOf the thousands of migrants that made it to the U.S. border in the last major caravan, less than 700 remain in Tijuana hoping for asylum.\n\nCBS News asked officials in Mexico if they are incentivizing migrants to come north. They said the migrants will come no matter what and legal migration provides rights and protections. The question is how many will stay in Mexico and how many will head to the U.S.
Baghdad — Iraq issued a warrant for the arrest of U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday as part of a Baghdad court's investigation into the killing of a top Iraqi paramilitary commander. Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy head of Iraq's largely pro-Iran Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary network, died in the same U.S. drone strike that killed storied Iranian general Qasem Soleimani at Baghdad airport on January 3 last year.\n\nThe strike on their motorcade was ordered by Mr. Trump, who later crowed that it had taken out two (men) for the price of one.\n\nAn arrest warrant against the outgoing President of the United States of America, Donald Trump, has been issued in accordance with the provisions of Article 406 of the Iraqi Penal Code, Iraq's Supreme Judicial Council confirmed in a statement on Thursday, adding that the investigations would continue to identify others who participated in committing this crime, whether they are Iraqis or foreigners.\n\nThe United Nations special rapporteur for extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Agnes Callamard, has described the twin killings as arbitrary and illegal.\n\nIran already issued a warrant for Mr. Trump's arrest in June, and asked Interpol to relay it as a so-called red notice to other police forces around the world. Interpol made it clear there was no intention to meet Iran's request.\n\nUnlike adversary Iran, Iraq is a key U.S. ally in the Middle East. While the U.S. military presence in the country has diminished significantly under President Trump's orders, to around 2,500 troops at present, billions of U.S. tax dollars have been spent, and American forces have been killed, shoring the Iraqi government up to defend itself from terrorist groups, and to help it resist the influence of its neighbor to the north, Iran.\n\nA member of Lebanon's Hezbollah stands in front of a picture depicting senior Iranian military commander General Qassem Soleimani (right) and Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis who were killed in a U.S. attack, during a ceremony marking the first anniversary of their killing in the southern village of Khiam, Lebanon, January 3, 2021. AZIZ TAHER/REUTERS\n\nIt was the court for east Baghdad that actually issued the warrant for Mr. Trump's arrest under Article 406 of Iraq's penal code, which provides for the death penalty in all cases of premeditated murder, but the Supreme Judicial Council, which runs all of Iraq's courts much like the U.S. Department of Justice, confirmed the warrant.\n\nWhile the soon-to-be former U.S. president may be unlikely to visit Iraq any time soon, the order for his arrest highlights the huge resentment against U.S. policy in Iraq, and the deeply entrenched influence of Iran among Iraq's large Shiite Muslim population.\n\nThe U.S. military had braced for any possible retaliatory attacks by Iran or Iraq's pro-Iran militias, which have fired rockets at American bases many times since the strike last year, but there was no violence on the anniversary of the attack over the weekend.\n\nIraq's national government has at times struggled to maintain cordial relations with both its biggest global partner, Washington, and its neighbor Iran.\n\nEven as the court issued the arrest warrant on Thursday, U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Matthew Tueller met nearby in Baghdad with President Barham Salih to discuss the importance of reducing tensions and avoiding escalation, supporting efforts to enhance security, stability and peace in the region, and resolving the outstanding issues through dialogue, according to a statement posted on Salih's Twitter feed (below).
As vaccinations continue across the U.S., some companies are offering financial incentives to encourage their workers to get their shots.\n\nInstacart Inc., the grocery delivery service, announced Thursday that it would provide a $25 stipend for workers who get the COVID-19 vaccine. It joins others, including Trader Joe's and Dollar General, which plan to pay workers extra if they get vaccinated.\n\nOur goal with the introduction of our new vaccine support stipend is to ensure that, when the time comes, Instacart shoppers don't have to choose between earning income as an essential service provider or getting vaccinated, Instacart CEO Apoorva Mehta said in a statement.\n\nSan Francisco-based Instacart has nearly doubled its mostly gig workforce to about 500,000 to meet a surge in demand for online grocery shopping since the pandemic erupted in the U.S. last spring.\n\nGrocery chain Trader Joe's, which has more than 50,000 employees, said Thursday it will give its employees two hours of pay per dose for getting the vaccine. The Monrovia, California-based company said it will also shift around schedules to make sure employees have time to get vaccinated.\n\nDollar General said Wednesday it will give employees the equivalent of four hours of pay if they get the vaccine. The Goodlettsville, Tennessee-based retailer said it employs 157,000 people.\n\nA vaccine advisory panel at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control voted late last month on recommendations for vaccine distribution. The panel said grocery workers — which would include Instacart and Dollar General's employees — should be in the second group to receive shots after health care workers and nursing home residents.\n\nIt is up to each state to decide how and when to adopt the CDC's recommendations. Some states have already opened eligibility to the second group, which also includes firefighters, police, teachers, corrections workers, postal employees and people 75 and older. There are around 50 million people in that group.\n\nCompanies can mandate that workers get COVID-19 vaccines as a requirement for employment, although they must make accommodations for medical or religious reasons, according to guidance from the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nHowever, most companies are reluctant to impose such mandates, said Sharon Perley Masling, a partner at the law firm Morgan Lewis who has been advising clients on workplace issues surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. The emergency nature of the vaccine's FDA approval makes it impractical for many companies to require it, given that the shots are not available to most of the population, she said.\n\nStill, Masling said the companies she works with are taking various steps to strongly encourage their workers to get vaccinated, including internal public relations campaigns showing top executives who are eligible getting the shots. Other incentives include free child care, paid time off and freebies such as pizza delivery and other gifts, she said.\n\nIt's good for employees, it's good for their communities and it's good for ensuring the continuation of business operations, Masling said.\n\nThe push to vaccinate comes amid signs that some people — even health care workers — are reluctant to get the shots, contributing to a slower-than-hoped-for rollout of the mass vaccination effort in the U.S. Masling said many companies are still trying to figure out how their staff feels about taking the shots, with some sending out internal surveys.\n\nConcerns over side effects\n\nIn a survey last month by the Society for Human Resource Management, nearly two-thirds of U.S. workers said they were likely to get the vaccine when it becomes available. Still, 36% said they were not likely to get vaccinated, citing as their main reason concerns about side effects. SHRM surveyed workers from 529 U.S. households using the AmeriSpeak Omnibus survey, a probability-based panel developed by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\nScientists say the vaccines have been rigorously tested on tens of thousands and vetted by independent experts, and there have been no signs of widespread severe side effects from the shots.\n\nNot every company is offering incentives. Delivery app DoorDash, another big platform for gig workers, said it has asked the CDC and governors to prioritize delivery workers in vaccine distribution. But it doesn't plan to provide perks for workers who get vaccinated.\n\nTarget Corp. doesn't plan to provide incentives either, but said it will make the vaccine free and accessible to its 350,000 employees. Target said 1,700 of its stores have a CVS pharmacy on site that will offer the vaccine to staff when it's available.\n\nAlbertsons, a grocery chain with 2,250 U.S. stores and 300,000 employees, also isn't doling out financial incentives. Like DoorDash, it's asking state and local authorities to make sure its workers get priority for the vaccine.\n\nA separate SHRM survey last month found that while about two-thirds of U.S. employers planned to encourage employees to get vaccinated, only 3% have decided to require it for at least some workers. That could change, since 55% of employers said they were unsure if they would eventually require it, according to survey of 955 members of SHRM, an organization of about 300,000 human resource professionals.\n\nBad press\n\nMany large companies have faced criticism over how they have treated their employees throughout the pandemic, from shoddy sick leave policies to poor working conditions. Companies, ranging from meatpacking plants to Amazon, have grappled with worker absences and outbreaks that have forced temporary shutdowns of their factories and warehouses. There is also a looming debate in Congress over whether employers should be exempt from legal liabilities related to coronavirus exposure, as more begin to recall their employees back to offices and other work sites.\n\nPublic perception provides a strong incentive for companies to get their workers vaccinated, said Laura Boudreau, an economics professor at Columbia Business School who specializes in labor rights.\n\nA lot of them have had to defend their reputations in terms of how they are treating their employees throughout the pandemic, Boudreau said.\n\nInstacart is among several companies that have lobbied for their workers to be prioritized for vaccines. The company also has faced criticism, and some worker unrest, over allegations that it had not done enough to protect its shoppers — gig workers who make multiple trips a day to grocery stores to shop for and deliver groceries to people who order on its app — who don't receive health insurance through the company or guaranteed paid sick leave.\n\nThe company says it has distributed 620,000 free safety kits to its workers, including face masks and hand sanitizers. It introduced a new policy in March to provide 14 days of paid leave for gig workers who are diagnosed with COVID-19 or have been ordered to quarantine because of potential exposure.
Amazon is asking third-party sellers to stop shipping most goods to its warehouses as the online retailer grapples with a coronavirus-fueled surge in demand for medical supplies and household products.\n\nThe ecommerce company told sellers in a note on Tuesday that it will only ship household staples, medical supplies and other high-demand products unless Amazon already has other purchased items on hand in its warehouses.\n\nThe pause lasts through at least April 5 and will apply to Amazon shipments in the U.S. and European Union. Products already in Amazon warehouses, or those currently in transit on their way to the facilities, will not be affected, the company said.\n\nThe change affects third-party shippers that rely on Amazon's fulfillment service, as well merchants who sell directly to Amazon. Sellers that package and ship their own goods will not be affected by the temporary change in policy..\n\nWe are seeing increased online shopping, and as a result some products such as household staples and medical supplies are out of stock, Amazon told CBS MoneyWatchh in a statement. With this in mind, we are temporarily prioritizing household staples, medical supplies and other high-demand products coming into our fulfillment centers so we can more quickly receive, restock and ship these products to customers.\n\nProducts that Amazon is prioritizing for shipment must fall into one of six categories, according to the company:\n\nbaby products\n\nhealth and household products\n\nbeauty and personal care products (including personal care appliances)\n\ngrocery products\n\nindustrial and scientific products\n\npet supplies.\n\nAmazon told customers last weekend that waits for some products could take longer than the usual two days. Many common items, such as soap and diapers, were listed as unavailable on Tuesday.\n\nThird-party businesses constitute most of the sellers on Amazon's vast platform, generating more sales than even the products sold directly by Amazon, according to Business Insider. While they are independent businesses, these sellers often heavily rely on Amazon and have little say in setting the terms of their interaction.\n\nWe understand this is a change to your business, and we did not take this decision lightly. We are working around the clock to increase capacity, Amazon wrote in its note.\n\nThat didn't assuage many sellers, with some writing that the change could put them out of business. Others called for compassion for the workers who pack and ship Amazon goods and whose jobs don't allow them to work from home during the coronavirus crisis.\n\nFor most of us, this would mean inconvenience. For those at risk, it means a matter of life and death, one poster wrote in a seller forum.\n\nAmazon has faced a surge in orders as coronavirus panic sets in across the U.S. and more people shop online. The company announced on Monday it would hire 100,000 additional workers to deal with unprecedented labor needs.
Iowa Rep. Steve King is facing criticism after he defended white nationalism and white supremacy in an interview. White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive? King said to The New York Times. Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?\n\nHe later posted a statement to Twitter, after the interview was published, saying, I want to make one thing abundantly clear; I reject those labels and the evil ideology represented by those terms. I am simply a Nationalist, he said, not a white nationalist or white supremacist.\n\nI condemn anyone that supports this evil and bigoted ideology which saw in its ultimate expression the systematic murder of 6 million innocent Jewish lives, he wrote. Like the Founding Fathers, he wrote, I am an advocate for Western Civilization's values.\n\nKing, one of the most right-wing members of Congress, also told Times that he is not a racist, saying his Twitter timeline shows him greeting Iowans of all races and religions in his Washington office. He said he supports immigrants who come to the U.S. legally and assimilate, since the culture of America matters more than race.\n\nMy statement on the New York Times article. pic.twitter.com/IjBHgZYgRD — Steve King (@SteveKingIA) January 10, 2019\n\nSeveral top Republicans spoke out to condemn the remark. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said, Everything about white supremacy and white nationalism goes against who we are as a nation. Steve's language is reckless, wrong, and has no place in our society. The Declaration of Independence states that 'all men are created equal.' That is a fact. It is self-evident.\n\nMinority Whip Steve Scalise said, I think it is offensive to try to legitimize those terms. I think it was important that he rejected that kind of evil because that's what it is, it's evil ideology.\n\nAnd the number three House Republican leader, GOP Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney, blasted King's remarks, tweeting about the Times interview, These comments are abhorrent and racist and should have no place in our national discourse.\n\nThese comments are abhorrent and racist and should have no place in our national discourse. Steve King asks how terms 'white nationalist' and 'white supremacist' became offensive | TheHill https://t.co/yL23avpNFB — Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney) January 10, 2019\n\nKing's comments come as he is facing a primary challenge in 2020 from state Sen. Randy Feenstra. King fended off a challenge from Democrat J.D. Scholten in 2018, although he won by a narrower margin than he has in the past.\n\nIn the interview, King credits himself with President Trump's shift to his own hardline views on immigration. Donald Trump came to Iowa as a real nonideological candidate, King said. He recalled telling Mr. Trump, I market-tested your immigration policy for 14 years, and that ought to be worth something. King in the past has shown a model of a 12-foot border wall he had designed on the House floor.\n\nKing, 69, has attained notoriety for statements and positions that appeal to white nationalists. His history of controversial comments caused the National Republican Congressional Committee to rescind all support for him before the 2018 election, with NRCC chairman Steve Stivers condemning him and white supremacy and hate. King has lost support from a number of prominent corporate donors, and the state's Republican governor has also spoken out against him.\n\n-CBS News' Rebecca Kaplan contributed reporting.
Amman, Jordan — The United Arab Emirates said Friday that it would reopen all of its land, sea and air borders with Persian Gulf neighbor Qatar, the latest significant step to end a crisis that was a major diplomatic thorn in the side of U.S. policy for several years. In a statement carried by the country's official news agency, UAE Foreign Minister Anwar Gargash said the end of his country's blockade of Qatar would include practical measures of airlines, shipping and trade.\n\nThe move followed a Gulf Cooperation Council summit on Tuesday in the ancient Saudi city of Al-Ula, where a breakthrough agreement marked the end of the rift between Qatar and its neighbors. Late on Monday, Saudi Arabia, the biggest country involved in the blockade, said it would reopen its airspace and land border to Qatar in the first step toward ending the crisis.\n\nSaudi Arabian television carried live pictures of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman warmly welcoming Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani to the summit. The pictures from the tarmac at the Saudi airport sent a powerful signal.\n\nEmir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani (L) is welcomed by Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman ahead of the 41st Summit of Gulf Cooperation Council in Al-Ula, Saudi Arabia, January 5, 2021. Royal Council of Saudi Arabia/Handout/Anadolu Agency/Getty\n\nThe breakthrough came after an extensive diplomatic push led by President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner. It also came just ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's swearing in.\n\nThe incoming U.S. administration is expected to take a firmer stance towards the kingdom than President Trump, whose family has close ties with the Saudi royals.\n\nThe blockade began in 2017 when Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt accused the tiny state of Qatar of supporting Islamic extremists — charges Qatar has always firmly denied.\n\nQatar not only survived, but managed largely to avoid any serious impact from the blockade thanks to its wealth, accumulated over decades from vast natural gas reserves.\n\nThe GCC leaders signed an agreement this week for a complete resumption of diplomatic relations between the boycotting Arab quartet and Qatar, and to jointly confront any threats to Gulf security.\n\nThe chief threat alluded to in the statement by the Gulf nations was that posed by their other neighbor, Iran. The U.S. government has long relied on its allies in the Gulf to present a united front against the Shiite Muslim powerhouse.\n\nQatar Airways has announced that its planes will return to using Saudi airspace. During the blockade, the airline was forced to divert most of its flights through Iranian airspace, and Washington was keen to deprive Tehran of the hundreds of millions of dollars in overflight fees the Qataris were paying.\n\nMinister of State for Foreign Affairs for the United Arab Emirates, Anwar Gargash, speaks at an event at Chatham House in London, England, July 17, 2017. REUTERS/Neil Hall\n\nSpeaking at a virtual news conference on Thursday, Gargash, the UAE's top diplomat, said his country was behind this deal, and positive about the prospect of reestablishing relations with Qatar.\n\nHe added, however, that restoring full diplomatic ties would take time and depended on Qatar's future dealings with Iran, Turkey and Islamic extremist groups. We have a very good start, said Gargash, but we have issues with rebuilding trust.\n\nThe basic issues that the Emiratis are talking about are still there, Dr. Hassan Barari, professor of international relations at Qatar University, told CBS News on Friday. The differences are going to continue, but the problem is how to manage these differences.\n\nPeople here in Doha insist on their right to have a different foreign policy, Barari said of Qatar's leadership. The reconciliation with Saudi Arabia is very important for Qataris, but for them it is more important to be independent.
With four days to go until Monday's Iowa caucuses, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is ramping up his rhetoric and taking direct shots at two of his top rivals for the Democratic nomination, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nCBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman says Buttigieg has tried to position himself as the candidate who can offer bold policy proposals while also unifying the country. His attacks on Biden and Sanders come as recent polls show him lagging behind Biden and Sanders, albeit narrowly.\n\nI hear Vice President Biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new, Buttigieg said Thursday at a town hall in Decorah. But history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up, is to look to the same Washington playbook and recycle the same arguments and expect that to work against a president like Donald Trump, who is new in kind. Buttigieg then pivoted to Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who favors Medicare for All and free college tuition at public universities.\n\nI hear Senator Sanders calling for a kind of politics that says you got to go all the way here and nothing else counts, Buttigieg continued. And it's coming at the very moment when we actually have a historic majority, not just aligned around what it is we're against, but agreeing on what it is we're for.\n\nButtigieg's campaign has also recently sent out fundraising emails that say nominating Sanders would be a risk at a time when Democrats are desperate to reclaim the White House from President Trump.\n\nButtigieg has remained in the top tier of Democratic presidential hopefuls in early state polls, although his position may have slipped since the start of the year. The most recent Des Moines Register poll found him to be the first choice of 16% of likely Iowa caucus-goers while Sanders was the first choice of 20%. The same poll in November found Buttigieg leading the Democratic field in the state with 25% support.\n\nThe millennial veteran has acknowledged in recent weeks that he needs to show versus tell that he's the best candidate to face Mr. Trump with strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, which holds its first-in-the-nation primary on February 11th. He hopes that a solid finish in the first two contests will help him compete in Nevada and South Carolina, where is currently polling well behind Sanders and Biden.\n\nWhile maintaining that the current campaign should not focus on re-litigating past issues, Buttigieg did reference the ongoing spat between Sanders and Biden over Social Security. The Vermont senator has accused Biden of being open to cutting Social Security in the past, a charge the former vice president's team disputes.\n\nThis is no time to get caught up in reliving arguments from before, Buttigieg said. The less 2020 resembles 2016 and our party, the better. After his town hall in Decorah, Buttigieg told reporters he is trying to clarify to caucus-goers what he stands for. We're competing, Buttigieg told reporters. It's a respectful but important competition, about what the best approach is going to be. I admire and respect everybody running for president, but we've got to make sure that we win.\n\nMeanwhile, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson notes that at a speech in Newton, Iowa, Biden spoke about the importance of 2020 Democrats focusing on Mr. Trump and not swinging at each other. The former vice president said we shouldn't let this Democratic race slide into negative attacks. The temptation is too much for some Biden added, while highlighting President Obama's comments a few months back about 2020 hopefuls avoiding a circular firing squad.\n\nEarlier in the day, Biden delivered a speech in Waukee, Iowa where he didn't name a single rival Democrat and kept his focus solely on the president. In the home stretch, Biden is making a similar pitch to the one he had from the start: The soul of the nation is at risk due to Mr. Trump's actions and moral turpitude.\n\nFROM THE CANDIDATES\n\nJOE BIDEN\n\nAs Joe Biden goes up on the air in Nevada with several new ads in a buy totaling $167,503 this week, per Kantar CMAG data, the former vice president's campaign is also rolling out several new endorsements in the state, according to CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. Among them are two former Clark County party chairs, the vice president of the Washoe County School District Board of Trustees, and online betting CEO Joe Asher, who was listed last year as a top fundraising bundler for Biden.\n\nMICHAEL BLOOMBERG\n\nThursday Democratic presidential candidate and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg released his Super Bowl Ad, in a spot that the campaign says highlights the urgent need to prevent gun violence in America, according to CBS News Campaign Reporter Tim Perry.\n\nThe 60 second spot, titled George, will air Sunday February 2 during Super Bowl LIV. It features the story of Calandrian Simpson Kemp, a mother whose son, George Kemp Jr., was shot and killed in 2013.\n\nIn the aftermath of her son's death, Kemp has been an active member of Moms Demand Action. I chose to devote the entire sixty-second ad to gun safety because it matters to communities across the country and it will be a top priority for me as president, Bloomberg said in a statement released by the campaign.\n\nCalandrian's story is a powerful reminder of the urgency of this issue and the failure of Washington to address it. People will be rooting for different teams in the Super Bowl, but virtually all Americans — including people in both parties and a majority of gun owners — support universal background checks and other common sense gun laws.\n\nBloomberg, a billionaire businessman, has used his enormous fortune to self-fund his campaign. Despite a late entrance into the race and his decision to skip the first four voting states, including Iowa where voting begins Monday, Bloomberg is on track to spend more than $275 million on television, radio and digital ads by the end of the week.\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG\n\nEquality California, the state's largest LGBTQ civil rights organization, and its recently-launched Nevada partner Silver State Equality announced Thursday they would be backing Pete Buttigieg after an unanimous vote by the groups' endorsement committee. CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin says the former South Bend mayor can use all the help he can get as early voting kicks off in California, where Buttigieg has failed to crack double digits in recent polls of the Super Tuesday contest.\n\nWhile we did not endorse Mayor Pete simply because he's gay, the historic nature of his candidacy has already had a transformational impact on the LGBTQ community, Rick Zbur, the groups' executive director, said in a statement, also praising Elizabeth Warren and Tom Steyer for their extremely strong platforms.\n\nTULSI GABBARD\n\nCongresswoman Tulsi Gabbard's long-shot campaign for the presidency is betting big on a strong performance in New Hampshire, where the primary historically rewards outsiders and underdogs, on occasion. Over 42% of the state's voters here are registered as undeclared, which allows them to vote in either party's primary in February. And while other candidates focus on next week's Iowa caucuses, Gabbard has all but moved to New Hampshire, spending more days in state (a sum total of 34) than any other Democratic candidate across December and January.\n\nA recent analysis by the New York Times reveals just one-fifth of Obama-Trump voters returned to the Democratic Party in the 2018 midterm elections, while three-quarters voted Republican. Roughly half of the New Hampshire towns Gabbard has visited backed Mr. Trump in 2016. Her populist, anti-war message attracts fans from both ends of the political spectrum, including former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and former Democratic Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich. But she has struggled to attract much of any support from mainstream Democratic voters who pick their party's nominee.\n\n[S]he's pulling from Trump voters. It could make it even tougher for Trump to win, particularly in states like Michigan and New Hampshire, Bannon told CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS\n\nBernie Sanders' first TV ads to air in Super Tuesday states are up today in California and Texas. In a 30-second ad aired in Dallas and Los Angeles this morning for the first time, Sanders talks about the rich getting tax breaks while the middle class continue to struggle. That's what happens when billionaires are able control the political system, Sanders says on camera.\n\nCBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice says he goes on to talk about his campaign being funded by the working people and says those are the people he will represent. In another ad aired in Dallas and San Francisco, a narrator talks about Sanders fighting to raise wages and for health care.\n\nOur country is at a turning point. Hard working people betrayed by Trump struggling to survive, the narrator claims. In this moment, we need a fighter. Bernie Sanders, we know he'll fight for us as president because he always has, the voice concludes. According to Kantar/CMAG tracking, Sanders is on track so far to spend $1.5 million in California and more than $160,000 in Texas through February 25th, but more ad buys are likely. On Tuesday, the campaign announced it would me making $2.5 million in ad buys in the two states this week. Super Tuesday is March 3rd.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP\n\nThe Trump Campaign released one of two ads set to air during the Super Bowl on Thursday, reports CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. The 30-second ad released Thursday morning called Stronger, Safer, More prosperous highlights the record unemployment numbers the United States has seen during the first three years of the Trump administration. According to the campaign, the other 30-second ad will not be released prior to the game.\n\nANDREW YANG\n\nWith the Iowa caucuses quickly approaching, rumors are swirling around Des Moines about campaigns making alliances if their candidate doesn't hit the 15% viability threshold. I think some campaigns have reached out to our team, Andrew Yang told reporters at an event yesterday, CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe reported.\n\nA source close to the Yang campaign with knowledge of the situation tells CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster that former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign reached out about a deal. The rules of the Iowa caucuses require candidates to have 15% support in a room to win delegates, meaning some people have to settle for their second or third choice. Yang said yesterday that he isn't inclined to instruct his supporters where to go if he doesn't enough support in a caucus room. I frankly think I'd have a hard time getting them to do anything that they're not naturally inclined to do, Yang said. In Waukee today, Biden ignored questions about whether his campaign is trying to make deals with other campaigns and one of his top surrogates, former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack, also sidestepped questions on the issue, according to O'Keefe.\n\nSTATE-BY-STATE\n\nGEORGIA\n\nA popular clergyman has announced his bid to run as a Democrat in the special election for U.S. Senate in Georgia. CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson reports that Reverend Ralphael Warnock, the pastor of Martin Luther King Jr.'s Ebenezer Baptist Church, announced his U.S. Senate bid Thursday in a Twitter video. Warnock is the first high-profile candidate to enter the race.\n\nMatt Lieberman, the son of former Senator Joe Lieberman, and Ed Tarver, a former attorney, are also competing for the Democratic nomination. Nevertheless, Warnock's entry could rally Democrats ahead of a fight with what may be a divided Republican Party in the Peach State.\n\nThe special election is being held to fill the seat held by former Senator Johnny Isakson, who resigned at the end of last year. Governor Brian Kemp appointed financial executive Kelly Loeffler to Isakson's Senate seat following his resignation at the end of 2019. Loeffler will run in the special election in November to carry out the final two years of Isakson's term, and she has the support of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Senate Leadership Fund. However, Congressman Doug Collins announced his bid for the seat on Wednesday, setting up what could be a bitter primary fight within the GOP.\n\nDemocrats are targeting a number of House seats in Georgia, as well as the state's two Senate seats. Georgia has been a Republican stronghold for decades, but Democrats hope the state's changing demographics could help them win it back this year.\n\nCONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE\n\nIN THE HOUSE\n\nThe House Democrat campaign arm is confident in using healthcare as their central message for 2020, but didn't specify any immediate plans for any specific ads in some of the most competitive districts they have to defend, reports CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro.\n\nIn a meeting with reporters on Thursday, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Cheri Bustos detailed the party's million-dollar national cable ad buy, which is meant to set a dialogue about healthcare and the Senate's inaction on the House's H.R. 3 bill, which aims to lower prescription drug prices.\n\nThe ads will run in 14 cable markets across the country, including in areas that overlap with competitive Democrat districts. Bustos pointed to good fundraising numbers from 2019 and the length of the election cycle, as to why no district-specific ads are currently being run. Let's just remember the election is nine months off, Bustos said. We want to make sure that going into November 2020, we've got everything we've got at our disposal when people are paying very close attention and making those decisions of who they're going to vote for.\n\nDespite setting their own off-year record, the Republican campaign arm was outraised by the DCCC by more than $40 million in 2019, and vulnerable Democratic members raised $92 million in the off year. Two such members, Joe Cunningham of South Carolina and Anthony Brindisi of New York, both released their first 2020 ads this week, one of the first direct responses in these districts to months of ads from outside Republican groups about impeachment.\n\nBustos, a Democrat from a district won by Mr. Trump, said any member being targeted by outside ads should run on their records, and listed off a number of Democrats she says have compelling arguments. They've got the stories to tell they're getting the job done. Cindy Axne's done 57 town hall meetings, Joe Cunningham has closed more than 1,500 cases…Lauren Underwood working to bring down the cost of insulin, she said. When you see somebody going after you, you can also use that as motivation. And I think they're doing that, but they're doing all the right things.\n\nBustos also said after he dropped out, Beto O'Rourke reached out to the DCCC offering his help if needed. The DCCC themselves have reached out to several former presidential candidates, such as Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker and Secretary Julian Castro, about potential involvement in the House election cycle. Where ever it makes sense, you bring people in where they're going to resonate well, she said.
The U.S. economy has thrown Federal Reserve policymakers a wicked curveball ahead of their two-day policy meeting next week: A sudden, unexpected slowdown in the pace of job gains was reported on Friday.\n\nIt wasn't supposed to be this way. For months, Fed officials have responded to a surge in business confidence, consumer sentiment and stock market prices by preparing for further rate hikes this year. More recently, the Fed has also openly discussed the process of tapering its $4 trillion-plus balance sheet swollen by years of bond-buying stimulus.\n\nBut now, with jobs slowing, auto sales braking and the economic data overall disappointing on a scale not seen since early 2015, the Fed suddenly looks out of sync. While equities remain unshakable -- thanks mainly to a persistent bid in megacap tech stocks like Amazon (AMZN) -- other asset classes are responding: Gold is rising, long-term interest rates are falling and the dollar is losing ground.\n\nAlthough the unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent last month (lowest since May 2001), it was the result of a reduction in the labor force. Total payrolls grew just 138,000 vs. the 185,000 expected, which was below the lowest estimate. Moreover, April and March job gains were revised lower by a net 66,000. It was an ugly showing.\n\nAt this late hour, it's unlikely to keep the Fed from raising rates by another quarter-point at its June meeting. Indeed, futures market odds of a rate rise this month strengthened on Friday's jobs news, rising to 94.6 percent from 92.3 percent prior. On May 5, the odds stood at 78.5 percent.\n\nBut for the rest of the year, the outlook for further rate hikes is dimming somewhat: The odds of a one-and-done at the June meeting, with the Fed holding pat through the end of the year, rose to nearly 50 percent from just 37.7 percent a month ago.\n\nDeutsche Bank economist Joseph LaVorgna doesn't believe the downshift in economic data is enough to completely derail the Fed's current rate-hike policy, however, since it reflects the intense tightening underway in the labor market. This is not unlike what's happening in the housing market, where robust demand is being limited by scarce supply of homes for sale, lowering deal volume. Simply too few qualified workers are in the labor force. Thus, hiring is slowing.\n\nAt time point, assuming the economic expansion continues, businesses will be forced to choose between continuing to forgo new hires (and limiting their ability to grow) or getting into a bidding war for the best workers by paying more. The latter would lead to the much-delayed, long-heralded boost to wage inflation -- and would deliver a much-needed salve to middle-class incomes.\n\nIn response, LaVorgna is looking not only for a hike this month and an unveiling of a balance-sheet tapering plan in September, but another quarter-point hike in December. That would push short-term interest rates to 1.5 percent.\n\nSo far, stocks are agreeing with this optimistic outlook. But bonds, currencies and commodities are suggesting otherwise, pointing to a deflationary future reflective of a possible policy error by the Fed.\n\nWe'll know more about where the economic data is pointing this week, with an update on labor productivity and costs on Monday and job openings on Tuesday.
President-elect Joe Biden introduced members of his science team on Saturday. He says science will always be at the forefront of my administration, and is elevating the post of science adviser to Cabinet level — a White House first.\n\nBiden said the scientists will ensure everything we do is grounded in science, facts and the truth.\n\nA pioneer in mapping the human genome — the book of life — is in line to be director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and adviser on science. Eric Lander is the founding director of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and was the lead author of the first paper announcing the details of the human genome. He would be the first life scientist to have that White House job. His predecessor is a meteorologist.\n\nIn accepting his nomination, Lander said the opportunities we have, and the challenges we face, are greater than ever before, but stressed that no nation is better equipped to address these challenges because no nation is as diverse. No one can top America in that regard, Lander said. But we have to make sure not only that everyone has a seat at the table, but a spot at the lab bench.\n\nDr. Alondra Nelson of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, who Mr. Biden has picked to be deputy science policy chief, also emphasized the importance in expanding opportunities in the STEM fields. As a Black woman researcher, I am keenly aware of who is missing from these rooms, Nelson, a social scientist who studies science, technology and social inequality, said of her career.\n\nFrances Arnold, a California Institute of Technology chemical engineer who won the 2018 Nobel Prize in chemistry, and MIT vice president for research and geophysics professor Maria Zuber will lead the outside science advisory council. Lander held that position during Obama administration. Zuber said she hopes to restore trust in science, and pursue breakthroughs that benefit all people.\n\nThe president-elect also said on Friday he is retaining the director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Francis Collins, who worked with Lander on the human genome project. Biden also is naming two prominent female scientists to co-chair the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.\n\nCollins, in an email statement, called Lander brilliant, visionary, exceptionally creative and highly effective in aspiring others.\n\nI predict he will have a profound transformational effect on American science, Collins said.\n\nThe job as director of science and technology policy requires Senate confirmation.\n\nScience organizations were also quick to praise Lander and the promotion of the science post.\n\nElevating (the science adviser) role to member in the President's Cabinet clearly signals the administration's intent to involve scientific expertise in every policy discussion, said Sudip Parikh, chief executive officer of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world's largest general scientific society.\n\nLander, also a mathematician, is a professor of biology at both Harvard and MIT and his work has been cited nearly half a million times in scientific literature, one of most among scientists. He has won numerous science prizes, including a MacArthur genius fellowship and a Breakthrough Prize, and is one of Pope Francis' scientific advisors.\n\nLander has said in talks that an opportunity to explain science is his Achilles' heel: I love teaching and more than that, I firmly believe that no matter what I do in my own scientific career, the most important impact that I could ever have on the world is going to be through my students.\n\nVice President-elect Kamala Harris said she was particularly excited about the administration's push to elevate science due to her upbringing. Harris said her mother, an endocrinologist, lived by the scientific method, teaching her daughters that it's not a failure to reevaluate a hypothesis when the facts don't line up.\n\nPresident-elect Biden and I will not only listen to science, we will invest in it.\n\nCorrection: The Associated Press erroneously reported the institution for Alondra Nelson. She is a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, not at Princeton University.
Washington — The Supreme Court on Monday allowed the Trump administration to enforce its most ambitious effort yet to restrict legal immigration, giving U.S. officials the green light to implement a sweeping rule that critics warn will shut America's doors to low-income immigrants and people of color.\n\nIn a 5-4 ruling, the conservative-leaning high court approved the Trump administration's request to set aside a ruling by a federal judge blocking the so-called public charge regulation while the merits of the case continue to be argued in lower courts. The court's conservatives, including President Trump's appointees, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, agreed to allow officials to enforce the policy, while the liberal justices would've denied the administration's request\n\nBy dramatically expanding the definition of a public charge, or an economic burden on society, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) regulation unveiled in August gives officials more power to deny visas and green card applications from immigrants and prospective immigrants whom the government determines rely, or could rely, on certain public benefits like food stamps and government housing programs.\n\nFor decades, the U.S. has asked most green card and visa petitioners to prove they won't be a public charge on the country, but the new rule scraps Clinton-era guidance that said only the use of cash benefits could be analyzed by immigration caseworkers.\n\nThe Trump administration has defended the new restrictions as a way to ensure immigrants are self-sufficient. But opponents believe the policy is an attempt by the White House to circumvent laws passed by Congress by instituting what's essentially a wealth test designed to limit the immigration of poorer people from developing countries.\n\nIf you listen to Trump talking about how he wants a points-based immigration system and wants people who are wealthier, better educated, higher skilled and not from countries he's spoken of in derogatory, profane language — this is it. This is the policy that aims to do that, without Congress approving it whatsoever, said Doug Rand, a former White House official under President Obama who co-founded Boundless, a company to help immigrants navigate the U.S. immigration system.\n\nIt's a way to screen out people, not just from developing countries, but from any country, that the government has decided aren't wealthy enough, aren't healthy enough and don't speak English well enough, Rand added.\n\nSoon after its final version was published last summer, the public charge rule was blocked in court, with one federal judge calling it repugnant to the American dream. However, in recent weeks, circuit courts lifted three of the four nationwide injunctions against it, leaving only an order by a federal judge in New York standing.\n\nEarlier in January, the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to set aside the remaining nationwide injunction — a request that has now been granted. U.S. immigration officials will now be able to implement the new restrictions in every part of the country other than Illinois, where the rule is still blocked under a statewide injunction.\n\nIn a concurring opinion joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, Gorsuch expressed profound concerns about lower court judges issuing nationwide injunctions that transcend the cases before them. He said both the government and those suing it are rushing through cases with national implications in the hopes of obtaining emergency rulings, instead of methodically developing arguments.\n\nThe routine issuance of universal injunctions is patently unworkable, sowing chaos for litigants, the government, courts, and all those affected by these conflicting decisions, Gorsuch wrote in his concurring opinion.\n\nKen Cuccinelli, an immigration hawk and the second highest-ranking official at the Department of Homeland Security, said his department is making preparations to enforce the public charge policy following the Supreme Court's decision.\n\nSelf-sufficiency and self-reliance are key American values not to be litigiously dismissed, but to be encouraged and adopted by the next generation of immigrants, Cuccinelli said in a statement Monday evening. We plan to fully implement this rule in 49 states and are confident we will win the case on the merits.\n\nExpanding the definition of public charge\n\nThe term dates back to 1882, when the U.S. was trying to limit immigration from developing, non-white countries. The year it was first codified, the U.S. also enacted the discriminatory Chinese Exclusion Act, which barred the entry of most Chinese immigrants on the premise that they jeopardized the good order of certain localities.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the Clinton administration issued guidance saying only cash benefits could be considered when determining whether an immigrant might be a public charge. The Trump administration's policy substantially expands this term by broadening the type and amount of benefits that count against immigrants seeking to stay in or move to the U.S.\n\nUnder the new regulation, caseworkers would consider enrollment in the widely used Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), certain federally funded Medicaid benefits, and a variety of forms of government-subsidized housing, including Section 8 vouchers.\n\nOfficials would deem an immigrant a public charge and deny the application if they determine he or she is more likely than not to use one of the considered benefits for 12 months or longer over the span of three years. On certain occasions, those deemed a public charge could post a bond for an amount no less than $8,100.\n\nTo determine whether prospective immigrants are likely to become a public charge, caseworkers would also take into account their wealth, age, educational skills, English language proficiency and health. Since those expected to be affected by the rule are not eligible for most public benefits because they aren't U.S. citizens or permanent residents, critics of the regulation say it is designed to severely restrict immigration based on those factors.\n\nThis regulation is not about public benefits, except insofar as it's scaring people to stay away from public benefits — even when they don't have to, said Rand, the former Obama official.\n\nWhat the rule really does is it imposes a 25-factor test that's never been done before, that Congress has never authorized, that is going to make it less likely for someone to get a green card based on their age, their income, their heath, the number of children they have, whether they have a mortgage or student loans and a whole bunch of other things that have nothing to do with public benefits, he added.\n\nImmigrant advocates are concerned about the effects the rule could have on people who are technically not subject to it. Researchers have documented a chilling effect stemming from the proposed changes that have prompted some fearful immigrant families, including families that include U.S. citizens, to drop out of benefits programs.\n\nThe stringent requirements proposed by the public charge rule are not the only moves the administration has taken to impose limits on legal immigration.\n\nIn October, the White House issued a proclamation allowing the government to reject visa applications from would-be immigrants it determines won't be able to cover their medical costs. The plan, which is still being held up in court, could deny entry to approximately 375,000 prospective immigrants each year, according to an estimate by the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.\n\nA proposed rule by USCIS published in November would hike petition fees for immigrants seeking U.S. citizenship, for young undocumented immigrants known as DREAMers trying to renew protections from deportation and for victims of crimes who are seeking to stay in the country through their assistance to law enforcement. The proposal would also make the U.S. one of only four nations that require asylum-seekers fleeing persecution to pay a fee to file affirmative requests for protection.\n\nJan Crawford contributed reporting.
U.S. equities drifted lower on Friday as buyer exhaustion set in after an exciting week.\n\nCooling investors' ardor were mixed tech earnings, lingering disappointment with President Donald Trump's tax proposal from Wednesday, a lack of progress on health insurance reform and worries about a potential government shutdown. But above all, investors were unhappy with a very weak initial reading of first-quarter U.S. GDP. Growth came in at just 0.7 percent as consumer spending posted its weakest result since the end of 2009.\n\nBut the stock market's losses were really quite modest, with Nasdaq even pushing to a new intraday high at the open. Wall Street, it seems, tried to focus on the silver linings in the report ahead of another busy week of economic reports and a Federal Reserve moneary policy decision on Wednesday.\n\nThe GDP report sure wasn't pretty: Growth slowed from the 2.1 percent pace set in 2016's fourth quarter to its worst pace in three years (chart below). Personal consumption increased just 0.3 percent following a 3.5 percent expansion in the previous quarter, which is exceedingly odd given off-the-charts survey-based measures of consumer confidence in recent months. Inventories were a drag.\n\nBright spots included nonresidential fixed investments (businesses are ramping up spending, especially in the mining sector) and residential investment, which increased at a 13.7 percent seasonally adjusted annualized rate for its second straight quarter of very strong gains. The export gap also narrowed, slightly.\n\nPaul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, doesn't believe the weak first-quarter performance will keep the Fed from hiking rates again in June. Aside from the silver linings outlined above, he noted a tendency for weakness in first quarters that seasonal adjustments haven't fully accommodated. Since 2011, the average growth rate for the quarter is just 0.9 percent vs. 2.4 percent in each of the other three.\n\nAnother likely drag was unseasonably warm weather, which reduced consumer spending for utilities.\n\nOverall, IHS Markit expects full-year 2017 GDP growth to come in around 2.5 percent, led by the double-digit gain in residential investment, the best growth in five quarters.\n\nWe'll know more when the Fed holds its policy meeting on Wednesday, May 3, and when the latest jobs numbers are released next Friday. Also coming are updates on personal income and consumption, motor vehicle sales (a recent worry) and fresh data on labor costs and productivity.
U.S. commandos have captured a chemical weapons expert for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), CBS News national security correspondent David Martin reports.\n\nThe capture has led to at least one strike in Iraq's second largest city, Mosul, which was designed to destroy a building where mustard gas munitions were believed to be manufactured. There are 12 reported instances of ISIS using mustard gas on the battlefield.\n\nIt's the first known major success of Washington's more aggressive policy of pursuing the jihadis on the ground.\n\nThe Obama administration launched the new strategy in December, deploying a commando force to Iraq that it said would be dedicated to capturing and killing ISIS leaders in clandestine operations, as well as generating intelligence leading to more raids.\n\nU.S. officials said last week that the expeditionary team had captured an ISIS leader but had refused to identify him, saying only that he had been held for two or three weeks and was being questioned.\n\nThe two Iraqi officials identified the man to The Associated Press as Sleiman Daoud al-Afari, who worked for Saddam Hussein's now-dissolved Military Industrialization Authority where he specialized in chemical and biological weapons. They said al-Afari, who is about 50 years old, heads ISIS' recently established branch for the research and development of chemical weapons.\n\nHe was captured in a raid near the northern Iraqi town of Tal Afar, the officials said. They would not give further details.\n\nThe officials, who both have first-hand knowledge of the individual and of the ISIS chemical program, spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to brief the media.\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition began targeting ISIS' chemical weapons infrastructure with airstrikes and special operations raids over the past two months, the Iraqi intelligence officials and a Western security official in Baghdad told the AP.\n\nAirstrikes are targeting laboratories and equipment, and further special forces raids targeting chemical weapons experts are planned, the intelligence officials said. They and the Western official spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the press.\n\nISIS has been making a determined effort to develop chemical weapons, Iraqi and American officials have said. It is believed to have set up a special unit for chemical weapons research, made up of Iraqi scientists from the Saddam-era weapons program as well as foreign experts. Iraqi officials expressed particular worry over the effort because ISIS gained so much room to operate and hide chemical laboratories after overrunning around a third of the country in the summer of 2014, joined with territory they controlled in neighboring Syria.\n\nStill, its progress has been limited. It is believed to have created limited amounts of mustard gas. Tests confirmed mustard gas was used in a town in Syria when ISIS was launching attacks there in August 2015. Other unverified reports in both Iraq and Syria accuse ISIS of using chemical agents on the battlefield.\n\nBut so far, experts say, the extremist group appears incapable of launching a large-scale chemical weapons attack, which requires not only expertise, but also the proper equipment, materials and a supply-chain to produce enough of the chemical agent to pose a significant threat.\n\nMore than a symbolic attack seems to me to be beyond the grasp of ISIS, said Dan Kaszeta, a former U.S. Army chemical officer and Department of Homeland Security expert who is now a private consultant. Furthermore, the chemicals we are talking about are principally chlorine and sulfur mustard, both of which are actually quite poor weapons by modern standards.\n\nThe United States has been leading a coalition waging airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria for more than a year. The campaign has been key to backing Iraqi and Kurdish forces that have slowly retaken significant parts of the territory the militants had seized.\n\nBut after coming under pressure at home for greater action against the militants, the Obama administration moved to the tactic of stepped up commando operations on the ground.\n\nLast year, U.S. special forces killed a key ISIS leader and captured his wife in a raid in Syria, but the new force in Iraq was intended as a more dedicated deployment. American officials have been deeply secretive about the operation. Its size is unknown, though it may be fewer than 100 troops.\n\nThis is a no-kidding force that will be doing important things, was about all Defense Secretary Ash Carter would say about the force in testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee in December.
The Louisville Metro Police Department has formally fired two of the officers involved in the March police raid that killed emergency medical worker Breonna Taylor. Louisville mayor Greg Fischer confirmed the firings Wednesday and CBS News obtained copies of the termination letters.\n\nThe department last week sent pre-termination letters to Detective Myles Cosgrove, who an FBI analysis determined fired the shot that killed Taylor, and Detective Josh Jaynes, who applied for the search warrant at Taylor's Louisville home. In the letter to Jaynes obtained by CBS News, Interim Police Chief Yvette Gentry said Jaynes was not truthful when he claimed he received information from a U.S. Postal Inspector that Taylor's ex-boyfriend had been receiving suspicious packages at Taylor's home.\n\nLouisville police detectives Myles Cosgrove, left, and Joshua Jaynes, right, were involved in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor. LMPD\n\nThe raid was linked to a drug investigation into the ex-boyfriend, Jamarcus Glover, who did not live there. Kenneth Walker, Taylor's boyfriend, said police did not announce themselves before they battered in the door and he fired a shot because he feared someone was trying to break in. Three officers including Cosgrove returned fire, killing Taylor. No drugs were found in the home.\n\nCosgrove was fired for violating the department's deadly force policy, according to a termination letter obtained by CBS News.\n\nAnother officer who opened fire, Brett Hankison, had already been fired from the force for blindly firing shots into Taylor's apartment from outside. He was charged criminally with endangering Taylor's neighbors when bullets flew into their unit. No one has been charged in Taylor's death. Kentucky attorney general Daniel Cameron said Cosgrove and another officer who opened fire, Sergeant Jon Mattingly, were justified in their actions because they were returning the shot fired by Walker.\n\nBoth Cosgrove and Jaynes will have the opportunity to appeal the decision.\n\nIn the termination letter, Gentry cited Cosgrove's statements to internal investigators in which he described seeing a distorted shadowy mass and flashes of big light. Gentry said the statements made it clear that Cosgrove did not properly identify a threat, as department policy requires, before firing 16 shots.\n\nThe shots you fired went in three different directions, indicating you did not verify a threat or have target acquisition, Gentry wrote. In other words, the evidence shows that you fired wildly at unidentified subjects or targets located within an apartment.\n\nGentry wrote that Mattingly, who was shot in the thigh by Walker, was able to identify and describe the individual whom he targeted as a threat and against whom he returned fire.\n\nGentry wrote in a Dec. 30 letter to Mattingly that he had been exonerated after an investigation into whether he violated the department's use of force and de-escalation policies.\n\nIn her letter to Cosgrove, Gentry wrote the detective failed to follow procedure when he didn't activate his body camera. Gentry said Cosgrove had attempted to explain his actions during a pre-termination meeting by referencing information about the effects an imminent threat can have on an officer's performance. But she wrote, I cannot justify your conduct or in good conscience recommend anything less than termination.\n\nBreonna Taylor and Kenneth Walker\n\nCosgrove's lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CBS News.\n\nIn a termination letter to Jaynes, Gentry wrote that Jaynes did not independently confirm with a U.S. postal inspector that Glover had been receiving packages at Taylor's home, as he claimed in a search warrant affidavit he filed with a judge.\n\nI acknowledge that you believe you prepared the search warrant in good faith, Gentry wrote. However, you failed to inform the judge you had no contact with the U.S. Postal Inspector. Your sworn information was not only inaccurate, it was not truthful.\n\nThomas Clay, an attorney for Jaynes, confirmed the termination but couldn't provide more information. Last week, Clay disputed the allegations that Jaynes lied on the search warrant application.\n\nThe news of the firings came the same day the Fischer announced that Erika Shields, the former chief of the Atlanta Police Department, has been chosen as the next chief of the Louisville Metro police department. Shields will be the fourth person to lead the department since Taylor's death. She will be sworn is as chief on Jan. 19.\n\nSome in the community took to social media to decry the selection of Shields, who stepped down from her position in Atlanta after one of her officers fatally shot Rayshard Brooks, a Black man, during a June arrest in a Wendy's parking lot. The officer, Garrett Rolfe, was fired and charged with counts including felony murder.\n\nFischer said Shields stepped down from her position in Atlanta so the community there could heal, and described her as a leader committed to reform. Speaking Wednesday, Shields said the Louisville department is at a crossroads and believes it can become a model for other departments across the country. The department is undergoing a review of all police practices that's expected to be complete by the end of the month, reports CBS station WLKY.\n\nI commit to begin my work here with a focus on rebuilding community trust, trust that I believe was already eroding prior to Breonna Taylor's killing, Shields said.\n\nCostanza Maio contributed reporting.
The food stamp program will be funded through February should the government shutdown continue, the Trump administration says.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue is asking states to issue the February benefits on or before Jan. 20 so that they can be paid to the nearly 40 million Americans in the program. SNAP is already fully funded for January.\n\nRecipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, had been at risk of having their assistance disrupted next month because of the shutdown.\n\nThe administration announced its plans as the White House worked to limit Republican defections on spending bills in the House this week, which Democratic leaders have scheduled in hopes of driving a wedge between GOP lawmakers on the shutdown. Democrats set a vote for Thursday on the agriculture bill, which is largely made up of payments for food stamps, knowing that it would put pressure on Republicans to abandon their leaders and vote for the measure.\n\nA disruption in food stamp benefits is cause for very substantial concern, wrote Dottie Rosenbaum, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, on Monday. Many low-income households would be at risk of serious hunger and hardship.\n\nThat would put more pressure on food banks and local charities to provide food and assistance to poor families, she noted. More than 250,000 supermarkets, grocery stores and other retailers that accept food stamps would see a significant drop in SNAP redemptions, which can contribute a large share of sales, she added.\n\nShort-term funding bill\n\nThe USDA said it can fund SNAP through February thanks to the short-term funding bill that ran out on Dec. 22. That bill included a provision giving federal agencies the authority to make obligated payments to support certain programs for 30 days after its expiration date.\n\nBrandon Lipps, an acting deputy undersecretary, said other USDA programs will also be funded through February, including school lunches, food distribution programs on Indian reservations and child nutrition programs. The latter includes WIC, which provides nutritional assistance to pregnant women, mothers and babies.\n\nUnder the provision, the SNAP program will operate as it normally does and without any lapse in service, but with an earlier deadline for states to request benefits through a process called early issuance. That process is typically used during natural disasters, Lipps said, enabling states anticipating hurricanes or other weather events to distribute monthly benefits ahead of time.\n\nLipps said the USDA is sending letters to all state agencies to explain the process and will issue a blanket waiver of department regulations to allow for the early issuance.\n\nWe know this is a time of great uncertainty, and no doubt anxiety for people who rely on SNAP and are dealing with tough times, Lipps said. I hope it's reassuring for us to make clear today that we're committed to maintaining service to SNAP clients without interruption to the extent possible under the law.\n\n$3 billion contingency fund\n\nThe SNAP program will cost roughly $4.8 billion for February, and those funds have already been appropriated through the expired spending bill. But if the shutdown lasts until March, the USDA could be forced to dip into its reserves to help fund the program, and its $3 billion SNAP contingency fund won't cover a full month of benefits.\n\nPerdue is a strong proponent of scaling back the SNAP program, and publicly supported a GOP House measure to strengthen work requirements for food stamp recipients. The measure garnered no support in the Senate and didn't make it into the final farm bill, which President Donald Trump signed into law in December.\n\nThe Trump administration has announced its intent to try and limit SNAP use through regulation, crafting a proposal to limit the ability of states to waive the program's work requirements.
The shortlist for Amazon's (AMZN) second headquarters is out, with the online retail giant releasing a list of the top 20 contenders on Thursday.\n\nGetting from 238 to 20 was very tough – all the proposals showed tremendous enthusiasm and creativity, Holly Sullivan of Amazon Public Policy said in a statement. Through this process we learned about many new communities across North America that we will consider as locations for future infrastructure investment and job creation.\n\nSeattle-based Amazon said it received 238 proposals from cities and regions hoping to be the home of the company's second headquarters.\n\nThe List:\n\n\n\n\n\nAtlanta, Georgia\n\n\n\nAustin, Texas\n\n\n\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\n\n\nChicago, Illinois\n\n\n\nColumbus, Ohio\n\n\n\nDallas, Texas\n\n\n\nDenver, Colorado\n\n\n\nIndianapolis, Indiana\n\n\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\n\n\nMiami, Florida\n\n\n\nMontgomery County, Maryland\n\nNashville, Tennessee\n\n\n\nNewark, New Jersey\n\n\n\nNew York City\n\n\n\nNorthern Virginia\n\n\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\n\n\n\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\n\n\nRaleigh, North Carolina\n\n\n\nToronto, Ontario\n\n\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\n\n\nThe announcement came the day after tech titan Apple (AAPL) said it will build a second corporate campus and hire 20,000 workers in a $350 billion, five-year commitment to the U.S. economy. The company has not announced a chosen city; Apple's main headquarters is in Cupertino, Calif.\n\nAmazon kicked off its hunt for a second headquarters in September, promising to bring 50,000 new jobs and spend up to $5 billion. Proposals from cities, states and regions were due last week, and Amazon made clear that tax breaks and grants would be a big deciding factor on where it chooses to land.\n\nThe company has said the second headquarters, dubbed HQ2, will be a full equal to its Seattle home.\n\nLeaders in Pennsylvania hailed the inclusion of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh on the list of finalists. Gov. Tom Wolf said he wasn't surprised, given Pennsylvania's location in the heart of the East Coast along with its nationally ranked educational institutions and a workforce equipped to support future growth.\n\nBoth Pittsburgh and Philadelphia have a real shot, and we will continue to support these locations by making the case to Amazon that Pennsylvania is a unique and tremendous place to build a business, make a home, and pursue your happiness, Wolf said.\n\nOfficials in some metro areas that didn't make the cut expressed disappointment.\n\nNew Hampshire's groundbreaking proposal to recruit Amazon was the most comprehensive business marketing plan our state has ever produced, Gov. Chris Sununu said in a statement. While we always knew that our bid was considered a long shot, we are excited that it is already serving as a template for other businesses that now have New Hampshire on their radar.\n\nNew Hampshire's Amazon proposal was centered in Londonderry and emphasized the state's lack of a sales or income tax.\n\nMemphis, Tennessee, Mayor Jim Strickland said the state gave it out best shot, while expressing confidence that the process will help it attract other businesses.\n\nThe city offered Amazon $60 million in cash incentives.
President-elect Joe Biden's proposal to more than double the federal minimum wage would provide an urgently pay hike to millions of low-income workers and help stem inequality in the U.S., economists and labor advocates said.\n\nIn detailing his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief proposal on Thursday, Mr. Biden called for raising the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour, saying, No one working 40 hours a week should still be below the poverty line.\n\nA fatter paycheck could help many Americans regain their financial footing during the ongoing recovery, including essential workers such as grocery clerks and home health aides whose jobs have put them on the front lines of a pandemic yet whose earnings are among the lowest.\n\nEvery worker should be paid a $15 minimum wage, and essential front-line workers need hazard pay for the enormous health and safety risks they face during this pandemic, Marc Perrone, international president of the United Food and Commercial Workers, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement. The union represents 1.3 million retail, grocery and other workers.\n\nThe incoming Biden administration's plans to hike pay also reflects a dramatically shifting political landscape — one that could finally bear fruit for low-paid workers and grassroots activists who for years have pushed for better pay and working conditions as part of the influential Fight for $15 campaign.\n\nThe labor movement's success can be seen in minimum wage hikes in 20 states this year, with another four states and Washington, D.C., also set to raise their baseline pay later this year. In Florida, meanwhile, voters in December narrowly approved a measure to increase the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026.\n\nSame federal wage since 2009\n\nThe federal minimum wage, currently $7.25 an hour, hasn't budged since 2009, the longest period without an increase since it was passed in 1938. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, as of 2019 (the latest year for which data is available) 392,000 American workers were earning $7.25 an hour; another 1.2 million earned even less (tipped workers are among those exempt from the $7.25 minimum.)\n\nOverall, roughly 2% of all U.S. workers who are paid hourly earn $7.25 or less, government data show. Hiking the national minimum to $15 an hour by 2025 would lift 1.3 million workers above wages that put them below the poverty line, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe CBO also estimated the move would cost 1.3 million American jobs, a claim long made by conservative economists. Mr. Biden's call to boost the minimum wage to $15 an hour is the absolute last thing that unemployed workers need right now, Michael Farren, an economist with the right-leaning Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said in an email. After all, they can't benefit from higher wages if those higher wages result in slower job growth.\n\nHeidi Shierholz, senior economist and director of policy at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, rejects the argument that a wage hike would lead to job losses.\n\nThat claim of job loss isn't supported by evidence — it's likely an overestimate of negative employment impact. But even if you accept their findings, they still find the benefits far outweigh the costs, Shierholz, formerly the Labor Department's chief economist under Barack Obama, told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nHigher labor costs from raising the minimum wage would be shouldered by businesses, some of which would pass them on to consumers, according to the CBO.\n\nThe loss in business income would be mostly borne by families well above the poverty line. All consumers would pay higher prices, but higher-income families, who spend more, would pay more of these costs, the CBO stated in a 2019 report.\n\nThere's no question that this would reduce inequality and reduce poverty by shifting money from corporate profits to low-wage workers, Shierholz said. Biden has made it very clear that his economic plans are really centering on racial justice and gender economic justice. We know women and men of color are likely to be at the low end of wage distribution.\n\nAlthough labor groups cheered Mr. Biden's push for higher wages, the proposal's political path is uncertain. Democrats could try to pass Mr. Biden's broader relief plan under budget reconciliation rules that skirt the Senate's 60-vote requirement.\n\nBut non-budget related items are prohibited from reconciliation, which means items like a minimum wage increase could not be included in a reconciliation measure, according to Brian Gardner, chief Washington policy analyst at investment bank Stifel Nicolaus.\n\nDemocrats in the House are expected in coming weeks to reintroduce a version of the Raise the Wage Act that passed in the chamber two years ago, but never gained traction in the Republican-controlled Senate.
SALT LAKE CITY -- The Mormon church said Tuesday it will sever all ties with the Boy Scouts of America at the end of next year and place its remaining 425,000 boys into a gospel-focused youth program it is developing. The move ends a nearly century-old relationship that was based on their shared values.\n\nThe announcement by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Boy Scouts didn't come as a complete surprise after the religion last year removed 185,000 boys between the ages of 14 and 18, signaling that an end to the long-time alliance was near.\n\nJoining the Boy Scouts is practically automatic among Mormon boys, and the religion has long been the biggest sponsor of Boy Scout troops in the United States. The Mormon boys who will be leaving represent about 18.5 percent of the 2.3 million youths in the organization.\n\nThe Mormon church said in a statement that the move is about creating its own youth program that it can use for its increasingly global membership, but the two organizations' values clearly have been diverging in recent years.\n\nThe Boy Scouts decided in 2015 to allow gay troop leaders and announced last year it would allow girls in its ranks. Last week, the organization said it will change the name of its flagship program next year to Scouts BSA to account for the inclusion of girls.\n\nLike other conservative faiths, the Mormon church opposes gay marriage and teaches that being in a homosexual relationship is a sin. The church initially said it was deeply troubled by the Boy Scouts' policy change on gays but stayed with the organization after receiving assurances it could appoint troop leaders according to its own religious and moral values.\n\nThe religion has also traditionally used separate youth programs for boys and girls.\n\nThe Mormon church said in a statement the new program that will start in 2020 will help all girls and boys, young women and young men discover their eternal identity, build character and resilience, develop life skills and fulfill their divine roles as daughters and sons of God.\n\nThe still to be developed program will likely include outdoor activities and character building similar to Boy Scouts, but it won't be modeled after Boy Scouts or use ranks. The 14-to-18-year-old boys that left the Boy Scouts already focus on church-related activities and community service.\n\nMore than half of the church's 16 million members live outside the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America in a statement thanked the thousands of Mormons who have served as scout leaders and wished the religion well on its new program. The organization said individual Mormons who wish to stay in Boy Scouts would be integrated into other troops.\n\nThe Boy Scouts' move to allow girls, announced last October, marked the organization's latest momentous policy shift.\n\nThe organization already has started allowing girls into the Cub Scouts. So far, nearly 4,000 girls have joined roughly 170 Cub Scout packs participating in the first phase of the new policy, and the pace is expected to intensify this summer under a nationwide multimedia recruitment campaign titled Scout Me In.\n\nThough the flagship program's name is changing, the parent organization will remain the Boy Scouts of America, and the Cub Scouts - its program serving children from kindergarten through fifth grade - will keep its title, as well.\n\nThe Boy Scout movement had been entrenched in Mormon culture for as long as anyone can remember.\n\nIn 2013, the church put on an extravagant theatrical production inside its 21,000-seat auditorium in Salt Lake City to commemorate the 100th anniversary of its alliance with the Boy Scouts.\n\nA Boy Scout training complex in West Virginia is named after former Mormon church President Thomas S. Monson, a longtime member of the Boy Scouts' executive board and a major supporter who died earlier this year.
A four-year college degree has long been seen as the ticket to a better life. These days, though, it may be your ticket to a job as a file clerk, at least initially.\n\nAccording a national survey by CareerBuilder, 41 percent of employers are hiring college grads for jobs that were once held largely by those with only a high school education. That figure is up from 37 percent of companies that reported doing so in a CareerBuilder survey released last year.\n\nAnd in turn, workers with bachelor's degrees have lost ground to those with greater credentials. CareerBuilder also reported that 33 percent of employers are hiring more workers with master's degrees for jobs that used to be held largely by those with bachelor's degrees, up from 27 percent in the previous survey.\n\nWhy do employers continue to raise the educational bar? Because they can.\n\nWhile the labor market has improved significantly since the Great Recession, it's still chock-full of job seekers who have college degrees but not necessarily the skills in highest demand, including science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).\n\nIn fact, CareerBuilder reported that more than half of employers that are hiring workers with college degrees to fill jobs traditionally held by high school grads said they could do so because of the current labor market.\n\nEmployers are certainly willing, in this excessive [labor] supply situation, to hire people who might appear to be overqualified, said David Passmore, a professor in the workforce education and development program at Pennsylvania State University.\n\nSaddled with high levels of student loan debt, many college grads feel they may have no choice but to take whatever job they can get. That might help to explain why wages for the college educated haven't climbed all that much during the recovery: About half of college grads earn less now than they did in 2000. Median earnings for college grads stood at $24.99 per hour in 2016, about 1.5 percent less than they earned in 2000, according to a study by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI).\n\nThe labor market is in a funky condition, said Passmore. We have lower unemployment, but at the same time we have not had any real wage growth. Even though people are being hired, many are willing to accept a lower wage to get into the labor market, he added.\n\nOf course, CareerBuilder's findings are even more disillusioning for those with just a high school degree. Not only are they losing jobs to workers with more education, but the pay gap between college-educated workers and high school grads has never been larger. On average, college grads earned 56 percent more than high school grads in 2015, according to an EPI study. That was the largest such gap in EPI's figures dating back to 1973.\n\nOn the bright side, some of the fasting-growing jobs in the U.S. require technical skills, such as computer coding, but not necessarily a four-year college degree, explained Passmore. In 2015, as many as 7 million job openings required coding skills, according to a report from analytics firm Burning Glass.\n\nPeople with high school-level skills are being hollowed out of the labor market, said Passmore. He added, If you have a high school diploma without technical skills, you will be in a long line of people waiting for jobs.
ATLANTA -- A white police officer in the greater Atlanta area who told a black driver I don't care about your people has resigned, authorities said Friday.\n\nPolice in suburban Cobb County on Friday released Officer Maurice Lawson's resignation letter, which arose from a traffic stop in November. The letter was dated a day earlier and submitted to Chief John Houser.\n\nWe accepted his resignation effective today, Houser said in a statement.\n\nLawson had recently been suspended without pay for two weeks after completing a 16-hour training class on de-escalation.\n\nAttorney Lance LoRusso said Friday Lawson believed that the current media attention and the scrutiny anticipated upon his return to duty would have proved to be an unnecessary distraction to him, and the men and women of the Cobb County Police Department, CBS affiliate WGCL reported.\n\nThe president of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #13 created a GoFundMe account to raise money for Officer Lawson and his family following his suspension. Some of the donors who have given money are fellow officers, WGCL said.\n\nIn dashcam video of the Nov. 16 incident, Lawson gives motorist Brian Baker two citations. Lawson then says on video, Leave. Go away. Go to Fulton County. Atlanta is in neighboring Fulton County.\n\nLawson wrote in response to Houser's Jan. 15 memo that he said I don't care about you people, not your people. He also wrote that there was no racial motivation behind his comments, but that he had lost his temper when Baker was uncooperative during the stop.\n\nIn the video, Lawson can then be heard asking Baker whether he wants to get out of the car to talk with him. Houser wrote in the memo to Lawson that those words could be seen as an invitation for a possible altercation. Lawson then continued to engage in heated conversation with Baker, Houser wrote.\n\nAfter Baker drove off, Lawson was visibly upset, used profanities and could be saying, I lose my cool every time.\n\nAuthorities said the officer's statements raised concerns it might not have been an isolated incident and led officials to conduct random reviews of video from his other traffic stops and order a fitness for duty evaluation by a physician.\n\nHouser said that Lawson immediately recognized his behavior was contrary to policy and reported his own actions before any investigation had begun -- and before there was any media attention.\n\nLawson was given a Jan. 4 memo from the deputy police chief that proposed the two-week suspension without pay and 20-hours of verbal defense and influence training.\n\nHouser said the Department of Public Safety's Code of Conduct demands that officers show courtesy and tact and that they control their temper.\n\nWe will be reiterating the importance of courtesy and compliance with policy to our members since unbecoming conduct reflects discredit upon the individual and the Department and will not be tolerated, Houser said.\n\nLawson also had been ordered to attend 20 additional hours of training on verbal defense in March.\n\nBut Houser said In preparation for his return to active duty with a field training officer, we reviewed additional videos and additional policy issues were discovered.\n\nHouser didn't offer more details regarding the discovered policy issues.\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Lawson was also involved in an incident last summer in which he followed county commissioner Lisa Cupid, which led the African American commissioner to accuse him of racial profiling. Lawson was cleared of wrong-doing in the Cupid case.\n\nMessages to lawyers of Lawson and Baker were not immediately returned.
Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee have wasted no time in beefing up the investigative staff dedicated to continuing the committee's work on its semi-dormant Russia probe, even as the committee's new membership is still taking shape.\n\nThe new majority has made offers to half a dozen new staffers, CBS News has learned, and is still searching for six more. Among the latest hires are an expert in corruption and illicit finance and a former prosecutor.\n\nThe committee typically does not reveal much publicly about its staff; it is withholding names and most details about potential new hires as some of them progress through a lengthy security clearance process.\n\nThere's a lot of work yet to be done on Russia, a senior committee official told CBS News. What we're doing is we are creating a purpose-built team that will take the point on that.\n\nAs they assume the majority, Democrats under newly appointed Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., will add four members to the committee and more than double its staff, from 11 to roughly 24; Republicans will cut their staff count and, with some members having retired from Congress last year, likely keep their membership even at nine.\n\nAbout seven of the Democrats' new staffers will be dedicated full-time to the committee's residual work investigating alleged connections between President Trump, his campaign associates, and Russian officials – while a handful of other staffers will be available to assist in that investigation on a surge basis, committee officials say.\n\nThough Republicans on the committee declared an end to the Russia probe last spring and issued a final report finding no collusion on the part of the president's campaign, Democrats have long decried the findings as fundamentally unserious, and vowed to keep parts of the inquiry open.\n\nSchiff said in an interview last month that the committee had been deluged with résumés from candidates hoping to join its staff.\n\nThe new staff additions are intended to enhance the committee's ability to make inroads on unanswered questions in the Russia investigation without requiring it to pivot away from the day job of overseeing the intelligence community's 17 organizations, according to committee officials. But the final team will likely bring with it the investigative and prosecutorial specialties Schiff has long sought.\n\nAs ranking member, the California Democrat consistently lamented being hamstrung by a Republican majority which, under then-Chairman Devin Nunes, D-Calif., seemed at best incurious about certain aspects of the Trump-Russia nexus. Schiff has also been publicly wistful about the special counsel's investigative horsepower, telling an audience at the Council of Foreign Relations last February that he was deeply jealous of the team Mueller had assembled.\n\nI have a phenomenal staff, he said at the time, They're bright and they work 24/7, seven days a week and they do it with no windows.\n\n[B]ut they're largely analysts, Schiff continued, they're not trained to be investigators.\n\nThe team now tasked with resuscitating the Russia investigation is not expected to start from scratch, but instead to zero in on some complex financial and legal questions whose answers have largely eluded House investigators.\n\nUnlike in the last Congress, when the investigation was undertaken by existing oversight staff, Chairman Schiff will now have a team better able to answer the key questions about Trump's relationship with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and his cronies, the senior committee official said.\n\nSchiff and some of his fellow committee Democrats have been transparent about what some of their immediate priorities will be. They include the release to the special counsel -- and subsequently to the public -- of all of the committee's Russia investigation interview transcripts; subpoenaing relevant banking and telecommunications records that Democrats have said contain information that implicates the president; and hearing – in some cases a second time – from key witnesses.\n\nAmong the witnesses in which the Democrats have expressed an interest are the president's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, family members like Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner, and other former Trump campaign officials, like George Papadopoulos and Michael Flynn, who have cooperated with the special counsel.\n\nDemocrats have also telegraphed a voracious appetite for new avenues of inquiry, including the Trump Organization's reported offer of a $50 million condo in Trump Tower Moscow to Putin and the notes taken by the interpreter present at the two leaders' one-on-one meeting last July.\n\nWhile Schiff has also previously mentioned the potential for coordination between his committee and that of the Senate Intelligence Committee, whose own investigation will enter its second year later this month, aides from both indicated the change in leadership would not necessarily pave the way for collaboration, and that the two investigations will remain separate.\n\nAs these new priorities come to the fore, Schiff has also vowed restore both comity and sobriety to the committee – though there are no indications that he and Nunes, who will now serve as ranking member, have reestablished lines of communication, let alone decided on an amicable path forward.\n\nIn fact, Republicans on the committee are generally skeptical that the majority, under Schiff, will make a concerted effort to resume normal oversight work as long as the Russia investigation remains a chief focus.\n\nA Republican committee official said Democrats were adopting a posture of Show me the man and I'll show you the crime vis-a-vis President Trump – an apparent reference to the ruthless and manipulative tactics of the former head of the Soviet secret police under Joseph Stalin.\n\nIn a statement, the spokesman for the committee's Republican minority, Jack Langer, said, For months, the committee's Democrats have shown that their principal priority is to launch a sprawling investigation of Trump and to try to manufacture a basis for impeachment.\n\nSo Republicans will focus on doing the oversight of the Intelligence Community that this committee was created to do, and will be pointing out the absurdity of the Democrats' myriad conspiracy theories, Langer said.\n\nRestructuring\n\nThe day-to-day work of oversight is also evolving with the Democrats taking the reins.\n\nWhile parts of the committee's operations and structure are virtually always tweaked by the incoming majority – Nunes, as chairman, put in place a mostly agency-specific subcommittee structure, with groups dedicated to the CIA, NSA and defense intelligence in particular – under Schiff, the four existing subcommittees will also be reorganized.\n\nRather than keeping the subcommittees focused on specific agencies, they will be restructured around thematic challenges – or core missions – across the intelligence community, according to officials familiar with the committee's plans.\n\nOne subcommittee will focus on crucial and increasingly competitive technologies at the heart of the intelligence enterprise, including satellites and other space-based assets, advanced and quantum computing, and challenges like artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\nA second will oversee the intelligence community's counterterrorism and counterproliferation efforts – including those in hotspots like North Korea and Iran – as well as counterintelligence. The third will look at the overall management of the intelligence community, with an emphasis on human capital management, information technology, and security clearance reform. The last will focus on intelligence community's support to the American military and the Pentagon.\n\n[T]hese subcommittees will be empowered to devise and execute their own oversight plans through hearings, deep dives, and travel to [intelligence community] elements at home and abroad, Schiff said in a statement provided to CBS News.\n\nIt sounds to me like a sensible division of labor over four subcommittees and I don't think the agencies will feel like they're overlooked, said Michael Allen, a former majority staff director under Republican chairman Mike Rogers, R-Mich.\n\nThe technologies subcommittee in particular makes a lot of sense, said Allen, who also served on former president George W. Bush's national security council. That topic – especially as China continues stealing critical technology – remains a major concern in the national security community.\n\nMark Lowenthal, who also served as staff director to former Republican chairman Larry Combest, agreed. This array is more likely to lead to effective oversight, he said. While there are agency-specific problems, a lot of issues that you worry about – whether you are managing or overseeing – transcend the intelligence agencies, across the board.\n\nLowenthal, who also served in policy and management roles in the executive branch as vice chairman of the National Intelligence Council and as an assistant director of central intelligence, said the new structure will likely provide the committee with more visibility into the intelligence community's most urgent challenges.\n\nOne of the things people always complain about in the intelligence community is 'stovepipes,' he said. Well, if you set up committees on an agency basis you replicate those stovepipes.\n\nThis seems a much better way to get a sense of what's going on and where Congress can help figure out what needs doing, Lowenthal said.\n\nThe committee, once it is fully constituted, will still need to vote in order to finalize the new structure and assign new subcommittee chairs.\n\nFrom there, other business items, both regular and extraordinary, and ranging from the release of dozens of witness transcripts, to the issuance of subpoenas, to standard open hearings, are expected to be put in motion later this month or in early February.\n\nIt is unclear if Nunes, who for a time stepped away from the committee's Russia investigation amid an ethics investigation, will participate in the committee's witness interviews, once they recommence.
The following is a transcript of the interview with former special presidential envoy Brett McGurk that aired Sunday, Jan. 20, 2019, on Face the Nation.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'd like to now welcome Brett McGurk. He was President Trump's envoy to the global coalition fighting ISIS, but he resigned last month in protest following the president's decision to withdraw from Syria. In an op-ed this week, he warned America's decision to pull out is giving the terror group new life. Brett, thank you for being here.\n\nBRETT MCGURK: Thanks for having me Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The vice president sat here and reiterated that ISIS is defeated. Is he correct?\n\nBRETT MCGURK: Well they're not defeated. I've been- I've been part of this campaign for four years across two administrations. We've come a- an extraordinarily long way. And in 2014 this organization controlled territory of eight million Syrians and Iraqis. It was committing genocide against Christians and Yazidis and minority groups. It was planning attacks against us in the homeland. It was carrying them out in Paris, that killed Americans in Brussels and Paris. We've come a long way. We have taken away a lot of their physical space but we always said and our policy was, until most recently, we had to make sure that we completed the enduring defeat of ISIS. What that meant was taking away their physical space and retaining a presence so they could not resurge. And what just happened, was that policy was really just reversed overnight. So as a leader of the coalition we've been telling our partners on the ground and around the world, we've built a coalition of 75 countries, that we were prepared to stay in Syria for some time. And on instructions from the White House, we were telling them, we'd stay in Syria until we completed the enduring defeat of ISIS, not just the physical territory. We'd stay in Syria until the Iranians left Syria and also until there was a irreversible political progress in Geneva to end the ultimate civil war. We had told that to our partners on the ground. We had told that to our coalition partners and it was reversed in a conversation between the president and a foreign leader. Leadership- American leadership really counts. Leadership built this coalition. It led to these gains against ISIS. And leadership requires some presence on the ground and also consistency. And it was the total reversal of our policy that made it- I just I concluded I could not be effective in carrying out those new instructions.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We should point out, you joined the State Department under President Bush. You then served under President Obama and then under President Trump. Can you clarify there, I point that out because you serve Democrats and Republicans. Why did you resign specifically?\n\nMCGURK: Well again look I- look--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The President has alleged it's political.\n\nMCGURK: Well I've- I've served all three administrations. I've worked on policies that I fully supported. You work on policies here in the government that you might not support. You argue your case. In this case, I think the entire national security team had one view, and the president in a conversation with President Erdoğan just completely reversed the policy. You know the president has said, I think he's right, you never- you never telegraph a punch when you're in a military campaign. You also don't telegraph your retreat. I've probably traveled to Syria more than any other American civilian official. I know our people in Syria. I- my heart is broken and we're all- our thoughts are with the families and loved ones that were just killed. In this campaign in Syria since 2015, we've had two Americans killed in action. We built this campaign plan, to answer for those who believe that we should not be over invested in these confl- conflicts. Americans are not fighting. We built a force of 60,000 Syrians to do the fighting. American taxpayers are not spending money on civilian stabilization or reconstruction costs. The coalition is doing that. So it was a sustainable campaign plan and we had in- the pieces in place, as we defeat the physical caliphate, to begin a very serious negotiation with some pretty hostile actors in Syria, including Russia. And we had worked with the Russians diplomatically basically to draw lines on the map at the Euphrates River and we said, Look you don't cross that river. If you cross that river we'll kill you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we- have we have a map we can put up just so people understand that what you're saying is- is actually having a real world impact on the ground what President Trump did. And possibly lose the territory that the U.S. has cleared out?\n\nMCGURK: Well the minute you say- the minute you announce to the world that you're leaving, a vacuum opens up and all the other powers in the region start making different calculations. And we have to work things out in Syria with Russia, and our presence on the ground matters. And the two to three thousand Americans we have on the ground are not just any American soldiers. They are our most elite, most highly trained forces. Again I visited them from the beginning of the campaign- I was one of the first civilians on the ground way back in the battle of Kobanî. They have done an incredible job. It is those forces that allow the force of the Syrian Democratic Forces with 60,000 Syrians that we have helped build and enable, they allow that force to be effective. If you simply pull out American forces without a plan for what comes next, it is going to open up a signif- significant vacuum. I know the vice- vice president said we're gonna look for coalition partners to take our place. As the former leader of the coalition, I just don't think that that is credible. I know what it takes in these coalition capitals for them to put their blood and treasure on the line with us. It takes American leadership and takes American presence. And we've just told the world that we're no longer going to be present. So it'll have a dramatic ramification. And that's why, what I wrote in the Washington Post, I think we have to really accept some hard truths. I think number one we are leaving. The president has made that clear- we are leaving. And that means our force should be really with one mission: to get out and get out safely. We cannot add additional missions onto our force while they are trying to withdraw under pressure, because withdrawing under pressure from a combat zone is one of the most difficult military maneuvers we can ask our people to do.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And I think what you're sketching out here is- to put it plainly- how we withdraw. Accept that the president's mind- mind is made up. But one of the issues you have here is that the way the president is doing this puts forces at risk and puts the gains at risk. Am I hearing you correctly?\n\nBRETT MCGURK: Announcing you're going to withdraw, and without a plan, and believe me there's no plan for what's coming next. Right now we do not have a plan. It increases a vulnerability of our force. It increases the environment on the ground in Syria. This environment in northeast Syria has been fairly permissive and safe. Again, I've been there almost 20 times and we have been- been very careful with this. It is increasing the risk to our people on the ground in Syria and will open up space for ISIS. But what's most important is we cannot expect a partner such as Turkey to come in and take our place, or another coalition partner to take our place. That is not realistic. And if our forces are under order to withdraw, as at the same time they are trying to find some formula for another coalition partner to come in, that is not workable. That is not a viable plan.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So when the secretary of state says the U.S. military can strike ISIS or any threat in Syria from anywhere, you're saying that's not actually the case? Being on the ground matters.\n\nMCGURK: Well having a presence on the ground is a critical force multiplier that has allowed us to defeat ISIS as a physical- physical space. To give us the intelligence to keep pressure on them and pulling out all of those forces will have very significant repercussions which we need to be ready for.
WASHINGTON -- A joint-NPR/WAMU report published in late November exposed a culture of grade changing to boost graduation rates at a high school in Washington, D.C. On Tuesday, the findings of an audit essentially backed the reported claims, CBS affiliate WUSA reports.\n\nAlvarez and Marsal, a law firm, found that 63.8 percent -- or 113 -- of 177 students who graduated from Frank W. Ballou Senior High School last school year graduated with the assistance of policy violations, which were identified as actions such as awarding a student a 50 percent on assignments they did not finish or may have missed. In total, those students benefited from 222 violations, according to the law firm, WUSA reports.\n\nBallou administrators communicated high passing percentage expectations to teachers, reads the report, which says the school's principal and assistant principals were involved. These expectations were communicated directly to teachers from the Principal to the Assistant Principals in person, via staff meetings, and via email, and were formalized in the Ballou IMPACT rubric.\n\nThe audit was ordered after the report published in November found that more than 50 percent of Ballou's 2017 graduating class passed despite extensive absences.\n\nThe findings of the audit were discussed Tuesday at a City Hall news conference, where Mayor Muriel Bowser told reporters, We rolled out a policy in the 2015-2016 school year intended to raise the bar in our school district (academically) and ensure students were set-up for success.\n\nBut we've never really put in place the training controls or accountability to support it, the mayor said.\n\nWe should've done a better job, Bowser added.
If you've dropped and cracked your iPhone and are looking to exchange it for a newer model, you will probably like the latest retail initiatives from Apple. The company is reportedly launching a more generous iPhone trade-in program at Apple Stores, as well as in-store installations of iPhone screen protectors, the tech site 9to5Mac reports.\n\nRight now, the company's Reuse and Recycle iPhone trade-in program gives customers the chance to trade in older phones for credit toward buying a newer iPhone model. The catch? If these older phones have cracked displays or broken cameras or buttons, they aren't eligible to receive credit. With the new policy, credit will be given for iPhone 5s, 6, and 6 Plus phones that are damaged within reason. The main objective of this, of course, is to encourage phone upgrades rather than just getting a screen repair.\n\nSources told 9to5 Mac that the current trade-in prices for this new program would be $50 for an iPhone 5s, $200 for a 6, and $250 for a 6 Plus.\n\nBeyond the trade-in program, Apple Stores will start installing plastic iPhone screen protectors over the course of the next few weeks. Right now, this is rolling out in a few select stores starting Friday.\n\nWhy wasn't this offered in stores before? Apple Stores were instructed to avoid screen installations over concerns that putting third-party products on iPhones might result in error. For this new program, if the machine install results in error, Apple will give customers free protector replacements and try the installation again.
Beijing — China's economic growth hit a three-decade low in 2018, adding to pressure on Beijing to beef up stimulus measures and settle a tariff war with Washington.\n\nGrowth slowed to 6.6 percent from 2017's 6.9 percent as both the world's appetite for China's exports and domestic consumer spending weakened, official data showed Monday.\n\nForecasters said they expect Beijing to try to shore up growth by making credit cheaper, raising government spending and adopting measures to encourage sales of autos and consumer goods.\n\nCommunist leaders want to steer China toward slower, more self-sustaining growth driven by consumer spending instead of trade and investment. But the slowdown has been sharper than expected, prompting Beijing to boost spending on construction of roads and bridges and to order banks to lend more, especially to the entrepreneurs who generate most of China's new jobs and wealth.\n\nDownward pressure on the economy is increasing, the commissioner of the National Bureau of Statistics, Ning Jizhe, said at a news conference. He cited import controls, volatile financial markets and declining investment spending as factors.\n\nStill, Ning insisted China can resist shocks, saying the long-term trend of stability will not change.\n\nSlowest growth since 1990\n\nEconomic growth in 2018 was the lowest since 1990's 3.9 percent following the violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests centered on Beijing's Tiananmen Square.\n\nGrowth in the last quarter of 2018 dipped to 6.4 percent — the lowest quarterly level since the 2008 global crisis — from the previous quarter's 6.5 percent.\n\nThe government is expected to implement more fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to support economic growth, Yanjun Lin of IHS Markit said in a report.\n\nGrowth in investment, retail spending and factory activity all declined, though analysts pointed to a flicker of improvement in manufacturing in December. It grew by 5.7 percent over a year earlier, up 0.3 percentage points from November.\n\nProduction of plastics, metals and specialized industrial machinery accelerated, suggesting warming expectations for a pick-up in investment, Chaoping Zhu of J.P. Morgan Asset Management said in a report.\n\nTrade war taking a toll\n\nThe trade dispute with the U.S. is proving costly. Exports held up through most of 2018 despite President Donald Trump's tariff hikes on Chinese imports in a fight over Beijing's technology ambitions. But they contracted in December as the penalties began to depress U.S. demand.\n\nThe two sides have imposed tariff hikes of up to 25 percent on tens of billions of dollars of each other's goods in the fight over U.S. complaints that Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. Washington wants China to roll back plans for state-led industry development that its trading partners say violate its market-opening obligations.\n\nThe trade dispute, and reports of job losses and tumbling sales of autos and real estate, have unnerved Chinese consumers that Beijing is counting on to drive growth. As pocketbooks snap shut, the downturn could worsen.\n\nChina's top trade envoy, Vice Premier Liu He, is due to visit Washington for talks Jan. 30-31.\n\nBusiness groups and economists said a decision by Liu and his American counterpart, Robert Lighthizer, to get directly involved would suggest earlier talks by lower-level officials made progress.\n\nTrump said Saturday that trade relations with China were going very well and a deal could very well happen.\n\nBeijing hits the gas\n\nForecasters expect Chinese growth to bottom out this year as Beijing's stimulus efforts gain traction. However, they have pushed back the time frame for that due to weakening exports.\n\nPublic works spending is shaping up to be the engine for 2019, Iris Pang of ING said in a report. However, non-infrastructure business activities will be dismal this year. And debt will grow.\n\nA meeting of Communist Party leaders in December promised tax cuts, better access to bank lending for entrepreneurs and other steps to help the private sector.\n\nChinese leaders have been warning that any recovery would be L-shaped, meaning that companies and investors shouldn't expect growth to rebound to the previous decade's double-digit levels.\n\nForecasters expect growth to decline further this year to 6.3 percent or lower.\n\nChina's economy is likely to weaken further before growth stabilizes in the second half of the year on the back of expanded policy stimulus, Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report.
New research finds tobacco products are being marketed and sold through unpaid content on Facebook despite policies from the social media company restricting or prohibiting the promotion of these items. In many of these instances, there is no safeguard in place to prevent access to minors.\n\nFacebook has a portfolio of policies with the laudable intent of keeping tobacco promotion and sales out of the Facebook platform, lead study author Robert Jackler, M.D., principal investigator of Stanford Research Into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising, told CBS News. These policies are voluntary, and they're a sign of Facebook's commitment to social responsibility. Unfortunately, these policies are inconsistently enforced and a large volume of tobacco promotion exists on Facebook.\n\nFacebook bars paid tobacco advertisements, including ads for cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobaccos, tobacco pipes, hookahs, hookah lounges, rolling papers, vaporized delivery devices and electronic cigarettes. According to its advertising policy, images of tobacco and related products, as well as links to sites where such items can be purchased, are not permitted.\n\nThe social media giant does allow blogs or groups connecting people with tobacco-related interests, as long as they're not selling tobacco or tobacco-related products. But it has an array of rules in place that apply to sales and commercial activity.\n\nFacebook\n\nHowever, new research from the Stanford University School of Medicine finds many tobacco companies are getting around these restrictions through unpaid or organic posts, mainly on their brand-sponsored Facebook pages.\n\nOut of 108 company-sponsored Facebook pages for leading brands of cigars, e-cigarettes, hookah tobacco and smokeless tobacco, the study authors found more than half included purchase links, such as a shop now-type button. Roughly two-thirds of the pages offered sales promotions, including coupons and discounts. All but one featured images of tobacco products.\n\nWhile none of the 21 top traditional cigarette brands had Facebook pages, the study found 10 of 14 online tobacco stores with company-maintained pages promoted popular cigarette brands, such as Marlboro, Camel, Newport, and American Spirit, and included links to purchase them. The results of the study are published online in The BMJ Tobacco Control.\n\nFacebook has what it calls an age-gate requirement for the private sale of regulated goods, including tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. This means anyone under the age of 18 should not be able to access pages promoting the private sale of these items. Facebook notes that the age restriction applies only to private individuals selling items peer-to-peer, not licensed retailers.\n\nThe researchers found only 48 out of the 108 tobacco brand-sponsored Facebook pages had a safeguard in place to restrict access to minors.\n\nThis is important, Jackler says, because younger people are more likely to begin using tobacco, with the risk of becoming addicted to nicotine.\n\nAs the vast majority of smoking initiation occurs during teen years, the tobacco industry has a long history of targeting adolescents, he said. If you want to reach teens in 2018, the place to do it is via social media, especially Facebook, because such a high fraction of youth use it on a daily basis. \n\nRecent figures show 5.8 million U.S. teens aged 13-17 use Facebook, and 65 percent of them say they check it every day. The social network has over 2 billion users worldwide.\n\nThe researchers also analyzed the number of likes for each company-sponsored Facebook page. At the time of the study, 30 of the pages had accumulated 10,000 or more likes, with four of the pages having more than 50,000 likes.\n\nJackler said he and his team were not surprised that tobacco companies found ways around Facebook's restrictions to promote the sale of their products.\n\nWhat did surprise us was the volume and variety of unpaid tobacco promotion we encountered on Facebook and the passivity of Facebook in sustaining its own policies, he said. While Facebook was vigilant in excluding paid tobacco advertisements, which appear to receive special scrutiny, it seems to have no systematic monitoring of tobacco brand sponsored promotion on its pages.\n\nFacebook took issue with some aspects of the study, for example noting that its commerce policies only apply to the Shop Section of a company's page, while the researchers considered a broader array of posts.\n\nIn a statement provided to CBS News, Facebook said:\n\nSelling or advertising tobacco products is not allowed on Facebook. We use a combination of technology, human review and reports from our community to find and remove any content that violates these policies, and provide tools that make it easy for our community to report content they think may violate. Our enforcement is not perfect, but we continue to find ways to strengthen our review and enforcement of our policies.\n\nHowever, Jackler says the issue is not principally with Facebook, but with the tobacco companies.\n\nIt is primarily focused upon exposing yet another example of the cynical way the tobacco industry circumvents any and all attempts to constrain its never ceasing efforts to promote its products, Jackler said.\n\nHe said ultimately, the study exposes loopholes within Facebook that the social network has the opportunity to close.\n\nOur hope is that our study, by highlighting the degree to which tobacco marketers evade their intended restrictions, will encourage Facebook to make a renewed effort to implement their well-intentioned policies, Jackler said.
COLUMBIA, Mo. - Missouri quarterback Maty Mauk has been suspended indefinitely.\n\nAthletic director Mack Rhodes and coach Barry Odom announced the punishment on Monday night after a brief video was posted to Twitter. It shows a person appearing to snort a white, powder-like substance and the accompanying tweet mentions Mauk by name, but there was no confirmation from Missouri that the video shows the quarterback.\n\nRhodes and Odom say in their joint statement they are gathering information regarding the video in question. They say they will take appropriate action once they have all the facts.\n\nIt is Mauk's third suspension in the last four months. He was suspended in September for an undisclosed violation of team policy and again in November for unspecified disciplinary reasons.
DALLAS - Soon Delta Air Lines will require additional documentation for passengers taking service animals with them on flights. This comes amid an increase of incidents involving animals, including a dog attack last year.\n\nStarting March 1, customers will have to show proof of health or vaccinations for their animals 48 hours in advance. In addition, owners of emotional-support animals will need to sign a statement confirming their animal can behave. However, the new requirements don't apply to pets that stay in kennels during flights.\n\nDelta's new rules are aimed at two different types of animals. The first are service animals, which receive specific training to help blind or disabled passengers. Then there are emotional-support animals, which require no training at all. Both fly for free and are not required to be caged during the flight.\n\nFederal regulators have interpreted a 1986 access-to-travel law to allow support animals in airplane cabins and in apartment buildings that do not allow pets. But some people use untrained pets in order to get them on a plane for free, especially since it's easy to go online to buy vests or ID card with a service animal insignia.\n\nDelta said the idea behind the new regulations is to keep trained service animals and emotional-support animals safe from aggressive ones. Overall, the airline says it carries 700 service or support animals every day. But people have tried to fly with everything from turkeys, to snakes, spiders and even gliding possums, which are also known as sugar gliders.\n\nSince 2016, the company reported an 86-percent increase in 'animal incidents', that include animals urinating, biting or showing acts of aggression. Last June, a 70-pound dog flying as a support animal bit another passenger several times in the face on a Delta plane in Atlanta. The victim was hospitalized.\n\nAccording to CBS News correspondent Don Dahler, Tom Panek, CEO of Guiding Eyes for the Blind, was on a Delta flight recently, made miserable by a misbehaving support dog.\n\nFor two and a half hours, passengers had to tolerate this dog while it was barking, lunging and disrupting the flight, Panek said. No one wanted to confront this individual and say that that dog is not appropriate as an emotional support dog.\n\nIt might seem like a harmless way to travel with your pet, but Panek says there are serious repercussions.\n\nIt profoundly affects us because the next time that we go into a restaurant, they may tell me, 'no, you don't have access here', and I wouldn't be able to take three steps without Gus.\n\nNineteen states have laws against calling untrained dogs, service dogs. Arizona is considering legislation to become the twentieth.
The economic recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic has been unprecedented in many respects, but all too familiar in one: The crisis has taken a particular toll on young workers.\n\nAs unemployment around the U.S. was peaking this spring, more than a quarter of young Americans lost their jobs. Most of the country's youngest workers have either lost a job or taken a pay cut during the crash, according to Pew Research — and perhaps not surprisingly, they are also the most likely to report having trouble paying their bills or rent.\n\nYounger people who still have jobs are least likely to have the option of telecommuting, according to a report from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), losing out on a large added measure of protection from the virus, not to mention the cost savings of not having to commute. They're also most likely to have relocated due to the pandemic: For the first time since the 1930s, more young adults in the U.S. are living with parents than not, according to Pew data.\n\nNot only have many young people in this country faced the harsh reality of returning to school without in-person classes at their colleges and high schools, the job prospects for those seeking employment have been particularly bleak, economists at the left-leaning EPI said in a recent report.\n\nYoung workers were among those hit hardest by the coronavirus shutdown this spring. The unemployment rate for 16- to 24-year-olds peaked at 27% in April, according the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. As of November, unemployment among the youngest workers was twice as high as among other employees.\n\nFirst jobs vaporized\n\nThe pandemic has shuttered many of the service industries that have historically employed young people: restaurants, bars, coffee shops and retail stores.\n\nLast year, one in four young workers had a job in the leisure and hospitality sector — an industry that lost 3.3 million jobs in 2020, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports. Another one-fifth of young workers were in the retail sector, which is down 680,000 jobs since the spring.\n\nThis crisis has delayed that very first step into the labor force, said AnnElizabeth Konkel, economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab. It's that first experience of making money — it may have been an office internship, or a cashier in a book store, or restaurant job over summer.\n\nCole Stevens, who graduated from high school this spring, has been working since he was 14 to help with his family's expenses. In April, the Minneapolis-area coffee shop where Stevens worked part-time closed, putting him and other high school students out of work.\n\nIt was all high school students that work there. And we lost that business, all of those students were out of a job, Stevens said at a recent roundtable discussion with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. After a legal battle, he was able to collect unemployment benefits.\n\n\n\nMy family never had a lot of money, so I learned the value of family and the value of the dollar when I was young, Stevens told CBS Minnesota. He has long wanted to start his own business, but working to support himself has delayed those plans, Stevens told Walz at the roundtable event.\n\nFailure to launch\n\nDelayed entry into the workforce is becoming far more common for American teenagers, whose rates of working have plummeted since the 1990s, according to data from the Census Bureau, the Labor Department and the Federal Reserve. However, the unprecedented breadth of the pandemic, which has permanently closed more than 100,000 restaurants and thousands more small businesses, raises questions about how much work there will be once the virus abates.\n\nMeanwhile, those young people lucky enough to find a first job in these times can look forward to a lifetime of lower earnings, thanks to having entered the job market during a recession. Decades of research show that college graduates who start work during recessions earn, on average, less than their peers from other generations for up to 20 years, and in some cases for their entire working lives.\n\n\n\nBecause of their initial bad start, they often get stuck in low-paying, low-quality jobs. Even when the economy gets stronger, it can be difficult for these workers to catch up to their pre-recession cohorts, EPI said.\n\nDouble whammy for millennials\n\nIndeed, research on millennials, the generation that entered the job market during the Great Recession and whose oldest members will turn 40 this year, shows that the dismal economy had weighed on their ability to earn and keep money.\n\nThey've really gotten hit twice — the Great Recession and now, again, a crisis. That's going to impact lifetime earnings, said Konkel.\n\nI feel like I've regressed to my teenage years: I'm in my childhood home, in my childhood bedroom. I have chores again, 30-year-old Eric Rivera told CBS This Morning. He moved from his apartment in Brooklyn, New York, to his parents' home in New Jersey after losing his job during the pandemic.\n\nYou kind of start spiraling: Am I ever going to move out of this house? Rivera said. I'm still hopeful about finding a job and moving out on my own again, but that timeline's a moving target.\n\n\n\nMillennials, as a group, are earning less than their parents. They have far less wealth and more debt than baby boomers did at the same age. Today, just 5% of national wealth is held by the millennial generation. Boomers, at the same age, held more than double that.\n\nIn personal finance lore, the 30s are a time to build up a savings cushion, pay into your retirement fund and perhaps buy a home. But, Konkel said, millennials already didn't have a good cushion to start with, because of the Great Recession.\n\nThe current crisis will further exacerbate those decisions: When to get married, whether to have kids, how many kids to have, because kids are expensive, Konkel said. Indeed, Brookings researchers have warned America to expect a baby bust next year, with 300,000 fewer births happening than would normally be expected.\n\nMeanwhile, many millennials who are parents are finding their work and family in conflict — and are being pushed away from work. One in five working parents isn't working in order to take care of their children, the Census Bureau found this summer.\n\nThat burden largely falls on women, two million of whom have dropped out of the workforce this year, a reality reflected in the labor participation rates for men and women of parenting age. After losing jobs earlier this year, men are rejoining the labor force — but women aren't.\n\nWe're just seeing so many women leaving the labor force, and there are concerns about will they come back? said Konkel. Have we lost the last 20 years of progress?\n\nShe added, If they don't come back, we are not going to return to where we were in the pre-COVID era. We're not going to get back a full, robust recovery.
Updated at 3:17 p.m. ET\n\nSenate and House leaders announced Friday they are postponing work on two controversial anti-piracy bills in the wake of large online protests that spurred several congressmen to rethink the legislation.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced today that he is postponing Tuesday's procedural vote on the Protect IP Act (PIPA). Meanwhile, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith said his committee is postponing consideration of PIPA's House companion, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), until there is wider agreement on a solution.\n\nPIPA and SOPA are intended to strengthen protections against copyright infringement and intellectual property theft, but Internet advocates say they would stifle expression on the World Wide Web. CBS Corporation is among the media and entertainment companies that support the legislation.\n\nIn protest of the legislation, major sites like Wikipedia and Reddit participated in a 24-hour Internet blackout on Wednesday, while other sites like Google took less drastic steps to signify their opposition to the legislation. The protests inspired voters to deluge their congressmen with phone calls and emails in protest of the bills as well, and by Wednesday afternoon, several congressmen either came out in opposition to the bills or said Congress should take more time to reconsider them. It seemed unlikely PIPA would find the 60 votes necessary to pass Tuesday's test vote in the Senate.\n\nAdam Green, co-founder of the grassroots group Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said the legislation's delay shows that people power works. His organization helped about 43,000 people call their congressmen in opposition to the bill.\n\nSOPA, PIPA: What you need to know\n\nSOPA, PIPA protests spur Congress to rethink bills\n\nSOPA and PIPA Internet blackout aftermath, staggering numbers\n\nReid said in a statement, There is no reason that the legitimate issues raised by many about this bill cannot be resolved. He encouraged PIPA's author, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., to continue working with stakeholders on the bill to forge a balance between protecting Americans' intellectual property, and maintaining openness and innovation on the Internet.\n\nReid said the Senate had made good progress through its discussions on the bill in recent weeks and that he's optimistic that the Senate can reach a compromise. He stressed that counterfeiting and piracy are serious problems that hurt major industries, including the movie industry, which supports 2.2 million jobs alone.\n\nWe must take action to stop these illegal practices, he said. We live in a country where people rightfully expect to be fairly compensated for a day's work, whether that person is a miner in the high desert of Nevada, an independent band in New York City, or a union worker on the back lots of a California movie studio.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee was slated to take up SOPA again in February, but Smith issued a statement after Reid's PIPA announcement, noting that he also has heard from critics of the bills.\n\nI take seriously their concerns regarding proposed legislation to address the problem of online piracy, he said. It is clear that we need to revisit the approach on how best to address the problem of foreign thieves that steal and sell American inventions and products.\n\nSmith said the problem of online piracy is too big to ignore and that the House Judiciary Committee will continue to work with both copyright owners and Internet companies to find the right solution.\n\nIn his own statement, Leahy criticized the senators who walked back their support for PIPA, compelling Reid to postpone the procedural vote, which would have officially started a Senate floor debate on the bill.\n\nThe day will come when the Senators who forced this move will look back and realize they made a knee-jerk reaction to a monumental problem, Leay said. Somewhere in China today, in Russia today, and in many other countries that do not respect American intellectual property, criminals who do nothing but peddle in counterfeit products and stolen American content are smugly watching how the United States Senate decided it was not even worth debating how to stop the overseas criminals from draining our economy.\n\nOpponents of SOPA and PIPA object to the bill in part because they argue it would impose a huge, unmanageable burden on Internet companies to police their sites for connections to copyright or intellectual property infringers. Start ups in particular would not be able to handle the legal costs involved, and it could quash innovation in the Internet industry.\n\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Friday he was encouraged by Reid's decision to postpone the vote.\n\nWe all agree that we must do more to combat the on-line theft of intellectual property, McConnell said in a statement, but he said PIPA raised serious legal, policy and operational concerns.\n\nRepublican Rep. Darrell Issa of California and Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon co-authored a bill intended to serve as an alternative to SOPA and PIPA -- the Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade (OPEN) Act.\n\nFor all those who might have thought that their voice didn't count in their government, I hope you now know it does, Wyden tweeted after Reid postponed the PIPA vote.\n\nIssa said in a statement that postponing the PIPA vote removes the imminent threat to the Internet, but it's not over yet. Copyright infringement remains a serious problem and any solution must be targeted, effective, and consistent with how the Internet works.\n\nComputer & Communications Industry Association President Ed Black said in a statement that Those who value and appreciate the Internet can breathe a little easier today.\n\nWe recognize that the dynamic quality of the Internet can be disruptive to established entities and practices, whether they be governments, companies, or individuals, Black said. When legitimate interests and problems result, we remain prepared to address those problems in ways that don't damage the core principles on which the Internet depends.
On this Face the Nation broadcast moderated by Margaret Brennan:\n\nFormer Secretary of State John Kerry @JohnKerry\n\n@JohnKerry Secretary of Defense Mark Esper @EsperDoD\n\n@EsperDoD Senator Tim Kaine, D-Virgina, @TimKaine\n\nD-Virgina, @TimKaine Senator Mike Lee, R-Utah, @SenMikeLee\n\nR-Utah, @SenMikeLee Representative Adam Schiff, D-California @RepAdamSchiff\n\nClick here to browse full transcripts of Face the Nation.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on FACE THE NATION, the critical standoff between the U.S. and Iran deescalates, but the conflict takes a tragic turn and now there's a new crisis, as Iran admits to erroneously shooting down a passenger aircraft killing a hundred and seventy-six. We'll have the latest.\n\nAnd here in the U.S. some in Congress are demanding answers as to why the administration continues to send mixed messages about the, quote, imminent threat used to justify the strike in the first place.\n\nOn Saturday, the Iranian government acknowledged what they've been denying for days, that following retaliatory missile strikes on U.S. installations in Iraq--they'd unintentionally shot down Ukrainian passenger jet mistaking it for an incoming missile. A high-ranking Iranian official was quick to point to U.S. provocation as partially to blame. Now Iranians are angry with their own government and the U.S.\n\nAs Washington and Baghdad remain at an impasse over the role of U.S. forces in Iraq, we'll talk to Secretary of Defense Mark Esper.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We did it because they were looking to blow up our embassy.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll also ask him about the intelligence behind the killing of Soleimani. The administration's handling of the crisis is causing frustration even among some Republicans loyal to the President.\n\nMIKE LEE: Now, I find this insulting and demeaning.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Republican Mike Lee, Democrats Tim Kaine and Adam Schiff will all be here. Plus, former Secretary of State John Kerry weighs in on Iran and why he's supporting Joe Biden.\n\nAnd a special behind-the-scenes report from our Liz Palmer, she and her team spent a tumultuous week in Iran.\n\nAll that and more, is just ahead on FACE THE NATION.\n\nGood morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We begin this morning with the secretary of defense, Mark Esper. Good morning to you, Mister Secretary. Good to have you here.\n\nMARK ESPER (Secretary of Defense/@EsperDoD): Good morning, Margaret. Thank you for having me.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Our team in Tehran witnessed anti-government protests, chants against the regime. What is the U.S. assessment of what's happening on the ground?\n\nMARK ESPER: We are safer today than we were just a few weeks ago. Why? Because we took out the world's foremost terrorist leader, Qasem Soleimani, who had the blood of hundreds of American dead service members on his hands. Secondly, we restored deterrence with Iran without any United States casualties. And, third, we reassured our partners-- partners and allies in the region that we will stand up and defend our interests. I think when you look at--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of restoring deterrence, there wasn't an-- Iran fired off missiles at the United States' bases, so.\n\nMARK ESPER: We-- we are confident we restored deterrence. And if you look to your question--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You don't expect any further attacks on U.S. presence?\n\nMARK ESPER: We do not expect any further attacks. But if you look at what's happening on the ground today, you have just yesterday in Tehran and other cities, Iranians chanting, Death to the Ayatollah. We don't-- we don't think America is our enemy. You can see the-- the Iranian people are standing up and asserting their rights, their aspirations for a better government, a different-- a different regime.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So what is the assessment, though, of-- of what level of threat there is to the regime's hold on power? Because the President was tweeting yesterday in Farsi messages that he stands with the protesters and he's following closely what's happening.\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, we do stand with the Iranian people. They want the same things that most people around the world want. They want prosperity. They want the ability to-- to live their lives, to raise their children. And we do support those same aspirations for people wherever they are. I just think you see a very corrupt regime that the Iranian people are finally standing up and trying to hold them accountable.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So is there still an offer to negotiate with that regime you call corrupt? Because by saying you stand with the protesters, it seems to be in contradiction to an offer to negotiate with the government they're protesting against.\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, it is still the legitimate government, if you will, of Iran. And what we've said, I've said publicly, the President certainly has said, is we will meet with them. We're willing to sit down and discuss without precondition, a new way forward, a-- a-- a series of steps by which Iran becomes a more normal country.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's-- offer still stands?\n\nMARK ESPER: That offer still stands.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And if something happens to these protesters in the street, I mean is there a line that the President won't meet with Iran?\n\nMARK ESPER: The President has drawn no preconditions other than to say we're willing to meet with the Iranian government.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. I want to ask you about the downing of this Ukrainian commercial airliner. The Iranian foreign minister tweeted, admitted it was a mistake on their behalf, but also said, essentially, the U.S. contributed because of the escalation. What's your response to that?\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, first of all, it's a terrible tragedy. A hundred and seventy-six people from many nations killed. It's a shame that the first reaction of the Iranian government to show their corruption, wanted to say that it was American propaganda, when, clearly, it was just a horrible mistake. To somehow allow Iran to play the victim card with the international community is just ridiculous. These tensions started many years ago, twenty years ago, forty years ago, and escalated in the past twelve months, led by the terrorist leader, Qasem Soleimani, who is escalating attacks against United States forces in the region, in Baghdad in particular, which ultimately led to the siege of the United States embassy there.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about that attempt to breach the perimeter and the embassy. But also, broadly, the threat that the U.S. was tracking that has been described as imminent time and again by the administration. The President said last week that there was an attempt to blow up the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. Here's, specifically, what he said on Fox News.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (Fox News/Friday): I can reveal that I believe it would have been four embassies, but Baghdad certainly would have been the lead. But I think it would have been four embassy; could have been military bases; could have been a lot of other things, too. But it was imminent. And then all of a sudden he was gone.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Why couldn't you share that specific threat with senators in a classified briefing?\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, that information-- there was a reference in this-- in this exquisite intelligence to an attack on the United States embassy in Baghdad. That information was shared with the Gang of Eight. All that exceptional intelligence shared with the Gang of Eight, not the broader membership of the Congress.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: A specific threat against the U.S. embassy in Baghdad to blow it up--\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, I was--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --was shared with the Gang of Eight?\n\nMARK ESPER: I was not in that meeting with the Gang of Eight. But I will tell you, I spoke to one of the briefers. What the briefer said to me coming out of that meeting was his assessment that most, if not all the members, thought that the intelligence was persuasive and that they-- and that the Gang of Eight did not think that it should be released to the broader members of Congress.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But, broadly, can you clarify though, was the specific threat that the President shared with Fox News about four U.S. embassies being under threat, also shared with Congress? Why was there a difference?\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, what the President said was he believed that it probably and could have been attacks against additional embassies. I shared that view. I know other members of National Security Team shared that view. That's why I deployed thousands of American paratroopers to the Middle East to reinforce our embassy in Baghdad and other sites throughout the region.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Probably, and could have been.\n\nMARK ESPER: Mm-Hm.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That is-- that sounds more like an assessment than a specific, tangible threat with a-- a decisive piece of intelligence.\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, the President didn't say there was a tangible-- he didn't cite a specific piece of evidence. What he says probably-- he believed, could have been--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are you saying there wasn't one?\n\nMARK ESPER: I didn't see one with regard to four embassies. What I'm saying is I share the President's view that probably-- my expectation was they were going to go after our embassies. The embassies are the most prominent display of American presence in a country.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The description had been that this was a imminent threat to U.S. personnel and facilities in the region.\n\nMARK ESPER: Mm-Hm.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is that a more accurate description than what the President provided?\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, what I've said publicly, I've-- I've said many times, is that we had information that there was going to be attack within a matter of days that would be broad in scale, in other words, more than one country, and that it would be bigger than previous attacks, likely going to take us into open hostilities with Iran.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is that threat gone?\n\nMARK ESPER: That was orchestrated by Qasem-- Qasem Soleimani. He was the one-- was-- has led the attacks against America for twenty years now.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nMARK ESPER: So we had every expectation to believe that this would happen. In fact, a very, very senior person from the intelligence community said the risk of inaction is greater than the risk of action. That was compelling for me.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is that threat gone?\n\nMARK ESPER: That threat has been disrupted. I think what we have to find out now is continue to work to make sure that that threat is completely eliminated.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you understand the frustration and anger from members of Congress who say why the President-- why can the President tell Fox News something he can't tell members of Congress or-- or members of his administration can't explicitly explain to members of Congress?\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, look, I understand the frustration. The fact is that evidence, that information is only available to the Gang of Eight. That's been practice and policy for decades.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But you said you don't know that it was told to the Gang of Eight.\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, I'm talking about, the intelligence stream, the exquisite intelligence. That was told-- that information of that source and method was revealed to the Gang of Eight. I understand the frustration of the broader members of Congress. They are not going to have access to that information. I would support it if we-- if we didn't jeopardize the sources and methods. And I think the President said the same.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Mike Lee, who will be with us on this program--\n\nMARK ESPER: Mm-Hm.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --also was frustrated with your briefing. And he said, you know, why did you tell members of Congress that it would, essentially, be a negative message to try to call into question that the authorization for military force in Iraq.\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, no--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Why did you oppose that debate?\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, first of all, for every member that didn't like the brief, there's members that thought it was the greatest brief ever. That was never said that they should not have a debate, that they should have a discussion. I was asked a specific question about do I have concerns about a debate? And what all I said was this: is as that debate continues--don't-- not have a debate--but as that debate ensues, be conscious of the messaging, particularly to our troops, because they are looking for messages. Do they have the support of the American people while they are in harm's way? Why do I say that? My predecessors-- predecessors have said that in the past. And I had the personal experience in the 1991 Gulf War. I was on the ground preparing for our final actions to go into Iraq.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nMARK ESPER: And we watched very carefully the debate in Congress in mid-January of that year to find out did we have the support of the--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nMARK ESPER: --American people and our lawmakers.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly, are other Iranian leaders still potential targets? Because we have reported that there was an IRGC leader in Yemen targeted the very same day Qasem Soleimani was killed.\n\nMARK ESPER: Look, I'm not going to speak to any planned or alleged operations. We will exercise everything we need to do to protect the American people, to protect our forces, to protect our embassies.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But you're not denying that report?\n\nMARK ESPER: I'm not going to speak to any-- any reports.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. I want to quickly ask you as well about the presence in Iraq. Will the U.S. cut off U.S. aid if the Iraqi government tries to expel U.S. troops?\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, let's take this one step at a time. We're not there yet. What we need to do is sit down, have discussions with Iraq. We're doing that now. I want to-- we also intend to do that with our NATO partners. I had a good conversation the other day with the NATO Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg. We're going to send a team over to discuss how can NATO play a bigger role in the Iraq mission? Two important missions there. One is to train, advise, and assist the Iraqi military. And number two is the enduring defeat of ISIS. We are committed to both those operations. And I think that we can work out a better way forward.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Does plussing up a NATO presence mean drawing down the five thousand U.S. troops?\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, it could. It's been my aspiration for some time to have a smaller footprint in Iraq and--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have a number in mind?\n\nMARK ESPER: --in the broader Middle East. No, I think that's-- that's a matter for commanders on the ground to assess. We have to look at whether the capabilities that our NATO partners can bring to the-- bring to the-- bring to the fore. And I think that has to be a process in full respect of-- of-- of Iraq's sovereignty. At the end of the day, the United States government wants what the Iraqi people want, and that is a strong, prosperous, and independent Iraq.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: On Saudi Arabia, we are reporting-- CBS News is reporting that about a dozen or so Saudi service people may be expelled from the United States in the wake of that Pensacola shooting and an investigation. Is that the right number? What-- can you tell us about that? And what did the President mean when he said Saudi Arabia deposited a billion dollars into a bank account in exchange for U.S. troop deployment?\n\nSEC. ESPER: Well, two separate things. You know, first of all, the-- what you're referring to is an investigation being conducted by the DOJ and the FBI in the wake of that-- that tragic shooting in Pensacola some-- few weeks ago. In the wake of that, the department has taken a number of steps to-- to ensure it doesn't happen again. I've signed out directives that address enhanced screening of all of our foreign students that address credentialing going forward, weapons policies, etc. So we're doing everything we can. The investigation is being conducted by DOJ and FBI. I'm sure they will release something on that in the coming days.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And the billion dollars into the U.S. bank account?\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, what the President is referring to is burden sharing. Burden sharing comes in many forms. When we talk to NATO, we talk about contributing more to their GDP to defense commitment. And the President's actions have resulted in hundreds of billions of dollars more being contributed by our NATO allies. It includes--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not a transaction like what he described.\n\nMARK ESPER: Well, it includes host nation support, it includes foreign military cells, it includes providing troops on the ground, and in cases it provides helping to offset some of our operations maintenance costs, which the Saudis are committed to doing, just as they did offset costs during the 1990 and '91 Gulf War.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary--\n\nMARK ESPER: Burden sharing.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --appreciate your time.\n\nMARK ESPER: Thank you, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be back in a moment with the House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff. Stay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff. Good morning to you, Mister Chairman.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF (D-California/Intelligence Committee Chairman/@RepAdamSchiff): Good morning.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You are part of the Gang of Eight, so you're part of that group that received the very classified briefing that the Defense Secretary was referring to. He said the intelligence was exquisite, and it was incredibly detailed. Do you quibble with his characterization of what you were told?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: I don't quibble with it. I think it's just plain wrong. There was no discussion in the Gang of Eight briefings that these are the four embassies that are being targeted and we have exquisite intelligence that shows these are the specific targets.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What about U.S. embassy, Baghdad?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: It-- it--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: He said that was specifically referenced.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I don't recall, frankly, in that briefing there being a specific discussion about bombing the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. The brief was much more along the lines, frankly, of something that Secretary Pompeo admitted the other day when he said that we don't know precisely where and we don't know precisely when. That was much more the nature of the briefing that we got. In the view of the briefers, there was plotting. There was a-- an effort to escalate being planned, but they didn't have specificity. And so when you hear the President out there on Fox, he is fudging the intelligence and when you hear the Secretary say, well, that wasn't what the intelligence said, but that's my personal belief, he is fudging. When Secretary Pompeo was on your show last week and made the claim that the intelligence analysis was that taking Soleimani out would improve our security and not-- and leaving them in would make us less safe, that is also fudging. That's not an intelligence conclusion. That is Pompeo's personal opinion. Intelligence--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is that a polite way of saying they're lying?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, you know, you could certainly put it that way. But, frankly, I think what they are doing is they are overstating and exaggerating what the intelligence shows. And when you're talking about justifying acts that might bring us into warfare with Iran, that's a dangerous thing to do.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But to be fair, because you are the Intel Committee chairman, you know, the Intel Committee often or-- that the Intelligence Committee works in assessments, in judgments, in putting together mosaics, pieces of information to come to a conclusion. When Esper is working in beliefs and projections, isn't that just how it works? Impossibilities and not necessarily always having one conclusive piece of the exact place and time?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, that's exactly right. But that-- that means that you need to be very clear about what you're saying the intelligence shows and what it doesn't. If we were to ask the intelligence agencies, will taking Soleimani out make us safer or less safe? They would say to us, Congressman, that's a policy judgment that the policymakers need to make. What we can tell you is if you take him out, here are the likely repercussions. Those repercussions that we were briefed about were far more dangerous to this country than anything that Soleimani was plotting, as far as I can tell. And so when you're talking about taking out a top government official of another nation, an act that might bring us into outright warfare--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --the burden of imminence, of showing imminence with very great specifics, I think is very high.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So I-- I just want to button up because the Defense Secretary also said that in that Gang of Eight briefing, when he said there was sensitive information shared, though, he said he wasn't in the room, that it was the Gang of Eight's decision not to share the information with the rest of Congress. He said he'd be okay with it if sensitive bits were taken out.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is this is a political decision?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: He said a couple of things. He said that what he was told by the briefers is that most or all of the members were completely satisfied. That's not correct. I can tell you I wasn't, and there were other members of the Gang of Eight who were equally unsatisfied with the proof of imminence. In terms of the-- what he has described and others have described as the exquisite nature or sources and methods, we often don't share the most sensitive sources and methods with all of the members, but that's not an excuse for withholding from the members the underlying facts. And so if the intelligence showed that there were four embassies being targeted that should have been shared with the members. It wasn't because I don't believe that is what the intelligence showed.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Have you heard from members of the intelligence community that they objected to what the administration did?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: They are not going to volunteer that. In other words, the intelligence community doesn't want to get crosswise with the White House and with--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You've spoken to CIA director Gina Haspel?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: This was, it appears, according to Esper's description, also her assessment.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I don't know whether Esper has represented that the CIA director supported or didn't support a strike on Soleimani. The job of the CIA director is to say, this is what our intelligence shows, this is what our intelligence analysts tell us will be the repercussions if you take Soleimani out. That is the principal role. It's the President's call whether that justifies taking a strike, but that should be done in consultation with Congress and approved by Congress. And neither of those things happened here.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Should other IRGC leaders be targeted?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: I think that we have escalated enough, and--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Even though Iran says it's standing down and the President has used that phrase?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I think what we're likely to see, at least in the near term, is the end of Iran's overt attacks, like the missile attack on our bases. I don't think that we conclude-- conclude at all that we've seen an end to the-- their use of Shia and other proxies. And so the risk to American troops and to American civilians continues, I think is-- is greater now as a result of the administration's actions. Iran has been humiliated by-- by this taking out of their top leadership, but also by their disastrous shoot down of this civilian aircraft.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: That makes them, I think, more dangerous and provocative in the sense that we may very well see covert retaliation against the United States.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to switch gears, because in your role, you were also playing a key-- a key-- you are a key figure in the impeachment investigation up to this point. I'm wondering if you have a sense about whether you'll be an impeachment manager when this goes to a Senate trial?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, that'll be the speaker's decision. I don't want to get ahead of her--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you want to be?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --thinking. I've told the speaker that I will play whatever role that she and the caucus believe would be useful.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And the speaker was on another network today and seemed to leave open the idea of subpoenaing John Bolton, the former national security adviser to the President. Is that something you would be looking at? Are you looking at?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: You know it's certainly something that we are considering. But, look, Americans want to see a fair trial in the Senate. They want to see a trial that's fair to the President and they want to see a trial that's fair to the American people, that brings all the facts forward. There-- there's little sense in bringing Bolton in to the House and not allowing the senators to see his testimony. If they're going to be the triers of fact and they will be they should hear from the witness directly. He has offered to come forward and testify. There is no reason not to have him testify unless you just want to cover up the President's wrongdoing. If McConnell succeeds in making this trial a trial without witnesses--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --it will be the first impeachment trial in history where the subject of the trial didn't resign, mid trial where they didn't have witnesses. That's not a fair trial. That's a sham. That's a cover up. And I think one of the things that holding on to the articles has succeeded doing is--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --fleshing out McConnell and the President's desire to make this a cover up.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will get to what that trial might look like with Mike Lee, senator from Utah, a Republican ally of the President, who will be with us soon.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee. He's written a number of books about the Constitution and our country's founding documents. He joins us this morning from Salt Lake City. Good morning to you, Senator.\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE (R-Utah/@SenMikeLee): Good morning.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You heard the Secretary of Defense say that there was a specific threat assessment shared with the Gang of Eight. Should that threat stream have been shared with the rest of Congress, people like yourself?\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: Yes, it should have. It's important to remember that the Gang of Eight does not equal Congress. The House of Representatives has four hundred and thirty-five members. The Senate has one hundred members. Look, I understand Secretary Esper's point. I understand that not every piece of information can or pragmatically should be shared with all five hundred and thirty-five members of Congress, but drive by notification to eight people is not the same as notification to Congress. Remember, there is an important constitutional reason for this. We have some overlap between-- and some natural tension between the Article 2 commander-in-chief power--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: --enjoyed by the President and the Article 1 Section 8 War Power that is possessed by Congress. In order to know and understand where one power ends and another begins in any context, we need to have a certain amount of information--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You--\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: --and an adequate amount of information was not shared with us.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there was information shared with Fox News in that interview the President gave where he said it was his belief that there were four embassies that were going to be threatened by attack by Iran. You've spoken to the President. Was that television interview the first time you heard it?\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: Yes, it was. Let me say about the President. I have great respect for President Trump for how he's handled this situation and how he's handled other situations involving his immense power as commander-in-chief. I believe more than any other President in my lifetime, President Trump has shown restraint in the way he's exercised that power. There-- any other President--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But do you have a problem with learning it on television?\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: --would've taken us to war several times. Yes, but the problem there is not with the President. The problem is with those who are briefing us.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: Those who are briefing us, I believe would have done a different job under the light of day had television cameras been there than they did in private--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: --where his boss couldn't see what they were saying, that they were not helpful and they didn't reflect well on the President's great restraint that he's shown and deference to the American people.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, I want to continue this conversation, specifically, about War Powers as well on the other side of this commercial break. So stay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Some of our stations are leaving us now, but we will be right back with Senator Mike Lee and then Democratic Senator Tim Kaine and former Secretary of State John Kerry. Plus, a report from Elizabeth Palmer, our CBS News team in Iran. Stay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We're back now with more from Republican Senator Mike Lee. Senator, you heard the defense secretary say there was not one definitive, specific piece of intelligence that indicated these four embassy attacks were being planned. It was a belief. Does that give you pause?\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: No, not necessarily. Look, I want to be clear, within hours after General Soleimani was killed, I made a public statement to the effect that the fact that he is dead is a good thing. It's a positive signal for the safety and security of the American people. And I stand by that. This is a guy who would've done a lot of damage.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm not sure if the Senator can still hear me. I think we just had an interruption on that feed. So, hopefully, we'll pick it up. Standing by, though, in Richmond, going live now to Virginia's senator, Tim Kaine. Good morning to you, Senator.\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE (D-Virginia/@timkaine): Good morning, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And you and Senator Lee have actually found some common cause here, despite the difference in your parties, on a frustration regarding the President's lack of consultation with Congress. And I want to dive into that. But let's--\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- start off specifically on-- on what we learned. Because you are on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which has oversight of the State Department and, therefore, embassies, were you aware that there was any kind of threat, specifically, to embassy Baghdad and three other posts, as the President has described?\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: No, I wasn't, Margaret. I-- I was at the classified briefing because I'm both a-- an Armed Services and Foreign Relations member. That was not told to us in the classified briefing, nor was there a suggestion that multiple embassies were threatened. And I think that was one of the reasons that the senators in the briefing were so unhappy. We felt that the evidence was far short of imminent threat. We were mad that they were so dismissive of the notion that Congress would have anything to do with questions of war and peace. And we also thought that the administration was very cavalier about the Iraqi reaction-- the Iraqi resolution of parliament that the U.S. should leave. They were sort of like, oh, that's just the way the Iraqis talk.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: This is a very serious concern. And the administration was downplaying it in a way that I think was very unrealistic.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But, specifically, the Defense Secretary said the Gang of Eight was told in specific detail and they chose not to share it with members of Congress. You are saying that you were never told of a threat to the U.S. embassy?\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: No, no, and, as I've talked to the Gang of Eight, again, this is classified information, I'm not going to put that all on the table. But members of the Gang of Eight on the Senate side, were not happy with the degree of him-- this-- this question of was there an imminent threat? The administration says there was exquisite and detailed intelligence. That means it was specific. But for it to be-- justify the President taking, essentially, an act of war on Iraqi soil to wipe out a-- an Iranian military leader, it had to not just be a plan, but an imminent threat. And that usually means it's more than a plan. There's been some move toward making a decision to execute on the plan. And we heard nothing about that in the briefing or in any of the conversations I've had with administration leaders.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Why is it not sufficient enough for the administration to say broadly there was a threat to U.S. personnel in the region, as Esper said, within days? Why don't you trust that?\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, look, the bottom line is the Constitution makes really plain it's-- it's Congress that gets to make the decision about whether to go to war. And, ultimately, that's a judgment about the troops. We don't want to put our troops in harm's way unless there is deliberation in front of the American people about whether it's important. Now a President can act unilaterally to stop-- defend against an ongoing attack or an imminent threat.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: But if it's more than that, it's supposed to be for Congress, because Congress will have this debate in a way that the American public will be informed of the stakes. And then if we debate and vote at the end of the day--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: --then it's fair to ask our men and women in uniform to risk their lives and health. But if we're not willing to do that, or if the President tries to rush to war and escalate, then you run the risk of making mistakes that are just so fatal in their consequences you can hardly ever, you know, undo them.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The President says he doesn't want to go to war. I want to get to that authorization of use of force.\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: Yep.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We went back and we looked, and-- and the original AUMF from 2001, and then there's one in '02, but in the wake of the al Qaeda attacks on this country, that was the premise for this authorization Congress gave at the right time.\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It has-- was then used over the past almost twenty years to send troops to Libya, Turkey, Georgia, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, the Philippines, Cuba. There are Democratic presidents. Why hasn't any party made a full-throated effort to get a new authorization for military force?\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, Margaret, as you know, I have been working on this since I came to the Senate, and I have the same concern. When I came to the Senate in 2013, I criticized President Obama for taking us into military action in Libya without congressional authorization, for going on ISIS in Iraq and Syria without congressional authorization. I will say this, when I started on this crusade six, seven years ago, very few people were interested in it. But in the last year, the good news is finally, members of both parties and in both Houses have started to step up and take the congressional responsibility seriously. I do think we have to rewrite and redo the 2001 authorization that authorize us to wage war against non-state terrorist groups--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: --that are connected to the perpetrators--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But-- but what--\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: --of the 9/11 attack.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --what you're proposing now and you happen--\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: Here's-- yeah, here's what I'm proposing now is that--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --you're working with Senator Lee on it. But I just want to point out that there does seem to still be a carve-out for imminent threats. How--\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: And there should be. So, sen-- senator--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --how would that not stop what the President just did?\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, Senator Lee and I are basically trying to restore this to its constitutional place, so we have-- we have a resolution that would basically say no war against Iran unless Congress, specifically, votes to authorize it. But we do state, as you point out, the President can defend the nation against an imminent threat, and that is existing law. That's-- the constitutional framers clearly understood that. We're skeptical of the evidence that this President has put on the table about imminent threat. That's why we're challenging the briefers and that's why we're challenging the President. But at the end of the day, I think this is less about the President than it is about Congress. Congresses of both parties for a very long time--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: --have hidden under their desks rather than have votes about war. Votes about war are tough. I-- I've cast two of them in the Foreign Relations Committee. Fundamentally different than any vote you'll ever cast.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: And so many members of Congress, what they want to do is hide under their desk, let the President just do whatever the President wants, and then they think they can escape accountability for the consequences of war.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: It's time to go back to what the framers envisioned. We shouldn't send our best and brightest into harm's way if Congress doesn't have the guts to-- to have a debate and have a vote.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator Kaine, thank you for laying out your case. You-- you were persuasive enough to get Senator Mike Lee on board with this, and he joins us now.\n\nSenator, thanks for sticking with us. I know we had some problems with the uplink there, but we can see and hear you now just fine. What Senator Kaine, essentially, said here is no elected official wanted to get their hands dirt-- dirty and go on the record to vote for a war, which is why Congress is allowed for this to continue without a new vote on an AUMF. Can you get other Republicans on board with this beyond yourself and Rand Paul?\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: Yes, we can, and I believe we will. Look, my grievance here is not with the President of the United States. He's exercised his power with great restraint and respect for the Constitution. It's not even really as much with the briefers, even though, I didn't love the briefing the other day, as it is with Congress. Congress is the problem. We have to remember that this isn't just about this President or this war. This is about the future question of what any President can do to get us into any war. Over many decades, Congresses and White Houses of every conceivable partisan combination have put us down this path where it's very easy for members of Congress to wash their hands of it--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: --to step away and say, this isn't our problem and we have created this problem. We created the day-- (AUDIO CUT) of a full explanation.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator, can you hear me?\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, good.\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: Pretty fine, thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We had some interruption there. You spoke to the President. Have you received any private assurance that Congress would be consulted if he plans to take future military action against Iran?\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: Yes. And it's always implicit that we will be consulted. I always want to make sure that any step that is taken is either authorized by one of the AUMFs in question in '02 or '01, or that there is some indication that the strike in question is necessary in order to repel an imminent or actual attack on the United States. That's always the question. And that's one of the reasons why I'm co-sponsoring Tim-- Tim Kaine's resolution is to make clear--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: --that neither the '01 nor the '02 authorization can be read fairly to authorize a war against Iran.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But this was-- there are things short of war. There are-- is hostile activity. There is, you know, a targeted strike like this. And-- and what you are supporting here, this resolution, there is still a carve-out for an imminent threat. So how would that stop the administration from doing again what it just did?\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: Well, anytime we have something like this and we've signaled in advance that it's not covered by an existing AUMF, then, yeah, we're-- we're relying on the good faith use of a commander-in-chief power by the President. This is not a new precedent; it's not-- it's not contingent on or-- or rooted in-- in this presidential administration. This goes back to 1791 when George Washington pointed out that it's okay for the President to act in order to repel an actual or imminent attack--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: --without authorization from Congress. But he also noted that it's important that any sustained military effort does have to be authorized.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Lee, thank you for joining us. Next time, I hope you're here sitting across from me so we can see and hear each other more clearly next time.\n\nWe'll be back in a moment with former Secretary of State John Kerry.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Dubuque, Iowa, and the presidential campaign trail where former Secretary of State John Kerry is on a campaign bus trip with former Vice President Joe Biden and you can hear that bus generator going in the background. Good morning to you, Mister Secretary.\n\nJOHN KERRY (Former Secretary of State/@JohnKerry): Sorry about that. Good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I-- I want to pick up kind of where we just left off with-- with the two senators. You know you-- you've been touting Joe Biden's foreign policy experience as a reason voters should consider voting for him. Bernie Sanders, his opponent, has-- has taken that on as a reason essentially, not to specifically focusing in on Biden's vote to help authorize the-- the war in Iraq. He called it appalling that after eighteen years, Joe Biden still refuses to admit he was dead wrong on the Iraq War, the worst foreign policy blunder in modern American history. Given what you know about the region and how Iran was, essentially, empowered by that, why-- why doesn't he just call it a mistake?\n\nJOHN KERRY: Well, I think I-- I-- in fact, Margaret, I think that Bernie, regrettably, is distorting Joe's record in the following sense. I mean he doesn't have what Joe Biden has, which is eight years of sitting on the National Security Council and demonstrating his judgment, whether it was on his leadership, dealing with the migration that was flowing across our border and helping to resolve that with the presidents of those countries or his work pulling troops out of Iraq and negotiating that and working as perhaps the lead point man on that effort. I-- I think that-- that I know very well what Joe's position was because I answered those questions back in 2002, 2000-- 2003 and '04. And it was very clear that what we were doing was listening to a President who made a pledge that he was going to do diplomacy; that he was going to exhaust diplomacy, build a coalition. And, ultimately, we learned, as Joe did and I did, that the intelligence was distorted. So Joe spoke out and criticized. Joe was against what they were doing. The vote was not a vote, specifically, to go to war. It was a vote for the President to have leverage with respect to getting Saddam Hussein back to the negotiating table, back to the inspections, excuse me. And I think we were let down and Joe has said many times that it was a mistake, obviously, to trust the words of the administration who didn't follow through on what they said they were going to do. And I invite you to go back, read my speech on the floor and others--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nJOHN KERRY: --where I said this is not a vote, specifically, to let the President go to war. So I think Bernie is trying to drive a wedge in there. I understand that but I think the vice president has unparalleled--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nJOHN KERRY: --demonstrated accomplishment and success in foreign policy as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and as vice president. And he, in my judgment, is the one person running for President--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nJOHN KERRY: --who the moment he takes office, has the ability to be able to address a lot of questions, including the credibility of the United States.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well--\n\nJOHN KERRY: Joe has told the truth. People know that. And I think they will trust in his capacity to lead the country at a very, very delicate time--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well--\n\nJOHN KERRY: --when foreign policy experience--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It is--\n\nJOHN KERRY: --is, in fact, a premium.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It is. And Iran, an issue you know well, is front and center right now. But, virtually, every single Democrat running for office right now is claiming the same or virtually the same Iran policy, which is to try to revive the deal that you negotiated. There's-- some would say a shell of it left now. Shouldn't voters expect more out of a Iran strategy from someone trying to be commander in chief?\n\nJOHN KERRY: Well, Joe Biden is, in fact, providing more, which is to recognize that-- that it's not enough just to go back to where we were because, obviously, circumstances have changed and things have evolved in the last three and a half years. And-- and what-- what Vice President Biden knows we have to do is make sure now that all the things that we were going to do in the follow on agreement, which was always contemplated. Margaret, you were there. You're an expert at this. You know exactly what the truth is about it. We were trying to take the nuclear weapon off the table first and then negotiate Yemen, Hezbollah, threats against Israel--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nJOHN KERRY: --the regional question of trafficking of arms. And-- and so Vice President Biden understands that now has to also be front and center--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nJOHN KERRY: --as you-- as you revive the agreement. But the truth is, France, Germany--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nJOHN KERRY: --Britain, China, Russia are all still trying to keep the agreement in place because they recognize it's the strongest, most transparent, most accountable nuclear agreement on the planet--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well--\n\nJOHN KERRY: --and it did take a nuclear weapon off the table until President Trump decided unilaterally to ignore all of our allies and move to get out of the agreement.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the President--\n\nJOHN KERRY: And everything--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --the President's going on the--\n\nJOHN KERRY: --that's happened in the last days--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --going on the-- the attack on that deal this morning, specifically, mentioning you. Perhaps, not a surprise. But, you know, I-- I know the deal you negotiated lifted sanctions, gave some relief in exchange for capping the nuclear program. There was also a parallel negotiation that released some cash as part of a settlement of a different, separate dispute. The President this week put blame on the administration, your-- the administration you served on with, essentially, helping to provide money to the IRGC. I want to play a sound bite of what you said in 2016 to CNBC when you were asked about how Iran would spend the money.\n\nJOHN KERRY (U.S. Secretary of State/January 2016/CNBC): I think that some of it will end up in the hands of the IRGC or of other entities, some of which are labeled terrorists. You know, to some degree I'm-- I'm not going to sit here and tell you that every component of that could be prevented. But I can tell you this: Right now we are not seeing the early delivery of funds going to that kind of endeavor at this point in time. I'm sure at some point some of it will.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I remember talking to you at the time. Money is fungible.\n\nJOHN KERRY: Sure.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Why, though, did you think--\n\nJOHN KERRY: Absolutely. Money is fungible.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --that that was a risk worth taking if you knew the possibility of-- of what would happen with that money?\n\nJOHN KERRY: Well, what I was really saying, I think, first of all, Margaret, you are an expert at this. You were there. You know that the President's tweet is a lie. And the President tweeted this morning, because I am coming on the show and he knew you'd ask me the question or he'd push you in a place where you did ask the question. You and the media, I think, need to call a lie a lie. You know--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mister Secretary, I asked you that question in 2015, too.\n\nJOHN KERRY: --they didn't get a hundred and fifty billion dollars. No, no, no. But let me just finish. You know-- yes. And I'll-- I'll answer that. I was saying, clearly, some money from the budget of Iran is going to go to the IRGC. It always has. That's no surprise. But the truth is and-- and President Trump-- I-- I-- well, he probably doesn't know this, but the fact is his own defense intelligence agency in 2017 testified to the Congress that very, very little money actually went to the IRGC at all. Most of the money went to the economy of Iran, which is precisely what I said and what we all said. So, the IRGC has never had a problem getting money, Margaret. But the fact is Donald Trump keeps saying they got a hundred and fifty billion dollars. A lie. He keeps saying that all of that money went to pay for it. It did not. His own defense intelligence agency says most of the money went for the economy of the country. So, you know, we have to stop--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nJOHN KERRY: --dealing with questions on Donald Trump's lies and start dealing with the reality of what is going on. The fact is--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\n\nJOHN KERRY: --that mo-- the vast proportion of that money--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nJOHN KERRY: --went to the economy of Iran and they're always going to be funding the IRGC. There was no question about that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nJOHN KERRY: And the IRGC budget has not gone up markedly as a result--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\n\nJOHN KERRY: --of what happened with the agreement, period.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mister Secretary, thank you for joining us. I want to take a break because we have a report from Iran.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer has been reporting from Tehran all week. Yesterday, she and her team were unexpectedly asked to leave by the Iranian authorities and have now departed Iran. Before they left she filed this reporter's notebook.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nELIZABETH PALMER: This week ended with the unthinkable, Iran admitted to shooting down a passenger plane killing everyone on board. But it had begun with the unknowable, what Iran would do to avenge the killing by America of its most revered military hero, Qasem Soleimani.\n\nThis is not just a mourning procession, it's a political message.\n\nIn all my years of covering Iran, I have never seen such high-stakes drama. Javad Zarif, Iran's foreign minister, warned the U.S. revenge was coming.\n\nMOHAMMAD JAVAD ZARIF (Tuesday): In a clear and proportionate.\n\nELIZABETH PALMER (Tuesday): When?\n\nMOHAMMAD JAVAD ZARIF (Tuesday): As we choose.\n\nELIZABETH PALMER: They chose that very night. Iranian missiles fell on two U.S. bases in Iraq.\n\nDAVID MARTIN: A rocket attack was launched against the Al Asad Air Base.\n\nELIZABETH PALMER: The world held its breath.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (Wednesday): The fact that we have this great military equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it. We do not want to use it.\n\nELIZABETH PALMER: But with no casualties, America held its fire. And the two old enemies appeared to call it a draw. Ordinary Tehranis heading out in the first real snowfall of the season called it a relief.\n\nWere you relieved when he said there would not be another American attack?\n\nWOMAN: Yes. I sleep very--\n\nELIZABETH PALMER: Well?\n\nWOMAN: Very well.\n\nELIZABETH PALMER: But another bombshell was about to burst.\n\nMAJOR GARRETT: CBS News has learned that U.S. officials are confident that Iran shot down a Ukrainian jetliner.\n\nELIZABETH PALMER: On Wednesday morning, wreckage and bodies from Ukrainian Airlines Flight 752 lay strewn across Iran's western suburbs. By Friday when we managed to reach the site, there was little left, even for the scavengers.\n\nLocal people say that yesterday, Thursday, around lunch time, trucks, cranes showed up and took most of the pieces that were here away.\n\nAmid rumors of a cover-up, world leaders called for an international investigation and the victims' families prayed for answers to soothe their grief. The answer came suddenly in a stunning TV address that said Iran's army had shot down the plane by mistake. It was a huge admission for this proud and prickly country, which may have appeased critics outside Iran but it's inflamed them at home. Protests erupted in Tehran last night, crowds of students who despise the government for its corruption and ineptitude. Iran starts next week not only in conflict with the U.S. but also with itself.\n\n(Crowd protesting)\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Elizabeth Palmer reporting from Tehran.\n\nWe'll be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.
Victories by the two Democrats in Georgia's Senate runoff elections could mean a third stimulus check for Americans this spring, according to analysts. That would provide crucial financial support for households that this month are receiving $600 payments directed by the most recent relief bill — an effort that has been criticized by both Democrats and some Republicans as doing too little to help families that are struggling through the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nCBS News projects that Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock have defeated incumbent Republican senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. The surprise outcome will result in a 50-50 split between Senate Democrats and Republicans, giving Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tiebreaking vote. That will ease passage of another stimulus relief bill, which President-elect Joe Biden has previously said he supports, according to political and financial analysts.\n\nAnother so-called Economic Impact Payment would come on the heels of the most recent relief measure, a $900 billion bill that President Donald Trump delayed and criticized the $600 payments as ridiculously low. Democrats and some Republicans had supported lifting the checks to $2,000 per person, but the effort failed due to opposition from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nA big question is whether lawmakers might push for $2,000 or $1,400 cash payments, with the latter representing the difference between the $600 checks and the quashed effort to boost them to $2,000 in the most recent bill. On January 10, Mr. Biden tweeted that $600 is is simply not enough when you have to choose between paying rent or putting food on the table.\n\nWe need $2,000 stimulus checks, he added.\n\n$600 is simply not enough when you have to choose between paying rent or putting food on the table. We need $2,000 stimulus checks. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) January 11, 2021\n\nWe expect growing anticipation that Democrats will pursue additional stimulus, with a $2,000 check (or at least the remaining $1,400) as a leading item, Ed Mills, an analyst with investment bank Raymond James, said in a report following the Georgia election.\n\nBiden: Latest aid a down payment\n\nMr. Biden has described the $900 billion stimulus bill passed last month as a down payment on a more comprehensive relief package. That could translate into a new package ranging from $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion, according to Heights Securities analyst Hunter Hammond.\n\nThe debate over $2,000 isn't some abstract debate in Washington. It's about real lives. Hardworking Americans need help, and they need it now. Georgia — you have the power to make it happen. Vote. pic.twitter.com/yFBBk1YAEm — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) January 5, 2021\n\nA sweetened stimulus package would likely come in March, Hammond and Mills predict. That's because the most recent relief measure extended unemployment programs until mid-March, which puts pressure on Congress to act on additional financial support by that cutoff to continue jobless benefits for millions of unemployed Americans.\n\nDemocrats are likely to push for a new round of checks worth $2,000, Hammond predicted, noting that both Mr. Biden, as well as Warnock and Ossoff, had campaigned on the issue. While stumping for the candidates ahead of this week's vote, Mr. Biden said their election would help get $2,000 checks out the door immediately, to help people who are in real trouble.\n\n8 million more poor people\n\nEven with previous stimulus aid, 8 million Americans have slipped into poverty during the coronavirus pandemic. Millions of others are experiencing a range of hardships, from food insecurity to trouble paying their bills, after the crisis upended the economy.\n\nThe $600 checks issued by the Treasury Department last month may last the neediest Americans no more than six weeks, according to financial-services app Earnin. The firm found that people who had been living paycheck to paycheck and who got the initial $1,200 checks last year spent their money within one week.\n\nSome economists say much more funding is needed beyond the recent $900 billion package to help the economy until coronavirus vaccines are widely distributed, which may not be until this summer or fall.\n\nAs much as $3 trillion could be needed to ensure a swift economic recovery, according to the Economic Policy Institute. The left-leaning think tank noted that the most recent stimulus package omitted funding for state and local governments, which have seen a plunge in tax revenue due to the crisis.\n\nAlthough the stimulus checks are helping households weather the crisis, most economists view other relief measures as more effective — especially programs that target people who are currently suffering a financial hit, such as unemployment benefits. That's because the cash payments are distributed to almost every middle- and low-income household, regardless of whether they have been impacted financially by the crisis.\n\nChecks are generally less potent in supporting spending than unemployment benefits, wrote Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Gregory Daco in a recent research report. He added that the $900 billion relief bill will likely fall short of what is needed to prevent a rough winter.
The following is a transcript of an interview with Sen. Bernie Sanders that aired Sunday, March 1, 2020, on Face the Nation.\n\n\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Senator Bernie Sanders. He is on the campaign trail in Norfolk, Virginia. Good morning to you, Senator.\n\nSENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Good morning, MARGARET.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is this now a two man race?\n\nSEN. SANDERS: Well, all I can say is we have won the popular vote in Iowa. We won the New Hampshire primary. We won the Nevada caucus. We lost last night. We're looking forward to Super Tuesday. I think we've got a great chance to win in California, in Texas, in Massachusetts and a number of states around the country.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: South Carolina is the first southern state. Does that indicate anything to you about your prospects in places like Virginia and- and North Carolina? Will Joe Biden really challenge you there?\n\nSEN. SANDERS: Well, we're going to see. I mean, I think based on the polling, we're doing pretty well in Virginia. I think we've got a shot in North Carolina. All I can say is the issues that we are talking about and that is health care as a human right, raising the minimum wage to a living wage, dealing forcefully with the existential threat of climate change. Those are ideas, MARGARET, that I think are resonating all across this country. I think we have an excellent chance to do well on Tuesday and to win the Democratic nomination.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Joe Biden is blanketing the airwaves this morning. We know from your campaign that you raised forty six million dollars in February. That's a significant number. What do you think that does for you going into Super Tuesday? What edge?\n\nSEN. SANDERS: Well, MARGARET, it is not only- it is not only the amount of money that we raised, and that is a phenomenal amount, it's how we raised it. We don't have a super PAC like Joe Biden. I don't go to rich people's homes like Joe Biden. I think Joe has contributions for more than $40 billionaires. What we have done is received more campaign contributions from more Americans than any candidate in the history of the United States, averaging eighteen dollars and 50 cents. This is a campaign of working people and by working people. And I'm extraordinarily proud of that. But we have enough money now not only to take us through Super Tuesday, but take us through the entire process fueled by the contributions of working class people all across this country.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Your campaign said that if you are the nominee, you won't accept the financial help that Michael Bloomberg has offered. He said he'd extend it to any party nominee. Do you really want to turn down his bankroll?\n\nSEN. SANDERS: Well, look, Mr. Bloomberg is free to do anything he can with his 60 billion dollars, and that's legal. All I can say is at this point, we are confident that we can receive the kind of campaign funding that we need from working class and middle class people, that we don't have to be beholden to any powerful special interests. Look, one of the things that upsets people--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So you would accept it?\n\nSEN. SANDERS: --whether conservative or progressive, is- I didn't say that. What I would say--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSEN. SANDERS:-- is that he has the right to do anything he wants. Right now, we are confident, MARGARET, based on the fundraising that we are doing, is that we can beat Trump.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But you are a democratic socialist. You have never officially entered the Democratic Party. In fact, you constantly criticize Democratic establishment. So how can you convince the country that you are the best candidate to unify Democrats and challenge President Trump?\n\nSEN. SANDERS: Well, two points. I'm a member of the Democratic leadership. I've been in the Democratic caucus from my, you know, virtually my first day back in Congress 30 years ago and from- in the state of Vermont, where I live, I am supported by Democrats and have won the Democratic primary. But we will win because we have an agenda that speaks to independents, to Democrats, and to more than a few Republicans. Look, we are living at a time when the American people are sick and tired of the kind of income and wealth inequality that exists in America. All over this country, MARGARET, and I have been all over this country, you got millions of people are working 11, 12 bucks an hour. They can't afford childcare. They can't afford healthcare. They're scared to death about their retirement. They want a government that represents them, not just billionaire campaign contributors. That's how you win. You put together that coalition, multi-generational, multi-racial. That is what we're doing. No campaign out there has a stronger grassroots movement than we do. That's how you beat Trump.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nSEN. SANDERS: We're beating them in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. We can beat Trump.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You have rallies planned out in California. There is very much a concern about the spread of the coronavirus on the West Coast. Is it safe for you? Have you spoken to any government officials about whether people can really appear at your rally and not worry about their own health?\n\nSEN. SANDERS: Well, actually, we have. I mean, that's a very fair question. And my campaign has spoken to public health officials on that issue. And right now, we are planning to do rallies not only in California, but in Utah, Minnesota and other states around the country.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You've been sparring with the pro-Israel lobby known as AIPAC. You said it gives a platform for bigotry, which was seen as a swipe at Prime Minister Netanyahu. Today, Israel's ambassador to the UN says of you that you're not welcome in that country and Anyone who calls our prime minister a racist is either a liar, an ignorant fool or both. Do you see a political cost in taking on the pro-Israel lobby in this way?\n\nSEN. SANDERS: Yeah, I do. I mean, they have a lot of money. They have a lot of power. Look, I'm Jewish and I'm very proud of my Jewish heritage. As a kid, I spent time in Israel. I am not in- anti-Israel. I will do everything I can to protect the independence and the security and the freedom of the Israeli people. But what we need in this country is a foreign policy that not only protects Israel, but deals with the suffering of the Palestinian people as well. You've got 70 percent youth unemployment in Gaza. People can't even leave that district, that area, major, major crises. It is not sustainable that we continued conflict in the Middle East until the United States develops an even handed policy.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nSEN. SANDERS: So, I am pro-Israel. I am pro-Palestinian. I want to bring people together to finally achieve peace in that region.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you on foreign policy. The president just authorized a deal with the Taliban. What do you think of that? Because if you're commander in chief, you'd either follow through with it or halt the withdrawal of U.S. troops.\n\nSEN. SANDERS: Well, I don't have enough details and the- and that peace agreement, needless to say, is going to have to go through the Afghan government. We don't know what's going to happen. One of the difficulties, to be very honest, MARGARET, in dealing with Trump, it is very hard to believe anything that he says, whether it's the coronavirus, whether what's going on in Afghanistan. But it is my view that the United States and I- I speak as somebody who helped lead the opposition to getting us into the war in Iraq. It is my view that we've got to end endless wars, that when we have five hundred thousand people in America sleeping out on the street and people can't afford health care, we got to invest in this country, not in endless wars.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator Sanders, thank you for joining us.
On this Face the Nation broadcast moderated by Margaret Brennan:\n\nClick here to browse more full transcripts of Face the Nation.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It's Sunday, January 6th. I'm Margaret Brennan and this is FACE THE NATION.\n\nWashington may have a new Congress, but it's stuck in the same shutdown.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You can call it the Schumer or the Pelosi or the Trump shutdown, doesn't make any difference to me. Just words.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But words so far have produced no solution as a quarter of the U.S. government remains shuttered for the third week. President Trump warns it could last months or years and Democrats dig in.\n\nNANCY PELOSI: We're not a doing a wall. Does anybody have any doubt that we are not doing a wall?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with two veteran deal makers who are trying to break the impasse and reopen the government. The Democratic whip, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.\n\nKEVIN MCCARTHY: Nancy Pelosi, I extend to you this gavel.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: In the middle of the funding standoff, the one hundred and sixteenth Congress gavels in, Nancy Pelosi reclaims the title of speaker as Democrats take control of the House and usher in the most diverse Congress in history. A panel of freshmen members weighs in on inheriting a shutdown and early calls to impeach the President.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: This is a national disgrace.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And it's off to the races as the battle for the 2020 presidential contest begins to take shape. One high-profile Democrat jumps in.\n\nELIZABETH WARREN: Hello, Council Bluffs. Whoo.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And other potential candidates near their own decisions.\n\nAll that, plus, analysis on the week's other news coming up now on FACE THE NATION.\n\nGood morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. Top White House officials and senior congressional aides will meet again today to try to find a way out of the shutdown. So far their talks have yielded nothing. Yesterday the administration stuck to its demand for 5.7 billion dollars to build a border wall. Democrats insisted the government needs to reopen while negotiations continue. With no deal in sight, trash is piling up at the nation's national parks and some eight hundred thousand federal workers won't receive paychecks until the government reopens.\n\nWe begin today with Senate Democratic whip Dick Durbin who is in Springfield, Illinois. Senator Durbin is among a group of senators talking to the White House about how to end this shutdown. Senator, welcome to FACE THE NATION. The President said this morning that he's considering declaring a national emergency depending on what happens in the next few days. If he tries to build this wall without congressional approval, what will Senate Democrats do?\n\nSENATOR DICK DURBIN (Minority Whip/@SenatorDurbin/D-Illinois): Well, I can tell you, first, there's no requirement that this government be shut down while we deliberate-- deliberate the future of any barrier whether it's a fence or a wall. This is the first President in history who shut down his own government. Unfortunately, there are going to be people who suffer. Look at those at the airport who were carefully-- going through-- the passengers to make sure that they're safe on airplanes. As of next Friday, they'll miss a payday that may mean some problems for mortgage payments, problems and balancing the budget of their own families and households. This is totally unnecessary. And that's a point we've made over and over to this President, let's have this debate on the future of any barrier wall or border security but not at the expense of critical services for America.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But the President says he could bypass Congress by declaring this national emergency. So what would you do if he-- he went that route?\n\nSENATOR DICK DURBIN: I can just tell you, I don't know what he's basing this on, but he's faced so many lawsuits when he ignores the law and ignores tradition and precedent and just goes forward without any concern, he'll face challenge, I'm sure, if he's oversteps what the law requires when it comes to his responsibilities as commander-in-chief.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We described in your introduction your attempts in the past to broker agreements, you-- you've tried to be a deal maker. You were in the room with the President on Friday. Did you hear any points of agreement?\n\nSENATOR DICK DURBIN: Well, of course, there was agreement to continue the conversation. But what we've said is open the government and let's have a fulsome debate and deliberation. This gun in our head approach with closing down the government is the thing we most opposed, and-- and we wish incidentally that the Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, would step up and be part of this conversation. He's used to-- he's going to stand on the sidelines and wait for instructions from the President. He is part of a branch of government and a leader in the Senate, he should be a participant in this conversation from the start. As of last night, three Republican senators have said they don't like this approach of shutting down the government and they're talking about joining in a bipartisan effort to end it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So from what you're describing, it doesn't sound like there is any progress. How close are we to ending this shutdown?\n\nSENATOR DICK DURBIN: Well, I can't say that we're close because President's made it clear he doesn't care. He's prepared to see a shutdown for months and he even said years, and reaffirmed that before the cameras. It was stunning to hear a President of the United States say that about his own government, the government we elected him to lead. But that is his position. Think about the hundreds of thousands of people who will be entitled to income tax refund checks who won't receive them because the Treasury Department has been shut down, the Internal Revenue Service is shut down, the unfortunate end and unfair results here are just across the board.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: According to the White House, so, you know, this centers on what they see as some hypocrisy among Democrats, right? They point to in 2006, there were about, you know, ninety Democrats who did sign on to a secure fencing act that talked about barriers and reinforced fencing at borders. Their argument is if you agree to it, then why can't you agree to something similar now? What-- what is your response to that?\n\nSENATOR DICK DURBIN: Well, I would just say, do you remember the President's words, how could you forget, a concrete wall, two thousand miles long from sea to shining sea, paid for by the Mexicans. How many times did he say that to the American people? That is not what any of us have ever voted for in the past.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he now says--\n\nSENATOR DICK DURBIN: Talk about-- or--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --it doesn't have to be concrete.\n\nSENATOR DICK DURBIN: --those fences and barriers. Well, he's changed-- he's changed his demand from time to time and he's changed the amount of money he is asking for dramatically from two billion to five billion to eleven billion to twenty-five billion, even to seventy billion dollars. And when we ask for specifics, how are you going to spend this money, what are you going to do with it? He basically says, well, shut down the government until you agree on it. That is not an approach that comes up with the safe border which Democrats certainly want.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Have you seen the more specific financial request that the White House says they were giving to Democrats?\n\nSENATOR DICK DURBIN: No. As a matter of fact, the meeting yesterday between Vice President Pence and the staff, they agreed that today they would produce it, finally produce documentation backing up what the President's latest demand might be. But Vice President Pence said at one point a few weeks ago, two billion will do it, 2.1. And then within a matter of hours, the President reversed and said, No, it has to be 5.6. That's what we're up against. There doesn't seem to be a consistent message and-- and it doesn't seem to be a message consistent with border security. If we're talking about border security, the overwhelming number of undocumented people in the United States overstayed visas.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR DICK DURBIN: They did not cross the border. The solution to that is not a concrete wall it's a computer program that needs to track these people who have received the visas. And this wall, incidentally, when you have people coming to the border looking for a border official to present themselves and they make their claim for asylum or refugee status, this wall is no deterrent.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like you're saying you would be open to more border funding if it were spent in a different way, could you get to that five-billion-dollar number?\n\nSENATOR DICK DURBIN: I don't see that. But I will tell you we've offered 1.3 billion with very specific limits which would not include a concrete wall. The President could have taken this long ago and we could have moved forward. But he said, No, I'm going to shut down my own government. That's what he's done.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: There has been speculation and-- and our next guest, Senator Lindsey Graham, has proposed this idea of a wall for DACA, sort of, a trade here. The President stood in the Rose Garden the other day and said he wants to wait until the Supreme Court rules on DACA before he comes to any kind of proposal here. Do you agree that we need to wait on the courts there? And is there any room for that kind of swap, that kind of deal?\n\nSENATOR DICK DURBIN: Listen, Senator Graham and I could not be more different politically. He's a conservative Republican from South Carolina; I'm a progressive Democrat from Illinois. But we've teamed up time and time again to try to solve this problem. And a year ago-- a year ago, we presented to the President on January, the eleventh, 2018, I do remember the day, a bipartisan proposal to deal with DACA and many other aspects of the reform and the President rejected it. He said, I'll go with my approach. His approach ended up with thirty-nine votes in the United States Senate. It wasn't even accepted by his own party anonymously. So we're in a position now where when the President makes these claims and promises a lot of us, I hope I could speak for Senator Graham, are a little bit skeptical.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, thank you very much, Senator.\n\nWe will turn now to South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham who joins us from Clemson. Senator Graham is someone, as we've been describing, who-- who speaks to the President, often shares his advice. Senator, did you speak to the President this weekend about this shutdown?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-South Carolina/@LindseyGrahamSC): Yeah. It was pretty clear to me that we're never going to have a deal unless we get a wall as part of it. Dick Durbin is a reasonable guy, but he's not leading this parade. We're having to negotiate with people who want to abolish ICE, not support ICE. We're having to negotiate with people who see the border patrol agents gassing children, rather than defending our borders as professional law enforcement officers and we're negotiating with people who will give us one dollar for the wall, even though, it's immoral and accuse all of us who support a wall as part of border security as racist. As long as the radical left is in charge we're never going to get anywhere. The President will compromise but he will not capitulate. So that's where we're at.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But the people in the room are your colleague Senator Durbin along with--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: He's not in the room.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --along with Speaker Pelosi. You don't--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: He's not in the room. Neither one of them are in the room.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: He was on Friday. He was--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM. Neither one--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --on Friday with the President.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: They sent staff. They sent staff people to do the negotiation. The vice president's in the room with a bunch of staffers.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Today.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Dick Durbin is a good guy. He's a reasonable guy. But Nancy Pelosi has made progress. She's gone from not a penny to a dollar. Nancy Pelosi sees the border crisis as manufactured. President Trump sees it as real. Until we see the same movie you're never going to reach a conclusion. The President is right to dig in to get money for a wall as part of border security. It will not be a concrete wall it will be steel barriers. And every plan I've supported in the past with Dick Durbin has had money for physical barriers--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --including walls and fences. Except now when Trump is President.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are about eight hundred thousand federal workers who are in this limbo not being sure--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --when they're going to get paid. So--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, with that in mind, with them in mind why can't you reopen the government while you argue about the things you just laid out?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Why would you negotiate with somebody who calls you a racist if you want a wall? Who gives you a dollar for a wall when the Democratic Party supported twenty-five billion dollars in the past? We're not going to negotiate with people who see the world this way. We'll negotiate with Dick Durbin but I'm not going to negotiate with somebody who calls the Border Patrol agents a bunch of Nazis when they're trying to defend the border against a mob. These caravans have changed everything. The reason you need five billion dollars now and not 1.6 is the border is deteriorating in terms of security. We've got eleven thousand unaccompanied minors coming from Central America.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: And it cost us seven hundred and fifty dollars a day to house these minors and only God knows what they go through to get here. The Democrats see our law enforcement officers as the problem, we see the illegal immigrants, the coyotes, and the drug dealers as a problem--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But what about--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --until that changes there's--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --those people who work for homeland security who are carrying out the policies you're talking about who are not going to get paid?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What about the Coast Guard? Who are not going to get paid.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. They're being held hostage. They're being held hostage by people who say you need one dollar to secure the border. They're being held hostage by people--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't want to--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --who accuse them--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --open the government and then continue talking?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I do want to open up the government but the goal is not to open up the government. The goal is to fix a broken immigration system to bring reality to this table. That ICE is not the problem, it's the solution. The goal is to repair a damaged, broken immigration system. It's to implement policies--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --Democrats have voted for in the past on President Trump's watch. We're not going to give in to this radical left ever until we can find a rational way forward. We'll have wall as part of a border security plan. We're going nowhere. Wall plus DACA plus TPS makes sense. But you'll never convince me--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is the President open to--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --that we don't need a wall.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But is the President open--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah I think so.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --to that compromise you just floated there?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. I really believe that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That DACA and TPS for a wall?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. But what he's not open to is a lecture by the Speaker of the House. I'll give you a dollar. He's not open to the people on the left accusing his border patrol agents of being Gestapo agents gassing children. He's not open to the idea that the wall is immoral. So if you bring Dick Durbin's to the table, we'll fix this.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. But let's dig into that--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: If the left is going to--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --because that's significant what you said there--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Okay.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --if you think the President--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah I think he is open to it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --is indeed open to a DACA for wall trade here because he stood in the Rose Garden the other day and said no you've got to wait till the court rules and we're some time out from that.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Okay. Here's what he's open to. He's open to getting his wall money. We need five billion dollars for the wall in light of the increased threats. He has always put on the table--he put 1.8 million illegal immigrants having a pathway to citizenship in his own plan. So how can you say he's not open minded to it. Here's what I think the deal would look like: given the money we need to secure our border in five billion-- five, six could be well spent. And I think we can put on the table TPS reform. There's four hundred thousand people going to lose their legal status soon who've been here for decades. I'd like to deal with that problem and I would--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: When is that going to be put on the table? That offer.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think we'll have offers on the table when we find somebody that's not crazy to deal with. We're not going to put any offers on the table as long as people in charge of these negotiations accuse all of us who want a wall of being a racist and see our border patrol agents as gassing children. Until you get that crowd put to the sidelines, I don't see anything happening.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You've worked with the President's son-in-law Jared Kushner on criminal justice reform.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: He is cited as someone open to the deal you described of-- of DACA for wall.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, he is.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But the President really seemed to shoot that down in the Rose Garden the other day.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I am here to tell you--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: When would we see that put on the table? Is that-- that's a bigger immigration overhaul than what we're talking about right now which is simply the wall.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: When you see Dick Durbin and others in the room not a bunch of staffers. When you see this rhetoric that those who want to build a wall are racists stop. When you see the idea one dollar is enough for the wall. When that stuff ends, the real negotiations begin. Right now, the people running the show on the left are radical, liberal Democrats who don't see a border security problem. They see their own government being the problem--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --not the illegal immigrant. Until that changes we'll never get anywhere. There is a deal to be had here--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --but it will include a wall. And if there is no wall in this deal we'll never have a deal.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about Syria. I know you watch the region and you had criticized the President's decision to pull out. The National Security Adviser John Bolton is in the region right now and is saying now there's no timeline for a U.S. drawdown and it'll be dependent on Turkey agreeing not to slaughter our Kurdish allies. It sounds like he's describing--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --an indefinite timeline of U.S. troops staying in Syria.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, I had lunch with the President last week and I came away a bit encourage. There are three things that we want to accomplish as part of a withdrawal. We want to make sure that when we leave the Kurds do not get slaughtered. And I don't trust Turkey to take care of the Kurds. It'd be like Putin trying to police Assad. That didn't work well. We need a plan to protect the Kurds from Turkey and others. We need to make sure ISIS doesn't come back once they're defeated and Iran is not the biggest winner. If you can accomplish those three objectives by reducing our forces, which I think we can, then count me in. But those three things have to be--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --accomplished for us to successfully leave Syria. And the President's slowing down and he's re-evaluating his policies in light of those three objectives. Don't let Iran get the oil fields, don't let the Turks-- Turks slaughter the Kurds, and don't let ISIS come back. I think I share the goal of the President to withdraw our forces. Let's just do it smartly.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is this an admission that the President made a mistake?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think this is the reality setting in that you got to plan this out. President Obama ended the operations in Iraq against sound military advice. The President's getting sound military advice about the status of the Kurds--what will happen with Iran if we leave too soon. And the-- bottom line here is we want to make sure we get this right, that ISIS doesn't come back. And I applaud the President for re-evaluating what he's doing. He hasn't changed his mind but he's listening to a lot of good advice. And President Obama never would do that. And you saw what happened when a President shuts people out. This President's not shutting people out. He has a goal in mind of reducing our presence. I share that goal. Let's just do it smartly.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, thank you for joining us.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We will be back in a moment. Don't go away.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Four freshman Democrats joined us earlier this week to talk about their new jobs in Congress. We spoke with Representative Jahana Hayes, a former National Teacher of the Year from my home state of Connecticut and that state's first African-American woman to serve in Congress. Congressman Max Rose, an Army captain from New York who earned a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart in Afghanistan, he then went on to work in the Brooklyn district attorney's office. Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill represents New Jersey. She flew helicopter missions in the Navy then went to law school and became a federal prosecutor. And Representative Colin Allred, who's from Texas. He's a former NFL player who later worked for President Obama's Department of Housing and Urban Development. We started the conversation talking about the vote they took to reopen the government.\n\nAll of you just came to Washington at a time when a quarter of this government is shutdown. All of you took a vote to reopen the government but Leader McConnell in the Senate has said that is just a waste of time and political posturing. Where do we go from here, Congresswoman?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL (D-New Jersey/@RepSherrill): Well, I don't think it's a waste of time. We voted on the most bipartisan bill we could vote on, the one that was passed recently by the Senate, within the last month. And so I think what we're asking Congress to do is its job, and pass a bill that's going to re-open the government.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But passing a bill that re-opens the government comes up against this hard line position the President has taken which is he wants border security, specifically, a border wall, adequately funded. Do you see, Congressman, room to move beyond that existing level of 1.3 billion dollars, how do you get to the five he wants?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED (D-Texas/@RepColinAllred): Well, let's be very clear. He doesn't want border security. We have border security in this bill that we passed and we are willing to negotiate on border security. There is a difference though, between border security and then building a wall that we don't need and that will be a waste of money. A five-billion-dollar price tag is a lot of money. There's a lot of things we can do instead of that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is it just a matter of semantics here? Border fence, some kind of barrier? I mean is there movement for Democrats to support what the President in some way is asking for?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Well, let me say, I'm from Texas. We have fencing in place, there is a significant amount of fencing, in fact, in place and there is a big difference between wasting money on something that maybe will be just a campaign promise versus something that will actually get the job done. Fencing in certain places is absolutely appropriate and we do have that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, what is the impact of the shutdown? I mean there is some calculation here that this could go on for weeks, if not months, because it's not really being felt. Are you seeing that in your district?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE (D-New York/@ RepMaxRose): Absolutely. Look we all are. We all have federal workers in our district. This is a national disgrace. There's a lot of talk here about national security and border control and we need that. But we also have to talk about the fact that a shutdown should never be used in this country as a negotiating tactic.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, Speaker Pelosi has called the wall an immorality. She said, no way, no how, is the President going to get money for it. That's a pretty hard line position versus where the President is. Do you find any room for compromise in the middle?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: The room for compromise is talking about how we can deal with the crises that we are currently facing. Right now at our ports of entry fentanyl and other very serious drugs is just streaming right in. We don't--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You think the ports are a bigger issue than the southern border?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: I think that we have serious issues throughout the country. The point here is that what I'm not willing to do is spend billions of dollars on what amounts to a vanity project--a fifth century solution to a twenty-first century problem. What, you want to also bring horses back to the United States cavalry?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Bring some rowboats to the Navy? We can put Trump's name on it. This is far more serious than just political brinkmanship, okay? Let's get back to work. It's why we all ran and I know it's what the Republicans are interested in doing it-- doing as well. And I promise you, if they did that their voters will reward them, okay. This is not political suicide.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, if a compromise is reached in the Senate, where you see some kind of increased funding for border security, call it a wall, call it some kind of fence, but something put on the table for Democrats. Do you see your-- your fellow House members getting on board?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES (D-Connecticut/@JahanaHayesCT): Well I think-- I apologize I lost my voice yesterday. But I think the government shutdown is a sobering reality of where we are right now. We have to get to work. We cannot keep operating in hard lines. We cannot keep saying nobody's willing to move. We have to move. That's why we were elected. That's what we were sent here to do. We have to get back to work.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So you would be open--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: Absolutely.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --to voting for increased border security beyond the 1.3 billion that all of you signed off on already?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: I think we have to look at the bigger problem of immigration reforming our immigration system, not just a wall.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So would all of you--yes or no--vote for something that put an offer on the table for Democrats, like protections for DREAMers or protections for those coming here under extraordinary circumstances like temporary protected status.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Well, I think it's important to see what's in the package. And it's- I think it's hard for any of us to say. I think all of us at this table came to Congress to work in a bipartisan fashion, to get things done. We're trying as hard as we can right now to be bipartisan. We need some bend from the other side as well.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll continue that conversation in our next half hour. So, stay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has made a name for herself taking on Republicans in her own party. Tonight, she sits down with 60 MINUTES. Here's part of her interview.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nANDERSON COOPER (60 MINUTES): You're willing to compromise?\n\nALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (60 MINUTES): Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. It's just about what we choose to compromise. My personal opinion. And I know that my district, my community feels this way as well is that we as a party have compromised too much and we've lost too much of who we're supposed to be and who we are. And--\n\nANDERSON COOPER (60 MINUTES): The Democratic Party has lost so much.\n\nALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (60 MINUTES): I think so. I think-- I think we've compromised things that we shouldn't have compromised whether it's judgeships with Mitch McConnell, whether it's compromising on climate change I think we've-- there's some things that we've compromised a little bit too much on but am I open to compromise on-- on certain ways to get things done, absolutely. Absolutely.\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And you can watch more of that interview tonight on 60 MINUTES.\n\nNext up on FACE THE NATION, we'll have more of our panel of new House members.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We continue our conversation now with our panel of new House members. Earlier this week we asked them about their priorities in Washington.\n\nAnother topic, of course, all of you haven't been on the job very long, but very quickly--we did see one of your colleagues introduce articles of impeachment. The House Oversight Chairman, Elijah Cummings, said that's premature. What do you all think? Is that too soon?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: I-- I think so. I'm a former federal prosecutor and we certainly never made charging decisions before the FBI finished their investigation. I think we've got to let Mueller finish his investigation, see what evidence he finds, and then we can make some decisions.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You're waiting on the Mueller Report?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: I am.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: It's absolutely premature. This is way too early to be talking about this. We need to let the investigation run its course. And I just think that it's-- it's also something that can be used as a partisan lightning rod that we need to try to avoid.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What about the tone of this conversation? One of your colleagues, Congresswoman from Michigan, was speaking to supporters and used a profanity, and said you know, impeachment should be what we're talking about. What do you think of, maybe not the language, but the-- the premise of what's being talked about?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Well, I'm from Staten Island. I have no problem with profanity, okay? Well what-- what I have a problem with though is the fact that she is talking about this issue and urging action on this issue before the investigation has been completed, that will just continue this era of hyper-partisanship that we have to move away from. I-- I-- I certainly object to it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: Premature.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Premature.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: The gravity of that word is too big and too important to just throw it around.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to also ask you about some of the things you campaigned on. Congresswoman, as we said, you're from Connecticut. In your home state that was the site of the Sandy Hook shooting. I know you've talked a bit, given your time in the classroom, and you've thought a lot about this. What is it that you think can actually get done? What are you going to try to do about gun control?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: Well, I think that, any conversation about arming teachers is not the response to gun control. I think we have to have background checks. We have to make sure that we are getting guns off the street.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So would you commend the Trump administration for this ban on bump stocks that recently happened?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: Yes. Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But not enough?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: It's a first step.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It's a first step.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Rose, you served in Afghanistan as we said in your introduction. Both President Obama and President Trump have wanted to draw down troops--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Mm-Hm.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --from that war zone. What do you think of that idea of a drawdown or a full withdrawal?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Well, there's been a larger problem in terms of the way in which we have tried to overcome twenty-first century threats, and that is that we are fighting sequential one-year engagements without any type of long-term strategy. So the key here in Afghanistan, because we saw in Iraq, the invasion of Iraq was absolutely foolish. But then we did a speedy withdrawal, which I believe was motivated by politics, and then we had to go right back in. We cannot afford to do the same thing in Afghanistan, but we also have to come to the realization that the only way in which we will stabilize that country is with some type of political reconciliation with the Taliban and it's our responsibility, as the part of an international coalition--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: --to provide the freedom and the space for that political reconciliation to be realized. And I intend on playing a part in trying to contribute to that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And that is not a small ask either to get diplomatic talks with the-- with the Taliban underway, and the administration is trying to do that--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: No. It-- it absolutely isn't. But we have been at war in Afghanistan now for seventeen years. To put things into perspective, people are now enlisting in the United States military who were born after 9/11. And we cannot just have perpetual war. But we also have to maintain our leadership on the global stage, which means that when we make a commitment, we stand by it, and we don't just try to exercise politics on the global stage. We need to have a long-term strategy not governed by tweets--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like what the Trump administration is suggesting.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Well, what I just saw was a announcement about a withdrawal like that, which took everyone by surprise. I believe that that's playing politics and that's a shame. I don't want to see Americans put at risk. I've watched loved ones get hurt. I don't want to see that if it's unnecessary. But I just want us to have a long-term strategy--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: --that realizes the fact that politics is what matters here, it's the United States military's job to provide that room for diplomacy to take its action.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, you've also served, as we said in the introduction. What do you think? Do you support not just Afghanistan, a drawdown but a withdrawal in total?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: You know what I would add to what Max is saying, and what I think is lost a little bit in the discussion of Trump's strategy, is this idea that we don't have a good plan with our allies. We are always at our strongest as a country when we are moving forward with our traditional allies and NATO, for example, that is when we're able to get the space to have diplomatic relations, which-- which when we bring world approbation to bear. And so when we're in an era where we're treating our traditional adversaries better than our allies, I think that is making it more and more difficult for us to operate from a point of power on the world scene.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But you support a drawdown?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: I think we certainly need to be talking about how we end these wars, but I don't think you can do it and say, you know, as-- as we just announced in Syria we're just pulling out.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: You have to have that long-term strategy and that is a piece that's missing.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, this week, not only a new week in Congress but also the beginning it seems of the 2020 presidential campaign season-- I know, get ready.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: If-- if-- you just finished your own campaigns, I know you're sort of, wow.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Exhausted.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It's exhausting, but it's beginning.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Who do you think, as people who just ran competitive and successful races, how do you win as a Democrat in 2020 in a presidential race?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: You know, I-- I think that 2020 is going to be about 2020, and it's not going to be about 2018. And there are certainly lessons you can learn, I think, from some of our races. I think there--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Like what?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: I think-- I think there is a hunger out there for people who are willing to speak honestly, who aren't, you know, just so poll tested and-- and holding back on what they're really thinking. I think there's also a hunger out there for people who are trying to solve problems instead of just carrying a partisan banner. I think the country needs to heal, the divisions are growing and I think that we need a uniter to be our nominee.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have anyone in mind from your home state?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Well, I certainly like my former boss, Julian Castro--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: --who is a friend of mine and a mentor of mine. And-- and we have a lot of political talent in Texas, so.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What about the rest of you?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: I'm supporting Mikie.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: But if I could just have one important thing. It's obvious that election season's starting again. But what we can't do is campaign in the halls of Congress. When it comes to things like infrastructure and reducing health care costs, we can't say Oh, I don't want to give this President a win because it might improve his chances in 2020.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is that what you think is happening now in the House?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: I think that there's the potential that it could happen. We've only been governing now for twenty-four hours. There's the potential that we could say, man, there's all this opportunity for consensus, think about draining the swamp, right? Everybody is running on anti-corruption now. But in order for us to do something we have to be bipartisan, which means everyone is going to win. If all we're thinking about is 2020, that's going to be a big, big problem and the American people are going to suffer.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: I think if we're going to win as Democrats, we need to run the kind of races that form broad coalitions. The way we took back the majority of the House is through districts like mine. The eleventh district of New Jersey, where I ran on a-- with a broad coalition of people on issues that everyone in my district, from progressives to conservatives agree on. Things like infrastructure reform, things like bringing down health care costs, things like really, you know, focusing on our environment and how we move forward now, not in fifty years. Making sure we have universal background checks for gun purchases. These are things that the majority of Americans agree on and the Democrats are always at their strongest when they're focused on families and they're focused on issues that are going to move people forward.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And all of that requires working with a Republican Senate--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --and a Republican President.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Yes, sure.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Yeah.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And all of you are willing to do that?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: But here's-- here's the shock-- here's the shocking thing, though--2016 and 2018 were not that different. It's just different political parties run-- won. If you think about what Donald Trump ran on, okay? If you put some of the racist stuff aside for a moment, which is difficult, I know. But he spoke about infrastructure, he spoke about drug costs, he wants to protect Medicare and Social Security, draining the swamp. We ran on many of those same things, the American people right now are united, that they want sensible solutions to deal with the things that really cause them pain and suffering. And now it's our responsibility to actually do something about it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much for this conversation. I wish you all luck as lawmakers. Welcome to Washington.\n\nWe'll be right back with our reporters' panel.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'd like to welcome our reporters' panel now for some political analysis, Dan Balz is the chief correspondent for The Washington Post, Ed O'Keefe is the political correspondent right here at CBS News, Shannon Pettypiece is a White House reporter for Bloomberg News and Mark Landler covers the White House and foreign policy for-- at The New York Times. So, Ed, I'll start with you. Did you hear any points of agreement or were Democrats and Republicans just talking past each other on the show?\n\nED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): Two of their best spokespeople were talking past each other this morning, yes, and I think elsewhere as well. Look, the staff meetings that are happening this weekend that the vice president is chairing is usually the kind of thing you see on maybe day two or day three of a shutdown. We can forgive the holidays, we can forgive the fact that people weren't in town. Maybe that's the delay. But what are we on, day sixteen now? And-- and this continues to stretch out and-- and given that they're still at that very preliminary point, where they are still only beginning to define what border security means to everybody--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nED O'KEEFE: --where they are still defining how 5.6, 5.7 billion dollars would be spent. We got a ways to go. Congress doesn't get back till Tuesday night, Wednesday morning that would suggest that you're going to have meetings and maybe some initial votes. I am thinking a week from today government's probably still shuttered unless something urgent suddenly arises that forces them to move faster.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You had Senator Durbin saying he doesn't see a way to get to five billion. You had Senator Graham saying no wall, no deal. Is there any point of agreement anywhere in here, Dan?\n\nDAN BALZ (The Washington Post/@danbalz): There's not at this point other than that both sides believe in border security.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Whatever that means.\n\nDAN BALZ: And-- and whatever-- and-- and frankly-- and, yeah. So whatever that means. And I think it's-- it is remarkable that we have gone now two-plus weeks and there has been absolutely no indication of where the negotiating could actually take place. Every time they sit down, they seem to be farther away than they were and more dug in. It feels as though each side still believes that this can be a win-lose proposition. I win, you lose.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nDAN BALZ: That's never the way these kinds of things end. We'll see whether this is a different situation.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and the Senate would say--such as, me winning or losing--this is all campaign 2020 that they're gesturing towards and immigration is one of those issues that divides people. But it makes them emotional and fired up, as well. Is that actually a conversation about border security or is it a conversation about politics?\n\nDAN BALZ: Well, there-- there is certainly a lot of politics in this because we know that for-- for President Trump the wall has been central to his political message. And I know there are Democrats who believe that he will never make a deal because he wants the issue more than he wants the wall, if you will. And so that's part of the hump that you have to get over in these negotiations. But with the government shutdown, there's going to have to be solution at some point. I mean, this can't go on indefinitely. President talked about this could go on for months or even years. It's not going to go on for years, we're-- we're confident of that. But the question is, how long each side is prepared to hold out? And I think what we'll-- what we'll get to, at some point, I don't-- don't know when is, there will be enough, you know, if you will, pain and suffering and complaints and issues that pop up as a result of the hardships caused by government being shut down that will eventually force a solution.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Shannon, I mean, is that the calculus? We didn't really hear answers from either of the senators about what to do about these hundreds of thousands of American workers--\n\nSHANNON PETTYPIECE (Bloomberg News/@spettypi): Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --who are waiting for paychecks.\n\nSHANNON PETTYPIECE: Right. At this point, both side think they have a winning hand politically. No one is facing any real political pressure. And part of that, again the holidays, people weren't really paying that much attention. But for the White House, they see this (INDISTINCT) politically. Democrats, you know, they are not really feeling any political pain at this point. So that changes at the end of this coming week when Friday, when federal employees start missing their first paycheck. There are services. People will start noticing getting their passport renewed, going to a national park on the weekend. So then, you get the political pressure starting to ratchet up. But because the sides are so far apart, I don't think this ends without one side caving under political pressure, and right now no one's feeling it. So it goes on and-- and-- and there's no urgency.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mark, one of the other things that may not be breaking through but is a big headline today is the National Security advisor in Israel making an announcement that seems to be yet another change in the Syria policy. The President said he was pulling troops out in thirty days, then we stretched that to a hundred and twenty days. Now what's being described as a total indefinite stay of U.S. troops in Syria. What are people of the Pentagon actually being told to do?\n\nMARK LANDLER (The New York Times/@MarkLandler): Well, it's-- it is interesting. It's-- it's as though we have come full circle from where we are, where on December 19th when President Trump announced this pull out and put a thirty-day deadline on it. I think there's probably a great deal of confusion at the Pentagon and I think it's not an accident that we have not seen a single four-star general come out and speak publicly about what the strategy is in Syria. There's been a great lack of-- of-- of synchronicity between the White House and the Pentagon all along. The question I have now is, how in sync is the National Security advisor--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nMARK LANDLER: --with his own President. President Trump just a few minutes ago on his way to Camp David repeated what he has said over and over again, the troops are going to come out of Syria soon. That's a very different message than what John Bolton had in Israel a few hours earlier. Some of the caveats that he put in place, namely the one that we would not pull out our troops if there was any threat that the Turks would go after our Kurdish allies, that is by all accounts a standard that cannot be met at all in the short term, I think a lot of people in the Pentagon are skeptical the Turks can ever be relied on not to go after the Kurds. So I think that we're-- we're really in a very-- a-- a moment of-- of deep confusion about where this policy goes. But I have to say, it is in keeping with what we've seen from President Trump on troop deployment and withdrawal issues almost from the beginning of his presidency. He will say something dramatic, indicate a desire to termination to pull out and then as the machinery of the national security--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nMARK LANDLER: --apparatus kind of grinds on, the timetable suddenly slow down, it's a lot more complicated. His words meet reality on the ground and I think that's the moment we're at but it must be a very confusing one for our allies and for our adversaries.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. It's not clear if the order has been given to troops to not pull out because they had been ordered to pull out.\n\nMARK LANDLER: Indeed.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we don't know who the secretary of defense will be, either.\n\nMARK LANDLER: And that's a very interesting question, because a number of the obvious candidates for the defense secretary job are actually people who went on record fairly strongly against President Trump's troop pullout. Lindsey Graham being an obvious example. Tom Cotton expressed reservations about it as well. So some of those top tier candidates don't appear to be on the same page. There are some other names that are being bandied about, but I am beginning to sense that maybe filling the defense secretary job will be a little bit like filling the chief of staff job was, which, if you recall, a lot of people turned it down, and Mick Mulvaney only agreed to do it on an acting basis. I wouldn't be surprised if Pat Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, is someone we see in that job for quite a few more months.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And that would mean we wouldn't get to hear congressional hearings and on the record an explanation to the American people. More to talk about on the other side of this commercial break.\n\nWe'll be right back in a moment.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with more from our reporters' panel. We saw this week campaign 2020 kick off even though we just started 2019. Dan. And Elizabeth Warren, senator, throwing her hat in the ring. How do you see Democrats defining themselves?\n\nDAN BALZ: That-- that is such an interesting question because I think we are going to go through a period in which there is great hunger among Democratic activists to figure out who the best person is to take on President Trump in 2020, and I think there is such a range of opinions on who that will be. We saw in Iowa this weekend tremendous crowds that turned out for Elizabeth Warren. I think that is emblematic of the interest that people have and a desire to hear from the candidates. I think that people are approaching this with an open mind, we know this is going to be a very wide open race, there are a few people like Elizabeth Warren or Vice President Biden, Bernie Sanders who have standing and networks and-- and certain amount of name identification. But there are all kinds of other people who are going to be in this with different kinds of messages. And my sense is that people are going to be reluctant to jump too quickly to one candidate and get behind that candidate and they are going to say as-- as they all talk about in Iowa, they're-- they're going to kick those tires for some months as they watch and wait and listen to what people are doing.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So lots of exploring without declaring, Ed?\n\nED O'KEEFE: Yeah. I mean, Senator Warren was the first-- second to do it actually, Julian Castro, the former HUD secretary, was the first before Christmas, and will make it official next weekend. But where is everybody else? You might ask. And-- and they are still mulling it. I think we have at least seven Democratic senators who are thinking about it, some big city and small city mayors, Governor Inslee of Washington State said this week he's still thinking about it. So you will see in the coming weeks continued discussions about this people saying, yeah, I'm still thinking about it. Unless you think it's just empty talk, I-- I heard a story from somebody who met the former vice president at an event and said to him, my mother really wants you to run.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: This is Biden.\n\nED O'KEEFE: This is Biden. And Biden said in response to her, what's her name? Give me her number. He had an aide get her phone number. The next day he called this woman's mother and they talked for about ten minutes and he asked, so you think I should run? Yes, absolutely, you should, and if you do I will volunteer for you. And he asked her all these reasons why. That happens. And they're all doing this. It's got to be tremendous for their ego. But whether or not it actually results in them running and taking the plunge, you know, is another matter because they have to factor in, can I stand up against somebody like Elizabeth Warren--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nED O'KEEFE: --who has a name ID in the network. Can I somehow distinguish myself in the field that will feature numerous women, several different minority candidates, I have to find a way to play in the south, at the same time I have to find a way to play in California, in Georgia and all these other places because of early voting. It's going to be a tremendous competition and one that I think a lot of people are surprised hasn't been joined by others yet but I think that's because they realize this-- this is going to be a tremendous exercise for them.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It-- it sounds there-- Shannon, like, you're going to see some campaigning in the halls of Congress--\n\nED O'KEEFE: Oh, yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --based on the-- the rundown of candidates.\n\nSHANNON PETTYPIECE: Well, yeah. Well, I mean, and-- we can talk about this. Meanwhile, at the White House, they are very clearly in 2020 mode. I mean, we could say they were in 2020 mode, you know, two years ago today, but the White House is transitioning into 2020 mode. And while you have these Democrats who are exploring, and making their first trip to Iowa, now you have a President Trump who has a real campaign infrastructure behind him. It's not the Trump Tower, you know, papers flying all over the place, no one know who's in charge, they have an actual campaign. They have raised millions and millions of dollars. They have a big data operation. They are out of the gate and running and the Democrats are still kind of trying to find where the starting line is or decided if they're going to show up at the race. So, I mean, that's what they're going to be up against. And they also feel like despite how much criticism and how unpopular the President might be, they also feel like they have something really to run on, the whole slogan for 2020 is this, promises made, promises kept. You might not like the promises that he kept but they are going to say that he did what he said he was going to do. He was not one of those politicians who came to Washington and-- and-- and, you know, did a flip flop.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSHANNON PETTYPIECE: He-- he did what he said. And they feel like that's a strong hand to run on.\n\nED O'KEEFE: You know, to your point about campaigning in Congress, that panel, discussion you had with those freshmen members, three of those four replaced Republicans and will go home in 2020 and run again in districts that favor Republican candidates. To-- to watch those kinds of Democrats now in Congress twist in the wind as candidates go out and talk about a progressive tax rate, Medicare for All, agreeing with the President maybe we should withdraw all our forces from Syria.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nED O'KEEFE: It's going to be really difficult for a lot of these people to somehow make a mark here and somehow deal with maybe fifteen, twenty people who are running for-- for President and their party. And it's going to make things quite uncomfortable for them.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mark, I mean, one of the things that-- to-- to pick up on what Shannon was saying, promises made, promises kept, that is something the President prides himself on doing, it has been a challenge for some of his aides, though, who say sometimes, you need to change with the information flow, when circumstances change. You can't just keep to the promise because it was part of the original brand. Afghanistan, when the President had that cabinet meeting in front of the cameras earlier this week, he made some unusual comments, Wall Street Journal came down pretty hard on him.\n\nMARK LANDLER: Yeah. No, the President said in essence that the Soviet Union has been right to invade Afghanistan. He offered a series of reasons for that that were not factually based. He said it was an anti-terrorism move, it really wasn't. And-- and he also attributed the collapse of the Soviet Union to their misadventures in Afghanistan which is not right, it's not totally wrong but there were many other reasons for the collapse of Soviet Union. But to-- to get back to the political point you were raising, I think the troop withdrawal debate is an interesting one because it is true that he ran on withdrawing American troops from foreign conflicts. I think it's--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So did Obama.\n\nMARK LANDLER: So did Obama. And so do-- as you say many Democrats. What I don't think has been tested maybe at least I'd love to see it--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Hm-Mm.\n\nMARK LANDLER: --tested more is just how resonant an issue getting out of foreign wars is for President Trump's base. We know where his base is on the border wall, we know that's why he's sticking to the wall so hard.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nMARK LANDLER: And I think that also explains this decision before Christmas to announce this troop withdrawal. I just would be interested to see a little more maybe researching to how much is-- how much his voters really care about pulling troops out.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Good question. We'll be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching. Until next week for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.
Rural America is no longer where many young college graduates want to settle, with some fleeing for urban centers like New York or San Francisco. Aside from the glamour of living in those locations, there may be another culprit for the rural brain drain that's occurring across the U.S.: student loan debt.\n\nAdults with student loans are less likely to remain in rural areas than those without it, and adults with the highest student loan balances are the most likely to migrate to cities, according to new research from the Federal Reserve. That's contributing to a growing college attainment gap between urban and rural America, which has diverged from about 5 percentage points in 1970 to 14 percentage points in 2016.\n\nAs fewer college-educated young people remain in rural locations, those regions become less attractive to other young grads. Employers, for their part, increasingly are focusing on urban locations to recruit these workers. Added to the mix is the pressure of the country's growing student loan debt, which places more pressure on grads to seek higher-paying jobs -- which are more plentiful in cities.\n\nRight now we are experiencing the greatest opportunity gap between rural and urban places in history, said Matt Dunne, the founder of the Hartland, Vermont-based Center on Rural Innovation, which is working on creating rural innovation hubs to develop entrepreneurship. People believe the only place you can have an aspirational job is to cram into already overcrowded cities that are facing housing crises rather than make your way in rural locations.\n\nThat creates a self-fulfilling prophecy, said Dunne, who worked for Google from a remote office in Vermont before starting the Center on Rural Innovation.\n\nRural America's student debt problem\n\nRural America is increasingly old, shrinking in population and falling behind when it comes to its share of educated residents. About 19 percent of rural residents held college degrees in 2016, compared with 33 percent of urban residents, a gap that's widened over the past few decades, the Agriculture Department said last year.\n\nTo be sure, the Federal Reserve said it couldn't determine whether the student loan debt is causing young college grads to move to cities. Nevertheless, the trend is notable: About half of rural residents who took out student loans remained in those areas six years later, compared with two-thirds of rural residents who didn't take out loans. And the grads with the most debt were the most likely to leave, they found.\n\nThere's a good reason why young workers with student loans would head for the big city. Cumulative job growth since 2009 -- after the recession ended -- surged almost 14 percent in cities with at least 1 million residents, compared with 2.7 percent for rural areas and small cities, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nCity wages\n\nWorkers with college degrees earn far more in big cities, about $71,000 per year. But if they remain in rural areas, those college grads earn about $50,000 annually, Goldman found.\n\nNot surprisingly, college grads with student debt had better financial outcomes than those who stayed in rural areas, the Fed found. Those big-city migrants are more likely to pay down their loans, less likely to default, and are more likely to become homeowners, they said.\n\nThe allure of higher pay and wider professional opportunities is enticing -- and hard for rural communities to compete with, Dunne noted.\n\nThe general drumbeat is you have to go to urban locations, in particular tech centers, in order to have a new economy job, he said. That's accelerating the drive toward cities and the investment cycles in companies that are starting in cities. There's a notion you can't find talent in rural areas or smaller cities.\n\nA divided America?\n\nThe trend is worsening the economic outcomes for rural residents while making resources -- like housing -- scarcer and more expensive in large cities, economists and policy experts say. It's also blamed for the widening political gap between rural regions and big coastal cities.\n\nAny time you see a massive separation along demographic lines, it's not healthy, Dunne said. You want to have diversity of skills, education and perspective in any part of the country.\n\nIn many cases, Americans who live in large cities would welcome an opportunity to move to a rural location, but may perceive smaller regions as lacking professional opportunities. Almost one out of four urban residents aid they would like to move to a different community, with a third of those saying they'd like to find a rural community to live in, Pew found in a 2018 study.\n\nLoan forgiveness\n\nDunne, who credits his own lack of student loans with allowing him to return to Vermont to begin his career, said he made a proposal in the state's last legislative session to create a program that would forgive up to $20,000 of student debt over two years for college grads who bought houses in rural parts of the state.\n\nThe benefit would not only be to encourage young people to look at rural places to live and work and raise a family, but it would improve their financial profile in order to get a bank loan, he said, adding that he was inspired by corporations who offer loan forgiveness incentives when hiring, which they've found to be effective recruiting tools.\n\nOther communities have developed similar programs, such as Marquette, Kansas, which offers free land to people who agree to build a house in the rural town. And there are also loan forgiveness programs for health care professionals such as nurses who agree to work in rural areas.\n\nEverything should be on the table in order to address this challenge, Dunne said.
Thomas S. Monson, the president of the Mormon church -- The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints -- died late Tuesday at the age of 90, the church announced.\n\nPresident @ThomasSMonson, 90, has passed away peacefully surrounded by family. pic.twitter.com/66qoVrinIW — The LDS Church (@LDSchurch) January 3, 2018\n\nThe Salt Lake Tribune notes that, During Monson's nearly 10-year tenure … Mormonism faced some of the most intense public scrutiny in its history -- from a divisive vote over gay marriage to high-profile Mormon candidacies for president and a hotly debated policy for same-sex couples and their children. Still, the private prophet stayed largely behind the scenes, showing up unexpectedly at funerals, comforting the bereaved, visiting the sick and, before her death, caring for his wife, Frances.\n\nCBS Salt Lake City affiliate KUTV reports the church issued a statement saying Monson died at 10:01 pm in his home in Salt Lake City. He was with family at the time of his passing. He died at age 90 from causes incident to age. President Monson ... leaves behind a legacy of service and good works. A successor is not expected to be formally chosen by the Church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles until after President Monson's funeral.\n\nProminent Utah figures were quick to tweet tributes. Among them:\n\nPresident Monson was among the greatest men I have ever known. Service was his motto and humility his hallmark. Countless were the lives he touched as a prophet, father, and friend. Today, I join millions across the globe in mourning his passing. #LDSChurch #utpol — Senator Hatch Office (@senorrinhatch) January 3, 2018\n\nMy heart is filled with love for Pres. Monson. He touched countless lives, including my own, in a positive and sweet manner influencing good throughout the world. https://t.co/cXnZswmZP3 — Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) January 3, 2018\n\nFor more than 50 years, Monson served in top leadership councils for the church - making him a well-known face and personality to multiple generations of Mormons.\n\nA church bishop at the age of 22, the Salt Lake City native became the youngest church apostle ever in 1963 at the age of 36. He served as a counselor for three church presidents before assuming the role of the top leader of the church in February 2008.\n\nMonson's job is expected to go to next longest-tenured member of the church's governing Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Russell M. Nelson, per church protocol.\n\nMonson's presidency was marked by his noticeably low profile during a time of intense publicity for the church, including the 2008 and 2012 campaigns of Mormon Mitt Romney for U.S. president. Monson's most public acts were appearances at church conferences and devotionals as well as dedications of church temples.\n\nMonson will also be remembered for his emphasis on humanitarian work; leading the faith's involvement in the passage of gay marriage ban in California in 2008; continuing the religion's push to be more transparent about its past; and lowering the minimum age for missionaries.\n\nMormons considered Monson a warm, caring, endearing and approachable leader, said Patrick Mason, associate professor of religion at Claremont Graduate University in California. He was known for dropping everything to make hospital visits to people in need. His speeches at the faith's twice-yearly conferences often focused on parables of human struggles resolved through faith.\n\nHe put an emphasis on the humanitarian ethic of Mormons, evidenced by his expansion of the church's disaster relief programs around the world, said Armand Mauss, a retired professor of sociology and religious studies at Washington State University.\n\nMonson often credited his mother, Gladys Condie Monson, for fostering his compassion. He said that during his childhood in the Depression of the 1930s their house in Salt Lake City was known to hobos riding the railroads as a place to get a meal and a kind word.\n\nPresident Monson always seemed more interested in what we do with our religion rather than in what we believe, Mauss said.\n\nA World War II veteran, Monson served in the Navy and spent a year overseas before returning to get a business degree at the University of Utah and a master's degree in business administration from the church-owned Brigham Young University.\n\nBefore being tabbed to join the faith's church's governing Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Monson worked for the church's secular businesses, primarily in advertising, printing and publishing including the Deseret Morning News.\n\nMonson married Frances Beverly Johnson in 1948. The couple had three children, eight grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren. Frances died in 2013 at the age of 85.\n\nThroughout his life, Monson was an avid fisherman who also raised homing pigeons, specifically, roller pigeons who twirled as they flew. He was known for his love of show tunes, Boy Scouts and the Utah Jazz.\n\nMonson's legacy will be tied to the religion's efforts to hold tight to its opposition of same-sex marriage while encouraging members to be more open and compassionate toward gays and lesbians as acceptance for LGBT people increased across the county.\n\nAt Monson's urging, Mormons were vigorous campaign donors and volunteers in support of a measure to ban gay marriage in California in 2008. That prompted a backlash against the church that included vandalism of church buildings, protest marches and demonstrations outside church temples nationwide.\n\nIn subsequent years, the church began utilizing a softer tone on the issue. In 2015, the church backed an anti-discrimination law in Utah that gave unprecedented protections for gay and transgender people while also protecting religious freedoms.\n\nBut the religion came under fire again in the fall of 2015 when it banned baptisms for children living with gay parents, and instituted a requirement that those children disavow homosexual relationships before being allowed to serve a mission. The changes were designed to avoid putting children in a tug-of-war between their parents and church teachings, leaders said.\n\nThe revisions triggered anger, confusion and sadness for a growing faction of LGBT-supportive Mormons who were buoyed in recent years by church leaders' calls for more love and understanding for LGBT members.\n\nOne of the most memorable moments of Monson's tenure came in October 2012, when he announced at church conference that the minimum age to depart on missions was being lowered to 19 from 21 for women; and to 18 from 19 for men. The change triggered a historic influx of missionaries, and proved a milestone change for women by allowing many more to serve.\n\nTaking the lead from Hinckley, Monson also continued the church's push toward being more open about some of the most sensitive aspect of the faith's history and doctrine. A renovated church history museum reopened in 2015 with an exhibit acknowledging the religion's early polygamous practices, a year after the church published an essay that for the first time chronicled founder Joseph Smith's plural wives.\n\nOther church essays issued during Monson's tenure addressed other sensitive topics: sacred undergarments worn by devout members; a past ban on black men in the lay clergy; and the misconception that Mormons are taught they will get their own planet in the afterlife.\n\nThe growth and globalization of the religion continued under Monson, with membership swelling to nearly 15.9 million, with more than half outside the United States.\n\nThe Mormon church was founded in 1830 in upstate New York by Joseph Smith, who claimed he was visited by God and Jesus while praying in a grove of trees and was called to found the church. Members are known as Mormons because of the religion's keystone scripture, the Book of Mormon.\n\nMormons believe they are called to share the word of God, specifically their own message of the restored Gospel, through their missionaries. There were 71,000 church missionaries serving around the world at the end of 2016.\n\nLike his predecessors, Monson traveled the world, visiting countless countries to give speeches, dedicate temples and preach to Latter-day Saints. Under his watch, 27 new temples were planned or built.\n\nMonson chose five new members to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, a top-governing body that sets policy and runs the worldwide faith's business operations. All five were white and from Utah - a fact that disappointed some Mormons who wanted to see a minority or person from outside the U.S. selected to acknowledge the globalization of the church.\n\nThe man expected to take Monson's seat, the 93-year-old Nelson, has been a church apostle since April 1970. Out of respect for Monson, his appointment will not be officially named until after his funeral services.\n\nIn keeping with tradition, Nelson will choose two new counselors from the Quorum of the Twelve who will join him to form a three-person presidency that is the top of the religion's governing hierarchy. Monson's two counselors were Henry Eyring and Dieter Uchtdorf. They will go back to being regular members of the Quorum unless they are chosen again.
SALT LAKE CITY -- The Mormon church appointed a 93-year-old former heart surgeon Tuesday as its new president, following a longstanding succession plan that aims to keep the faith on course with a minimum of upheaval.\n\nThe selection of Russell M. Nelson was announced during an address broadcast from Salt Lake City to Mormons around the world. Nelson called on Mormons to stay true to their faith and keep the covenant path.\n\nIf you have stepped off the path, may I advise you with all the hope in my heart to please come back, Nelson said. Whatever your concerns, whatever your challenges, there's a place for you in this, the Lord's church.\n\nThe announcement came after Nelson was chosen as the religion's 17th president during a private meeting of the church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles leadership body in a temple, per church tradition that makes the longest-tenured member of the Quorum the new president. Nelson is now considered a prophet, seer and revelator by Mormons. Nelson succeeds Thomas S. Monson, who died Jan. 2 at age 90.\n\nNelson announced that his two counselors will be Dallin H. Oaks, 85, and Henry B. Eyring, 84, both members of the Quorum. Eyring was also a counselor for Monson, while this marks the first time Oaks will serve as a counselor to a church president. Oaks is the next-longest tenured member of the Quorum, making him next-in-line to become the next president.\n\nMembers of the media watch as Russell M. Nelson speaks via television from the historic Mormon Salt Lake Temple after being announced as the 17th president of the Mormon Church on Jan. 16, 2017, in Salt Lake City, Utah. Getty\n\nNelson is the second-oldest man to assume leadership of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which is based in Utah and counts nearly 16 million members worldwide. He will oversee the religious and business interests of the faith in collaboration with two top counselors and members of the Quorum, one of the faith's top governing bodies.\n\nNelson's record during his three decades in church leadership suggests he will make few changes as he upholds church teaching and seeks to draw new members.\n\nAmong the challenges he faces is adapting to the increasingly global nature of the church, which was founded in 1830 in the United States and now has nearly six in 10 members living in other countries.\n\nStill, the rate of growth overall in membership has slowed in the past few decades, despite efforts to spread the faith including the lowering of the minimum age for those serving as missionaries.\n\nNelson takes the top position amid increased scrutiny of church teaching in the internet age, which has made more information on doctrine available. Under Monson, leaders released a series of essays explaining some controversial areas of Mormon history, including early polygamous practices and a past ban on black men in the lay clergy.\n\nThe church also faces some pressure to allow greater leadership roles for women, including those who want to be admitted to the priesthood.\n\nNelson also will have to navigate the issues raised by the LGBT rights movement. The church, at times, has expressed empathy and told members to be welcoming to LGBT people while also strictly defending opposition to same-sex marriage and all homosexual relationships.\n\nLast year, Mormon leaders partially cut ties with the Boy Scouts of America, which in 2015 ended its blanket ban on participation by openly gay adults. The LDS church, which has been the biggest sponsor of troops, said the move wasn't about that decision.\n\nNelson fits the common profile of his generation of church leaders as someone who was successful in the private sector before leaving behind his career to help guide the faith.\n\nBorn in Salt Lake City in 1924, Nelson converted to Mormonism at the age of 16. He was a doctor by 22. He served a two-year Army medical tour of duty during the Korean War before resuming a medical career that included being director of thoracic surgery residency at the University of Utah.\n\nNelson learned Mandarin after church president Spencer W. Kimball challenged church leaders in 1979 to learn the language. The next year, Nelson spent a month in Jinan, China, working with doctors there as a visiting professor of surgery.\n\nIn the spring of 1984, he joined the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.\n\nThe final surgery Nelson performed was the next year in China, when he operated on Chinese opera star Fang Rongxiang at the request of a doctor who knew and trusted Nelson, according to a church biography.\n\nNelson was scheduled to answer questions from reporters later Tuesday morning.\n\nHis past speeches offer some clue to how he will lead.\n\nIn October 2015, during a period of intense discussion about the role of women, Nelson spoke of women's unique contributions.\n\nMy dear sisters, whatever your calling, whatever your circumstances, we need your impressions, your insights, and your inspiration, Nelson said. Married or single, you sisters possess distinctive capabilities and special intuition you have received as gifts from God. We brethren cannot duplicate your unique influence.\n\nThat year, when the U.S. legalized same-sex marriage, Mormon leaders declared people in same-sex relationships apostates, meaning they could be excommunicated, and banned baptism for children living with gay parents until the children reached age 18. The policy caused an uproar among gay rights activists within and outside the church. Nelson told a group of young adults in 2016 that the rules came from a revelation received by Monson and other leaders that gave spiritual confirmation for their stance.\n\nLast October, in an address to the church general conference, Nelson implored members to closely read and understand the faith's keystone scripture, the Book of Mormon.\n\nWhen I think of the Book of Mormon, I think of the word power, Nelson said. The truths of the Book of Mormon have the power to heal, comfort, restore, succor, strengthen, console, and cheer our souls.
Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg says he would pay more to Uncle Sam under his plan to raise taxes on wealthy Americans. What the former New York City mayor hasn't said: He'd pay as much as $3.5 billion less under his wealth tax than he would under similar proposals from Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, two of his rivals for the party's nomination. Bloomberg's plan would also generate far less government revenue.\n\nBloomberg, who released his tax plan last week, said the proposal targets the very rich. That includes him: Bloomberg is worth an estimated $61 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nMuch of that fortune is tied to Bloomberg LLC, the global financial data and media empire he founded four decades ago. The candidate owns 88% of the company, which generated an estimated $3.8 billion in income last year alone, according to industry consultant Douglas Taylor. And his nearly 90% ownership stake in the media enterprise entitled him to about $3.3 billion of that income stream.\n\nBloomberg would certainly pay significantly more in taxes under his tax proposals than what he is paying under the current tax code. But that's not unique. All of the major Democratic presidential candidates are proposing tax plans that would raise taxes on the wealthy.\n\nWhat's more, even outside his proposed wealth tax, Bloomberg's broader tax plan could save him and his company millions versus what he would pay under plans proposed by his rivals. For instance, Bloomberg would raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from a current 21%, but not all the way back to the 35% where it was before President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans lowered it in late 2017. (Rivals like Pete Buttigieg, Sanders and Warren would like to roll back Mr. Trump's corporate tax cut completely.) That 2017 corporate-rate change saved Bloomberg's company roughly $550 million last year.\n\nBloomberg's campaign declined to comment on what he would personally pay under his tax plan or that of other candidates.\n\nWe don't have nor discuss Mike's personal financials, a Bloomberg campaign spokesperson said. Mike is in the highest tax bracket now, and he would be in the highest tax bracket under the plan he released.\n\nThe Bloomberg campaign also hasn't released a detailed explanation of his tax plan, while independent tax experts have yet to evaluate it. Here's a breakdown of what we currently know — and don't know — about Bloomberg's wealth tax proposal and how it compares to what other Democratic candidates have proposed, including Sanders and Warren as well as Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar.\n\nBloomberg plan\n\nHow much more Bloomberg would pay under his proposed wealth tax: $1.2 billion per year, compared to his current tax bill.\n\nHow it would work: A key in understanding Bloomberg's plan to tax the rich is that it isn't really a wealth tax — it's simply an income tax. That means it would be easier to administer than a wealth tax.\n\nBloomberg's wealth tax is an incremental change, and that's an advantage because it won't require the construction of a new administration of the IRS to put in place, said Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. But it will also create a lot less new tax liability for the wealthy.\n\nCurrently, the top tax rate for all income over $500,000 is 37%. Bloomberg's proposal adds a new tax of 5% on incomes over $5 million a year. He calls that a new surtax on high incomes, but it's essentially just adding a higher tax bracket.\n\nBloomberg also plans to raise that base rate — before the surcharge — for income above $500,000 to 39.6%, which is what it was under President Barack Obama. That would bring the highest income tax rate under Bloomberg's plan to 44.6%. That's still less than Sanders's top proposed income rate of 52%, but more than what the other campaigns are proposing.\n\nHow many people would pay Bloomberg's wealth surcharge: Income taxes generally hit a larger portion of the population than wealth taxes. But that might not be true for Bloomberg's wealth surcharge, even though it is structured as an income tax.\n\nRoughly 11,000 Americans earned at least $5 million in 2017, according to the latest available statistics from the Social Security Administration. Include investment income from things like gains on stock sales or flipping houses, and many more people would pay Bloomberg's wealth surcharge — it just isn't clear how many.\n\nAs of 2017, there were 143,000 tax fillings that reported income of $2.4 million or more, and 14,300 with that nearly $13 million or more. So the number is likely somewhere between those two.\n\nHow much government revenue it would raise: Bloomberg's tax proposals would generate a total of $5 trillion in new government revenue over a decade, according to his campaign. But that is for all of his proposals — not just the wealth tax.\n\nBased on earned income alone, Bloomberg's surcharge targeting the rich wouldn't raise much, maybe around $4 billion a year, or $40 billion over a decade. Consider all forms of income, however, and the potential haul could be roughly $1.8 trillion over a decade, based on the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Wharton Budget Model estimate of $200 billion a year from just raising the capital gains tax to 42% (slightly less than the 44.6% top rate that Bloomberg is proposing). About $140 billion of that would come from the top 1% of all earners.\n\nSanders plan\n\nHow much more Bloomberg would pay under Sanders's proposed wealth tax: $4.7 billion.\n\nHow it would work: Sanders's plan is a true wealth tax. After that, it gets complicated.\n\nSanders is proposing eight wealth tax brackets that start at 1% for couples with wealth above $32 million, and goes up to 8% for wealth above $10 billion. Tax thresholds are cut in half for individuals, who would start paying his 1% wealth tax at $16 million.\n\nThe advantage of a wealth tax is that it taxes all types of assets, not just income. For instance, it would capture those who have inherited their fortune or got to eight figures from investments.\n\nThe disadvantage is that the government would have to create a whole new system to asses wealth — including real estate and private business ownership — and then tax it. That wouldn't be cheap. And many experts say it's even easier for rich people to avoid a wealth tax than an income tax as they can shelter much of theIr wealth overseas.\n\nHow many people would pay the wealth tax: The Sanders wealth tax would likely affect more Americans than those who would pay Bloomberg's surcharge. The Sanders tax would be paid by the 180,000 wealthiest American families, according to his campaign and an independent assessment from economists and income-inequality experts Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. That's about 40,000 more households than Bloomberg's wealth tax.\n\nHow much government revenue it would raise: The Sanders campaign says $4.4 trillion over a decade. Penn Wharton's analysis puts the revenue projection at $3.3 trillion, and possibly as low as $2.8 billion if the wealth tax slows the economy.\n\nWarren plan\n\nHow much more Bloomberg would pay under Warren's proposed wealth tax: $3.7 billion.\n\nHow it would work: Warren's plan, like Sanders, is a direct tax on wealth. But her blueprint is simpler.\n\nThere are just two brackets for both couples and individuals: Warren is proposing that millionaires pay a 2% tax on all their wealth above $50 million. Billionaires would pay 6%. That should make administering a wealth tax slightly easier, but still more complicated than just raising income tax rates, as Bloomberg proposes.\n\nHow many people would pay: The Warren campaign, as well as economists Saez and Zucman, say her tax plan would affect 70,000 households. But another study by a trio of economists estimated that nearly 300,000 people would have to pay Warren's wealth tax for it to generate the total money Warren says it could.\n\nHow much government revenue it would raise: Saez and Zucman peg the expected revenue from her wealth tax at $4 trillion. Penn Wharton estimates it at $2.7 trillion, and $500 billion less, or $2.3 billion, if her wealth taxes slow the economy.\n\nBiden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar\n\nHow much more Bloomberg would pay under the other candidates' proposed tax hikes: $1 billion.\n\nHow their plans would work: Neither Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg nor Amy Klobuchar are proposing a designated wealth tax. Of the three, only Klobuchar has said she is open to one. Buttigieg called Warren's wealth tax extreme.\n\nIn fact, Biden and Buttigieg are proposing to tax billionaires like Bloomberg less than what the media mogul has outlined. Klobuchar is proposing a 30% minimum alternative tax for those earning more than $1 million a year, but hasn't given many details on how it would work.\n\nInstead, and like Bloomberg, all three want to raise income taxes on the wealthy, mostly by taxing investment gains at the same rate as wages. That would hit the rich more than average Americans who may not participate in the stock market beyond their 401(k)s, IRAs and other pre-tax retirement plans.\n\nThe candidates have also proposed returning income tax rates for top earners to where they were before President Trump took office. That would raise the tax on capital gains to 39.6% from its current top rate of 20%.\n\nHow many people would pay more tax: The Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar plans are by far the broadest because their additional tax revenue would come from raising the capital gains tax on all Americans, not just the super wealthy.\n\nAs of 2017, some 1.4 million American households had annual income of more than $500,000. Nearly all of them would likely pay more under the three candidates' plans.\n\nHow much government revenue they would raise: Penn Wharton has said Biden's total tax plan can generate $2.6 trillion over a decade. But that includes everything from raising the corporate income tax to eliminating tax breaks for companies that produce fossil fuels. About half of that, or $1.3 trillion, would be raised from top wage earners, according to Penn Wharton's calculations.\n\nThe Buttigieg and Klobuchar plans have not been analyzed by an outside group. Neither campaign responded to comment for this article.\n\nEditor's note: CBS MoneyWatch Senior Reporter Stephen Gandel is a former employee of Bloomberg LLC.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story said that candidate Mike Bloomberg wanted to maintain the current 21% corporate income tax rate. In fact, the candidate has said he would like to raise it to 28%.
Shares slid Wednesday in Europe after a day of gains in Asia as attention turned to minutes from the latest meeting of the Federal Reserve. U.S. stock index futures fell in pre-market trading, following a sell-off on Tuesday.\n\nKEEPING SCORE: Germany's DAX slipped 0.5 percent to 12,432.70 and the CAC 40 of France lost 0.5 percent to 5,265.04. Britain's FTSE 100 lost 0.2 percent to 7,234.56. Dow futures edged 0.1 percent lower to 24,933.00 and S&P 500 futures also were down 0.1 percent at 2,712.50, pointing to losses on the open in New York.\n\nASIA'S DAY: Japan's Nikkei 225 index climbed 0.2 percent to 21,970.81 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 1.8 percent to 31,431.89. Australia's S&P ASX 200 edged 0.1 percent higher to 5,943.70 and the Kospi in South Korea added 0.6 percent to 2,429.65. India's Sensex gained 0.3 percent to 33,801.94 while shares in Southeast Asia were mixed. Markets in mainland China were closed for a final day of lunar new year holidays.\n\nWALL STREET: Walmart's stock sank 10 percent on Tuesday, its biggest drop in 30 years, after the retailer reported fourth-quarter results that missed Wall Street's expectations as its e-commerce sales in the U.S. slowed. The late sell-off erased early gains led by technology companies. Grocery store operators, retailers, health care companies and industrial stocks accounted for much of the market's slide.\n\nFED WATCH: Investors have been bracing for signs the U.S. central bank might tighten monetary policy in minutes from its Jan. 30-31 policy meeting due out Wednesday. Jitters over inflation remain after the spate of volatility earlier this month.\n\nBONDS LOOMING: Adding to the risks, the rising yield on the 10-year Treasury, which is used as a benchmark for mortgages and other loans, is making bonds more appealing than stocks. It has been rising in recent months from a low of 2.04 percent in September. On Wednesday it was at 2.89 percent. Some of the broader concerns on investors' minds right now are looking across to the bond market and seeing the 10-year Treasury starting to approach that 3 percent level, said Bill Northey, vice president at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.\n\nJAPAN MANUFACTURING: Preliminary results from a survey of manufacturers in February showed indicators at their strongest level since early 2014. The Nikkei Japan Manufacturing PMI (purchasing managers index) was at 54 on a 0-100 scale where reading exceeding 50 indicate expansion. Job creation hit an 11-year high. Export growth slowed from January's peak but remained solid, Bernard Aw, principle economist for IHS Markit said in the report.\n\nENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 67 cents to $61.12 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It rose 24 cents to settle at $61.79 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed 72 cents to $64.53 per barrel. It gained 42 cents to close at $65.25 a barrel in London.\n\nCURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 107.64 yen from 107.33 yen on Tuesday. The euro slipped to $1.2316 from $1.2337.
Sacramento, Calif. - The announcement by the nation's largest utility that it's filing for bankruptcy puts Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s problems squarely in the hands of Gov. Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers, who now must try to keep ratepayer costs down, ensure wildfire victims get the money they're owed and rethink California's energy picture in the face of climate change.\n\nThis issue is all about three fundamental things: It is about safety, it's about reliability and it's about affordability, Newsom told reporters Monday afternoon after spending the day in and out of meetings with lawmakers about the pending bankruptcy.\n\nEarlier in the day, PG&E announced it will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as it faces at least $30 billion in potential damages from lawsuits over catastrophic California wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that killed scores of people and destroyed thousands of homes. The announcement kicked off a 15-day window before the official filing. Newsom said he would like to stave off the bankruptcy but it may not be possible.\n\nWe'd like to see it avoided, but we're not naive, he said. I respect the taxpayer, I respect the ratepayer and I'm absolutely cognizant of those that lost their homes.\n\nThe filing wouldn't make the lawsuits disappear. It would result in all wildfire claims being consolidated into a single proceeding before a bankruptcy judge, not a jury. That could shield the company from excessive jury verdicts and buy time by putting a hold on the claims.\n\nThe chances of victims getting what they would've gotten without a bankruptcy are not good, said state Sen. Bill Dodd, a Napa Democrat.\n\nHow much and what the state can do remains to be seen. Lawmakers last year tried to prevent a threatened PG&E bankruptcy resulting from the 2017 fires by letting the utility pass on some of its costs to ratepayers, a move some critics dubbed a bailout for the utility. Democratic Assemblyman Chris Holden had considering introducing a similar bill that would pass on the costs of 2018 fires, but on Monday he said he has backed off that idea.\n\nClearly PG&E has made a decision that the legislative arena is not where they feel they're going to get the kind of results that will go far enough, he said, adding that the decisions about PG&E's future now appear to be in the hands of bankruptcy court.\n\nIn a Tuesday morning note, Height Securities noted the difficulty of finding a legislative fix for PG&E's complex problems. As of today, it wrote, we do not see a clear path to action that would avoid a bankruptcy filing.\n\nClimate change makes matters worse\n\n\n\nPG&E serves about 40 percent of California's utility customers, Newsom said, making it the nation's largest utility. It operates in three-quarters of California's land most vulnerable to wildfires, Newsom said. While PG&E's equipment has been named the cause of multiple recent fires, experts blame climate change for extending California's wildfire season and making blazes more deadly and destructive.\n\nState officials are investigating whether the utility's equipment sparked the deadliest, most destructive wildfire in California history, a November blaze that killed at least 86 people and burned down 15,000 homes.\n\nNewsom and legislative leaders carefully avoided laying out potential solutions in the hours after the bankruptcy announcement while stressing the importance of ensuring wildfire victims get the money they are owed. But no one has yet figured out the future of California energy policy as the state faces increasing threats -- and more wildfires -- as it copes with climate change.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jerry Hill said a PG&E bankruptcy may turn out to be a good thing. Hill represents San Bruno in the San Francisco Bay Area, where a PG&E natural gas pipeline exploded in 2010 and killed eight people.\n\nThis company has been dishonest, it has prioritized profits way over safety and there has been no effort on their part to change that, he said. I don't believe it will change unless there is some sort of restructure.\n\nOnly viable option\n\n\n\nNewsom agreed PG&E hasn't been a trusted actor in the past, but he said the state must work collaboratively with the utility. He noted that a portion of its leadership is gone, including Chief Executive Geisha Williams, who resigned on Sunday with a $2.5 million severance package.\n\nChapter 11 reorganization represents the only viable option to address the company's responsibilities to its stakeholders, Richard Kelly, chairman of PG&E's board of directors, said in a statement.\n\nThe Chapter 11 process allows us to work with these many constituents in one court-supervised forum to comprehensively address our potential liabilities and to implement appropriate changes.\n\nRegardless of the solution, the process is likely to be long: 18 years after the company's last bankruptcy filing, PG&E customers still see a small fee on their monthly bills to pay for it, labeled the energy cost recovery amount.\n\nThe Natural Resources Defense Council warned that bankruptcy could threaten billions in funding for PG&E's clean energy initiatives, which are key to California's environmental goals. PG&E is the state's largest investor in energy efficiency and electric vehicle infrastructure, said the NRDC's Ralph Cavanagh.\n\nThe bankruptcy is different from PG&E's bankruptcy in 2001, when California faced an energy crisis that caused power outages. Newsom said the state has an abundance of energy and power shutoffs are not imminent.
The White House Office of Management and Budget violated the law when it withheld military aid from Ukraine, according to the Government Accountability Office. In its decision released Thursday, the federal watchdog agency concluded that the funds were frozen to align with President Trump's policy priorities.\n\nFaithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law, reads the agency's decision. [The Office of Management and Budget] withheld funds for a policy reason, which is not permitted under the Impoundment Control Act (ICA). The withholding was not a programmatic delay. Therefore, we conclude that OMB violated the ICA.\n\nThe OMB argues that the Ukraine freeze was not subject to the ICA because it constituted a programmatic delay, that hinged on a policy development, according to the report. The GAO contends that that argument has no basis in law.\n\nProgrammatic delays occur when an agency is taking necessary steps to implement a program, but because of factors external to the program, funds temporarily go unobligated, the GAO explains in its report. Here, there was no external factor causing an unavoidable delay. Rather, OMB on its own volition explicitly barred DOD from obligating amounts.\n\nAccording to GAO General Counsel Thomas H. Armstrong, the White House OMB told GAO that it withheld the funds to ensure that they were not spent 'in a manner that could conflict with the President's foreign policy.'\n\nThe President has narrow, limited authority to withhold appropriations under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, Armstrong said in a statement regarding its decision. ... The law does not permit OMB to withhold funds for policy reasons.\n\nCounselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway, confronted with the GAO's findings moments after they were released, said she hadn't had a chance to read the report but she was very glad that Ukraine got the aid, and got it within the deadline.\n\nPressed further on the report's findings, Conway emphasized that Ukraine did receive the aid, and Mr. Trump wanted it to be higher and better and bigger than aid was under his predecessor.\n\nWell then it's a good thing that the aid that Congress approved got to Ukraine intact and it got there because this president released it, Conway said. And he wanted it to be higher and better and bigger than it was under President Obama so that they can protect themselves against foreign aggression.\n\nThe GAO — an independent watchdog that provides information and legal analysis to Congress on executive activity — concluded that the White House OMB was unauthorized to withhold the approximately $214 million in military aid from Ukraine in Summer 2019. Congress had already appropriated $250 million to the Department of Defense for security assistance to Ukraine for fiscal year 2019.\n\nThe funds were intended to provide Ukraine with training; equipment; lethal assistance; logistics support, supplies and services; sustainment; and intelligence support as they defend themselves against their neighbor, and aggressor, Russia.\n\nAccording to GAO's report, the OMB withheld the funds by making the money unavailable for obligation, effectively pausing its availability to the DOD.\n\nGAO also reported that that the OMB and the State Department did not provide them with all the documentation requested in their investigation. Specifically, GAO notes that the agencies provided them with very little information on foreign military financing over a period of six days in August 2019.\n\nWe consider a reluctance to provide a fulsome response to have constitutional significance, reads the GAO's decision. ... All federal officials and employees take an oath to uphold and protect the Constitution and its core tenets, including the congressional power of the purse.\n\nThe GAO said it will renew its request for information from the State Department and OMB. We will continue to pursue this matter.\n\n— Kathryn Watson contributed to this report
Arizona and Uber kept the company's testing of self-driving cars in the state out of the spotlight for months, according to a report in the Guardian.\n\nThat is, until a self-driving car in Arizona crashed into a woman crossing the road in a Phoenix suburb and killed her, and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey suspended the testing of autonomous vehicles in his state.\n\nNeither Uber, nor the State of Arizona had a legal obligation to inform the public about the testing, under Arizona law. And Ducey did sign an executive order in August 2015 allowing the testing of autonomous vehicles in the state.\n\nBut emails obtained by the Guardian under public records laws show reveal a consistent working relationship between Uber and Ducey's office.\n\nUber representatives and Ducey first met a month after Ducey was sworn into office in 2015, according to the Guardian. In April 2015, Ducey signed legislation authorizing ride-sharing in the state in a high-profile appearance.\n\nA few months later, Ducey had a press conference with Uber announcing the company's $25,000 gift to the University of Arizona's College of Optical Sciences. Uber claimed it would base a fleet of cars out of the university. The same day, Aug. 25, 2015, Ducey issued an executive order allowing for the testing of autonomous cars with human drivers in the car as a safety precaution.\n\nIn July 2016, Uber's communications director Taylor Patterson asked Ducey's office to tweet about Uber Eats' arrival in his state. Ducey did so the following day.\n\nJust before Uber began testing the autonomous cars in August 2016, Uber's head of public policy, Ashwini Chabra, informed Ducey's deputy chief of staff that the testing was about to begin, and asked him to send someone discreet to give the Phoenix police department a heads up, according to the emails the Guardian obtained.\n\nDucey's office said it is categorically false that Uber's testing was a secret. Ptak pointed to multiple news stories from 2016 about such autonomous vehicle testing in Arizona.\n\nThe allegation that any company began testing autonomous vehicle technology in Arizona 'in secret' is categorically false, Patrick Ptak, spokesman for Ducey's office, told CBS News.  ... Arizona has been very public about the testing and operation of self-driving cars -- it has been anything but a secret. The governor has also demonstrated he will hold companies accountable when necessary, as his letter to Uber this week indicates.\n\nUber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
